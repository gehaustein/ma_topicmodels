<p class="contents">Colleagues, I should point out that a number of our distinguished guests from the Commission and the Council are currently stuck in a traffic jam, but they are on their way and should be here in a few minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are about to conclude the last stage of a fascinating legislative and interinstitutional adventure: a quadrilogue on the establishment of an ambitious, efficient, accountable and forward-looking European External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we will be discussing legislative texts relating to the Staff Regulations, the Financial Regulation and the amending budget. We will be voting on those texts tomorrow. They are the successful result of a month of intense negotiations between the European institutions, working together to achieve a common goal: ensuring that the European Union’s voice is heard and respected on the wider world stage. We in the European Parliament took our responsibilities very seriously. We took the view that in external actions, as in other areas, Community interests and methods must prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">We are looking forward to holding this final debate today. We are looking forward even more to the launch of the EEAS on 1 December 2010, just one year after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The institutions have shown that they can deal with challenges. Parliament was part of the solution. We made quick decisions – some perhaps were made too quickly. This service is uncharted territory – <span class="italic">terra incognita</span> – and breaks with some of the previous fundamentals of budgetary law and staffing law. That will present us with major challenges in the long term. For me, as a member of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, the hybrid nature of this service remains a constant concern, not only in terms of its efficiency, but also simply in terms of our ability to monitor it. The joint Rivellini-Gräßle report attempts to address these problems. We have tried to achieve the best possible solution for the service, for Parliament and for taxpayers. We have explained processes and assigned responsibility. We have strengthened Parliament’s influence in respect of tasks in the area of foreign policy, we have increased transparency by means of clear reporting obligations and we have increased accountability. We have made it clear to the EU ambassadors that they have a key role to play in protecting the financial interests of the European Union, and it is very important that their own service should also make this clear to them. We have created synergies through the joint use of the accounting system and we are granting the Commission’s internal auditor the power to monitor how the funds that it needs to carry out its work efficiently are managed. The European Development Fund and its integration into the budget remain on the agenda, as does discharge for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank everyone who made this outcome possible: the co-rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs who have co-signed the compromise. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the negotiating partners from the Belgian Presidency. They have done a good job.</p>
<p class="contents">What remains is the important homework that the service needs to do. No efficiency savings as a result of the merger are in sight. The service envisaged savings of 10%, which is not much, but it is a long way from meeting that when it comes to management positions. Everyone is whispering about a ‘Mexican army’. How professional can a service be if it does not even know exactly what its tasks are? The opportunities to define the tasks in more detail have not, as yet, been utilised, and it is very important to get back to this very soon. A great deal of importance should be attached to the coalescence of the staff. The preferential treatment that has been given up to now to diplomats from the Member States gives us cause for concern. If some positions are advertised several times and the old colonial map of the world is taken out once again, we will have to have very serious discussions about the service. We should assure the service of our critical support and the watchful eye of the Committee on Budgetary Control. I wish it the success that we need for Europe in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EEAS, created by the Treaty of Lisbon, will include staff members of the Council, the Commission and the national diplomatic services, who will represent the European Union in all matters of foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As originally structured, the EEAS still suffered from a number of drawbacks deriving from its complex, decentralised structure, with ramifications throughout the world. In particular, the accountability of the financial actors called on to manage budgets of hundreds of millions of euros remained unclear, and that was likely to contribute to an increase in fraud and corruption to the detriment of the Union budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Treaty of Lisbon greatly expands Parliament’s powers and identifies it as the only institution representing Europe’s citizens, the debate on the establishment of the new EEAS was at first monopolised by the Commission and the Council, which did all they could to structure it along intergovernmental lines, contrary to the Community method. After long consultations with the Belgian Presidency and the European Commission, an agreement was reached overturning the initial arrangements and enhancing Parliament’s role, so that it could become involved by right at the heart of the European debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The following points are fundamental. The Commission shall present a working document annexed to the draft budget with a comprehensive presentation of, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, all administrative and operational expenditure related to the external actions of the Union, including the common foreign and security policy and the European security and defence policy. Article 1 lists the European Union’s institutions. The lists of responsibilities are to be attached to the annual activity reports compiled by the Directors-General of the Commission. Heads of delegations shall attend the meetings of the relevant parliamentary committees, together with the Directors-General. The EEAS shall share an auditor and an accounting officer with the European Commission; this arrangement is to be reviewed in 2013. The Member States must undertake to fully support the Union in pursuing any kind of liability of temporary staff working for the European External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">We subsequently have to discuss some important issues, which will be taken up during the triennial review of the Financial Regulation. They include discharge for the institutions and the inclusion of the European Social Fund in the general budget. The outcome of the negotiations has been good, especially for Parliament, in that its central importance has been strongly enhanced. The fact that the regulation lists all the institutions – which means that discharge for the other institutions is just a matter of time – is an excellent result, as is the fact that it provides for a single auditor and accounting officer held in common by the two institutions. I am grateful to everybody for the work that has been accomplished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bernhard Rapkay, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and when I say ‘ladies and gentlemen’, I include you, Baroness Ashton, Mr Šefčovič, your team and the Council Presidency, because, at the end of the day, we experienced collegial cooperation, without which we would surely not have achieved the result that we did.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy with the result, at least as regards the part for which I was responsible and where I had a grasp of the overall picture. However, I would say that this is not so very surprising, because it is not as if we have only just started. Mr President, it was a very clever idea of yours to call all the rapporteurs together on a regular basis for an exchange of ideas right from an early stage – back at the time of the Brok, Verhofstadt and Gualtieri reports. As a result, for the relevant people, it was clear what would need to be done later, and for those who were to do this later work, it was clear what had already been done in terms of preparatory work. For this reason, it was primarily a matter of applying to the Staff Regulations the organisational aspects of what had been agreed between Parliament and the Council in connection with the establishment of the European External Action Service in the particular areas of competence covered by these Staff Regulations. When I say organisational, I mean that organisation is policy and policy is organisation. That is, of course, something that we found repeatedly during the detailed negotiations, because it was already clear at that point that perhaps one person may interpret something one way and others may interpret it somewhat differently. However, the spirit of cooperation resulted, I believe, in us finding very sensible solutions to such issues.</p>
<p class="contents">What did we actually need to do, then, in terms of policy adjustment and what did we need to lay down in the Staff Regulations? Firstly, we had to incorporate the equal treatment of the three staffing components. I want to mention this point because, as you know, the treaty states that the staff of the EEAS shall comprise officials from the Commission, the Council and from the diplomatic services of the Member States. The last of these elements, in particular, did pose something of an issue, as it was something new. We had to resolve the almost antagonistic contradiction between the Community approach and the intergovernmental approach. It goes without saying that the Council and the Member States take more of an intergovernmental approach, while we prefer the Community approach. I believe I can say that we then worked out a solution to this together. To that extent, then, we can be very satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">What we needed, and indeed must continue, to take into account is gender balance and a balance in terms of geographical origin. We want to have a service that is modern, including with regard to the issue of gender equality. I am pleased, Baroness Ashton, that, in addition to what we have incorporated into the Staff Regulations as mandatory, you have assured us that you will make another personal statement, which will form part of the whole package. That already represents considerable progress with regard to both the aspect of gender equality and the other aspect of geographical balance.</p>
<p class="contents">We need equal rights and equal obligations, and that includes loyalty – and indeed from all three components – towards the institution of the High Representative, currently embodied by Baroness Ashton. In this regard, we had a bit of additional work to do as far as the veto right of the diplomatic services was concerned in connection with possible extensions to the contracts of staff coming from the diplomatic services. However, we resolved this, too.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one issue that should not be underestimated. We jointly agreed that this issue cannot be accommodated in the Staff Regulations. This is the fact that the new European diplomatic service also needs something of a separate identity. Everyone working there must be working towards the same goal and therefore, a common form of training and further training is also extremely important. That was especially important to some of my fellow negotiators, and I can understand that. I have just said that we did not succeed in doing this. It was clear that it would not be possible to incorporate something like this into the Staff Regulations systematically. However, here, once again, I have to thank the High Representative, because I have been informed that she also wants to say something about this and that she regards it as a major obligation and a major necessity and will also make another declaration of commitment in this regard, which, although not a component of the Staff Regulations, will reassure us and those who view it as particularly important as we look to the future work of the common External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing all that in mind, we have done a very good job, and the service is now set for a sound start on 1 December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This position is due to Parliament’s desire to see the EEAS set up, because Europe urgently needs it, but, of course, it does not mean that it will give up its role as budgetary authority in the debate on the nature of the body that will deal with crisis management or on the priorities of staff policy, as shown by the reserve that we established in the 2011 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulations that we are going to adopt reinforce the outcomes of the Madrid agreement and, in some cases, go further, for which I would like to thank Mr Rapkay, Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini. I must also thank Baroness Ashton and Mr Christophersen for their willingness and openness in our discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Staff Regulations ensure that all EEAS staff will have the same rights and duties irrespective of their origin, and requires the High Representative to ensure a geographical and gender balance. These arrangements will be binding and Parliament will make sure that they are complied with. At the same time, they avoid the use of quotas, which would be not just difficult to implement but also wrong. The Financial Regulation ensures a solid control system and keeps the EEAS closely tied to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the success we have achieved with the setting up of specific budget lines for the main common security and defence policy missions, which represents a major leap forward for Parliament’s ability to exercise control over the common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With tomorrow’s vote, therefore, we will have an EEAS that is stronger, more <span class="italic">communautaire</span> and subject to greater Parliamentary scrutiny. We will be strict and demanding in performing this scrutiny but, at the same time, we will do it responsibly and in a constructive spirit, since we are determined to help the High Representative in the colossal task of providing Europe with a real foreign policy to serve its values and interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we planned the budget for 2010, we raised the question about resources for the external diplomatic service. The answer was that there was no need for resources in that respect, as this could be resolved by redistributing budgetary resources. Well, as members of the Committee on Budgets, we did not really believe this. The truth is somewhere in between. It was indeed possible to resolve the bulk of costs through the redistribution of budgetary resources, but by adding up two amendments, there is an extra cost of approximately EUR 44 million. This extra cost represents roughly the coverage of expenditures for one quarter, while we have seen that the setting up of the service is still at the 10% level. Obviously, the funds which I hope will be passed tomorrow would cover a period somewhat longer than what they are actually used for. This does generate or could have generated certain tasks, such as amendment of the amount. In our view, however, there is no point in doing so now. It is much more important to have this service set up as soon as possible and see some progress with it, because one of the important messages of the Treaty of Lisbon is that we should be visible in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while discarding time-wasting measures, we do formulate expectations, as it has already been done by previous rapporteurs. We think that geographic balance is very important where the setting up of the service is concerned, but we did not include any binding provision of reserves, also in order to give an impetus to the whole system. We would also like to see a guarantee that the funds available are used in a time-proportional manner and economically, as now we have to face constraints everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would like to have very clear cooperation with, and mutual assistance from, Member States’ External Action Services, because if these elements are in place, it will allow certain tasks to be performed in countries where a Member State is not represented, but our European service is present. This will also be cost efficient for the Member States affected and will obviously improve the atmosphere of cooperation. Mr President, I hope that Parliament will support this redistribution of budgetary resources with its votes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, the Commission also condemns any acts of terrorism and I am sure that it would react accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">If you will allow me to return to our debate, let me start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, for the excellent work he has done to table this proposal to your distinguished House. I commend the excellent cooperation we have had over the past months and weeks on this complex file. Let me also extend my compliments to the shadow rapporteurs as well to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs who have worked hard and constructively during the whole process. Last but not least, allow me to express my gratitude to Cathy, her team and the Commission services for their enormously hard work which will lead, I hope, to the establishment of the EEAS in a very short period of time.</p>
<p class="contents">This week’s work will conclude the complex work of laying the legal and budgetary foundation for the EEAS. They build on and are fully in line with the cornerstone of this process – the EEAS decision. I had the privilege of participating in the discussion on setting up the EEAS and I was honoured to represent the Commission in the famous quadrilogue in Madrid. I can be a direct witness as to how important the contribution of the representatives of the European Parliament, Mr Brok, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Gualtieri, was to the successful conclusion of our very intense debate on this matter. I think the input they brought to our debate really contributed to having the EEAS as a truly efficient and effective European diplomatic service.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said about the work of your rapporteur, Mr Rapkay. The amendments to the Staff Regulations appear to be of a purely administrative nature, but they are not. They are essential in enabling the service to be up and running and to truly serve European interests. The Commission is of the opinion that the compromise package tabled by your rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, is a very good result that can be fully supported. The amendments have led, in my view, to a real improvement of the whole text.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me highlight just a couple of the core elements of the proposal. As you know, the EEAS will be composed in its starting phase of the three sources mentioned in the treaty, namely, the Commission, the Council General Secretariat and national diplomats. The relevant departments of the Council and the Commission will be transferred to the EEAS, while the existing rights of the staff working in these departments will be fully guaranteed. National diplomats will be able to apply for published vacant posts. I am happy to say that, as of 1 July 2013, officials from other institutions including the European Parliament, will also be able to apply to the EEAS on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">Permanent officials and national diplomats will have the same rights and obligations in the EEAS and the necessary provisions of the Staff Regulations will apply to ensure their independence and loyalty to the European Union. National diplomats will have contracts which can last up to a maximum of ten years. In addition, Member States will provide national diplomats with a guarantee of immediate reinstatement after their service in the European External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise also includes provisions which express a strong commitment to reaching geographical and gender balance in the European External Action Service. The situation will be reviewed in 2013 with a report by the High Representative to be presented to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that some of you in this House would have wished for stronger provisions in these proposals, whereas others were vehemently opposed. I am convinced that the amendments, as tabled to you now, constitute a balanced solution. The negotiations on this file have not always been easy. The preparatory process was quite complex as it required a consultation with our staff representative, but the hard work and the intensive negotiations have paid off, and you have a very good negotiation result for your House on your desks.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the European Parliament will adopt these amendments tomorrow. Allow me to conclude by expressing the Commission’s strong commitment to ensuring the smooth creation of the EEAS and its readiness to provide all necessary support and help to this new European service. I hope that tomorrow will mark an historic vote by this House which will lead to the establishment of the European External Action Service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The launch of the External Action Service required amendments to the Financial Regulation but, for the first time, this has been done under the ordinary legislative procedure. That is why tomorrow, Parliament will be amending the Council regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am really happy that we were able to reach an agreement in last week’s trialogue. It is proof that we can deliver under the Lisbon Treaty. It has also made it possible for us to give the European External Action Service a solid and timely basis. I do not wish to go into too much detail, but it allows for the creation of a separate section of the budget, it secures optimal accountability of the heads of delegations and it allows this External Action Service section of the budget to be overseen by a Commission accounting officer and the internal auditor. This is subject to review.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rivellini, for their constructive and cooperative approach.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to amending budget No 6, both arms of the budgetary authority are now, I hope, in a position to approve the amending budget without amendment. That is also a pre-condition for the External Action Service to start operating very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The justification for the first tranche of new AD posts is to cope with immediate additional tasks, but by 2013, we aim to have upheld our commitment for one-third of AD staff to come from the diplomatic services of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore invite Parliament to support the amending budget already approved by the Council. I should once again like to express my gratitude to the rapporteurs, Mr Surján and Mr Gualtieri. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I know that these have been tough negotiations at times and you have been tough negotiators. I believe that the outcome that we have before us is a good one and genuinely reflects the Lisbon Treaty in implementation, with Parliament playing a substantive and important role for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been a joint and collaborative exercise and I am extraordinarily grateful to all of you for the work that has gone on. Most importantly, I believe we have set the foundations for the service in a way that will engage Parliament properly in the future, and I have already made my commitments to transparency and the approach that I wish to take in working with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also made it clear that this is a service that must reflect the breadth and the depth of the European Union. It is a service that I wish every Member of this House, every Member State, and every Member of the Commission to be really proud of. I wish to see Europe reflected in the staff that we have, in the ambassadors that we appoint, in the people at the centre. You will have many opportunities to ensure that that commitment is brought to bear, especially with the review in 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">I know, too, that Members have been concerned to ensure that we have proper training facilities and capacity. We do have the legal basis for this, and I want to reassure this House that we will make sure that those who come from different traditions, from different sources, will be brought together to create a truly European service that again will reflect all that has been said in the process of building up to this moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to say thank you particularly to Ms Lichtenberger and Mr Saryusz-Wolski for the work they have done on the issue of training. I know that there is much more we need to discuss and I look forward to doing so with you and with others over the coming weeks and months, but you have my full commitment to ensuring that training is part of how we approach the building of the service. I say this in the context of the economic backdrop and climate in which this service is coming into being, and you have a full commitment from me that there will be a cost-effective service.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this enables us to fulfil our aspirations and ambitions in the world. Every citizen of the European Union is affected by what we do in foreign policy, in trade and development, and in counter-terrorism. This is, above all, a service for them, and I stand before the representatives of the citizens of Europe to make my commitment to see this service fulfil your ambitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">After the political agreement of Madrid and the European Parliament’s opinion issued on 8 July, on 26 July, the General Affairs Council, as you know, adopted a decision setting out the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service. However, in order for this service to be properly established, we still need to adopt the three instruments that I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Work on these various dossiers has been intensive both for Parliament and the Commission, for the High Representative and the Council, and everyone has made an effort to reach an agreement in the shortest possible time, within the deadlines we were set.</p>
<p class="contents">We can now all celebrate and give ourselves a pat on the back for getting the job done successfully thanks to the agreements achieved on the various dossiers, after Parliament’s vote here during this session. On Monday, 25 October, the General Affairs Council may adopt these instruments at a political level. The European External Action Service can therefore, as planned, begin operations on 1 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything was basically reiterated this morning by Baroness Ashton, the commissioners and the rapporteurs. For my part, I shall limit myself to addressing the historical nature of this event which, a year after the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, embodies one of its most significant innovations. By setting up the European External Action Service, both the coherence and the visibility of the Union’s external action will be strengthened considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the job is not over. It is just the beginning and the challenge is equal to our expectations, but I am sure we can count on the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, to do so with energy and determination. In any case, I wish her every success in this mission.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I should like once again to thank the European Parliament for its commitment and its constructive approach which was decisive in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Half a year ago, geographical balance was not an issue. Today it is, and will remain so, and paragraph 7 of our resolution and Article 6(6) will point this out. Two hundred MEPs from the new Member States in this House will also be keeping an eye on this. Far more emphasis was placed on geographical balance than was the case in the initial proposal, although this was not sufficient. Arithmetic is not always right, and laws and geography cannot be outvoted. We believe that all men and women are equal and not that some are more equal than others. This also applies to the foreign service of the Union.</p>

In addition, the Commission’s proposal is improved by the amendments proposed by the main rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, which introduce provisions concerning the personnel of the European External Action Service and which have been included in the political agreement. They concern, in particular, gender equality and geographical balance among staff, as well as a balance between staff from European Union institutions and those with a background in national diplomatic corps. I hope the new External Action Service will appreciate the autonomic character of cooperation on development and will not treat this issue as a ‘carrot’ – an instrument for conducting foreign policy.

<p class="contents">That is why, my group will tell you straight, it supports you and has every confidence in you, Baroness Ashton. We must give you the means to succeed. It is high time that the External Action Service was launched, but it is true that if, in two years time, you come back to us with a major problem of division amongst your staff, that will raise the small problem of discharge, and I am thinking of you as well as us when I say it should be avoided at all costs.

<p class="contents">With this in mind, trade policy does not fall within the High Representative’s mandate, but as a former trade commissioner, I have no doubt that she can establish the dialogue which is needed to ensure that trade policy, as specified in the treaty, observes the goals of the Union’s External Action Service, in particular, sustainable development, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to stress that our shared political will will be measured by the budgetary resources earmarked; our ability to have political punch on the international stage depends on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new body obviously needs a budget. Nevertheless, it is at least as important to define and comply with budgetary principles and financial rules, due to budgetary and financial accountability. In the past years, our committee had a debate on this with DG RELEX. Therefore, I would like to give special emphasis to this issue. It is very important to establish appropriate organisational and operational regulations. It is important to bear in mind that the duplication of tasks, functions and resources must be avoided, and all options must be considered in order to ensure the efficiency of expenditures. Transparent and simple organisational structure and management of resources is the guarantee that the new organisation will operate efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Members will come from three sources: the EU institutions, the Member States and the experts of the recipient country. It is especially important that this body comprising members of EU institutions and Member State employees has full equality in this respect. Therefore, we consider that training is important, and it is very important that the principle and practice of selection be based on uniform processes and requirements.

The functioning of the EEAS must satisfy the principles of effective and efficient financial management. This year, we allocated an additional EUR 9.5 million to the EEAS, but it will be possible to assess the true costs after the first year of operation when a report on all the expenditure related to the work of the EEAS will be presented to the European Parliament. The European Parliament also plays a responsible role in the functioning of the EEAS to ensure the effective use of EEAS money and to make sure that European Union taxpayers’ money creates real added value for the Community’s policy and its people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our work over the past few months has concentrated on ensuring that the service has the right legal basis and suitable instruments to enable its future work to be effective. We have worked under time pressure, and the negotiations have often been difficult. We have reached agreement with the Council and the Commission on many issues and I hope that the compromises which have been worked out will yield a favourable end result. The Committee on Legal Affairs had the task of proposing amendments to the Staff Regulations which will be appropriate to the needs of the new service and which will also guarantee that it will be independent and that its work will be of a high standard. I think the amendments adopted yesterday evening at the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs do give such guarantees, although personally, I do not find them completely satisfying, particularly on one matter. I think the question of geographical balance, which is emphasised so often, could have been resolved in a much better way. I do, of course, welcome the declarations made by the High Representative that she is going to give particular attention to ensuring participation in the service by citizens from all the Member States, and I also welcome the provision that in 2013, a report will be presented in which the High Representative will provide information on the work of the service.</p>
<p class="contents">Union diplomacy is supposed to be European, and the truth is that the citizenship of its staff members should not play a special role. However, where we come from and what our roots are form our worldview, and this has a significant influence on our perception of the world around us. It is a fact that there are still Member States in the Union which are under-represented in all the institutions. If Europe is to be united in diversity, it is necessary to give Europe a chance for that diversity to be properly maintained and expressed. This, in fact, was what our discussions on geographical balance were about, and not, as some mistakenly think and understand, guaranteeing fixed quotas for Member States. I thank the rapporteurs for good cooperation, and my wish for Mrs Ashton is that she will be able to put our efforts to good use in her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I can assure Mr Saryusz-Wolski that we all – not just the new Members of this House – must ensure that we achieve a better geographical balance, and that we all – not just the women – must ensure that we achieve a healthy gender balance. That is necessary, and I take the promises seriously. We will certainly press for these things to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, it is a question of providing a common service of the highest quality for the European Union. I see no contradiction here. On the contrary, everything must be reduced to a common denominator, because now it is time to act; now it is also time to show our commitment to the European Union operating at international level. In Iran, the High Representative has already taken over the leadership role, and it is very important that we achieve good results here. In the Middle East, it is important for us not only to provide funds, but also to get involved, and we should do this for the sake of the issue at hand, not simply for the prestige. Where Russia is concerned, we need to ensure that we achieve a pragmatic relationship, albeit one based on values, particularly in the interests of our common neighbours. With the United States, we need to negotiate on equal terms. Where there are problems, we also need to address these openly so that we can stand together with the United States in the fight against terrorism and in the reshaping of globalisation. China is a new emerging power, and we do not want to prevent that, but we object to a form of nationalism that is developing a certain degree of aggressiveness, particularly in that region in Asia. We want to involve China more in the international community, including in the international institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">For the High Representative, too, that is surely also one of the most important issues that needs to be addressed, namely to ensure that, in these new international multilateral institutions, we also achieve an appropriate new regulation and new distribution of influence and power, where the European Union is not restricted, but where there is acceptance of the fact that there are also new global players. All of these are huge tasks for the diplomatic service and ones for which the High Representative needs our full support. The Belgian Presidency – in other words you, Mr Chastel – has just promised that it will also give due support to the High Representative. This promise is a good one, and the words of congratulations are also good, but I hope that the foreign ministers also recognise the fact that it does not make any sense to play one of us off against the other, but that there is only one option, and that is for the foreign ministers, the High Representative and us in this Parliament to be able, together, to represent Europe strongly to the outside world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton certainly does not have an easy task ahead of her now that our common European External Action Service is to be established. However, together with the Council and the Commission, Parliament has laid the foundation for an effective representative organisation that will truly be able to represent Europe and European values and interests around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s strength is diversity. The European Union is made up of people with different backgrounds, skills and experience. By creating an External Action Service that utilises men and women recruited from all of our Member States, we are also utilising Europe’s greatest strength and resource. At the same time, there must be absolutely no doubt that it is skills and qualifications that are decisive when it comes to making appointments to posts within the new External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has a fine motto: united in diversity. These are words that carry obligations and they have a deep meaning. I hope that, under Baroness Ashton, the External Action Service will develop into a genuine European service that will represent citizens from all of our Member States, women as well as men. Those who are to work in our common External Action Service must be clearly trained to represent the whole of the Union. I wholeheartedly wish Baroness Ashton success in this important work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have saved the Community method and development priorities. We have enhanced democratic scrutiny, especially on CFSP lines. We have laid the ground for an inclusive service that is based on equality and an <span class="italic">esprit de corps</span>. Thank you, Mrs Ashton, for mentioning the training measures in respect of gender equality and geographical balance in your proactive measures. I should like to thank everyone in this House, Mrs Ashton and the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">But have we created a modern service that is more than a 28th national diplomatic service? What is the added value of the European External Action Service?</p>
<p class="contents">I think the game is still open. First of all, it will require effective coordination across policy areas. I still want to see the structures in place to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we have to enhance crisis management and conflict prevention. That can be an added value provided by the European Union. That will depend on the implementation of the ‘appropriate structure’, and it will depend on how we use new posts and posts created through synergies across the Council and the Commission. Along these lines, do we need more deputy ambassadors? Or will it not be your role, Mrs Ashton, to send an SMS? We are living in the 21st century. The role of former diplomats belongs in the 19th century. Should we not have a debate on whether we really need these people, and what we need them for?</p>
<p class="contents">I hope your establishment plan and your staffing priorities will reflect the priorities as promised and will make the service really deliver added value – something that not every national diplomatic service has, and can do. For us, there are two priorities: conflict prevention and civilian crisis management. Create a mediation cell, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">On human rights, we want this service to be strong on human rights, with capacity at the highest level. Gender equality does not end with staffing priorities. It is also about gender mainstreaming and attaching a high degree of importance to missions and mandates. In that respect, I think it would be a good idea to have an overview and review of the existing CSDP missions that have been completed, to learn from the past for the future of your service, Mrs Ashton. I think that will bring us all forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish everyone luck and I am ready to cooperate again constructively in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not create the impression that some countries are not being given recognition in relation to creation of the new service. The service should reflect the cultural wealth and different national traditions in Europe, including in the field of diplomacy. Therefore, a group of MEPs, which includes myself, has prepared an amendment which provides for the introduction of a geographical balance factor. This is so that when candidates selected in competitions are found to have similar competences, the deciding factor for appointment should be the geographical criterion. It is not, therefore, a rigid solution which imposes geographical criteria of this type when recruiting staff for the future service, but a flexible and auxiliary measure. Adoption of such a provision will reduce current disproportions and allow us, in time, to ensure greater representativeness. I would like to emphasise that this solution preserves the central significance of the competence criterion, which is so important for those who have created these measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With the European External Action Service, we are now attempting to bring the foreign policy instruments of the Union within a coherent framework. The resources that we already have are being bundled together and new ones are being added to complete the picture.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the report by our fellow Members, in view of the novel nature of this structure, ambitious provisions with regard to transparency and budgetary and financial accountability need to be applied.

I hope that you will make use of this orchestra to bring Europe’s voice to the fore and to protect our interests. Since Europe’s first priority is to safeguard peace in Europe, the next major task, in view of the international challenges – from energy security right up to combating terrorism, globalisation and much more – is to look after Europe’s interests in the world. You and this service will have a special role to play in this regard. Therefore, the progress that we make in the interests of our citizens will depend very strongly on your work and that of your orchestra.</p>
<p class="contents">In this process, we have succeeded in enhancing Parliament’s cooperation, control and right to information, including in the area of the budget. We have succeeded in safeguarding the Community character of the policies that are Community policies and also in ensuring that more than 60% of the staff must be Community officials. I am certain that, in contrast to the Council, we have managed to introduce better geographical balance and gender parity. The governments did not do this; we did their job for them. Moreover, if this is now legally binding and a review must also be carried out in 2013, then it is an excellent achievement by this House – a good compromise that we have reached between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This instrument must also be observed by us. We will do this with the necessary flexibility, but we will also exert pressure to ensure that you, Baroness Ashton, are able to succeed in your task.

<p class="contents">Such a vision will not last without an ambitious, accountable, efficient and ‘communautarian’ External Action Service. Such a service will not function effectively without staff recruited on the basis of merit.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe most of us can agree on these principles. The devil is, however, in the detail. And it is precisely these details, which have transformed a report that was meant to be technical into a source of passionate political debate, which risks dividing us deeply.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no dilemma between ‘communautarianism’ and intergovernmentalism, between merits or quotas, between old and new Member States. Nevertheless, the triumph of ‘communautarianism’ requires that each and every national of each and every Member State feels fairly treated on the basis of their merits.</p>
<p class="contents">The triumph of the merit criterion must be tested by the equilibrium of the results of the selection, since God, I believe, distributed merits and sins in a balanced way to men and women, old and young, small and big, weak and powerful, westerners and easterners, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact of the matter is that some in our Union – mainly but not only among the new members – feel they are discriminated against. Even if this perception were wrong, we should still treat it with respect and care since our unity is of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the criteria which are being questioned, but the insufficiency of guarantees that they will be properly enhanced, and of corrective measures to be applied when imbalances are obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only hope that the High Representative will correct the imbalances in the process which apparently fuelled these perceptions, and I also hope that a future European diplomatic academy, or something similar, will help us to create a corps of European diplomats who are competent and loyal to our common interest and to the European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This could prove one of the greatest strides towards a truly full-fledged European foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in my own country, which I am afraid is becoming increasingly introverted, a transfer of tasks to this new EEAS is in evidence in the new coalition agreement. Admittedly, this has only concerned the consular tasks so far, but I am convinced that the realisation will soon come that other diplomatic tasks, too, would be best handled at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, today we are focusing, in particular, on the financial and organisational side of the EEAS, and that is an important aspect. Not until sufficient transparency and financial responsibility are in place will this service be fully capable of action. Therefore, I am delighted with the agreement that has been reached among the institutions to really get started. That had been at risk on account of Parliament’s putting very detailed requirements on the table. Indeed, we, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, had opposed those somewhat.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs. A good package has been achieved, which will enjoy the full support of my group. I hope, above all, that after tomorrow’s vote, this package will enable the service to get up and running very quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

British Conservatives opposed the creation of this service, fearing it would erode Britain’s prerogative to exercise an independent foreign policy. Now that the service is a political reality, we will engage with it constructively in order to ensure that British interests are indeed promoted and protected.</p>
<p class="contents">One way is by lobbying for British EU officials and British diplomats from the Foreign Office to fill posts in the service, because surprisingly, the UK is under-represented in the EU institutions. While the new service needs to be representative of the EU’s 27 Member States, it must be built, first and foremost, on merit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Member States are making deep cuts in public spending. The EU must be sensitive to the need for austerity, particularly when it comes to the budget of the EEAS. Budget neutrality is vital if the European External Action Service is to gain and retain the confidence and approval of all of Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, it is clear that foreign and security policy constitutes part of the sovereignty of the Member States. When decisions are made on matters of principle, the power of veto still applies, and so, in the case of major decisions, such as the intervention in Iraq or the secession of Kosovo, there has been no European Union foreign policy in existence. The foreign service that has been created will therefore largely have a reduced agenda and, in the case of major political decisions, will only second the decisions of individual countries, or even be silent.</p>

At present, the number of employees from the countries of the ‘old 15’ is significantly and disproportionately greater than the number of those from the new Member States. I will quote some figures: before the last nominations, of 115 ambassadors, just two were from countries which acceded to the Union from 2004 onwards. Among the 29 ambassadors who were recently nominated, only four are from the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allow such a division to become a rule in the operation of the future External Action Service. Without the right geographical representation, we are not in a position to establish a strong External Action Service which will act effectively in the interests of all of us. Neither will we be proud of such a service, as the High Representative, Lady Ashton, has said. I am also convinced that the use of a transition period, during which the disproportionally low representation of the new Member States would be gradually increased, will allow us to move efficiently and effectively towards a situation in which our objective, which is to promote the European Union as a key player in the international arena, will be achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From tomorrow, when we are due to make the final decisions, we will expect real results. I am confident, of course, even as the debate went on today, that the European Parliament will be a European institution which will help, encourage and pass on its ideas to the new service so that it will be really effective and successfully create a more active, visible role for the European Union on the international stage.</p>

It is now only six weeks until Baroness Ashton will no longer primarily be the Minister responsible for establishing an EU foreign ministry; she will instead be the Foreign Minister for Europe, and that is a good thing. This will commence on 1 December and we wish you every success in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had many debates and we have achieved a great deal. It was a fruitful political battle. The lack of democracy associated with the old common foreign and security policy has been eliminated, there is a greater degree of accountability and the quality of the public debate has improved. There will be more stringent budgetary control, the prerequisites for a genuine team spirit have been created and national diplomats can, if they so wish, remain in the European External Action Service. There will be no geographical quotas – you could sometimes get the impression that this is the most important issue here, but it most definitely is not. Germany, in particular, would benefit greatly from a quota, but I am nevertheless against this. A common form of training will be provided. I believe that the prerequisites for a successful EEAS are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the European Parliament is almost happy. We would be really happy if you were now to take advantage of the opportunity and actually establish the appropriate structure for conflict prevention and crisis management that has been promised.

Difficulties are also evident in developing principles for recruiting personnel for Union diplomatic offices. The principle of solidarity and representativeness, which has guided the Union for a long time, must not be obscured by the selfishness of some of the large Member States. The distribution of positions in diplomatic offices lies in the hands of Mrs Ashton, who is present, today, and who is making appointments exclusively on a discretionary basis. Out of the well over 100 diplomatic offices around the world, the sixth largest Member State of the European Union, Poland, has been given only two. It should, therefore, be asked what criteria guided the Commissioner when she distributed appointments in this way. I would like to remind everyone that it is, actually, our House which decides the structure of the budget for shaping Union diplomacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In that respect, I would like to focus on an aspect of the report that has involved us in difficult negotiations: the issue of geographical balance in the composition of the European diplomatic corps. Some Members would, in fact, have preferred different criteria for the selection of staff, based on country of origin and citizenship. Such proposals have been avoided by means of balanced compromise amendments, which have been able to take geographical and gender balance into account without imposing country-based selection criteria. The selection of country-based quotas would not, in fact, have been a suitable or desirable solution.</p>
<p class="contents">After over 50 years of European integration, the Union’s first real diplomatic corps is now being created. It has to be put in a position to be able to develop a common foreign policy and serve the Union’s interests on the international stage. For it to accomplish this task, it is crucial that its staff represent the Union and not the Member States of which they are citizens or have been diplomatic officers.

I represent the new Member States, and have watched with fascination to see what the essence of integration is like in practice, what the pushing and shoving between various institutions is like and how, finally, something has been born which is intended to consolidate, by a common foreign policy, that which is so much lacking in the European Union. It has proved possible, and Parliament has been part of it. We are very proud that we have been actively involved. The new service is a service of the entire European Union, and not of just one institution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this integration has, in addition, been about integration of the new countries with the old ones. Let us say this frankly – the examination result is partially good. If, today, there are questions and doubts, it is because the Commissioner, the Vice-President of the Commission, has to ensure that all recruitment decisions are transparent and that they show that the best people are being appointed. Then I will not fight for geographical parity, because, for me, a parity of knowledge and qualifications is much more important than geographical parity, but you, Mrs Ashton, have to prove this.</p>

<p class="contents">My second comment, however, is one that I would like to reiterate with regard to what has repeatedly been at the centre of this debate, namely, the question of geographical balance. Mrs Neynsky stole the show by saying that the compromise states nothing at all about this. I would simply suggest that, once we have adopted this, she quietly and calmly reads the text. Read the text! Reading the text will enlighten the mind.

The approval of the amendment tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, which will introduce ‘merit’ as the criterion for selecting the EU’s Heads of Delegation (the diplomats who will represent the European Union in third countries), will show us, once it has been implemented by the European External Action Service of socialist Catherine Ashton, that Romania and other new Member States will be left empty-handed. I am disappointed that even this time, we have not been able to reach a consensus among Romanian MEPs promoting Romania’s interests. I would have expected Adrian Severin, as a former foreign minister (albeit for only a few months), to support the introduction of some clear criteria regarding the allocation of Head of Delegation posts (number of inhabitants, number of seats in the European Parliament and the weighting of votes in the Council), instead of a highly subjective and vague criterion based on ‘merit’. Especially because, as far as I am aware, intelligence is spread evenly across the EU and we do not have all the clever people gathered in the West, with only the idiots left in the East.

In the few days before adoption of the report, the matter of geographical balance proved to be a bone of contention. Fellow Members from what are known as the old countries argued that the EU diplomatic corps which is just being set up should recruit the best of the best, and that recruitment should be based only on the criteria of candidates’ knowledge and experience (merit only), while as Members from the new countries, we drew attention to the fact that in our countries, too, there is no shortage of superb professionals, but that despite the passing of six years from accession, the 10 new countries are still strongly under-represented in Union structures. For example, the proportion of Poles in the European Commission Directorate-General for External Relations, which will be incorporated into the EEAS, amounts to only 2%. The concept of geographical balance, in the version proposed by the rapporteur, is, in my opinion, not clear enough and cannot be considered a clear legal basis for taking measures to correct this imbalance. Therefore, unfortunately, I cannot endorse the report, although apart from this question, it does contain many valuable proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These should not be the balances of yesterday’s Europe, but the balances of the enlarged EU that are reflected in amendment seven. I am happy that the High Representative has taken on board most of Parliament’s proposals, including the principle of parliamentary supervision. It is crucial that the issue of geographical balance has been addressed comprehensibly, and in a legally binding way, which means that in case of serious problems, it is enforceable by law. We are not rivals to the Commission, but allies, and can succeed only in mutual partnership. As for the substance, I would stress the future responsibility of the EU delegations to monitor the human rights situation in a given country, including regular contacts with the Sakharov prize winners and candidates there. It is in our common interests to make the EEAS operational in 2011. We look forward to the High Representative’s report to the European Parliament on its implementation in two years time and are prepared to make the necessary modifications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Building such a complex entity, which deals with an essential and increasingly significant area of competence of the European Union, is no mean task in today’s global reality. It is particularly vital to ensure that the work of the service serves to strengthen Europe’s position. To this end, we must ensure that extremely well qualified people, with the relevant skills and experience, join its ranks, so that representatives from all the Member States will be able to participate in the implementation of the European Union’s foreign policy. I welcome the fact that Mr Rapkay’s report takes into account issues such as the promotion of equal opportunities for the under-represented gender in certain function groups and a geographic balance in the recruitment of European External Action Service employees. A well-organised service, which employs the foremost experts from all the Member States, provides an opportunity for the European Union to gain importance and to make full use of its potential on the international stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the excessive administration is also increased at the same time, as has happened in Greece, with the government expanding despite the need for rescue packages, then the people in Europe will quite rightly be annoyed. The EU has hitherto always boasted that it has a lean administration – which, of course, is not true if we take into account the separate agencies. Fifty directors-general with a princely EUR 17 000 per month for an initial 30 employees, 73 promotions to the position of director – we could easily get the impression that this is a self-service shop. Of course, it is important for an EEAS employee to have the right qualifications. In this regard, gender quotas, for example, do not serve any useful purpose. However, as the saying goes, ‘he who pays the piper calls the tune’, so it makes sense not to offend the net contributors. The refusal to increase the use of German as a working language in the EEAS has already created some diplomatic rifts. It is not a good idea to widen them. The EEAS will have to ensure that the EU is no longer merely an extension of the United States, because up to now, we have allowed the Americans to interfere in sensitive EU matters, such as the forced enlargement to include Turkey, and, as a result, have neglected important partners like Russia. The world order no longer consists of these two powers alone; there are also emerging powers like China. We must not overlook that fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a long-awaited measure towards consolidating the position of the European Union as a proficient global actor. However, I am somewhat disappointed that although appointments to the EEAS will be made using a thorough selection procedure based on merit and having regard to gender and geographical balance, it still does not guarantee proportional representation of nationals of all Member States. It should be noted that while pooling human resources from the Commission, the Council and the Member States, one third from each, some Member States are still under-represented in the Commission and the Council, which might result in an implicit imbalance in the service. I fully agree that the service ought to be made up of competent professionals, but I am also more than sure that there are suitable candidates equally from both genders and from all the Member States. The fact that the European Union is an egalitarian organisation of 27 Member States should be clearly reflected in the composition of the European External Action Service in order to put our values into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were tough negotiations between the three pillars of the Union: the Council, the Commission and the Parliament, so each, even if not completely satisfied, saw its main interests safeguarded. During the entire process, emphasis was placed inevitably on the national representation of the Member States in the staffing process. Things were not helped when, in spite of the ongoing negotiations to set its rules, the process continued unabated and, as a consequence, only some countries have seen their representatives getting the positions they were seeking.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that the main challenge to the new service lies less in composition than in substance: if we want the members of the EEAS to be truly European, then we will have to provide them with a truly European foreign policy to implement. In that respect, both the multi-polar structure of the international system and the current crisis are important obstacles to be dealt with vigorously. Otherwise, the EEAS will only pursue the national objectives of the individual members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the compromise reached with the Council on Parliament’s rights is a satisfactory compromise for all concerned. It makes sense and we need to have activity reports from the heads of the delegations during hearings before the competent parliamentary committee during the procedure of exchange with the Council. The EEAS also needs the same internal auditor and authorising officer as the European Commission for the purposes of financial control. Finally, it is important that the Member States have committed to fully supporting the EU in the enforcement of any budgetary liability of temporary servants and in agreeing to create separate lines for CFSP expenditure, at least for major missions. We feel that the compromise achieved will help enormously in achieving more transparent, sound and effective administration of spending by the EEAS under the Community budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title6"></a><a name="creitem6"></a>

<p class="contents">The recent succession of global crises to have affected all countries, with the poorest countries being hardest hit, has shown how interconnected the world is. Promoting development is therefore an integral part of Europe’s response to today’s global challenges and the next five years will be crucial for development policy in Europe and the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is enshrined in Article 208 of the Treaty of Lisbon, and in the European consensus on development, we clearly stated that the overarching aim of EU development cooperation is the eradication of poverty in the context of sustainable development, including pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">However, achieving all the Millennium Development Goals, in the context of sustainable development, comes under a collective responsibility under which all partners should honour the commitments they have made. The European Union is convinced that the developing countries are also responsible for and masters of their own development and that it is up to them, above all, to take responsibility for achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore important to highlight the fact that global strategies are needed to achieve these goals, including democratic governance, the protection of human rights and the rule of law, pro-poor economic growth, private sector development, trade development, human and social development and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union encourages partner countries to rapidly scale up their own efforts, in particular, with regard to the reduction of poverty and inequality as well as the introduction of partnerships with civil society, the private sector and local authorities. The European Union will offer increased support for their efforts to mobilise domestic resources for development, in particular, in the context of improving public financial management and the strength and efficiency of their fiscal and customs systems.</p>
<p class="contents">On 22 September this year, on adopting the final document of the Millennium Development Goal summit, UN Member States also renewed their commitment to work together to improve the economic and social contexts of all people and to do everything within their power to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals are achieved between now and 2015. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the second part of this statement, I will also turn to the report by Mrs Figueiredo.</p>
<p class="contents">Eradicating poverty is the most pressing global challenge of our time. It is a challenge that must be tackled, not only for obvious reasons of solidarity and duty, but also for the sake of worldwide prosperity and stability. And that is in everybody’s interests. In 2000, world leaders gathered at the UN in New York and agreed on an international development agenda for the coming 15 years, the Millennium Development Goals. Among the different goals and targets set in the framework, the world committed to reduce extreme poverty by half. Where are we now, five years before the 2015 deadline?</p>
<p class="contents">Encouraging progress has been achieved. Overall, 120 million people moved out of poverty between 2000 and 2005, which corresponds to an annual drop of 2.4%, but there is no time for complacency. Today, 1.4 billion people still live in extreme poverty, and there are huge disparities among regions, countries and population groups. Besides, the recent and current global crisis – from food and fuel price shocks to economic instability and climate change – threatens both past achievements and future prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">Two weeks ago, the MDG summit confirmed the world’s ambition to fight against poverty. Members of the European Parliament, led by Gay Mitchell, made an important contribution to that summit and I thank them very much for their participation and support. I would also like to thank Parliament for its support in the whole preparation process ending with adoption of the Cashman report. This House’s continuing attention to the MDGs made the EU’s position strong and ambitious in New York. I think the MEPs who took part in the summit were reassured by the outcome. There was no blame game; rather, the gathering gave new energy, impetus and hope with regard to attaining the goals. It demonstrated that the MDGs are still high on the political agenda, with some 110 Heads of State or Government attending the summit. The European Union was instrumental in making this event a success by shaping and voicing a strong common approach among our 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against poverty is also high on our agenda in the European Union. This is part of our European project. It is a central objective of the European Union development policy, as stated in the Lisbon Treaty, and it is also something that European citizens firmly support, which is equally important.</p>
<p class="contents">As the world’s leading donor, the European Union has made a major contribution to the achievement of the MDGs so far. To give you just two examples, the European Commission alone has helped put 9 million more girls and boys in schools since 2004, and we have connected 31 million households to clean drinking water. I believe this is something to be proud of, but we need to do more and we can do more.</p>
<p class="contents">In June, Europe’s leaders helped make the MDGs stronger by agreeing on an ambitious plan and a set of actions. The plan prioritises action on the goals on which we have made the least progress, and in those regions and countries that are lagging furthest behind, including those experiencing conflict and fragility. The plan also confirms our commitment to meeting the 0.7% GNI target by 2050, despite the difficult economic and financial context. To achieve this, we need to assess progress on this every year.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning the Millennium Development Goals – in particular, the goal relating to poverty eradication – into Millennium Development Realities by 2015 will also remain the overarching priority of my action.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that aid alone will not be sufficient to attain the MDGs. To meet the goals, it is also of paramount importance that we are more creative in enhancing the impact of our aid, in promoting more sustainable and more inclusive growth, and in mobilising other and additional sources of finance for development. Equally important are the quality and effectiveness of aid, including through more transparency and accountability, as well as ensuring that non-aid policies are more supportive of the MDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">Development aid must be conceived as a catalyst, not as a cure. No country has ever been transformed by aid alone. Sustainable progress depends primarily on developing a country’s capacity to generate inclusive and sustainable growth. Development can only come from within developing countries, not from outside, and so it is on this ‘within’ that we must focus our development efforts. In the end, this is what the principle of ‘ownership’ means.</p>
<p class="contents">In November, I plan to launch a Green Paper and public consultation to gather views on how to improve our policies and instruments to better act on the enabling factors for sustainable and inclusive growth in partner countries, thereby tackling the root causes of poverty, bringing strong added value to our development cooperation. I believe, as usual, that your contribution to this debate will be essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Ms Figueiredo for her report on minimum income schemes. At the very heart of her report is the basic right of people to have sufficient resources to allow them to live in dignity. This is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It has inspired several recent Commission initiatives in the area of active inclusion, in particular, the 2008 Commission recommendation on active inclusion which was endorsed by Parliament and the Council. The recommendation sets out integrated active inclusion strategies based on three pillars – namely, inclusive labour markets, access to quality services and adequate income support. The Commission therefore welcomes this report.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we fully respect Member State competences as regards the design and functioning of social protection schemes in general and minimum income schemes in particular. Adequate income is a fundamental component in the fight against poverty for people who cannot work. It constitutes a necessary complement to inclusive labour markets, to combat poverty for people who can work.</p>
<p class="contents">The report rightly reaffirms the basic principle of income support, which has to be both adequate and incentive-compatible. Member States are currently taking fiscal consolidation measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances. The Commission shares the view that these measures have to take account of the need to protect the most vulnerable members of society.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission will present a European Platform against Poverty by the end of this year, setting out concrete measures to support Member States in reaching the target of lifting at least 20 million European citizens out of poverty by 2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a shocking step backwards for rich Europe, where the profits of the financial sector and economic groups continue to grow, and be secreted away in tax havens. As a result, there is a growing wave of indignation among millions of workers, women, young people, victims of salary cuts and precarious, poorly paid work, the unemployed, and retired people with pitiful pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of 2008, Eurostat said that, even after welfare contributions, around 85 million people would be at risk of poverty, but the situation will be all the worse with further neoliberal EU policies and the so-called austerity measures that are being taken by several Member States. These measures involve salary cuts and cuts in public health services, education and other areas, reductions in social support and tax increases on essential goods, including foodstuffs, as is now also happening in Portugal, following Greece, Ireland and other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable for the Commission and the Council to continue to put pressure on Member States due to the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact. They are looking only at financial, not social, issues, having given all the funds for public support to the banks and the financial system, with complete disregard for the public. Worst of all, they are now forcing workers and poor people to pay for the urgent public subsidies that the governments gave to the banks, with the backing of EU leaders and applause from financial groups.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary to change policies in order to tackle poverty and social exclusion, as demanded by the millions of demonstrators across Europe, including here in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">The objectives and guiding principles of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion cannot be mere words in the wind. The commitment that the EU made to realise the UN’s Millennium Development Goals cannot be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">Policies should recognise rights and sharing of responsibility, promote cohesion and the participation of people at risk of or living in poverty, take concrete measures and implement them in order to effectively prevent and eradicate poverty, and integrate the homeless and immigrants, not to mention people with disabilities, and they should not jeopardise the future of young people and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Europe 2020 strategy is limited to indicating the way out of poverty for 20 million people by 2020, which represents a step back from the initial objectives of the so-called Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The multifaceted nature of poverty and social exclusion calls for a social dimension to macro-economic policies as an integral part of overcoming the crisis. This means a change in priorities and policies, especially monetary policies, such as the Stability and Growth Pact, budgetary and fiscal policies, and competition and internal market policies. Priority needs to be given to economic and social cohesion and the defence of human rights. This means that at the very least, there should be a balance between economic policies, employment, social and environmental policies, and fair distribution of wealth and income.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, minimum income schemes are an effective tool for ensuring people’s security and reducing the effects of exclusion and unemployment. This supports access to decent work, combating the insecurity and poverty wages which are leading to a growth in the percentage of poor workers. These minimum income schemes play an important role in redistributing income, and they ensure solidarity and social justice, particularly in a time of crisis, as they act in a counter-cyclical way as social stabilisers, providing additional resources to strengthen demand and consumption in the internal market, and thus combating the recession.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, minimum income schemes based on at least 60% of the median income in each country should be an integral part of a strategy aimed at social integration, involving both general policies and specific measures for society’s most vulnerable groups in terms of housing, healthcare, education and training, and social services. This would help people out of poverty and act as a means of social inclusion and access to employment for all those who are in a position to do so, with decent working conditions, not modern slavery, as is the case with the unstable and poorly paid work that is affecting millions of workers, especially women and young people.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge facing the Commission is to present an initiative and action plan on minimum income schemes with a view to getting children, young people, adults and the elderly out of poverty and putting them on the path to social progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of people living below the poverty line is rising all the time, just as the gap between those who live in penury and those who enjoy a high standard of living is constantly widening.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the latest United Nations report on the state of the world’s cities, 827 million people live in shanty towns today, and that number will continue to grow by an average of 6 million every year. As has already been emphasised, Europe is not a stranger to this: today, almost 80 million of our citizens are living in poverty – 16% of the Union’s population – and a good 19 million of them are children.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, 2010, has been declared the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, and that forms the backdrop to the report we are discussing today. I was determined that the final text should analyse certain aspects that I consider extremely important, and I am grateful to Mrs Figueiredo for that. The recent economic crisis has resulted in a rise in unemployment. Unfortunately, it is once again women who have been hit hardest. Fighting poverty first of all requires policies that promote employment, particularly for women and young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone ought to be able to enjoy enough money to guarantee a decent standard of living. It is a fact: the minimum wage can play an important role in combating poverty, by offering everyone the chance to take an active part in social, cultural and political life. Nonetheless, each Member State must be free to decide whether to adopt a minimum wage; it must not be a decision made at Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve true social integration and combat situations of degradation and poverty, we must not rely merely on social security measures: we need to aim our sights higher. Let us therefore fight for better structural reforms and work towards more incisive employment policies, so as to encourage the weaker sections of society to join the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is founded on the idea that prosperity for as many people as possible is a guarantee of economic development for all Europeans. Thanks to the open market, but also thanks to structural funding – to the redistribution of prosperity – the standard of living in the Central and Eastern European Member States is rising, and older Member States are benefiting from this. All Europeans have a right to a decent living, as do all world citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why poverty reduction features in the Treaty of Lisbon. The Millennium Development Goals must be attained, and we can proceed at international level in exactly the same way we are proceeding with new Member States. Poor countries increase in prosperity as a result of respect for the rule of law, as this gives businesses the courage to invest there, knowing that their contracts are secure. Worldwide redistribution of prosperity reduces social tension and the chance of violence and refugee flows, and increases our potential markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is incomprehensible that some governments of Member States, such as the Netherlands – my own country – are now tampering with the development budget and also seeking to tamper with these objectives. They are doing so out of mistaken, short-sighted self-interest. Poverty reduction must remain the EU’s priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have always been a passionate supporter of a minimum income in all Member States, and I have written it into all the reports I have ever done on social inclusion, but I believe the best way of achieving this is through an exchange of best practice. In my view, if we try to take the legislative route, we will fail to take everyone with us and will not achieve what we all want – a decent standard of living for all and to take people out of poverty and avoid homelessness.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Employment Committee report, we also say that the most effective way out of poverty is to give labour market access to all. One way of achieving this is to make sure the Employment Directive is implemented effectively across all Member States. When formulating policy regarding poverty and social inclusion, we must listen to people at the sharp end – in other words, those who are experiencing poverty and homelessness themselves. We must make sure that Member States meet their targets for poverty reduction as outlined in the EU 2020 strategy.</p>

<p class="contents">We have just held the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October and the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion will soon draw to a close, but what will we have to show for this?

What hope can we offer my generation, this European generation bearing the brunt of unemployment, insecurity and exclusion, these young people who are mistrustful of Europe, who expect a lot from Europe and therefore from you?</p>
<p class="contents">We are duty bound to answer their day-to-day concerns and their anxieties over the future. The Lisbon strategy has failed in its mission to eradicate poverty. We can no longer stand by idly and let things happen. Now is no longer the time for meaningless rhetoric. The time has come to be bold and show some political courage. All the organisations working with victims of poverty, ATD Fourth World, the European Anti-poverty Network (EAPN), the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless (FEANTSA), Emmaüs Europe, have been demanding this for 20 years!</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are asking the European Commission for a framework directive which aims to set an adequate minimum income. This framework directive will ensure eligibility for and access to an adequate minimum income so that any child, adult or elderly person living in poverty can break free from it, thus guaranteeing them their inalienable right to live in dignity.</p>

In view of this, attempts to establish an appropriate minimum wage are very much to be welcomed. However, a minimum wage only makes sense when combined with additional measures. An isolated debate could lead to the decline of the business location and an increase in the number of people out of work. Finally, small and medium-sized enterprises will not be able to afford to pay a statutory minimum wage if the tax burden remains as it is, and, of course, higher wages also carry the risk of an increase in the price of goods and services. That would set the inflationary spiral in motion once again.</p>
<p class="contents">The focus must therefore be on relief in relation to work. Work must become worthwhile again for EU citizens. A minimum wage is certainly a good idea, but it should be provided within a meaningful overall package of tax relief for workers and also for Europe’s small and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, globalisation has increased inequalities within countries but it has reduced inequalities between nations, evidence of which can be seen with the success of emerging countries. This was pointed out by an expert from the International Monetary Fund at the Oslo conference, where the IMF joined forces with the International Labour Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">True, there are still major differences between nations but it would be wrong to blame ongoing poverty on globalisation alone when it comes to the inequalities within our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Europe, and this is my second observation, is very specific. It is the only large economic area to have become accustomed to mass unemployment over the last three decades, as pointed out by Professor Fitoussi.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2020 strategy does indeed open up some interesting perspectives on how to tackle structural unemployment but it is within the context of managing the current crisis that the European Union needs to find ways of improving levels of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us believe that if things swing too far in favour of streamlining public finances, the goal of reducing poverty risks becoming a pipe dream.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, our approach to combating poverty must be both international and outward-looking. With sustainable development in mind, we can no longer afford to favour one over the other. A Malthusian approach which involves asserting what is spent in the name of solidarity is quite simply...</p>

We also know that there are very big variations in effectiveness, that there is often no clear basis for the amounts that are paid, and that the amounts paid do not necessarily keep pace with rising costs. Some Member States have a very poor take-up, so people are not getting their entitlements, and some also time-limit these income schemes, which seems very bizarre for something that is meant to be a safety net.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe very strongly that we need a common framework across the European Union that gives clear principles for how we develop these schemes and a clear methodology for working on them. We are not talking about the same level of payment in each Member State and to keep saying this is to perpetuate something which is deeply untrue. We do need to develop these schemes so that everybody in the EU can live in dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that our efforts, as well as those of governments and non-governmental organisations, should be sustained and not be just campaigns and propaganda. Of all the measures proposed in the report under discussion, there is particular significance in the proposal to define minimum income in relation to median income. The causes of poverty are varied, and they are often associated with social ills and social exclusion. However, particularly striking and very shameful is the fact of the occurrence of poverty among working people and even among those who have no children or a small number of children. Such a situation is unacceptable, and so the steps taken by the European Commission and Parliament on this matter have to be exceptionally effective, consistent and resolute. While helping people in different continents and sending humanitarian aid in the wake of natural disasters, we should first set an example by showing solidarity with citizens affected by poverty in the territory of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may be the European Year for Combating Poverty, but thanks to the economic crisis, unemployment and social hardship are still on the increase in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Outstanding features of European poverty are child poverty, growing youth unemployment, the inferior position of women in the labour market, the exclusion of immigrants, the status of ethic minorities such as the Roma, and the plight of the unemployed of pre­retirement age. Reducing poverty is one of the key targets of the Europe 2020 strategy, and there has been the desire to make these a reality through quantitative aims that are binding on the Member States. There is good reason for this too, since the results of efforts to reduce poverty over the last decade have been virtually non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority on the Committee finally decided to propose that the Member States should set a minimum income of 60% of their median income threshold, and some Members even called for a framework law on minimum income. I do not support changes to legislation, because establishing a minimum income ignores the differing structures of the social security systems in the Member States. In some Member States, differently tiered and income-related social services as well as universal services funded through taxation are also part of the social security system. The question of minimum income should therefore be approached from the angle of the principle of subsidiarity in the Member States, and solutions should be sought through an exchange of best practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all aware of the statistics, the percentages and the rhetoric on this topic; the fact that such a large number of citizens are living below the poverty line is a serious matter that needs to be addressed without delay. It is a wonderful thing to be able to fight poverty by generating more jobs and encouraging the establishment of structures that can help us reach our goal. This includes a plan to help European citizens to receive the necessary training that will translate into a job that pays. We also require the necessary funds to provide support to those countries that are still lagging behind in this respect so that they, too, can fulfil these goals. Clearly therefore, we need to encourage as many people as possible to enter the labour market, women in particular. This report thoroughly evaluates this situation and here I would very much like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur on her very useful work. However, we must make sure that we do not rush forward blindly, for the provisions in the treaty on the subsidiarity principle must continue to be respected. To apply a one-size-fits-all concept to the whole of Europe is not a practical solution. Moreover, we do not yet have the necessary legal basis that our treaty requires for this. Subsequently, Member States should be free to regulate these requirements according to their own needs, unencumbered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The existing crises in certain Member States have worsened, social inequalities have widened, and this situation has led to an increase in the number of people living below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, there are more poor people in the European Union. There are more men and women with an income lower than 60% of the average salary for the country in which they live. We have a serious problem requiring concrete and effective measures. 80 million Europeans are living on or below the poverty line. Even though the poverty line differs from country to country within the EU, what is certain is that this is a growing phenomenon in our Union, which has the most advanced social model in the world as its development paradigm.</p>
<p class="contents">In Portugal, around 20% of people live in or at risk of poverty, on less than EUR 360 per month. The data on child poverty in my country are devastating. Portugal is one of the eight countries with the highest levels of child poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the target bringing 20 million people out of poverty by 2020, just as we welcome the efforts to promote employment and social inclusion.

In 2000, the international organisation committed to halving the rate of people living in severe poverty within 15 years. Two thirds of this period have already elapsed. The figures are alarming and we are behind the indicators, at a time when demand and expectations are very high. Seventy-three percent of the EN population sees the main problem in the increasingly widespread poverty in their countries. Eighty-nine percent of the citizens want urgent action to tackle the problem, and 74% expect the EU to play an important role in eradicating poverty. On the other hand, 6 million EU citizens have lost their jobs in the past two years, and child poverty is on the increase.</p>
<p class="contents">While we know and often refer to the fact that employment is the most efficient means of combating poverty, the model of the social Europe identified by Jean Monnet has been overshadowed by economic interests. The aim of economic development is to ensure the well-being of citizens, but it is worth nothing without efficient social measures and a drastic reduction of the current poverty level. It is obvious that social policy is primarily the task and responsibility of Member States. However, I still think that we have to find answers to the most urgent issues jointly, by an increased use of the open coordination method and by facilitating the exchange of best practices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Poverty is increasing, including among Europeans who do have jobs. Therefore, I believe we need to take an initiative at European level, too, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic growth, better education and training, more jobs: we are, of course, entirely in favour of this, but it is clear that this is not enough and that we need a specific policy to fight poverty. As has already been said here, this is actually one of the flagships, one of the priorities of our new EU 2020 strategy. What is it about in specific terms? It is about living in dignity – the right to live in dignity – and about food, housing, clothing: basic things that are evidently not guaranteed in our prosperous European Union in the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that is why I believe that action needs to be taken at European level, too, to secure this minimum income.

There must be sufficient scope for Member States to opt for their own specific solution. Yet we do have to keep increasing the pressure to prevent vulnerable persons being left out in the cold.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are expressly calling for a guaranteed minimum income scheme to be introduced in all the countries of the European Union. This would be an important signal of hope to all the most vulnerable persons in Europe, those who are currently affected by poverty and social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Minimum income can form one part of that solution, and indeed it already exists, in some form or another, in Member States’ social policies. However, in this material, I have also come across a proposal for a universal basic income or unconditional income for all.</p>

Secondly, there is an initiative that goes further than just using the GDP when preparing the structural funds, but also includes the Gini coefficient as a measure of income inequality in the assessment – where there is disadvantage.

More jobs, that is, with rights and fair wages.

One of the objectives of the strategy, which was approved by the Council on 7 June 2010, is to promote social inclusion, in particular, by reducing poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">This objective states that at least 20 million people should be removed from the risk of poverty or exclusion by 2020 on the basis of three indicators put forward by the Social Protection Committee, that is, the risk of poverty, material deprivation and living in a jobless household.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion aims to raise public awareness of this problem and to convey the message that poverty and exclusion undermine social and economic development. It also seeks to call into question the point of view that combating poverty represents a cost for society and to reaffirm the importance of collective responsibility, not only for the political decision makers, but also for those involved in the public and private sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Presidency has been keen to participate in this European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. I would like to mention some of the initiatives and events that have been organised. A conference on child poverty was organised in September. The purpose of this conference was to give scope to the European debate about adopting a recommendation on child poverty in order to break the vicious circle of poverty being repeated from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply specifically to Mr Daerden, a round table has been organised today in Brussels. Its subject will be the implementation of the recommendation in relation to active inclusion with its three pillars: minimum income, inclusive labour market and access to quality services.</p>
<p class="contents">Another conference on the subject of the social economy is to take place on 27 and 28 October and one on homelessness will be organised on 9 and 10 December. Finally, on 17 December, on the fringe of the European Council, the official closing session of the Year for Combating Poverty will take place, presenting good practice and the flagship events of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, is how the Belgian Presidency’s intention to put social issues at the top of the European agenda has been put into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We undoubtedly need a systemic approach that addresses and resolves the causes of the problems, nipping incipient problems in the bud. However, at the same time, we cannot currently provide immediate and urgent responses to their consequences. In view of this, ensuring that those who are vulnerable in our society receive a minimum income for living and are given urgent responses to enable them to get out of this situation is not only a necessity, but also a requirement that we should endorse, and one which this report advocates very well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although unemployment is the main reason for poverty, many Europeans, even those in work, are struggling with poverty on a daily basis and do not have the opportunity to lead life to the full. It is absurd that the income working people receive is insufficient to ensure a dignified life for their families. I would like to remind you that economic growth itself did not reduce poverty and social exclusion and the hard times are only increasing poverty, but minimum income schemes allow us to defend the most vulnerable people. The guarantee of minimum incomes is an important and effective means of overcoming poverty, which supports social integration and access to the labour market and gives people the opportunity to live in decent conditions. I would like to draw attention to the fact that even during the crisis, minimum incomes should not be viewed as an element that increases costs, but as a basic tool for combating the crisis, because early investment in the fight against poverty provides most benefit by reducing long-term social expenditure. Therefore, in order to meet the Europe 2020 strategy commitment to eradicate the threat of poverty and exclusion for at least 20 million people in the European Union, the European Commission must take concrete actions and propose European legislation, which would ensure minimum incomes throughout Europe to combat poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every six seconds, a child dies of hunger on Earth. There are several million undernourished children in Europe. The rate of children living in poverty, often with multiple disadvantages, is 19% at EU level, exceeding the rate for the total population by 3%. The need for special attention is also supported by the figures, and the strategy for children’s rights at EU level must also attach proper emphasis to this. The worldwide economic crisis we experience today is not only a burden upon us but also an opportunity. An opportunity for creative thinking, for a shift of approach in business life, and an opportunity for a paradigm shift in our way of thinking in terms of economy, society and the environment, to which our societies are increasingly receptive.</p>
<p class="contents">Social solidarity and local initiatives can contribute to the mitigation of child poverty and malnutrition. As a result of the ‘Sufficient food for all children!’ initiative recently launched in Hungary, several thousand children can get warm meals on a daily basis. At the same time, as a result of the initiative launched by the Franciscan monk, Csaba Böjte, in Transylvania, close to 2 000 children are fed and supervised in 18 children’s homes and 40 day care homes. In agreement with the opinion of the Eurochild international organisation, I would also like to emphasise that combating child poverty should be handled not only as an economic challenge but also as a children’s rights issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard, poverty still has a feminine face in Europe. The disadvantageous situation of women is structural. They work less, as household work is not acknowledged as legitimate work. If they work on the labour market, they earn less, because of discrimination and segregation. A reminder: all in all, the gender pay gap is still over 17% in Europe (meaning that women work 17% more for the same pay men get). And, in the end, of course, women also get less pension due to the circumstances described above. Is this not profoundly unfair?</p>
<p class="contents">We can break this vicious cycle by acknowledging that non-paid work is work indeed, by encouraging women to work and gain their economic independence, by attacking the structural causes of labour market segregation, and by paying attention to women’s problems when reforming our pension schemes. It may be more expensive today, but in the long run, less inequality and less poverty will help balance our budgets as well.

It is unquestionable that, in the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, this type of action is completely appropriate. The first question that I would like to ask is about the explanatory capacity of official data on unemployment, the average income, the percentage of people living in poverty and the setting of the poverty line. The average income is an indicator based on implausible, if not downright false, figures. If you add together the millions paid to various managers and the salaries of minimum income workers, the figure might be considered very unreliable. When comparing wages, managers and executives should be considered separately. In addition, the relationship between the incomes of citizens – measured, for example, as GDP per capita – has a very loose relation to the minimum wage. In Portugal and the Czech Republic, citizens’ income, measured by GDP, is roughly the same. The minimum income, however, varies by nearly 50%. The ‘poverty threshold’ and ‘at-risk-of-poverty rate’ are simply incomprehensible to my poor understanding. When I read that in Sweden, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for the population is 12%, in the Czech Republic 9%, but in Luxembourg 13%, I can only wonder. Despite these shortcomings, this report is certainly informative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Inactivity is much more destructive than many of us would think or know. However, this is what people living with disabilities experience day after day. They do not need single-digit percentage improvements in income levels while they are unemployed. It is activity that must be increased and encouraged at any cost. In addition, gerontology and lifestyle research should be supported. Up-to-date, innovative investments improving everyday life and supporting adaptation and access must be facilitated. Let us not legalise and strengthen dependency, increasing the masses of dependants and citizens in need. This, too, is a self-perpetuating stigma, which is untenable.</p>
<p class="contents">Resources needed for social provisions are increasingly difficult to obtain from dwindling public sources (taxes). The people whose situation is continuously worsening are those with actual needs, those who are incapacitated and live with severe disabilities: we see more and more examples of widespread abuse, for example, in the area of disability pensions, which bring down the standard of provisions. Coming back to ageing: the dependency rate is continuously increasing, which means that the value of existing social provisions will also decrease, due to a lack of sufficient numbers of active citizens to ensure adequate levels of social benefits and minimum income. The number of active European citizens will drop by millions even in the next decade. This forecasts a deterioration in the lives of those actually in need, which should not be tolerated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among the principal causes of the rise in the number of poor people in the EU’s Member States are a lack of adequate education and a failure to adapt abilities to the requirements of the labour market. Poverty is also associated with an enormous psychological burden and with fear, stress and an inability to make appropriate choices. These factors mean that people affected by poverty very often have to struggle with yet another problem – that of social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Children from poor families are deprived of the opportunities enjoyed by children from better-off families. Young people growing up in such an environment have neither the opportunities nor the right role models to enable them, in the future, to escape from this closed circle of poverty.

However, let us ask what the EU is actually doing to combat poverty. At present, there are 80 million people living below the poverty line in the EU, which represents 17% of the EU population. The most at risk in this group have long been not only older citizens but mainly young people. While overall unemployment in the EU stands, on average, at 10%, the figure is twice as high for young people – 21%, and in some countries, such as Spain, for example, it is as high as 40%. Poverty, therefore, mainly threatens young people. For the future development of the EU, it is therefore important to ensure not only a minimum wage, but surely job opportunities for the young in particular. It is very difficult for someone finishing education to find a job. We may talk about lifelong learning, but that too has a direct aim – to train someone for a profession. I am therefore appealing to the representatives of the EU. Adopt measures to improve conditions for young people, and in that way let us foster a healthy society in the future. Young people are the future of the European Union and of the whole world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main aim of income support programmes should be to lift people out of poverty and to enable them to live a dignified life. The latest statistics are frightening. There are 1.4 billion people in the world, and around 85 million in the European Union, currently living in poverty. The European Parliament and the Member States should take further measures to create more jobs and to improve the quality of those jobs and salary levels, as well as to guarantee fair pensions, benefits and family allowances. It is vital to ensure universal access to high quality public services. One of the European Parliament’s proposals is to establish a minimum income level of at least 60% of the median income in a given Member State. In Poland, the minimum income level currently stands at around 42% of the average income. Increasing the minimum wage would help to lift adults and elderly people out of poverty and to give them the right to a dignified life, as well as providing all children with the opportunity to foster their development and obtain an education. With regard to the issue of education, it is particularly important to take effective action, first and foremost, to combat factors which contribute to children prematurely dropping out of the education system, as well as improving the level of vocational training. I think that we need to create the basis for implementing specific measures and political strategies to broaden young people’s access to education, for example, through grants or student loans and subsidies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One in six Europeans, or 17% of the population, live below the poverty line. In Poland, that is about 6.5 million people. Poverty can affect anyone. It is enough to lose your job or become seriously ill. The ranks of the poor are increasingly being swollen by people who do have jobs. Poverty most often affects children and the elderly, young white-collar workers, graduates, families with many children and people who are repaying loans.</p>
<p class="contents">It is Parliament’s obligation to be effective in resisting and combating the causes of poverty. Our objective is to reduce the number of the poor by 20 million by 2020. First place in national strategies to combat poverty should be given to guaranteeing suitable material support for the poor, enabling easier access to the labour market and providing opportunities for education, as well as ensuring a high quality of public services for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally important are social and ethical issues. Poverty is also the state of mind associated with loss of dignity and humiliation. In fact, it is changing this attitude which is one of the most difficult aspects of combating poverty. We need, here, effective psychological care and speed in giving help. National strategies should be consistent with initiatives supported by the European Social Fund and projects of the EU’s PROGRESS programme. May the year 2010 be an opportunity for social dialogue to achieve ratification of the European Social Charter by all Member States of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is one choice that we have to make here: is 2010 to be the year of fine words and empty promises on poverty reduction, or do we take a specific measure that helps millions of Europeans? Parliament can opt for the latter by requiring the Commission to make a proposal for a framework directive laying down the principle of an adequate minimum income in Europe. After all, there are excessive differences within the EU at present, with some countries having no minimum income at all. Even in the countries that are doing better, however, such as Belgium, integration incomes still often fall below the poverty threshold. I believe that everyone deserves equal opportunities. Whenever people are pushed below the poverty threshold, they are deprived of these opportunities, and this manifests itself at various levels (such as those of health, housing and the chances of employment). In addition, if we really want to set to work on achieving the EU 2020 objectives, we simply cannot afford to just desert people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This visit is very timely. Last month, at the United Nations summit on the Millennium Development Goals, we had an opportunity to review our accomplishments and see what still needs to be done. Last Sunday was International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. We are two months from Cancún. We are awaiting a binding agreement and some crucial decisions and practical steps. We are also witnessing important developments that affect global security, with developments in the Middle East, in Asia and in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a visit by the Secretary-General of the United Nations would always be timely, because we, the United Nations and the European Union, share a common responsibility for global issues. As you wrote a few minutes ago in the European Parliament’s golden book, we are natural allies. That is true; we feel the same. You will address our Parliament and our citizens in a few minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has always been the driving force behind ambitious European policies. This is how we understand the aspirations of our citizens. They want a Europe of solidarity, of solidarity within Europe, but also of solidarity with all people all over the world, of solidarity with nations that continually work to ensure that their citizens live in dignity. But dignity not only means freedom from hunger, illness and violence. It also means freedom to realise the ambitions of education and active participation in social and political life. Dignity is also the freedom of belief and respect for differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Secretary-General, we believe that you share those aspirations with us. Your tireless and passionate commitment to the values that the United Nations and the European Union have in common is very important for us. We are looking forward to listening to your speech.</p>

<p class="contents">It is a great honour for me to be here addressing the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you were sent to Strasbourg by the citizens of your countries in order to construct a stronger Europe for the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself have come because you are the democratic voice of the European people, that is, almost 500 million people.</p>
<p class="contents">You adopt budgets, you pass legislation and you debate with an extraordinary spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">You are the vital link between the global, regional and local levels.</p>
<p class="contents">You are a powerful vehicle for peace, stability and prosperity in your own region.</p>
<p class="contents">You also play a crucial role in formulating policies whose scope extends far beyond your borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Your responsibilities are bound to increase given the possibilities opened up by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very pleased about this progress. </p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations and the European Union are natural partners. We are making a real difference for people in countries all around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Millions of poor girls and boys are in school, billions of young children are being immunised against deadly diseases, and thousands of soldiers are keeping the peace from Lebanon to Central Africa to Cyprus and beyond, all as a result of our partnership and Europe’s extraordinary generosity and leadership. That work must deepen and grow.</p>
<p class="contents">We are confronting many challenges and multiple crises. But something else is happening – a light bulb moment around the world. Country after country, leader after leader, is coming to recognise that the best way to address our challenges is by taking them on together – together with the United Nations and together with all the members of the European Union. No nation, no group, no region can do it alone. If we share in the burden, we will share in the benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">So, today, I would like to talk about solidarity – about how the European Union and the United Nations together can address the real fears of real people. Everywhere, we see currents of concern. Jobs are scarce, tensions are high, people are hurting, angry and disillusioned. That has led to an erosion of trust in institutions, in leaders, and among neighbours. These are testing times, even in a prosperous region like Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we can pass the test. Together we have framed a vision for our work – a precise definition of the overarching challenges of our time. We have mobilised global support for common action. Let me be clear: we are beholden to the people, who rightly demand results. Now is not the time for simply delivering speeches, but now is the time to implement those speeches and this is the time for delivering action.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on three global challenges: first, tackling extreme poverty around the world; second, confronting climate change; and third, building a world free of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be specific. First, the poverty challenge. Last month, world leaders gathered at the United Nations summit meeting on the Millennium Development Goals in New York. There is good news – major progress in combating extreme poverty and hunger, in school enrolment and child health, clean water, and in fighting malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet our achievements are uneven. Obstacles stand in the way. Global trade talks have stagnated, locking in place harmful subsidies and an unfair regime that denies developing countries new opportunities. Rising prices are putting essential medicines out of the reach of many of the neediest. Nearly one billion people go to bed hungry every night. This year alone, an additional 64 million people will fall into extreme poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this calls for a renewed push to achieve the goals by the deadline of 2015. At the recent MDG summit meeting, that is precisely what we agreed. We will boost resources and accountability. I commend those members of the European Union that made strong commitments despite fiscal pressures. We can tighten belts without closing our eyes to common challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask all of you to support the United Nations where action is urgently and especially needed. We must focus on employment-centred growth – decent work. Investment in clean and renewable energy is crucial for jumpstarting jobs and innovation. Where people go hungry, we must help people to help themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your investment in the European Union Food Facility, an amount of EUR 1 billion. We must put resources where they will have the greatest impact – in particular, the health and empowerment of women. Last month, we were able to generate USD 40 billion in pledges over the next five years for our Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health. This is the most stubborn of the Millennium Development Goals. Some might say, go for the easy wins, but I do not believe in declaring victory that way. We must strive for the hardest-to-reach goals and the hardest-to-reach people in the hardest-to-reach places. We can save the lives of more than 16 million women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second great challenge is climate change. Here, too, Europe’s vision and voice have been central.</p>
<p class="contents">Scientists warn that the extreme weather we have witnessed in many countries could be the opening act on our future. We have seen raging fires in Russia and epic floods in Pakistan. However, we must always be careful about linking specific weather events to climate change. Neither should we avert our eyes from what is plain to see. The message is clear: the more we delay, the more we will have to pay – in competitiveness, in resources and in human lives. We must take action now to reduce climate risks, strengthen our resilience, and support developing countries in pursuing clean energy growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Copenhagen was not perfect, but it provided an important basis for moving forward. Since then, there has been progress on important implementation issues, such as adaptation, technology cooperation, and steps to reduce deforestation. Movement has been slower on mitigation commitments, long-term financing, monitoring and verification, and the future of the Kyoto Protocol. At the upcoming UN Climate Change conference in Cancún, we must capture progress on those issues where there is consensus. On those issues still unresolved, governments must agree on how they will move forward to resolve them.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on all parties to show flexibility, solidarity, and muster the courage to compromise if needed. The health, security and prosperity of millions of people depend on it. There is no time to waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Most immediately, finance is crucial for building trust and spurring action. There is still a wide gap of trust between the developing and the developed world. The quickest way to bridge this gap is through providing financial support for those who do not have any capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon all developed countries, including those represented in this august Parliament, to provide their fair share of the USD 30 billion in fast-track financing pledged at Copenhagen for 2010-2012. Many view this as a litmus test of industrialised countries’ commitment to progress in the broader negotiations. We have also to generate USD 100 billion annually by 2020. This was a promise by the developed world made in Copenhagen. My High Level Advisory Group on climate change financing has been working this year and they will come up with several options as to how to generate USD 100 billion annually for developing countries by 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change is a crucial part of the broader agenda on sustainable development. That is why I recently established a new High Level Panel on Global Sustainability, co-chaired by President Halonen of Finland and President Zuma of South Africa. Their job will be to connect the many different dots which are interconnected, and to find the right path through the interlinked economic, social and environmental challenges of the coming decades.</p>
<p class="contents">In all this, Europe’s leadership – your leadership – will be essential. Europe has been a historic engine of growth and change. Now, when governments are not moving – when the train has hit the buffers in our talks on climate change or other issues – Europe can be the locomotive, driving it forward. You can push, you can pull and you can get the train back on track. You can keep us moving in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also advancing together on building not only a cleaner world, but a safer one. This is the third global challenge that I wish to bring to you today.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal of achieving a world free of nuclear weapons is a subject of great interest to the Members of this Parliament. I commend you for speaking out on disarmament issues, posing timely questions and urging new progress. Thank you for your resolution of April 2009 which supported total nuclear disarmament and cited the proposal for a Nuclear Weapons Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, there is new momentum in fulfilling disarmament commitments. This progress will continue if – and only if – the voices of the people are fully reflected in national and regional issues, and if the half a billion voices in the European Union speak out in harmony on this issue, joined by voices from other regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate and welcome your support for my five-point proposal on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and that of many leaders, including the Inter-Parliamentary Union. We are working to eliminate other weapons of mass destruction, curb trade in small arms and light weapons and counter the risk that nuclear materials could fall into the hands of terrorists. Let us move beyond our over-armed and under-developed age to a more secure world for all.</p>
<p class="contents">These are big challenges and great goals – diverse issues with a common denominator, namely, global solidarity. We rise or fall together, so we must guard against division – division around the world and division within communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost seven years ago, my predecessor Kofi Annan stood before you. In his address, he made an impassioned call for Europe to seize the opportunities presented by immigration and to resist those who demonised these newcomers as ‘the other’. I wish I could report, today, that the situation in Europe has improved over the intervening years, but as a friend of Europe, I share profound concern.</p>
<p class="contents">It is almost a cliché to say that the birth of the European Union ended centuries of war and brought lasting peace to the continent, yet it remains a profound truth and a beacon of hope. Europe has served as an extraordinary engine of integration, weaving together nations and cultures into a whole that is far, far greater than the sum of its parts. But for Europe, ‘winning the peace’ was the narrative of the last century.</p>
<p class="contents">The 21st-century European challenge is ‘tolerance within’. Inclusion and building diverse communities is as complex a task as the one Europe faced after the Second World War. None of this is easy. Migrants, whether from within Europe or beyond, suffer disproportionately from unemployment, discrimination, and unequal opportunities in schools and the workplace. A dangerous trend is emerging – a new politics of polarisation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Some play on people’s fears. They seek to invoke liberal values for illiberal causes. They accuse immigrants of violating European values.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yet too often, it is the accusers who subvert these values – and thus the very idea of what it means to be a citizen of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s darkest chapters have been written in language such as this. Today, the primary targets are immigrants of the Muslim faith. Europe cannot afford stereotyping that closes minds and breeds hatred. The world cannot afford a Europe that does this. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Modern Europe is founded on human rights and on the fundamental values of humanity. Our ambition therefore is for a united continent that is not divided by ethnic or religious differences. A Union in which all children, whatever the origin of their parents, have the same chance of success.</p>
<p class="contents">I have confidence in the European model, in a Europe that represents not only a geographical entity but also an ideal. We are going through difficult times. It is precisely because they are difficult that we must continue to show solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be equal to global challenges. I have mentioned three of them today: combating poverty, climate change and building a world without nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon you, Members of the European Parliament, to show leadership and solidarity both within and beyond Europe. As that famous man from Alsace, Albert Schweitzer, said, the first step in developing ethical rules is a feeling of solidarity with other human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not doubt that Europe, a symbol of solidarity, will show itself to be equal to it.</p>

The schemes of control in use by regional fisheries organisations should be transposed into Union law in such a way as to avoid the delays and legal loopholes which arise as a result of complicated procedures.

So-called non-standard jobs, whether in the services sector or in agriculture, are the first to be hit, particularly in a time of global crisis. As it is mostly women working in these sectors, layoffs mainly affect them. This is again an area where we must reject the apparent logic of the market, and in the name of fairness and in the name of supporting the purchasing power of the population and supporting demand, it is necessary to intervene positively and, for example, to end the practice of concluding contracts that do not stipulate working hours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Politicians should not interfere in the economy. Economic freedom is one of the characteristics of the common market. However, if the profit motive leads some companies to demand of employees that they work in hazardous and insecure conditions, law makers must erect barriers against this. We must finally acknowledge that the work of women in the home is also not properly secured. Insurance companies have already quantified this, and now it is the turn of the politicians. I would like to call on the Commission to put forward proposals for the recognition of the work of women in the home as a non-monetary investment in national prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Lithuania, the carriage of goods by sea constitutes just a small percentage of all goods carried and therefore, it is possible to achieve much more in this field. Furthermore, our coastal tourism sector also has great growth potential. By modernising goods transport logistics and promoting co-modality, i.e. combining various modes of transport within the same transport chain, we have the opportunity to increase the prosperity of the Baltic region. This is particularly important in order to maintain the future competitiveness of Europe’s ports, such as the Lithuanian port of Klaipėda. Closer cooperation between the Baltic countries will help bring them closer together and will make our region’s market more harmonious and accessible to the whole of the European Union. Currently, the Baltic countries are, to a large extent, isolated from the European transport network. It is hoped that traffic between the Baltic countries will double by 2020 and therefore, we must address the lack of suitable infrastructure and accessibility. Most importantly, we must ensure that data collection does not create an additional burden for Member States. We have nothing to lose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Denmark’s plan of action to help 951 people made redundant from 45 machine and equipment manufacturing companies in the small Nordjylland region falls within the same framework. In this case, 40% of the workers made redundant were skilled in manual work, metallurgy and mechanical construction, and 33% of the workers were classed as unskilled manual labour. This situation clearly shows the need for effective technical and professional evaluation of the people affected by this global crisis. I hope therefore that the European institutions will redouble their efforts in implementing measures that speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF, which currently has very low levels of mobilisation. This year, only 11% of the EUR 500 million available was requested. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 26 March 2010, the Netherlands requested financial assistance from the EGF for 512 of the 590 workers made redundant at NXP Semiconductors, which operates in the electronics sector in the NUTS II regions of Gelderland and Eindhoven. The total number of redundant workers is made up of 425 men and 87 women, which also includes seven workers with serious health problems or a disability (1.3%). The Netherlands stresses the major impact of these redundancies as NXP Semiconductors is the biggest industrial employer in the area, offering jobs to a large number of low qualified workers who have been employed with the company for several decades. The lack of job opportunities in similar companies in the region will pose a particular problem for workers with specialist experience in semiconductor production.</p>

It is therefore worth pointing out the importance of this plan of aid for 839 of the workers made redundant in order to mitigate the impact of the severe economic, financial and social crisis that this region is experiencing. I would also like to stress the importance of measures such as the certification of skills, professional training, incentives for job creation and the opportunity to gain new experience in the workplace. On the other hand, it is regrettable that in two years, this is only the second application that Portugal has submitted to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in order to receive direct support for workers in the Norte region. Faced with overwhelming numbers of unemployed and the impoverished state of public finances in Portugal, alongside the economic recession in 2011 under recent austerity measures, the government has a duty and obligation to act more competently in raising these funds to support unemployed workers in a concrete way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The low levels of education and training among the workforce in key sectors of production in Europe are a big problem in the light of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives.

<p class="contents">The current proposal aims to update EU regulations that transpose the monitoring and enforcement system adopted by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) convention. Such measures are aimed principally at promoting compliance by non-contracting party vessels with the rules of the convention, and including a new monitoring system by the Member State of the port. This prevents frozen fish whose legality has not been confirmed from being landed at European ports.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it establishes new measures that include the monitoring of vessels engaging in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activity. I believe that these measures will ultimately serve to protect European fishermen from the introduction of fish that do not comply with EU rules into the European market, and this is something to be welcomed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The quantities of fish caught are already increasing yearly and will therefore continue to grow. Studies have shown that increasing fish stocks in the oceans and inland waters are mainly a result of aquaculture. Increasingly, larger fleets are being used to attempt to catch fish from increasingly smaller stocks. In order to curb the merciless overfishing, it is important to introduce a control and enforcement scheme. Reports from fishermen who are held captive on the high seas like servants and have to work their fingers to the bone for extremely low wages in conditions that are akin to slavery are also cause for concern. If we want our descendants to know the taste of fish, controls are essential. For all that, at least a partial renationalisation of fisheries policy makes sense, in order for it to be possible for regional problems to be dealt with comprehensively.

Fish quotas and stock management are essential in order to prevent the complete overfishing of inland waters and oceans. However, in this regard, we must also ensure that organisations like the NAFO remain capable of action by virtue of a streamlined structure and good organisation.

The legislative framework should be adapted to the current situations that can lead to precarious working conditions, particularly involuntary part-time work and the fact that companies do not announce a lack of basic working conditions: a complete lack of job security, low wages, a lack of social protection and opportunities for career advancement, or even the lack of collective representation for workers. Initial and ongoing training, improved information on rights and a real examination of women’s professional and family life must be promoted, as opposed to these situations, because the way that women’s income is considered as a second income can be misleading, as it is often the sole family income. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is primarily women who work in precarious employment, who often do not even enjoy compulsory minimum social standards for workers. Women tend to take poorly paid jobs where they can reconcile work and family and consequently, they are forced to relinquish social guarantees and agree to poor working conditions. Social protection is an essential part of flexicurity. Therefore, in order to solve these problems, it is very important to encourage the Member States and social partners to align their legislative and contractual rules on working conditions. The Member States must reduce the double burden of work on women, one of the reasons for women’s over-representation in precarious employment. It is very important to grant all employees equal access to social services and benefits, including maternity leave, healthcare and retirement pensions, as well as to education and training, regardless of their employment conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The economic and financial crisis has undoubtedly worsened conditions for precarious workers, especially women, who bear most of the burden of precarious work. This is confirmed by recent data showing that in 55% of companies, only women do part-time work. It is also calculated that 31.5% of women work part-time, compared with 8.3% of men, and precarious work carries a higher injury rate and a greater risk of disease and exposure to hazards. In short, this is a situation of inequality to which the European Union cannot remain indifferent.</p>

The first concerns the issue of women’s work, which has been addressed from a modern, sustainable viewpoint in another dossier in this part-session. The second concerns the two-tier labour market found in many Member States, in which some workers enjoy rights and protection, while others are at the mercy of circumstances usually beyond their control. If we look at the data objectively, it seems increasingly evident that in the future, regular employment will also involve accepting greater risks than has been the case until now. Such change should, however, be managed to avoid speculation to the detriment of the weakest individuals in contractual terms, particularly those who find themselves in disadvantaged situations. The European institutions have a duty to avoid discrimination and to allow everyone to freely attain their own occupational targets, in line with their abilities, aptitudes and inclinations. I take this opportunity to point out that further research on precarious work by women would be useful for planning action aimed at removing obstacles, without being too invasive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, this is further evidence for the need to enhance maternity and paternity leave provisions to enable women and men to strike a balance between work and family commitments. Precarious work refers to a type of non-standard employment mainly characterised by little or no job security, low level of payment, lack of social protection rights, no protection against discrimination and a work environment without minimum safety and health standards. According to the latest available data, 31.5% of employed women work part-time compared with only 8.3% of employed men. Precarious work is not only a major cause of the gender pay gap between women and men, but also creates an obstacle to career prospects leading to better jobs and professional development, trapping many in low paid insecure work. Indeed, often, women from less developed countries come to the EU and work in low skilled jobs, or even illegal employment. Precarious work forms prey on the weakest sections of our societies, denying people dignity in work and the chance to build a decent life for themselves and their families. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also makes it more difficult for women to find work, and those who do have work are paid less than men who do the same jobs. The economic crisis has exacerbated these problems and shown the extent to which women are being exploited in the labour market. Short-term job contracts and part-time contracts with unpaid overtime are just some examples of practices which I consider unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is essential to draw attention to the need to comply with labour law on an equal basis for all employees.

It often happens that such women are less likely to be informed about their rights and end up being more exposed to the danger of losing any legal protection and being unfairly dismissed without any chance of appeal. This situation must certainly be brought to an end with respect for equal dignity, which should be granted to workers of all kinds.

In this regard, we must not overlook the fact that men are also affected by these forms of work, and there can be a risk of poverty even with full-time work. The local social systems and social measures are, however, designed to cushion the hardworking local population if the need arises. The report focuses far too much on women migrants, who often seem to find themselves in part-time work, and indirectly stipulates that the residence itself be supported. Women are certainly particularly affected by the false promises of traffickers, the problems of globalisation and – in the case of illegal entry – of new forms of slave labour in companies. Continuing to support imported poverty is not the solution. It only increases the social problems and may permanently jeopardise social peace. To reinforce this development is the wrong way to go. Ultimately, it is only locally, in other words, in the countries of origin themselves, that something can be changed.

<p class="contents">The financial and economic crisis has made precarious work an even more visible and urgent problem. Companies have made decisive cuts to temporary jobs and there is a fear that the jobs which have been lost will not be replaced. Unfortunately, the situation has had the biggest impact on women, and the problem is most visible in the services industry (hotels, catering, education, health, social work) and agriculture. Women employed in these sectors are not employed on a full-time basis, which means that their salaries and pensions are lower, they receive lower levels of social support and lack career advancement opportunities.

The problem of precarious work is rife among women, especially in the services sector and agriculture, and effective measures are urgently needed to change this situation. The underlying reasons are varied. The employment and pay gap between men and women is still far too large for us to claim that equality has been achieved, which is why certain effective measures, such as maternity leave, healthcare and old-age pensions, would be an effective way to halt the spread of precarious work. However, the starting point for getting out of this situation of employment inequality is surely education and training for young women.

The permanent jobs which have been lost during the economic recession will certainly not be restored, but will be replaced by atypical and very atypical labour contracts. This will result in a sharp deterioration in the level of working conditions. Across the EU, 31.5% of women work part time (30 hours or less per week), compared with just 8.3% of men.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the sustainability of the pension system, loan facilities for self-help projects and job creation and alternative income creation schemes can improve conditions for precarious women workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the European Commission and Member States to devise viable strategies on precarious work, with the focus on creating decent, green jobs and incorporating the principle of gender balance. I urge every Member State to introduce clear measures to reduce the gender pay gap by 10% by 2020, including the pension gap, in order to improve living standards, fight poverty and boost economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The economic crisis has contributed to destabilisation of the labour market. Employers have reduced employment or have employed temporary workers, offering them inferior financial terms. The waves of redundancies, too, have meant that many people have found themselves outside the labour market. The situation is particularly difficult for graduates, older people and women. The crisis has exacerbated the gender inequalities that already exist in employment. This has been particularly felt by women, who comprise the greatest percentage of workers engaged in what is known as precarious employment. The earnings gap has become wider, and inequalities in social protection have become greater. This situation has also hindered the professional development of women and has contributed to the consolidation of gender stereotypes in relation to work. Therefore, women working in what is known as precarious employment deserve special protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst other things, they should be covered by social insurance systems and legislation on job protection. Also important is financial protection for women in the event of unemployment or maternity. Women working in precarious employment should also have the option of unionised protection. Furthermore, women working exclusively in private households should be guaranteed free access to advisory services in the area of social rights. I would also like to draw attention to the necessity of regulating the legal situation of seasonal workers, who, in relation to the nature of their work, are more at risk from a variety of irregularities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sidonia Elżbieta Jędrzejewska, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(PL)</span> We are meeting, today, to talk about the European Union budget for 2011. The year 2011 is an exceptional budgetary year, for several reasons. Above all, 2011 is the fifth year of the multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013, so we already know a good deal about how this multiannual framework is being put into effect, which parts have been a success and which have not, and many programmes are already at a very advanced stage in terms of their life cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, much has happened in the European Union, for we have adopted the Treaty of Lisbon, which imposes or assigns new fields of competence to the European Union. I will permit myself, here, to mention several of these, in particular, those which are expensive, namely the new fields of competence in the areas of policy for combating climate change and energy policy. It also opens up new fields of competence for the European Union on the global stage, so we are talking, here, about the establishment of Union diplomacy, and there are new competences in terms of space research and in terms of sport and tourism. Unfortunately, none of these new roles is accompanied by appropriate financial means. It is somewhat true to say that the European Union has new ambitions and new plans but does not necessarily have the new financial resources needed to put these plans and ambitions into effect. This, then, is what 2011 is like.</p>
<p class="contents">In the opinion of the European Parliament, the European Commission programmed operations wisely in its draft and allocated appropriate resources for 2011. The Council – we have already discussed this, here – has reduced those resources. I would like, briefly, to present what happened in the Committee on Budgets during our reading. As a reminder: the new Treaty of Lisbon also introduces a new budgetary procedure. We no longer have two chances. Neither the Council nor the European Parliament now have two readings. We have only single readings, which is why both arms of the budgetary authority need particular effort and discipline, because, in fact, each of us has only one chance. I repeat: we no longer have two readings.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to vote tomorrow, and we are going to give attention to the position drawn up by the Committee on Budgets. It is important to emphasise that what the Committee on Budgets has drafted is a position which respects the multiannual financial framework. In contrast to previous years, the European Parliament will adopt its reading, which does not go beyond, in terms of planned amounts, the multiannual financial perspective. This position is innovative, but is equally a position which includes and takes into account the concerns and the situation in which the Council finds itself. The situation where, in Council, seven Member States rejected the Council’s position has not escaped Parliament’s notice. We have listened to and taken into account the fears of certain Member States and of the Council as such. We have taken careful note of the Council’s position, and therefore Parliament’s reading is disciplined and does not go beyond the multiannual financial framework. On the other hand, however, we cannot, of course, remain indifferent in the face of the facts about which I spoke earlier, namely, that we have new areas for which the European Union has to take up responsibility, but that these areas do not have appropriate financial provision. What is more, the Council has committed itself to a considerable number of measures related, for example, to bananas, with compensation for banana producers associated with the ITER and other programmes, which require new financial resources but which have not been provided with new financial resources. Apparently, they are to be financed from current resources. It is here that, as the European Parliament, we have doubts.</p>
<p class="contents">What we would also like to communicate in our reading is, above all, to emphasise once again the triangle of priorities, the triangle related to youth, education and mobility. The European Parliament has been saying since March that this will be our list of priorities for 2011 and that we would like those budget lines which favour youth, education and mobility to be appropriately funded, so that resources will also be found for innovative undertakings in the field of mobility, youth and education. The same concerns programmes related to research and innovation. We know there are not sufficient means in the current financial framework, which is why we have made the painful – although, in our opinion, essential – cuts to the ITER programme. I would very much like this reading of Parliament to be seen as disciplined, but also as a reading which enables the financing of the European Union’s commitments for 2011. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Helga Trüpel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner Lewandowski, ladies and gentlemen, we have just heard the rapporteur for the Commission’s budget talk about the major challenges that we face. I will now speak as rapporteur for the Parliament’s budget and for the other, mainly smaller, institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The political conflict that we have to deal with – and this applies not only to Parliament’s budget, but equally to the Commission’s budget, too – is as follows: with the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has gained fields of competence in connection with energy policy and foreign policy and the power of codecision with regard to agriculture. We have more to say in respect of policy relating to sport and space. To put it plainly, our competences have increased, and that is a good thing. We have always fought for this as committed European parliamentarians. However, at the same time, we have a situation in the Member States that has forced them into austerity measures and debt reduction policies, and therefore between these two major goals – on the one hand, we have new tasks and, on the other, we must show that we understand the pressure that the public budgets are under – we have to find a political line. That is exactly what I have tried to do as rapporteur for Parliament’s budget, namely, to find a genuinely fair balance between the new competences, and thus our new work requirements and requirements for additional staff, and the need to send out a signal to the citizens of the European Union and to the governments that we also want to practice self-restraint and self-discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bureau has put forward proposals, as that is its job, with regard to what costs should be increased in Parliament’s budget in order for it to be possible to work properly. We have now taken the decisions in the Committee on Budgets concerning appropriations, which, at an amount in the region of EUR 25 million, is below that originally proposed by the Bureau. That means that we intend to limit our travel costs, the amount allocated for studies, the funds for security here in this House and for information technology, and we will make fewer posts available for the library services. We have a conflict and that relates to the question of how much money there should be in the near future for MEPs’ assistants. The proposal is that, for 2011, this money should be increased once again by EUR 1 500. I would like to say quite clearly that as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I do not support this proposal. I think it is excessive at this point in time. In the Committee on Budgets, the majority agreed that we need more information and that this money will initially be held in reserve, in other words, not released, but that more policy decisions will need to be taken with regard to whether we now want to release this money or whether we consider it to be a wiser policy not to make this money available for 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it is very important to me – because, of course, we have a considerable interest in making our European institutions environmentally friendly and, as far as possible, changing our own behaviour – that we have called for a new, more environmentally friendly approach to mobility. For example, there is to be a ticket for local public transport in Brussels, and that is to be negotiated further. It would be extremely good if we could significantly limit our driver services, but this also means that here in this House in Strasbourg, we should make more bicycles available for the MEPs and staff, so that we can get around in an environmentally friendly manner here in Strasbourg as well.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point that is extremely important to me is the fact that we have tried to find a good balance with a majority in the Committee on Budgets. We did not only consider our own interests as representatives of Parliament and increase our budget responsibly, but, of course, we also had to look at the other small institutions: the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, the Court of Auditors, the European Data Protection Supervisor as well as the European Ombudsman. What we have done in this regard is to take a responsible position so that we have not only made more staff and resources available to ourselves, but that we have also, in a very targeted way, granted the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee a certain increase in funds, albeit not everything they asked for, because, of course, they too have greater labour requirements on account of additional competences resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon. Particularly in the case of a small institution like the European Data Protection Supervisor, which is very important in connection with many of the debates that we are conducting at the moment on how to deal with data protection in the digital world – and this important institution is still in the process of being established – it is right to accommodate it to the extent of granting it two new positions. In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, we would make it clear that the Committee on Budgets tried to take a very responsible line between well-founded increases which we support, and which we also have to justify to the Council because we want to do a good job here, and an understanding of the fact that a certain degree of self-restraint is definitely called for at the present time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue involves a promise made by the Commission some years ago to provide reasonable compensation for banana producing countries, and we must keep this promise. The only slight problem with this is that when the Commission made this decision and this announcement, it did not discuss it with any of the branches of the budgetary authority at the appropriate levels, and has still not managed to come up with a proposal acceptable to all parties affected. The sum involved is EUR 300 million, of which EUR 75 million would have to be paid from the 2010 budget. The question is where it should come from. And this is where the Council and Parliament still disagree, after two unsuccessful trialogues.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately it has not been possible to reach anything close to an agreement, even though a compromise is definitely needed, because these payments would be made to countries in situations which, in all fairness, clearly need this compensation. We cannot reach an agreement with the Council, however, because in our view, this is, in fact, a new task which is not included in the preliminary draft budget, and we invented an instrument called the flexibility instrument for precisely this type of situation. This is what it is meant for, to resolve problems such as this one, and it has an appropriate legal framework as well as funds ready to be mobilised. However, the Council was of the opinion that given the current state of affairs, Member States are not willing to mobilise this instrument, as it would require further payments, and national budgets are in no position to make them. In Parliament, however, we held the view that our existing programmes which are already under way are not in a position to allow for funds to be taken away, and we failed to arrive at a compromise solution. Therefore, to my greatest regret and with the support of the vast majority of the Committee on Budgets, I have to propose to Parliament that we, the Parliament, also reject amending budget No 6, the Commission’s motion for compromise tabled before us, which has not been adopted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in this debate, I am also supposed to be given the floor on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development. Let me combine these two speeches and say that I would like to pay tribute to the Commission, as it has done all that it could, in full compliance with the rules and upper limits specified in the 2011 budget. We all know that the European Union is underfinanced. The funds required to perform tasks should be increased. However, we also need to know that we are short of funds, and we have to manage available funds in a better way. In terms of regional development, it was very painful for us to see that the Council has also withdrawn or cut back regional development expenditure. What we have seen is the greatest reduction in payment appropriations in the history of the past ten years. In our view, it will be impossible to function like this. Therefore, what will follow now is a reconciliation meeting, where positions will hopefully get closer, and we will also have an adequate budget for the banana producing countries. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We welcome, of course, Parliament restoring the general level of the draft budget both in commitments and in payments – i.e. the gap of almost EUR 8.62 million in commitments and around EUR 3.6 million in payments between the Parliament vote and the Council vote.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the revised forecast, we are almost sure that our programming was right, that the special cohesion funds are moving at cruising speed at this point of the financial perspective and the bills are to be paid next year, so we are restating our forecast for 2011. Having said that, I would also like to draw your attention to the need to restore the draft budget for the agricultural clearance of account. Maintaining the cut would effectively leave part of the forecast for agricultural expenditure uncovered.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the amendments by Parliamentary committees in this respect. The line taken by Parliament, as indicated by rapporteur Jędrzejewska, is very clear. This is on horizontal amendments and political priorities placed in the forecast in heading 3b on youth and youth mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments above the draft budget are also proposed and some of them could be implemented if there were a legal base. We will send our letter of executability on both these amendments and also on the pilot projects and parliamentary preparatory actions that were voted in parliamentary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret that a significant number of reserves have been inserted by the Parliament. Both the size of the reserves on salaries (EUR 75 million, of which EUR 41 million are not related to the 1.85% salary adjustment) and the number of conditions attached to them – sometimes not even related to staff issues – are worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">We are doing our best to meet the conditions and the reserves could be lifted at the latest during the conciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission appreciates Parliament’s approach not to go above the ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. This has been done at the cost of some cuts for ITER, for example, where we need more money and not less, and for external actions were we need more money and not less.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this as an invitation to debate and it will be settled at the moment of conciliation of the global package.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer also on this occasion to amending budget No 3, already discussed by rapporteur Surján. This is about banana accompanying measures and so far, the Parliament rapporteur has reconfirmed the position of Parliament which is very distant from the position of the Council. The Council is for redeployment, Parliament is for the greater use of flexibility instruments, but here again, the credibility of our institutions vis-à-vis the ACP countries is at stake. We should therefore look for compromise in the coming conciliation process.</p>
<p class="contents">As usual, the draft budget will be accompanied or is already accompanied, apart from the amending budget for this year and the amending budget for bananas next year, with an amending letter on the External Action Service, an amending letter on the new supervisory agencies which are already politically agreed, and tomorrow, the Commission will adopt and transmit to Parliament an amending letter which is the usual updating of estimates for agriculture and fisheries agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I know that the institutional dimension should play a big role in the forthcoming conciliation. We owe it to our citizens to compromise and to prove that the Lisbon Treaty is working to their advantage in clearing up differences using the complex machinery of the European Union. So I am going to play the role of honest broker in anticipation of the final agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I heard the end of the Commissioner’s speech. I have also been briefed on the rapporteur’s speech. It is true that here, obviously, I am going to limit myself to informing you of the main themes of the Council’s position, and it is, of course, within the conciliation procedure, which should take place in the event of your Assembly voting for all of the amendments – one never knows – that we shall be able to refine all the political positions. I am therefore going to speak with regard to Parliament’s amendments and with regard to the amendments on which Parliament is preparing to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, I shall take this opportunity to tell you about some preliminary reactions and also to remind you of the Council’s concerns in the context of this 2011 budget procedure. I must, first of all, stress that this budgetary procedure is taking place at a time when we are emerging from an economic crisis, and, even if the European budget can and must help in emerging from this crisis, we must not lose sight of the considerable budgetary restraints that affect our national budgets. Obviously, this calls for strict control over expenditure. It is in this context that the Council attaches the greatest importance not only to respecting the ceilings of the various headings in the multiannual financial framework but also, and above all, to maintaining adequate margins to be able to cope with unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the Council welcomed the restraint shown by the Commission with regard to commitment appropriations in its draft budget. On the other hand, we are obviously much more concerned that the European Parliament amendments would considerably reduce some margins.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, the Council obviously regrets the increases in the level of payment appropriations that Parliament intends to vote for, all the more so since this level of appropriations exceeds the Commission’s draft budget. The level of payment appropriations must be sufficient but without being overestimated and must take into account past implementation and real needs for 2011. At all costs, we must avoid sending out the wrong signal at a time when Member States’ public finances are recovering. I would remind you also that within the Council, because of these difficulties, it was possible to strike a balance by a very narrow majority only on a rate of increase of payment appropriations of 2.91% compared with 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to draw your attention more specifically to certain points. The Council has taken note of the European Parliament’s intention to keep within the ceilings of the various headings of the multiannual financial framework, but it cannot accept that the approach taken in relation to commitment appropriations should be at the expense of important programmes, particularly under heading 1a, concerning competitiveness for growth and employment, and also at the expense of matters under heading 4, concerning the European Union’s role as a global player.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, may I say that I am surprised by the European Parliament’s proposed reduction in appropriations for the common foreign and security policy at a time when every effort is being made to set up the European External Action Service swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, the Council is surprised by the decrease in appropriations for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project in 2011 while we are still working on how to free up the resources to meet this project’s financial difficulties in 2010, in 2012 and in 2013. The Council has taken note, however, of the European Parliament’s priorities on youth, education and mobility and may consider these priorities in the context of a global agreement. Proposals will be made in the forthcoming discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards payment appropriations, I would like to convey to you the Council’s concern as to the actual absorption capacities under heading 1b, in relation to cohesion for growth and competitiveness. If the European Parliament’s amendments restore the draft budget and thereby increase the appropriations, this could give rise to issues about absorption of these various appropriations. Indeed, I would like to point out that the Council has accepted an increase of 14% in the payment appropriations, following careful consideration of the Commission’s proposals and taking into account the implementation rate of appropriations for 2010, as that is the best basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise one last point concerning the European Parliament’s intention to create eight new budget lines without any appropriations in relation to, on the one hand, expenditure in connection with implementing the Treaty of Lisbon and, on the other, revenue in connection with its own resources. I think that the 2011 budget is not the place to translate into a budgetary instrument the conclusions of those important debates and difficult decisions that will have to be made for the future financing of the European Union when the next multiannual financial framework is negotiated. It is a long and complex debate and a solution cannot be found within the next few weeks in the relatively restricted context of the 2011 budgetary procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I note, however, and this is quite understandable and to be expected, given Parliament’s new powers, that various other topics have been included in the political discussion concerning the 2011 budget. Some are directly linked with the budget for this year or for the following years, until the end of the multiannual financial framework 2007-2013. In particular, ITER is at stake, as well as completion of the process of adopting the rules for administering the multiannual financial framework under the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, and on these two issues, we must reach an agreement. The Commission made proposals that were broadly accepted by the Council. It will very shortly be discussing a proposal from the Presidency on the delicate matter of flexibility, a subject that I consider to be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to other issues, such as that of taking the opportunity of this adaptation to increase noticeably the budget resources of the multiannual framework to take into account the new allocations resulting from the treaty, realistically, I have to say to you that this will not be possible beyond the Member States’ current financing level. The need to emerge from the crisis and national budgetary policies, which, to a large extent, are influenced and controlled by the European Union, do not allow it.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be other issues, as we know, during the course of these negotiations. The Commission will emphasise these in its communication on the budget review. The Council is, by nature, a body that listens, considers and tries to provide answers. It will obviously not behave otherwise in the context of this discussion. It will listen to the proposals and will form an opinion. Then, of course, there will come the time to answer these questions and to take decisions. Since these are complex issues that will require substantial mechanisms and resources, we know that the answers will not come within the context of the 2011 budget discussion, but will come in the debate on the next multiannual framework. Naturally, however, with some of these problems, one can expect the Council to be ready to introduce some initiatives or to express comments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to end by pointing out how important it is to reach an agreement on the 2011 budget within the next few weeks. To that end, the Presidency will continue to make an active contribution to the excellent climate of cooperation that has prevailed hitherto, and I think that for European citizens, it would be particularly damaging to the European Union’s image not to be able to reach an agreement on this first budget to be put to the vote in the era of the new Treaty of Lisbon.</p>

<p class="contents">Although, in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we have exercised moderation and we are aware that the appropriations under heading 4 are increasing substantially above the average, we consider them to be insufficient for guaranteeing a consistent, visible and effective foreign policy that is in line with the ambitions introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also surprised that the Council is expressing surprise at some of the tactical cuts being proposed by Parliament, given the significance of the cuts, both in terms of compromise appropriations and in terms of payment appropriations, which the Council itself has introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Committee on Budgets, represented here by its Chair, for putting the appropriations for the new positions in the European External Action Service in reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, Mr President, this does not mean that we should not have a positive and constructive attitude, but obviously, in the conciliation process, Parliament has to be firm, very firm, in demanding its priorities, with the objective and aim of having the capacity to produce a budget for 2011, just as the President-in-Office of the Council has just said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The recent flooding in Pakistan has demonstrated once again that a rapid, effective reaction is called for – and not by dipping into the budget as an emergency measure, but instead by means of a structural amount for humanitarian aid.

The first of these is the level of errors which occur during budgeting and realisation. Two areas which are particularly important are external action and structural funds. Another matter which, for us, is crucially important, is the sums which are allocated in the traditional way using a criterion based on evaluation of the effects of funds used. This second aspect is very often lacking when budgetary decisions are being made. The third area is the harmonised budget, for example, the cohesion fund and trans-European transport networks. It seems that, in shaping the budget, we are using too little European methodology and too much national fragmentation of the budget. The final factor related to the budget is a request to take account of such information as the national reports on realisation of budgetary objectives for the last year. At present, fewer than half of the Member States submit these reports, and the reports which are submitted are prepared using very different methodologies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to increase the number of students in vocational training who can get traineeships. We want to get more adults into EU-funded further training.

<p class="contents">The first point concerns Europol, as our committee has restored its budget, given the cuts proposed by the Council, and we have also proposed an increase of EUR 500 000 so that it can tackle the responsibilities that have arisen as a result of the entry into force of the second version of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme.</p>

<p class="contents">We have also decided to put the appropriations destined for the second-generation Schengen Information System to be put in reserve, on the condition that they are release once we obtain the necessary information on the steps that have to be taken in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As we consider them to be of the utmost importance to the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, we have also proposed re-establishing the appropriations for the three funds aimed at immigration and integration: the European External Borders Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals.</p>

I understand Member States’ aim to cut costs by trying to reduce their budget deficit as much as possible, but many of the cuts proposed by the Council are unfounded. We must not forget that the European Union budget objectives are different. EU budget money is directed to our future investments. How we overcome the crisis will be dependent on that money being properly distributed and used. Energy, innovations, scientific research, education and mobility are the foundations for our economic growth and the creation of new jobs.

She has done an excellent job and, in the main, we are, in fact, in agreement in the Committee on Budgets, even though there are some areas – and I will come back to this – where we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have a slightly different view.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well aware of the crisis situation in the Member States’ finances. In spite of this, we essentially defend the EU’s budget, even though we are now keeping to very low levels, particularly when it comes to new policy commitments for next year, where Parliament, too, is keeping its increase below a rate of 1%. This is very modest.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards payments, the rate of increase is higher and that is also reasonable. To now try to keep back structural fund payments would directly affect those countries with the greatest problems in terms of jobs and growth. We need to remember that countries such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Latvia are all net receivers of the EU’s budgetary resources. Cutting the budget will not benefit them. We must not forget that.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, then, we are being restrained. Viewed over the last 20 years, the EU’s budget has actually increased more slowly than those of the Member States. That is something that we should not forget either.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we Social Democrats do not accept the view that austerity measures are the only way to deal with the crisis. We are therefore fighting for an increase, especially in category 1a, which includes investments, research and development and labour market initiatives. There must be an increase here. However, we are not in complete agreement with the Council and the Commission with regard to the ITER project. We are in favour of this project, but it must not be the only priority when it comes to research and development. It must not be allowed to supersede everything else. Therefore, if we are to proceed with ITER, we will need to carry out reviews and more money will be needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, and just as importantly, we need to maintain solidarity during this crisis. If the hardest hit by cuts in the structural funds are those who really need support, then the policy is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we also believe that a certain increase is justified on account of the Treaty of Lisbon. The EU will have a number of new tasks in relation to the External Action Service, new financial institutions, energy and the climate. We cannot assign new tasks to the EU and then not pay for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention the foreign policy budget, which is clearly underfunded. If we are to be able to afford to provide aid to Palestine and find the necessary funds for enlargement, we need more money. Therefore, it was also important to us Social Democrats to tie in the 2011 budget with a debate that has a more long-term perspective: about own resources, the budget ceilings for 2012 and 2013, and the financing of the new financial support mechanism. In order to achieve this, I welcome the Commissioner’s mention of flexibility as a possible solution. I am absolutely certain that we will not succeed in these budget negotiations if we cannot in some way either review the budget ceilings or utilise the flexibility instrument. I believe that this is absolutely necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Jensen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Mr Wathelet, Commissioner, the axe of cutbacks is swinging through the public budgets in most of the Member States. So, should we not rein in the EU budget? Yes we should, and that is also what we are doing to some extent. That is the common theme set out in Parliament’s proposal for next year’s budget. We have kept below the ceilings set in the multiannual financial framework, but this will only be possible by making cuts in definite priorities and in international commitments. Otherwise, we will not be able to get sufficient appropriations for research, energy and aid for Palestine. In specific terms, we have had to make cuts in appropriations for the ITER Fusion project, in the common foreign and security policy, and in aid for banana-producing countries and cooperation with newly industrialised nations. I think this reflects the fact that the multiannual financial framework is too restrictive, and I would like once again today to express my regret that the Commission has not, as promised, provided a genuine mid-term review of the framework. We need to review the financial perspective up to 2013. Otherwise, we will run into problems. The Commission has just given us a communication on the budget review in which it sets out the lines for several years to come, but it does not explain how we will be able to make ends meet in 2011, 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would like to thank Mrs Jędrzejewska for her expert management of the vote on the budget. We are happy with the result. We would have liked to have seen a few different figures in parts of the agriculture budget. We did not want EUR 300 million for a dairy fund. We should also help to sort out the accounting clearance problem. We voted wrongly in this regard. There are also a few places in Parliament’s budget where we would also have liked to have seen savings, but, all in all, we are happy with what we have in front of us now, and I look forward to constructive negotiations with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that Mrs Trüpel has done a tremendous job, a truly outstanding job, enabling even budget veterans, those who have been drafting budgets for years in this House, to work under new conditions – those of the Treaty of Lisbon – with a single reading. In any case, an excellent job has been done – thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">This has also been a marathon in which our group chairs – there is only one of them left in the Chamber now – all took part at some point. At times, we were a little afraid that things would turn out badly, but fortunately, that was not at all the case, thanks to our rapporteurs and to our President. It may be unorthodox, but I should like to commend his work also. We have benefited from the fact that the group chairs wish to table with us an ambitious budget and, above all, to forge a link with the follow-up, with what will come afterwards, in the Special Committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 (SURE), and in the context of the forthcoming budgetary perspective, because, clearly, the 2011 budget is one thing, but what comes afterwards is far more significant. I am delighted that together, we, the group chairs and the Committee on Budgets, have reached an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We will see! The fact remains that, for the moment, we have a parliamentary position, and having heard what Mr Wathelet had to say about the Council’s views, I obviously have some concerns about what awaits us in conciliation. It will not be easy because, between the requests made by the Council and those made by Parliament, we will struggle to come to an agreement. I am counting on you to help us in this matter and to come up with a truly ambitious budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Those in the Council who are criticising, for example, the increase in payment appropriations, are being unfair to this budget. These are past commitments; this is a question of credibility: when we pay what we said we would pay, we are simply doing what we ought to do, even if it goes beyond the payment appropriations. I think we should be careful not to miss the point here.</p>
<p class="contents">While we will support the resolution tomorrow, I think there are some inconsistencies in this budget, and I would like to highlight what I consider to be two of the main ones.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, we all voted on this major resolution on the 2020 programme, in which we decided to include items such as the greening of the economy, support for renewable energies, green technologies and so on, and everything that creates work and jobs. It was from this point of view that, in order to formalise our intentions, we tabled an amendment specifically to ensure that sustainable development criteria are taken out of the LIFE programme but included in all the other areas. I believe that that amendment will be rejected tomorrow. Nevertheless, I invite you to support our amendment so that sustainable development criteria are about action and not just talk.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the second contradiction: the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). ITER’s budget has been reduced by 45 million. That is something, at least. Above all, however, there were attempts to take that money from agricultural policy; fortunately, it was not taken from there, but from research, which is not much better. Here again, I am referring to what Ban Ki-moon was saying to us this morning. He called on us Europeans to be pioneers in the field of renewable energies, to strongly promote new types of energy and not those of the past, not those that earn money first and foremost for shareholders but fail to help European consumers or future generations of Europeans, who are going to have to continue to manage the issue of waste. This all or nothing strategy with regard to ITER – one which will ultimately cost EUR 1.5 billion – is, in my view, a big mistake, and I believe that we are not doing what we said we would do in the 2020 resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, to conclude, there are a few timetabling issues: we also have economic governance, the winding-up of the Council’s task force, and the Commission’s proposals; a great deal of work will be required to link up this budget with future budgets and the financial perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have given Europe the Treaty of Lisbon, and this treaty gives the citizens more of Europe. I would like to say very clearly that we must not say we want more Europe while not giving more money for this. This is the point from which I would like to begin. We cannot say honestly that we want more Europe but that we do not want to pay for more Europe. Europe costs, and if we look at the structure of expenditure on the European budget in the structure of expenditure of the biggest contributors, we see that spending on Europe is not a major cost. I would like to raise yet another matter, as a representative of Poland and as a representative of Central and Eastern Europe: all funds which go towards the development of our region, which is a huge consumer of goods developed and produced in Western Europe, and all money invested in the new countries of Europe, is money invested in the future of Europe. A wealthier Central and Eastern Europe and greater wealth in the new countries of Europe will also bring benefits to those countries of Western Europe which we hugely respect and which are net contributors to the European Union budget. In this debate, too, we need more European solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not a discussion between accountants, but a matter of plans and choices for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The view of the governments is very simple: they are all submitting to the new Brussels Consensus. At a national level, budgets are subject to a single watchword: austerity. At a European level, the result of this is very simple: the residual budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to the Council that the crisis is not over yet, but in the meantime, social measures are indeed all being withdrawn at a national level. The crisis is not over, but our national budgets all point to salaries being frozen or reduced, reductions in pensions and increases in the most unfair tax of all: VAT.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the governments are refusing to give one more euro to the European budget. Their proposal is EUR 3 billion less than the one that we are here to discuss today. However, we should be aware that the proposal that we are here to discuss is also a timid one that lacks any courage.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, what we needed was a European budget that could compensate for policies at national level, with clear investment aimed at job creation. We needed a European budget that counteracted the negative effects of budgetary policies at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">This was not an option. The governments are transferring new competences to Europe without transferring resources, thus cutting the links, and yet they are able to propose increases which can only be explained by their being in the pocket of lobbies. Such is the case with the EUR 350 million in funding proposed for the Institution of Nuclear Fusion, an investment which is seriously dubious in the current climate.</p>
<p class="contents">The real rationale at stake is, however, this one. At national level, budgetary discipline is based on stupid penalties like those that the Franco-German communiqué is attempting to state and ratify today. At European level, it is a residual and mediocre budget that is chronically underfunded.</p>
<p class="contents">At this juncture, it is therefore extremely important to discuss the European Union’s own resources and the need for a tax on financial transactions at European level, which would allow a modicum of justice in the economy. Europe is now desperate. This is the Europe where general strikes are taking place in Greece, Spain and France, even on this very day. Portugal and Italy will also see strikes next month. We owe Europe, the Europe that is fighting and desperate, a response based on justice, investment and job creation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Those who defend the increase argue that extra funding is required to cover the new competences arising from the Lisbon Treaty. In fact, I do not remember having heard – or anybody mentioning at the time of ratification – that there would be any cost associated with Lisbon, or what this cost would be. Not even today do we have a clear idea about what the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty will cost the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also alleged that austerity is not the right answer in times of crisis, and that it is necessary to spend more on education, renewable energy, etc. Looking at the underspend for the past few years, it is clear that the EU does not succeed in producing an efficient budget. This failure is linked to the irregularities identified by the European Court of Auditors every year. Yet again, the biggest increase that is being proposed – a 17% increase – goes to the Cohesion Funds, the area where the auditors report the highest number of irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">If I find it stunning that in times of crisis, this EU is looking to increase its own budget, I find it more difficult to explain that the European Parliament wants to double its own entertainment budget. Are we saying that the UK is axing child benefits and university funding, postponing school-building schemes and making other painful cuts just to fund more champagne and oysters for the European Parliament? Is it reasonable for the UK to make military spending cuts while its net contribution to the European Union will increase from around GBP 6 billion to GBP 8 billion in the next couple of years? This is simply unacceptable for the British people.</p>

Whilst the people at home are uncertain about their jobs and incomes, and are waiting for inspiring politicians to economise where possible and invest where absolutely necessary, the Commission and Parliament have actually managed almost across the board to increase expenditure on all kinds of useless and unnecessary hobbies.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst Commissioner Barroso is calling on Member States to economise, his Commission and the European Parliament are increasing the budget for 2011. You cannot take this seriously any more; yet it is happening. This House seems not to realise what really preoccupies the citizens back home. With a single positive exception, it is one grim, grey, costly being.</p>
<p class="contents">Ah, some in this Chamber are thinking, it is only that strange Party for Freedom (PVV) that is talking – and it is true, Mr President, that we hold up the mirror and say, ‘Is it necessary to squander our citizens’ money on expensive official cars, including for private use? Is it necessary to plough money into celebrations whilst Europe is in the midst of a deep economic crisis? Is it necessary to create an expensive External Action Service when all the Member States are perfectly capable of doing that themselves? Is it necessary to keep pointless expensive committees alive and send yet more money to Yemen and the Palestinian territories?’</p>
<p class="contents">It is only the PVV. Yet make no mistake: the PVV no longer stands alone in Europe. We fight for the citizen, and want to be a voice in this costly circus. I am proud of my country and its citizens and shall continue to speak out, because it has to be said, and because I want to. Therefore, we shall be voting against the 2011 budget.</p>

I am well aware that this intelligent ambition is possible, since the EU budget continues to amount to about 1% of gross national income.</p>
<p class="contents">This budget also clearly demonstrates the need to revise the multiannual financial framework, given the tight margins for its items, and particularly for items 1A, 3B and 4. It is also clear that a debate on the need for new resources for the Union budget is urgently required.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of policies and programmes agreed by the EU institutions is assured, against the will of the Council, which is proposing swingeing and arbitrary cuts in both payment and commitment appropriations that are not in accordance with financial and budgetary management. Worst of all, they call into question the implementation of initiatives and investments which constitute gains and added value for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is just as well – and congratulations to the rapporteur – that we are making a priority of policies concerning young people, education and mobility. We have increased funding for the lifelong learning programme, the PESSOA programme, the programme for the mobility of researchers, the Erasmus Mundus programme, and the Competitiveness and innovation framework programme. As for the mobility of youth employment, I would like to emphasise the pilot project in which I was personally involved: ‘Your First Job Abroad’.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I cannot neglect to stress Parliament’s objective of legislative excellence, which was combined with accuracy, as evidenced by the cut of EUR 25 million in this budget compared with the initial proposal before the meeting with the Bureau. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every budget is difficult, but against the backdrop of cuts in Member States, perhaps this budget is more difficult than normal.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the coalition government in the UK will tomorrow announce savage cuts of around GBP 83 billion which will affect every single person in the UK. We believe that is too quick, too soon and too much.</p>
<p class="contents">We all, however, know we have to be careful with EU spending and therefore we need to make sure that the EU spends its money wisely. We also need to ensure that the EU and the European Parliament are able to carry out their responsibilities and that we are able to fund our priorities – priorities such as the Structural Funds and research and development which benefit individuals, communities and SMEs right across the EU. All these things will also help us grow our way out of deficit and debt. These items should not be seen as unnecessary spending, but as investments in our future.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst Member States want to cut their way out of the crisis, we believe we can help create a different strategy: a strategy based on growing our way out of difficulties such as debt, deficit and growing unemployment. Because we need to find funding for these priorities, we need, of course, to monitor unnecessary spending and administration costs. When extra spending is justified, we should support it. Let us remember that some of the extra expenditure the EU now has is the result of decisions supported by Member States, such as the External Action Service and the creation of three new financial governance agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Where spending is unnecessary, we should oppose it. This is true for the general budget, as well as the budget of the European Parliament. The rapporteur has already given some examples of areas in which we have made efforts to make savings in Parliament’s budget. I will just give one: releasing the reserve on the second tranche of EUR 1 500 per Member per month. We need to get the full costs involved in employing extra staff before we consider releasing the reserve, and I would hope Members would support that view.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also hope that when they vote tomorrow, Members would look at every single amendment carefully to ensure we have the right balance between investment and carrying out our responsibilities as a Parliament, and careful public spending. I am sure every Member would want to ensure that the EU adds value to Member State spending, as well as to individuals and communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would hope that in the conciliation meetings, the Council will recognise that it needs to look not just at cuts, but also at investments and growth for jobs right across the EU, which we desperately need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, who led the negotiations extremely well.</p>
<p class="contents">These are difficult economic times we are experiencing at the moment, a fact to which my fellow Members have borne testimony. On behalf of my group, I was responsible for what were termed ‘other parts of the budget’. In difficult economic times, it is easy to end up with a symbolic debate on Parliament’s own costs and cost increases. It is easily interpreted as populistic, but as my fellow Member from the United Kingdom pointed out, while assistant costs and the costs of the President’s representation are certainly not especially large if we consider the big picture and the EU budget, they do have a symbolic significance. We should probably look at our own costs and refrain from increasing them during difficult economic times.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the draft budget in general, I would like to express my criticism of the Council. I understand that the Council wanted to make certain cuts in this year’s budget. It is completely logical for us not to want a 6% increase, for instance, but, at the same time, it is not particularly consistent of us to make cuts in research and development and innovation when, as recently as last spring, we agreed, together, on the Europe 2020 strategy, in which these areas were the key focus. Thus, the Council’s priorities for the 2011 budget seem to be somewhat illogical.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the debate about own resources, there are many of us in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe who very much welcome this debate. It is necessary. We are currently having a kind of arm wrestling match over the financing of the budget, which is not particularly constructive. It is good that we can now discuss other models for safeguarding the future EU budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our rapporteurs have done some very good work on behalf of the European institutions, for which I thank them. Our Parliament has managed to resist the pressures to impose budgetary austerity at the expense of our priorities, particularly in the area of sustainable development. We welcome some of the amendments that have been approved.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Corsican Member, I therefore welcome the fact that European funds are henceforth available to the threatened languages in Europe, regardless of their status within their Member State. We believe, also, that this EU budget raises debates which are essential for the future of Europe. The vote in favour of the 2011 budget is, as far as we are concerned, a first step. Parliament’s work is only just beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must make our new powers work. The Commission and the Heads of State have received interesting signals in this respect, notably concerning the ITER project.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must initiate a discussion, and consequently establish a balance of power, for our resources to be increased on the occasion of the forthcoming multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020. We need the Union to have its own resources such as a tax on financial transactions or the introduction of a European carbon tax.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2011 budget therefore introduces debates explicitly, even if they are only written in symbolically. Through this budget, Parliament has taken the measure of its new responsibilities and is preparing for debates which will determine the future of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The global financial crisis has revealed the deep structural weaknesses of the European development model, based on high taxes, high fiscal redistribution, inflexible labour markets and unnecessarily extended welfare provisions. Now it is time to rethink and restructure fiscality, not only at the national level, but also at the European one.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2011 EU budget shows some signs of austerity but does not go far enough in structural change. This is related to the fact that many people think that quantity is quality, namely, the bigger the spending, the better its impact on the European economy and society. Moreover, they demand additional funds because the Lisbon Treaty and the Europe 2020 strategy imposed new mandates on the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a fundamental misunderstanding in this concept. The EU budget is small compared to national ones – and rightfully so. It does not need to grow in order to perform its functions. What matters most is the structure of the budget and the effectiveness of spending. Sharp focus on innovation, R&amp;D, higher education, selected areas of energy transport, agriculture and rural development will do. Our budget is completely dissimilar to national budgets, which have very little discretionary spending. We do have a lot of discretion. The EU budget should be regarded as a capital budget, rather than a current one. It should focus only on investments in the common European future.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our group feels strongly that the EU budget does not need to grow. It never substitutes the national budgets representing national sovereignty. There is no need for an EU-wide tax. Taxes at the EU level would not substitute, but inevitably supplement, national taxation, increasing further the tax disadvantages of the European area compared to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The ECR says no to bond issuance as well. Debt securities imply debt and would open the door to deficits building up debt. We have enough debt at the national level and even more unfunded liabilities. We do not need additional layers of debt which would destroy the future of European youth and make Europe’s terminal decline irreversible. The ECR agrees with the priorities of the 2011 budget as stated by the rapporteur – youth, education and mobility – but, if we take these goals seriously, it logically follows that what our young people need is definitely not a greater fiscal burden in the age of adverse demographics, but more solidarity and investment in our common future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An urgent mid-term review of this financial framework is therefore needed, as others have said here. However, the proposed budget again falls short of the amount agreed in the multiannual financial framework. Faced with the ever-worsening crisis, unemployment and living conditions for millions of people, all of us are thus once again aware what the much-vaunted European solidarity really means for some.</p>
<p class="contents">Either the budget is a tool for solidarity, reducing inequalities, promoting economic and social cohesion, employment and social progress, and thus serving the interests of workers and the people, or rather it is a tool for inequality, furthering neoliberal causes, job insecurity, unemployment, foreign interventionism and war, and thus an affront to the interests of workers and the people.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also the message pervading the growing struggles throughout Europe. At the very outset, the smallness of this budget compromises its redistributive role, makes it devoid of justice, and exacerbates the pernicious effects of the policies that the EU has been pursuing.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, we would like to say that there is an alternative to this budget, and one that is not only possible, but also increasingly necessary. To this end, the various proposals that we have made include the creation of a European programme for employment and sustainable development, affecting 1% of EU gross domestic product, with additional capital from the Member States. The aim of this would be to achieve real convergence, promoting the potential of each country, the sustainable use of its resources, investment in production and the creation of jobs with rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament, on the other hand, is opting to increase the European Union budget for 2011. There is no justification for the fact that the rapporteurs at a high political level are still being accused of proposing excessively low amounts of money.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Parliament has been expressing its wish for the European Union to be more independent in the collection of its own resources. The principle of Member States financing the European Union is thus under fire. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is proposing a financial transaction tax (FTT), the proceeds of which would go to the EU budget. However, an EU tax would be undesirable. If a tax on banks were to be introduced, the proceeds would have to go towards paying off the high levels of public debt in Member States. After all, it is they who have had to spend large amounts of money on bailing out the banks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has had more responsibility and more legislative work. First of all, I would point out that the EU budget currently amounts to a little over 1% of GNI.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on three points in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the EU 2011 budget has set priorities, which need to be strengthened in light of the economic problems throughout Europe following the structural crisis of recent years. Above all, the reduction in the current level of unemployment in Europe must remain at the centre of our efforts, for example, through investment in the economy, industry, tourism and energy and climate policy, and by safeguarding existing jobs and creating new ones. In this regard, I am thinking, in particular, of the priorities of youth, education and mobility. We must give our attention to programmes like the lifelong learning programme or the Youth in Action programme. They support the EU strategy for economic recovery and the EU 2020 strategy. With better education – particularly education that provides them with qualifications – considerably better opportunities on the labour market will open up to young people. Erasmus not only facilitates the acquisition of languages, but also mobility – which is essential in an age of globalisation. However, with regard to mobility, young people are also required to take responsibility, and this programme ought to be utilised a lot more.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the main goal of the common agricultural policy must continue to be to maintain market stability and food security.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, my third point is that money is tight in these difficult economic times. As I have said many times before, we need to streamline bureaucracy in every possible area, and we need to find synergies with the Member States and utilise them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We understand, Minister, the positions of governments.</p>
<p class="contents">In all the countries, brave and unpopular policies are being implemented to reduce deficits which have become unacceptable. The European Parliament has lent its support to these policies. In a context such as this, we cannot ask Member States to increase their taxes or their debt to fund a significant increase in the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, for the first time in 20 years, the European Parliament will not vote for any amendment that exceeds the ceilings of the current financial perspective. Similarly, where the Council has reached a symbolic increase of 0.2% of commitment appropriations, the Committee on Budgets proposes 0.8% in current euros, that is, a reduction in volume. As for payments, Minister, the European Parliament will listen carefully to the Council whose clear message has been understood.</p>
<p class="contents">In return, the European Parliament expects a similar sense of responsibility on the part of the Council. The Treaty of Lisbon confers new or greater powers on the European Union: a common energy policy, a common foreign and security policy, a common immigration policy, a common space policy, etc. Would it be responsible to have the citizens believe that these policies are to be implemented without devoting a single euro to them before the second half of this decade? The ambitious Europe 2020 programme was adopted unanimously last July by the European Council. Is it responsible to turn up six months later without the slightest idea about how it will be funded? We observe that the financing of the European budget by levies on national budgets has led today to a political and financial deadlock. Would it be responsible to refuse to develop this system further?</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, negotiations on the 2011 budget, the first budget under the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, should also be accompanied by a political agreement to guarantee the future funding of the Union’s policies, agreement on a review of the financial perspectives from 2012 to supplement the funding of projects already under way, such as ITER or Galileo, and to start to fund new powers from the Treaty of Lisbon and the priorities of Europe 2020, along with agreement to open the debate on the reform of own resources. Parliament called for this reform three years ago. We are pleased that the Commission is taking some timid first steps in putting on the table some of the possible options.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us agree to work on this together, between the three institutions with the help of the national parliaments.

The European Parliament fully recognises this particular point.</p>
<p class="contents">During the discussions in the Committee on Budgets, we adopted a very responsible attitude and we did not do what is the most normal thing for every single member of every parliament to do, which is to ask for more resources, as we then come into conflict with the representatives of the executive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, we recognised that in the climate of an economic recession where national budgets are under the constant pressure of restrictions, the European Union’s budget must set an example on this. The appeal from Member States, which reflects that from European citizens, is for every opportunity to be found for prudence and greater efficiency when spending public resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We found every opportunity to increase efficiency. The outcome of this is what we proposed. For the first time ever, the European Parliament is being so responsible right from the start of the budget debate. At the same time, I expect that the Council will also assess its positions once again.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that there are limits to increased efficiency. A reduction in resources means a reduction in political ambitions. What kind of signal is the Council giving by proposing a drastic reduction in resources in paragraph 1a? These are the resources specifically intended for innovation and smart growth, which also provides the basis for all the national programmes for exiting the recession and for the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">How can these objectives be achieved with the budget being reduced? This means in practical terms that we are rejecting a number of Europe’s priorities. When are we honest with European citizens? When the Council officially announces new policies, grants European institutions new functions or when it is not agreed for resources to be reduced?</p>
<p class="contents">During recent years, the European budget has been an increasingly smaller part of the EU’s economy. At the same time, there has been an increase in the number of functions invested in the European Union. Consequently, this raises the issue that the budget is a basic instrument for achieving certain political objectives. It is not an end in itself. The European budget provides added value to taxpayers. It achieves much more than can be achieved with the same resources if they are spent by 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">A direct connection cannot be made between European and national budgets. The current reduction in expenditure in national budgets is a consequence of their increase last year. This did not happen with the European budget, which is much more stable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As many fellow Members have already said, it would seem that we are using the equation ‘more money equals better policies’. However, I believe that precisely the opposite is true, in other words, that better policies justify more money. It needs to be the case that the money we make available is spent in an efficient way. Regarding that as an essential criterion, together with the corresponding controls, will also lead to success. There is no point in us financing sacred cows such as the agricultural budget and structural and cohesion policy if we do not, at the same time, reform and modernise them. Many of my fellow Members have said – and I absolutely agree with them – that we need to focus on the areas of research and development, renewable energies, energy security and educational mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the subject of discipline, allow me to return once again to the agreement reached in Deauville, because discipline is something that we must also expect from the Member States. The news service AFP quoted a French representative: ‘There are Ayatollahs in Germany who take a Prussian hard line on such questions’, he said, referring to the unyielding position of the German Government. Personally, I doubt that the French representative of Europe has such a <span class="italic">savoir vivre </span>belief that money that we do not have should be given out freely and future generations be made to pay for debts incurred today. I cannot believe that that is what the Member States want to do, and it is also high time we demonstrated that in the relevant budget negotiations by showing the discipline that we called for and displayed in May. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At a time when the British Government is proposing the most wide-ranging budget cuts in a generation we, as Conservatives, have been calling for a freeze on European spending. We believe that the European Union budget must be used to add genuine value in areas such as securing economic growth now, and recovery in the future, stability in the EU and around the world, reducing global poverty and fighting the shared challenge of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have tabled amendments to the budget resolution where we want clarification in three specific areas: on the costs, for example, of Parliament’s external offices in the Member States; disquiet about non-governmental organisations’ funding, on which we would like a report from the European Commission; and last, but not least, the generous pension arrangements in the Staff Regulations, including those for retiring Commissioners. These are issues on which we want clarification in the months ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the broader view, we have had a press release from the European Commission this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we believe that this is not an opportune moment to think about additional own resources in the midst of the worst financial crisis in the last 70 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, Mr Commissioner, while saying ‘yes’, we need more flexibility, and ‘yes’, we want to have more emphasis on the results and the inputs, how is that compatible with calling for a 10-year financial perspective when we see the results of a mid-term review are entirely fruitless in this kind of exercise that we are going through? We cannot set figures in stone ten years ahead when we do not even know what the European economy is going to look like in two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as far as my country is concerned, our net contribution is rising by 60% in the next two years, but we have had no concomitant change in the CAP. Why should it be any different this year? We should be calling for a net cap on our contribution until we have a fair system for the EU budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also know that the nature of the budget is dictated in essence by the financial framework 2007-2013. Thus, from a political point of view, it is an inflexible tool. However, what we fail to grasp – if I may say so – is the following absurdity: throughout the biggest of financial crises, to which families and workers, small and medium-sized enterprises and young people have fallen victim, all the proposals made, from the Commission through to the Council, are confined to incentives for private sector companies. All these years, surely it is the dogmatism of the so-called free market and the ambitious Lisbon strategy which have been to blame for acute unemployment and the increase in poverty and underemployment? Where have we got all these years by putting the focus on equipment and a strategic approach to international regulations, which is maintained in the proposed budget? If the existing model is a failure, why not propose bold social change?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to draw your attention to the problem of the people who went missing in Cyprus following the Turkish invasion and events between 1963 and 1967 which led to the partitioning of the island. We welcome the fact that the European Parliament has again approved an appropriation of EUR 3 million for the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus. This will be a matter for both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. However, I must stress that Turkey needs to allow the fate of our missing persons to be cleared up in a systematic and dedicated manner and to provide all the information which is classified as military secrets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each Fleming makes a net contribution of approximately EUR 290 per annum to safeguard the functioning of the European institutions. We Flemings are the champions among European taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I consider it particularly unacceptable that, as early as the first paragraphs, the present report wags a finger at people who dare to ask questions – justified questions – about the magnitude of the European Union’s contribution and about the benefit of much of the European Union’s expenditure. It is anything but certain that taxpayers’ money is spent any more efficiently at European level than at levels closer to the taxpayer; indeed, the reverse is true.</p>
<p class="contents">The way in which the EU administrative colossus is still being enlarged is also unacceptable as far as I am concerned, particularly now that princely salaries and allowances are being paid in all those European institutions. This is not to mention the European subsidies; for example EUR 1 billion per annum for NGOs, to whom scarcely any efficiency criteria apply.</p>
<p class="contents">All the EU Member States face having to make huge fiscal efforts and economies. We might expect much greater efforts on the part of the European Union, but evidently we consider ourselves a cut above the riffraff.

<p class="contents">We are debating the 2011 budget at a time when we are consolidating public budgets. Even though the structure of the European budget is not, of course, at all comparable with the structures of the national budgets, we also need to be restrained, and we must nevertheless talk about areas of focus for the future. This is indeed where the balancing act lies. The refusal of the Commission and the Council to carry out a review and revision would <span class="italic">de facto</span> result in a late entry into force of the budgetary aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon. At a time of globalisation when it is a question of the economic and political survival of the European Union, this is not an adequate response to questions concerning the future. In the conciliation, we will finally have the opportunity, I hope, to talk sensibly and equally about added value and subsidiarity, about positive and negative priorities and, at the same time, about the urgent political requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside this, we also need to discuss adjustment of the budgetary interinstitutional agreement (IIA). We need to agree on a procedure for how we will, in future, discuss and decide on the multiannual financial framework together. We need more flexibility on the basis of points 21 and 23 of the IIA. Furthermore – my apologies Commission – if your document states that the utilisation of the EU budget for the stability mechanism represents an innovative use of the EU budget, I would say that, in principle, this represents a circumvention of Parliament. That is something that we will also have to work on.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a final and very important comment to make to the Council. You are complaining that we have made reductions in connection with ITER. However, we want a reliable multiannual solution for ITER, but you should not complain about current cuts while the management structures of ITER are poor. This needs to be sorted out first and then we will find a sensible solution, but not one that is divided into small portions and distributed over three years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It seems that the instructions from the Council and the Commission are to look after the new priorities but cut the previous ones. We do not agree with this attitude. Moreover, I believe that it can only have two explanations: either there is a lack of responsibility for the actual decisions that have been made, or we could believe that there is an anti-European feeling that is more or less disguised.</p>
<p class="contents">To those in the first category, I would say that when one accepts a commitment, one should then fulfil it. We cannot, therefore, agree to the most recent need being dealt with 100% while we forget about those which are apparently less current.</p>
<p class="contents">As for those whose sole objective is to cut the European Union budget, I would ask them to think twice. I know that some people are doing this because they do not believe in European integration. In fact, some people, as we have unfortunately seen in this House, do not like the idea of building anything together. They prefer to work for themselves, without caring about their neighbours. However, for now, they are in a minority.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the Conciliation Committee will have to take a decision, and we agree on the fundamental issues. We, too, want to finance the international thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER). The question is, how? Do we fund the new priorities by cutting the previous ones, as the Council and Commission want us to do, or do we do it properly?</p>
<p class="contents">We reached an agreement and found EUR 1.8 billion for the European Economic Recovery Plan. Why do we now have to cut the framework research programme in order to fund the ITER? Let us be consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot announce the Europe 2020 strategy amidst a great deal of hype, seeking sustainable growth from an economic, social and environmental point of view and attempting to achieve what the Lisbon strategy failed to achieve, and then immediately go on to cut, for example, research expenditure, in order to fund other research expenditure. They are justifying this to us by saying that we are in an era of cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the thing is that they cut the budget every year, and the current financial framework was adopted in 2005 when we were in a period of economic boom! That is why we are arguing over a few hundred million euro: because of their lack of ambition in 2005 and because we are in a period of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">They should not tell us that the treasuries of the Member States are going to go bankrupt due to the efforts that we are asking for. I just want to point out that we are talking about a budgetary effort equivalent to 0.003% of the Union’s gross national product. I think that is quite acceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot, however, content ourselves with a recession budget, in which we would have to go back on our common commitments, and possibly our international commitments too.</p>
<p class="contents">What is especially worrying about the Council’s cuts has been the fact that they are targeted, among other things, at research and development, as mentioned previously. Just because the Member States want to see economic growth and less public debt, that does not entitle us to let our priorities go to waste. While the storm rages, we need to be able to look to the future more determinedly. This has proven to be a good formula in my own country, Finland, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon objectives mentioned the figure of 3% of GDP as the target for research and development. At present, it stands at around 1.9% in the EU as a whole. An increase of 1% has been estimated to create up to several million jobs. We thus have every reason to try to achieve this very important and ambitious target.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the 2011 budget, which is being put to the vote tomorrow, shows that the Committee on Budgets thinks it important that we also try in future to create growth via the regions. That is why the Council’s cuts in regional development are completely untenable. I would hope that the Council also appreciates the importance of regional policy and its strong link to the Europe 2020 strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, we must try to take the following action. First, the European Parliament must take into account the real economic situation in the Member States – the fact that, in most states of the European Union, the economy is either declining or stagnating, and that in only a few countries is it growing. We must bear this fact in mind, and we therefore cannot ask for an increase in European spending in a situation where resources are scarce. Second, the European Parliament must continue the tradition of balanced management of European budgets. It is good that we have balanced budgets, and that we do not have to face the necessity of bailing out our debts like almost all the Member States. Third, the European Parliament should discuss the budget in such a way that we can proceed to approve it as usual at the final plenary session before Christmas. The certainty of the approved budget is important for economic stability in Europe, and we should be able to support it in this way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my view, the starting point for European action on the budget must be the concept of European added value, which, as you know, means that Europe’s spending must generate clear, visible benefits for the Union and its citizens. In that respect, it should be emphasised that the introduction of new policies and the enhancement of powers already recognised throughout the Union, such as the results of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, have made it plainer than ever that an adequate budget is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the European budget should remain large enough to achieve results that could not be accomplished by means of any other spending at national or local level. That is even more important at a time of crisis like now, when the Member States are committed to the difficult task of keeping spending under control and balancing their own budgets, and when the Committee on Budgets has given ample proof of its careful and responsible policy by keeping within the limits of the multiannual financial framework for the first time in 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has decided to follow the Commission’s initial position in many respects, while also providing for a number of increases to finance its own priorities proposed since March 2010, such as youth, mobility, research and innovation. It has therefore eliminated the cuts proposed by the Council, which were often applied indiscriminately and even in key budget lines, as in the case of the accounting clearance under heading 2, revealing a lack of clear, reasoned political decision making underpinning the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe the budget for the common agricultural policy (CAP) needs to be kept at its current level, particularly in view of the next revision of the CAP, due after 2013, which will require an adequate level of funding in line, therefore, with the amount provided in the current budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very happy to offer the PSE Group time because this is a rare case when the European Socialists, the ITRE Committee and the Committee on Budgets unanimously agreed. So I can speak as whatever. The unanimous agreement is there.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Chapter 1a and Chapter 5 on R&amp;D management, we all think that it is just not acceptable to have the cut Council introduced compared to the Commission draft proposal. Cuts are simply not acceptable in the fields of economic recovery and economic stimulus, any policies regarding entrepreneurs and SME policies on the Digital Agenda, innovation policies, R&amp;D policies, space policies and programmes like ITER.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget has to be in line with the fine words of our treaty and of our policies like EU 2020, the great Innovation Union, digital access to all, the Next Generation Network, and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">Our words have to be in line with the numbers provided in the budget. So the budget has to be in line with the challenges of the global world in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">We can stop Europe, but we cannot stop the world developing and there is therefore unanimous agreement in our committee – first, to ask for the budget to be restored to the Commission proposal – which was already a compromise because we would have needed more – and then, to find additional resources for the new policies under the Lisbon Treaty, namely the space policy and ITER.</p>
<p class="contents">The show must go on. We are prepared, in the conciliation procedure, to find a compromise which is best for European citizens living in the 21st century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we do want, however, is for the funds to be spent much more shrewdly, in a way that enables us to really achieve European added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Council has not done so. On the contrary, it has maintained the very areas where the future does not lie – agriculture and cohesion – and is economising on knowledge, innovation, sustainability and energy: the very investments that will determine our competitive position in the future. I am not surprised, therefore, that no less than seven Member States voted against the Council common position.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, the budget is cast in stone and we, Parliament, have virtually no flexibility to shuffle things between chapters. The Council, too, has already complained about this. It is also very regrettable that the review of the current financial perspective is only ready today, much too late to introduce that flexibility. The result of all this is that, as far as I am concerned, Parliament has no choice. We do have to increase the necessary investments in knowledge, innovation, sustainability and energy, resulting in a larger budget; but the Council leaves us no choice.</p>

I would just like to draw attention to the fact that the most effective and the strongest anti-crisis instrument which we have available is the common market. A sustainable common market can be achieved faster by using investments in the area of cohesion policy and with structural investments. Therefore, please do not seek cuts in those areas where we are not dealing either with social aid policy or with the squandering of money but with investments which are helping us to gain all the benefits from the common market, a market which we enlarged in 2004 and 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one more thing. We are talking, today, about the new budget in the context of building diplomatic institutions.

You presented a figure of minus 2.77%, but that is pure nonsense to the national parliaments that are unfamiliar with this. In other words, you have made cuts where there was too much money on the line anyway, and afterwards the European Parliament, which is trying in good faith to cancel these cuts, becomes the villain, so to speak, and gets the blame for this. That is all rather ingenious, but much too transparent for you to be able to succeed in this. As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I cannot see any sign that the Council is interested in an EU budget that is better in the long term. Where then is our joint monitoring and where is our joint budgetary control? As far as the Council is concerned, that is not working out.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to request – and here I am appealing to my fellow Members in particular, because tomorrow we will also be talking about the reserves – for us to refine our control mechanisms. My concern here is, above all, the administrative budget, simply because the focus is always very heavily on this in the Member States, too. Since 2007, we have had screening of staff in the area of administration and in the area of coordination. We must continue to carry out this screening. We have once again created a reserve for this. The Commission has 100 official director-general posts – 100 since the summer. According to its own benchmark, however, it is only permitted to have 87. Another reserve will serve to demand that the Commission go back to its own figure of 87. We have said that we need better monitoring of the implementation of EU law in the Member States, because compliance with the law is a cornerstone of the European Union. There is also a reserve for this. We need to ask ourselves what will become of the Directorate-General for Development with the establishment of the External Action Service, and what will happen to the EuropeAid Cooperation Office? Many people are sitting around there, and if we are not careful, just as many people will still be sitting in the delegations from the Commission as from the External Action Service. So far, we have only achieved an increase in efficiency in the External Action Service of 1%, whereas the target is 10%. Here, too, we would have a rewarding joint task, which I warmly invite the Council to carry out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The latter scenario is due, in particular, to the fact that the Member States would not invest savings, but would have to use them to reduce debt, whereas the European budget is largely an investor. Thus, if we want to achieve the goals that are set here every week, we need an ambitious budget, and that means not less money, but more money in future. In this connection, I believe it is important to emphasise that the national budgets and the European budget are complementary to one another.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the Member States behave as if money that goes into the European budget more or less disappears into a large black hole. That is not the case; it is invested in goals that we have previously agreed on here. We therefore also need, as Mr Böge proposes, a critical examination of the medium-term financial programme. This, of course, can only serve to show that the Council cannot say ‘yes’ to the Treaty of Lisbon while, at the same time, putting forward one or other project for financing and then saying: but you will not get any money for its implementation. If it is not possible, then we will resort to the necessary deletions of the budget lines that Parliament does not regard as priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we will have this discussion again and again while the EU does not have sufficient funds of its own. What is important – no, essential – is that these own resources do not impose an additional burden on normal wage earners. As a Social Democrat, I am in favour of the introduction of a financial transaction tax, because in general, this will not affect normal wage earners and it will help to put the brakes on the financial market. We firmly believe that those who triggered a crisis, the like of which we have never seen before, and the costs of which we all have to pay out of the public budgets of our own Member States, should be called on to compensate for these losses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All European governments, without exception, are being forced to reduce state spending. This applies not only to the much-discussed situation in Greece, which has managed to reduce its budget deficit for the first six months of this year by 46%, but also to the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and all the others. Incidentally, the European Commission itself frequently says to the Member States: ‘Tame your public finances quickly!’</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore consider it quite unreasonable that, at a time of persistent economic crisis, the European Commission has proposed once again to increase the European budget for 2011. After all, Europe must save too. For obvious reasons, of course, there is no agreement on where to make savings. In my opinion, it should not be in regional policy, but rather in European administration, promotional costs and costs relating to the Brussels bureaucracy, which come to almost 7%. It is administrative expenses which traditionally lead to most disagreement, and in this respect, unfortunately, my perception is different from the majority in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Faced with the crisis, many governments think of an economic governance model based entirely on stability mechanisms, which means cutting their national budgets and perhaps also the European budget. We, on the other hand, think that a stronger European budget, supported by own resources and also a financial transaction tax, is a precondition for effective European economic governance and for greater discipline in national budgets. We must therefore decide which way to go, and to that end, the amendments that the President-in-Office of the Council has considered inappropriate are, in fact, extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the greatest disagreements concern the figures, of course. In this respect, I would urge the Council to make up its mind, because it cannot want to keep strictly to the margins and, at the same time, expect Parliament not to bring its own priorities into play. The Treaty of Lisbon is quite clear on this: the Council is paramount as regards the quantity of spending, whereas Parliament has the last word on the quality of spending. Thinking about heading 4, we are not against increasing funding for the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) or for the Industrialised Countries Instrument (ICI+), but we do not want it to be at the expense of our priorities: first Palestine and then development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council therefore has three options to choose from: it can accept Parliament’s priorities, or it can agree to a revision of the margins, or it can accept greater flexibility of the budget and in the budget, in the knowledge that Parliament will stand united in defence of its prerogatives and priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am pleased with Parliament’s 2011 draft budget, which is being discussed today, as it dwells precisely on the stated priorities, and I congratulate the rapporteur on this. For the first time, Parliament is on an equal footing with the Council on these matters. This is the first budget following the Treaty of Lisbon. For this reason, and due to the crisis that Europe is experiencing, it is important that the reconciliation process is successful.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that the EU is given a budget for the implementation of priority areas and the new powers that were bestowed upon it by the treaty, such as energy, space and foreign policy. It is important to fight for our convictions; for a budget that is visionary in a time of crisis. Parliament’s proposal reflects this ambition. Only by strengthening these areas, such as science and innovation, and by contributing to economic growth and to more and better jobs can we make Europe a more attractive place to live and work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So everyone agrees on the diagnosis, but clearly we are not in agreement about what we need to do to extricate ourselves from this financial deadlock. As what was short-term has lasted, the Union budget has become a prisoner of national contributions, which make up almost 75% of its resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, if we decided to raise the expenditure ceiling to the maximum threshold allowed by the treaties, this would mean an additional levy of more than 5 billion for countries like France and Germany. Everyone here clearly agrees that this is not possible. It is not a question of stepping up discipline, as it is the people and, principally, the poorest people who pay the highest price for the consequences of these national austerity policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering that the financial sector bears the main responsibility for the crisis and explosion in public debt, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament proposes that a line of ‘own resources’ should be created funded by a financial transactions tax; this proposal was rejected within the Committee on Budgets by the right, which may make up for it tomorrow and bring its actions into line with the numerous statements they have made to the media in favour of this measure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a little more than two years since the fall of Lehman Brothers, and Parliament must not pass up an historic opportunity to create the foundations for a new development model, based on more lasting resources and certainly ones that are more just in terms of redistribution of wealth and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first budget voted on under the Treaty of Lisbon, this would send a strong political signal from our Parliament, which does not intend to make do with using its new codecision powers to manage penury, that is, to choose which of Peter or Paul is to go without clothing. Giving oneself the means, starting tomorrow, to increase the size of the Union budget, is to give oneself the means to pursue ambitious economic recovery, research, industrial, and employment policies. Let us not fail to grasp this opportunity that European citizens expect of us and which, in any case, the financial operators are expecting of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Negotiations on the 2011 budget are being conducted at a particularly difficult time. On the one hand, several Member States are pressing for cuts, due to the economic crisis while, on the other, there are already significant shortfalls in important budget sectors, such as growth, employment and foreign relations. The economic and social crisis has hit the whole of Europe and the only possible response, therefore, is a European response, via a Community budget which has all the necessary means at its disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we socialists tabled proposals for a more ambitious approach than that taken by the Council in terms of commitments, especially on employment, innovation and research. Commitments are an expression of the level of the EU’s political ambition. Its budget is a budget which supports investment. It cannot be seen as a burden on national budgets; on the contrary, it represents added value to the budgets of the Member States. It is an expression of solidarity between the Member States, especially in times of crisis, when the EU budget can play a decisive role in combating the economic situation throughout the European Union, especially in the Member States facing the biggest difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result of the economic crisis, we have 25% less in the regional budget than last year. We should not therefore wonder at the voices from the regions talking of the need to cut the European Union budget as well.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we all surely know that the funding of many policies is cheaper and more effective if we avoid fragmenting our forces and if we finance them from a common European budget, and not from the budgets of the Member States. These are the resources we are looking for. Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon has an impact on the work of several European institutions. Already in negotiations on the budget procedure for 2010, we agreed that we would preferentially use the reserve in heading 5 for financing costs arising from the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">As the main rapporteur for the European Union budget for 2010 for the other institutions, I asked the Council in the trialogues on 30 June to take a stance over the amending budget relating to the consequences of the Treaty of Lisbon for the European Economic and Social Committee and for the Committee on the Regions. The Council has so far failed to take a position on this budget. This approach is creating serious problems in respect of the fulfilment of roles for which the institutions are responsible. The solution, unfortunately not until some future date, could be to revise the financial instruments, as the same approach which applies to the budget must also apply to the amending budgets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the second point relating to European statistics, the Council has been trying for years to brush these aside to a certain extent and to avoid them. Today, we can see that putting more money into European statistics would have been a sound investment.</p>

<p class="contents">Ninety six per cent of the modest increase for 2011 is concentrated in the area conducive to growth and jobs. These are bills to be paid, a sort of legal obligation. What is more, it is filling the gap in investment, a shortage in the credit market at national level where investment is the first to be cut. Therefore, I think there is added value in these very modest increases and the measure of responsibilities, considering the project is EUR 4 billion below the ceiling agreed in 2005-2006 for the year 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">What should be known is that 6% out of the total is administrative expenditure out of a budget equal to 1% of GDP. That means that 94% is delivered to the beneficiaries. That should be known when discussing the future of the European budget.</p>

I am simply going to reiterate a certain number of principles that I had come to raise here in the debate when we presented the Council’s budget. It should be stated again that all the appropriations adopted by the Council are based on the implementation of the 2010 budget, and that, for all lines, in fact, provision has been made for a number of amendments by way of letters of amendment within the framework of the implementation of the 2011 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We are living through difficult times, where growth in budgets is limited and, as you are aware, the increase of 2.91%, which was agreed on within the Council, was won by a very, very small majority. The scope for additional or other kinds of majority is virtually non-existent. We should therefore be able to keep the opportunity open, over the year, to develop the budget by letters of amendments, in the course of its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Heading 1b has often been mentioned. I remind you that the Council pledged, in a statement, to ensure that the development of the implementation of budget 1b was evaluated, and that is why we wish to stick to this and to witness this reality and its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as I said in my introduction, the debate on the 2011 budget will not be linked solely to the 2011 budget as such. The other elements linked to the budget will be subject to debate. We are going to have a discussion on the budget review. Evidently, all the questions raised within the budget review, and particularly those concerning own resources, will be the focus of debates that we must have together. Another item within the budget review, the question of flexibility, for example, will be a topic that we must debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, by ensuring that we have this global debate, we shall be able to show that the 2011 budget, on the basis of this new Lisbon procedure, will be a success, and I simply remind you that if we fail to reach an agreement on the 2011 budget, the perspectives for additional spending for 2011 will be even smaller and will not match what the Council is proposing today. We should be well aware of all these elements to ensure that this first Lisbon-procedure 2011 budget is a success, one that we shall achieve together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, the reading of the 2011 budget, a budget which the European Parliament will adopt tomorrow, is a very disciplined reading. For the first time for many years, the European Parliament is not proposing anything more than what was planned as far back as in 2006 in the multiannual financial framework. It should be stressed that this is a somewhat exceptional situation and a sign of our discipline as the European Parliament. We understand, too, the Council’s doubts. I would like to stress that the European Union budget is not a budget of the same kind as the national budgets. It is a budget which is directed towards investment and it is an anti-crisis tool. It is worth taking advantage of the opportunity it represents. I would also like to point out that, of course, as general rapporteur, I hope we will be able, by working together, to adopt the 2011 budget successfully and efficiently, and I hope we will adopt it in such a way as to be able to implement Union policy from the beginning of January in accordance with what was decided in 2006 and in accordance with what we have been working on, too, for the whole of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council should take note of those matters to which we have given additional emphasis in our reading of the budget. It is questionable whether we should add new roles and new ambitions if there is not a readiness to accept new financial obligations. As far as the Council is concerned, I appeal to its President, who is present today, for the Council to note the good will of the European Parliament in our reading. I hope that during the Belgian Presidency, the Council will manage to obtain greater support for the original idea of the European Commission concerning the 2011 budget and its proposals. What all this is about, and what the European Parliament is proposing, has not simply been pulled out of a hat, but is the effect of our earlier work, and I think that much of the Council’s scepticism is, in fact, the result of the fact that the Council adopted its reading in a written procedure, because it is much easier to be negative in writing than during oral discussion. I am hoping for open and direct dialogue which will allow us to adopt a reasonable and sensible budget for 2011. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to point out once again that I believe it is right for us to have indicated our willingness to put our expenditure under the microscope, but that we, of course, should ask for what we need to meet our new requirements with complete self-assurance and fight for it so that we will also have the necessary funding. I would like to add a political message, if I may. After the vote that will take place tomorrow, we will be at the start of a three-week consultation period with the Council, during which we will hopefully come to an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, the first time that we have had this new procedure following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, but I believe that all of us, right down to the real anti-Europe fractions and sceptics, have to be clear in our own minds once again, in the face of all of the criticism, including specific targeted criticism, that the European Union makes us stronger. Every one of us and all of the Member States benefit as a result of the fact that we have the European Union, particularly in view of the changes to the challenges at global level. It is clear to everyone that each individual Member State would be weaker on its own in view of the global situation. That needs to be our common starting point, which is why it is right to fight for more resources in the European Union and, together, to consider very carefully what the major financing needs are, how we can make our budget more sustainable and how it can be more social and more future-oriented.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, as Parliament, we can come to an agreement with the Council using such an approach and that, as a result, European citizens can also benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Janusz Lewandowski also deserves a beautiful large banana for presenting a 2011 budget which comes much closer to Parliament’s way of thinking. It was not by accident that we spent five years together. Thank you, Commissioner! The speakers who have given a very clear outline of Parliament’s position also deserve our gratitude. This was not a completely unanimous position, but it did have a main stream. We would like a better and more effective budget, so that we do not have to spend several months or half-years disputing issues such as whether or not we can afford to spend EUR 75 million on compensating banana producing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the essence of our debate is that in our view, as stated in the 2010 budget, the European budget is a means for handling the crisis, and not some kind of a reason for the crisis. This is where we should be in agreement, and I ask the Council to notice the pledge implied here. It implies the intention of Parliament to cooperate with the Commission in prompting Member States to more productive work. Such work should actually be directed at achieving the objectives, increasing production and the number of jobs. If this is the case, it will be worth maintaining the budget of the European Union at an appropriate level. Thank you for your attention. Enjoy your bananas! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for that is that they tabled their proposals for the budget in another form, rather than actually tabling a formal opinion. It is not reasonable that this should lead to this committee being punished for choosing a more effective way of working than tabling a formal opinion.</p>

I support these proposals for the 2011 budget because the important policy areas and the individual opinions have been taken into account. It must be clear that the EU will not be able to fulfil its extensive tasks in future with fewer financial resources. As a representative of farmers, I am absolutely opposed to money being taken away from agriculture. Financial recoveries should be used to provide planning certainty for our farmers instead of reallocating them to other policy areas. Currently, funds are to be taken from agriculture and used to finance the nuclear research project ITER. This example shows that the financing of large-scale research projects is dependent on recoveries from other areas, the amount of which is difficult to determine in advance. It should not be the case that no long-term and carefully considered plans are made for the financing of European research. Agricultural policy also has long-term considerations and plans and this type of security is something we must pass on to agricultural undertakings. As the weakest link in the food chain, farms need the security to be able to make plans in order to be able to exist. Ring-fencing of the financial resources provided for this is necessary in order to strengthen the competitiveness of agriculture in the EU. Investments in agricultural research and green technology are investments in the future and they will create new jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janusz Lewandowski, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, today, the European Commission has adopted its Communication on the budget review to be communicated immediately, here in Parliament, to the representatives elected by the people.</p>
<p class="contents">This was originally foreseen for 2008-2009 but the chain of events – the late adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, the late appointment of the Commission and then a new EU 2020 strategy – explains why this is taking place in October 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The budgetary review should be seen as an integral part of our reflection on how to make Europe more competitive, dynamic, inclusive and sustainable. However, it cannot be separated from the political goals. This is politics in figures and, historically, there has always been a specific political context associated with the budgetary debate. In the past, this was about the single market, single currency and enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">We could wish for better political goals this time round, as there are clear new responsibilities stemming from the Lisbon Treaty. It is also clear that we need to find common European answers to common challenges in the areas of climate change, energy, security and migration.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have a eurosceptic Europe and we have a eurosceptic post-crisis Europe. There is a real tension – or even a contradiction – between both and we should solve this tension. We need consensus; we need unanimity on the next financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">We should draw on experience, and this is part of the budgetary review. Experience teaches us that we have to readjust the balance between predictability and flexibility. Since its introduction in 1988, the financial framework has brought budgetary peace and predictability to Europe, providing a reasonable time horizon for our regions, farmers and researchers to prepare and realise their projects.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a real achievement. However, this predictability came at the price of very limited flexibility, and it has been revealed in the past how much we can be exposed to sudden developments. We can be proud of certain actions – the generous and swift reaction to the Pakistan floods and to the problems in Haiti – but generally, we are slow. It took one year to mobilise money for the food aid facility. We are slowest internally, and quicker in rapid reactions to external challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson therefore is that we need more flexibility. We need to be able to transfer funds and unspent margins more easily, undertake front- and back-loading. In the budgetary review, we propose fixed margins which are bigger at the end of the financial perspective, and also to establish performance-oriented reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">Another factor to be taken into account is, of course, the economic crisis, and the new functions of the budget intelligently targeted could serve as an anti-crisis small sectoral and local package. It could become collateral for loans beyond the balance of payments facility. It can act as a toolbox for reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention one more factor of the budgetary review, and that is that the discussion of priorities is always overshadowed by the net balance, a <span class="italic">juste retour</span> type of approach to the budget which has to do with the complex revenue side of the European budget. However, an incentive to find a way out of this vicious circle would be if we had open reflection without taboos and where we could analyse not only spending, but also the revenue side of the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As President Barroso stated in his ‘State of the Union’ speech, this is not a discussion about spending less or more; this is about how to spend more intelligently. The budgetary review provides a number of suggestions on how to generate European added value, how to establish the new legitimisation of the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be done. We are pooling resources at European level, allowing Member States to cut their costs, avoid overlaps and get a better return on their investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take research and infrastructure as an example. This can be done by addressing common challenges in a coherent and coordinated way, especially if there are cross-border implications which are typical in the case of energy, security, migration and climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">It can be done by demonstrating solidarity in the case of natural or man-made disasters; and it can and should be done by delivering tools to allow us to act more forcefully on the global arena and make Europe more visible as the largest donor (55% of total assistance).</p>
<p class="contents">This is not enough. What we need – and this is also part of the budgetary review – is administrative expenditure self-restraint. We also need a much more professional management of large-scale projects and – this is the separate part of the annex to the budget review – the innovative financial instrument must go beyond the 1% by volume of the European budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Own resources is what makes most sense at the end of the day. (I am perhaps taking time from my final reflection.) It is so easy to criticise the present system as being unfair, complex, and contrary to the treaties, but it is also so easy to provoke unfounded accusations if we enter into discussions on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said that the Lisbon Treaty clearly requires that the own resources decision be reached unanimously and it needs to be ratified by all Member States. National tax sovereignty is not at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is worth reflecting on having a system that is closer to the original design, a system that allows the European Union to be more autonomous and allows the Member States to consolidate their public finances by progressively reducing their direct contributions. We could start with the abolishment of this artificial VAT delivery. We are listing six possible candidates: these are mentioned in the paper and quantified more in the annex, but nobody is perfect of course. This is not a replacement for the national contribution. It should be seen only as the supplement.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget review is an invitation to, and the opening of, the hot budgetary season in the European Union. I am looking forward to cooperating with the European Parliament. This is our common responsibility to demonstrate that the European Union is capable of responding to the challenges, and the budget – when intelligently targeting the goals – could be the tool for renewing confidence in our European project.</p>

It is the first in which we have desisted from calling for any increase in the global volume proposed by the Commission, instead preferring a realistic and political approach.</p>
<p class="contents">A realistic approach insofar as our Member States have been called upon to make unprecedented efforts in stabilising and reducing their public finances. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is the first to call upon them to do so. The reduction in public expenditure is, effectively, the prerequisite if our economies are to become more competitive and face up to international competition under favourable conditions. It is therefore not a question of our asking of the twenty-seven, for this budgetary year, expenditure which does not fit within the efforts made by our fellow citizens within their own national framework.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our approach is also political insofar as we believe that the 2011 budget cannot be disassociated from the more general financial context of the years to come and, in particular, from the perspective of the next 2014-2020 financial cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, if there is an objective that our Parliament must aim for in the course of this legislature, it is to ensure that European policies are funded in a manner commensurate with what is at stake. It is not necessarily a question of asking for more money but rather to ensure that the tasks assigned to the European Union can be achieved with adequate funding. Our States can even economise, reduce their contribution to the Community budget, if they are prepared for Europe to change its financial system, as it is now obsolete, and take advantage of own resources. A euro spent at European level is, indeed, more profitable, more productive than a euro spent at national level, because a European euro does not have a deficit to cover.</p>
<p class="contents">At national level, the euro is now worth only half or less in some countries. At national level too, this euro which has not already been reduced comes back in the shape of cohesion funds, funds for rural development and for promoting innovation. I request that the Council gives serious consideration to this new approach to European finance. I am grateful to Commissioner Lewandowski for already having opened this debate with our ministers of finance.</p>
<p class="contents">Europeans have the right to know what their public authorities spend, whether these be local, regional, national or European. Member States must be ready to lift this gauntlet. President of the Council, Ministers, you have in your own hands the key to unlocking these debates and negotiations so that all the Member States can move forward, so that the euro that is at the level of Brussels can return to the level of the citizens in the Member States and be much more productive and create new jobs at a European level. I beg you, the opportunity is still there. As a Christmas present, you must tell us that the own funds and own resources of Europe are starting to be the subject of serious discussion and serious negotiation under your Presidency. I assure you that we shall be talking of this matter for many years to come if we manage to achieve this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We debated a 2011 budget under the constraints with which we are familiar, that is, those of a deep crisis affecting all of Europe with public deficits at national level which could lead to two hypotheses. Either these public deficits at national level pose a constraint on the European deficit, or these deficits at national level must give a new direction and a new lease of life at the level of Europe. That is the question.</p>
<p class="contents">I am asking you, Commissioner, to try, above all, when we debate the budgetary review, when we are about to start to talk about the budgetary perspectives for post-2013, not to remain completely absorbed by this context of crisis, unless you are going to tell me and tell all European citizens that, in effect, Europe will remain in the crisis for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Our entire problem really concerns how to manage the crisis and reduce our deficits and debt, and also how to prepare for extricating ourselves from the crisis. That is where the question of the budget comes in. We can only get out of the crisis, and Joseph Daul made this point just now, if the European budget, on account of being European, is able to provide us with the resources to recover what we are lacking today; that is growth, job creation, innovation, research. That is what is at stake and it is in these terms that we should debate the budget and not do what we are too often prone to do, that is, constantly harp on about the issue of the crisis and the issue of deficits, and the Council really excels at that.</p>
<p class="contents">I observed that at Deauville, the German Chancellor and the French President even announced in anticipation a reform of the treaties, without having had any kind of discussion with Mr Van Rompuy, so as to punish all those States which failed to respect budgetary discipline in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">That is where we have got to in the Council today, while Parliament is only asking for one thing, in particular of the Commission, and that is to try to move the European project forward, which happens through the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">So, you have noted a certain number of issues on which we are entirely in agreement. There is a need for greater flexibility. Evidently, we must manage together to find the capacity to have a much more flexible budget because it is a necessity; Europe’s capacity for reaction is at stake. It is also, of course, a question of setting priorities and organising the European budget efficiently. We are all doubtless in agreement that it is a necessity. However, where we must be clear with one another is on the need for a timetable, on the need for us to set our objectives together. Commissioner, we cannot leave matters as empty words and promises, written texts which are extremely interesting and with which I agree almost 100%.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are going to have to get down to the practical matters and, in particular, to an essential issue that we have been skirting round, that of own resources. What do we need to do in order to have own resources tomorrow for Europe, or rather for all the citizens of Europe, so that we are all put back on the path to growth and on an even firmer path for the Europe of tomorrow to take?</p>
<p class="contents">We await your ambitious proposals, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Otherwise, the fact that the mid-term review should have been done 15 months ago is a small detail, and therefore it does not need to be mentioned again. Indeed, whenever there are negotiations, they sell us a mid-term review, which comes at the end of the term. This is unacceptable and must not happen in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the vital point of this text concerns own resources. Why? For that is the basis of the European Union. The founding fathers of the EU created a European Union based on own resources, that is to say, on tariffs, taxes on imported agricultural products and VAT. That is what happened. National contributions started because of the British rebate. That is the reality. We must therefore return to these own resources as the basis of financing. We must do so now because that is the only chance we have to take Europe forward. We must also do so for democratic reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">In a democracy, one thing is necessary: that the people pay their individual revenue directly to Europe and that they can therefore contribute and control the functioning of the European Union through those resources.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point, Madam President, in fact concerns the things that are being said here: that we must reduce the EU budget and contributions at European level in order to improve public finances – that is hogwash. The reality is that fiscal deficits – budget deficits in Europe – have now reached EUR 868 billion, or 7% of the European Union’s GDP. Even if we pursue the idea of curbing spending at European level and freezing the European budget completely, those EUR 868 billion would be reduced to EUR 860 billion. That, in fact, is the reality. The opposite should actually be done: transfer responsibilities from national to European level so as to reduce costs for Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Defence, research, diplomacy, infrastructure – these are areas in which the European Union can perform better and which can help reduce budget deficits. So this is the approach you must now take with your colleagues, President of the Council: progress must be made on the matter of own resources because otherwise, you will not have an agreement for the 2011 budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is crucial in the budget review is that we are going to look critically at whether the resources of the EU have achieved what we think. There is a lot of money going to agriculture and cohesion funds; have these sums been delivering on the targets that we aimed for? I must say that the budget review is a bit sparse on these kinds of questions.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us look to the future. I very much welcome your attitude, Commissioner, when you say we have to look at the goals we are aiming for in the 2020 strategy – i.e. goals on innovation, on climate, on poverty eradication, on employment. These targets should be given a central place and these targets should also be used for the budget review. That means something for our agricultural policies and for our cohesion policies, and here we expect some good and ambitious reforms from the Commission to make sure that agricultural policies and cohesion policies really deliver on poverty eradication, greenhouse gas reduction, innovation and unemployment. That is again, I think, very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to some crucial ideas that you address such as some new ideas on private investors. I have to say that this issue of private investors has been addressed before, but we know from the ITER experience and from the GALILEO experience that they are not there, so we have to make sure that we are not building on them if they are not forthcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the European Investment Bank, yes, try to include the EIB, but the democratic accountability of the Investment Bank is crucial. How can we make sure that their investments are also delivering?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on own resources. The financial transaction tax is mentioned again, but we know from the ECOFIN this week that the financial transaction tax is not supported by the Commission; it is not even on the Barroso list for the G20. Still, however, it is in this document, stating that maybe these kinds of incomes can be used. What is the position of the Commission on the financial transaction tax, because the Commission is vague and inconsistent here? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While there is a modest approach to limit common agricultural policy expenditure, there is a more radical attempt to eliminate the British rebate. But, worse still, there is a clear intention to create a new own resource. Like a thief, the European Union now wants to directly plunder the pockets of the British taxpayer. Be it carbon tax, a bank levy or whatever, it is certain that the taxpayers will be taking more pain.</p>
<p class="contents">When people see the EU taking their money, they will increasingly resent the EU waste and lack of transparency. The elimination of the rebate and the creation of a new European tax – let us call it by its correct name – will not require a change in the treaty. However, the agreement reached between the German Chancellor and the French President about imposing political sanctions to ensure financial stability will require those changes.</p>
<p class="contents">If the EU wants more power, it must ask the consent of the governed. If EU politicians want a new treaty, they must first give the people a referendum. Now there is a chance for ‘cast-iron Dave’ to make good on his reneged promise to hold an EU referendum. I will believe that when I see it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I see it, one of the main problems at the moment – and this was confirmed by Commissioner Lewandowski’s words on the subject – is that we are focusing too much on feasibility. After all, this only benefits vested interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have unanimity, and there lies a major problem. Yet the only things currently served by the EU budget are vested interests: vested interests in agriculture, in fisheries, in the cohesion aspect, and also in ‘old’ industry, if I may call it that. Vested interests pose a risk to the dynamic economy we want to see in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I see Europe, and the budget in particular, as a very large crude oil tanker. It is hard to change its course, but we now have the opportunity to take it out of the water and into the dockyard. Let us seize that opportunity and take a look at whether we cannot convert that large tanker into a couple of much smaller speedboats.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to own resources, these are important not only because Europe then has its own resources, but also to enable us to now combat the perverse effect of Member States’ contributions. Member States are interested in just one thing, which is how much money they can scrape back from the European budget, and that would be combated by a system of own resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all familiar with this saying, but dear Commissioner, where are the figures in this material? This is what is completely missing. So now I do not know what we are talking about, after all. Mid-term revision. This has also been covered by others before me. Well, we are in the third quarter and I do not know when we will get this revision over with. However, I would like to ask a question here. This is also for the Council. Perhaps it will get to them through the translation. What I would like to say is that we should complete this revision, or whatever we want to call it, this year. In 2011, there will be no point in still fussing about what we wanted to do in 2008, or what we should have done in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should get on with the next budget framework, which we have already started to some extent. There is serious work going on in Parliament, just like, I think, in the other partner institutions. This work should involve brave reforms. The issue of own resources was raised here. It is really an impossible situation that we are the only parliament in the world that creates a budget and does not feel the burden of it when facing the voters, as it is not us who take away those funds from citizens, but the intermediaries, the national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we have to be concerned about the sovereignty of Member States, that the European Parliament itself takes away from citizens and brings here its own expenditures, the joint European expenditures? I know this is a difficult issue. The issue of sovereignty is very important. And there is yet another issue which is very important, Mr President, namely that what we spend should comply with the considerations of subsidiarity, and we should not want to move over here, to a European level, any issues which are up to the Member States.

If we follow the content of this communication, it will mean that there will be no review until 2014. However, that means – as I also said previously – that essential elements of the Lisbon policy based on the new treaty, at least parts relating to the budget, will be postponed until after 2014. The question then arises as to whether we can afford to do this, particularly in the context of globalisation, where the ability of the European Union to act on a political level as well as an economic one is under discussion, and whether we can accept responsibility for this. I have the impression that the Commission in office at that time, and Mr Prodi, were too ambitious in their proposals and the current Commission is too cautious.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, when we come to take the next step, it is important first to focus on better legislation in order to promote growth and employment, simplification, efficiency and a reduction of the costs involved in implementing programmes before we ask for more money. This, incidentally, also applies to research, where we have deficits and where there are still yellow/red cards from the Court of Auditors. New financial instruments are also needed, as well as a discussion about what we will do, for example, with large-scale innovation, industrial and research projects such as ITER or Galileo or with energy projects. Will we say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to these? If we say ‘yes’ to them, should they then also be appropriately – and in a different way to previously – financed to completion through the European budget via the overall multiannual financial programme?</p>
<p class="contents">In view of a sometimes misleading discussion at the level of the Member States, allow me also to say something about our own resources. It is entirely legitimate and in accordance with the treaty – yes, the treaty requires it in fact – for us to concern ourselves with our own resources, because the treaty states that, without prejudice to other revenue, we shall finance ourselves first of all from our own resources. We should all take part in this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The document is disappointing in the sense that it does not open up any prospect of a revision of the multiannual framework for 2010-2012. Yet the 2011 budget has shown this to be untenable. Indeed, the financial framework takes account of neither the new tasks under the Treaty of Lisbon nor the EU 2020 objectives. This is indeed untenable. At the very least, scope for greater flexibility must be introduced. Fortunately, the Commission is also advocating this. This increased flexibility should apply from as soon as 2012. The document is encouraging, on the other hand, in that the Commission is opening the debate on own resources at long last. This may be the big debate in the next few years; a difficult but unavoidable one.</p>
<p class="contents">The treaty states that the EU budget must be financed from own resources. Currently, 80% of it is financed by transfers from national budgets. These are not European own resources, but instead form part of national budgetary expenditure. They weigh down on the national deficits that the European Stability and Growth Pact seeks to reduce, and so Member States attempt to reduce these transfers. At the same time, they expect more from Europe, as is evident from the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must break through this contradiction. This can be done only by having recourse to genuine own resources. These must also make it possible to reduce Member States’ contributions and to increase EU resources. As possible own resources, the Commission rightly points to new taxes that are directly linked to policy areas developed mainly at European level. I would cite the examples of climate policy and the regulation of the financial sector. It is to be hoped that the European Council and the Council will also grasp the need to now open the debate on own resources as a matter of urgency with a view to the financial perspective from 2014 onwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is good that it has come into being and that it has now been submitted to us. Of course, one can always complain that this could have been done earlier and so forth. I think that, above all, we should at this moment commend one particular feature of the document, which is the fact that it raises taboo issues. We should not at this moment be treating any questions which are in any way related to the budget as taboo, and we should be talking about everything, including about own resources. This is most definitely to be commended.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to issue a warning about a certain danger related to the discussion about new own resources. As we know, this is a very difficult discussion, a discussion which may easily block all other talks about what the European Union budget should be like and what we have already learned from the current financial framework. We should not allow ourselves to be manoeuvred into a dead-end street. We should broaden the horizons of our discussion and not get stuck on the subject of own resources, which will, in fact, make it impossible for us to find a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that the income side of the European Union budget should be stable and predictable. We should always remember the great achievement of the European Union budget, which is the fact that it is balanced. It is a budget which does not bring us into debt. This value should continue to be a guiding principle. I would also like to emphasise that new own resources should make the European Union’s income stable and predictable and, in addition, should not bring us into debt. I think we should give thought to this and remember that the current income of the European Union, based as it is on the gross national product of individual Member States, is not so bad a system that we have to reject it.</p>
<p class="contents">The new system should, in my opinion, be a combination of new and old. We should, to a large extent, be thinking about reform, but, in addition, we should not reject <span class="italic">a priori</span> what is a good tradition. In other words, both continuation and change – the one does not preclude the other. We should begin with what is already working successfully and not reject this, so that we do not get bogged down with a discussion only about own resources, and that we think, in fact, about how to construct the new financial framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It applies to families, to the European Union, and it even applied to Fagin in <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span>. When his little enterprise of picking a pocket or two was not working out, he said, ‘I think we have got to think it out again’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good that we are thinking it out again here as well. Particularly, we can do a lot to make what we are trying to do more acceptable to the Member States and the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the target of reducing red tape by 25% – and hopefully more – is very desirable and very sellable. Secondly, we need to stop scoring own goals. Unfortunately, I am in agreement with some of the Eurosceptics who said that increasing the entertainment budget was not a sensible thing to do. It was grist to the mill to the Eurosceptics and I think it disappointed Euro-enthusiasts. Thirdly – and very importantly – the whole question of creating own resources is most desirable. I think our President, Mr Daul, said it very well when he said that a euro spent at European level is better value than a euro spent at Member State level. I think we should be going along that line and particularly encouraging venture capitalists looking at euro project bonds to finance the various projects we need.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an R&amp;D target of 3%. This is absolutely vital for Europe if we are to be competitive and create the jobs we need. We also need to keep a strongly funded CAP – pillar one to ensure that the rural society is not denuded of people, and pillar two to ensure the delivery of public goods. As well as that, the renewable energy targets and CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions cannot be compromised on – nor, of course, cohesion policy, which has been very successful. If we can achieve all that, we will eventually have a 4% increase in GDP and 5.6 million extra jobs by 2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, the European structural and cohesion policy is a success story, particularly in recent years. The contribution of the Cohesion Fund to overcoming the crisis is considerable, particularly in the poorest regions. The horizontal approach in connection with the objective of competitiveness and employment is producing encouraging results. Never have EU funds been utilised more efficiently, never have we brought more small and medium-sized enterprises into international networks, and never have the regions been better prepared to utilise the European programmes. The use and absorption of EU funds gives a very clear and encouraging signal here. With this progress, even the irregularities in connection with the use of the Structural Funds could be significantly reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors, scientists and the regions inform us of these matters, but, unfortunately, not the Commission or the Member States. They are noticeably unforthcoming. There has not been a genuine mid-term review of the budget in relation to the Structural Funds. I very much regret that, because the tail wind of a budget review would have provided good reasons for continuing with structural policy. Of course, there is a need to adjust the content to the 2020 goals. The resources must be used more efficiently in many areas. However, the goal structures and cooperation with the Member States and the regions have more than proved their worth. We have missed an opportunity here also to prove this by carrying out a genuine review of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has a good memory. When we talk about the future financial perspective, we will bring up the successes of regional policy. When we talk about the reliability of the policy, we will defend the long planning periods for the structural funds. When we talk about future budget reviews, we will call for these to be mandatory, because regular budgetary reviews also contribute to transparency. We must take that more seriously in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All this is happening alongside a crisis that is showing no sign of passing. We want to maintain a strong social state, which will also enhance our competitiveness. We have devised a strategy for all of this: the Europe 2020 strategy. However, this strategy needs funding. We should identify the amount required for each of the policies in order to implement this strategy effectively, so that we will know the total sum needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I am advocating a bottom-up method, based on addition. Then, once we know what is required, we need to define precisely what resources we should have. Approximately 80% of the Community budget comes from national budgets, and we have to reduce this dependence in order to respect the treaties themselves. However, this strategy, the Europe 2020 strategy, should begin now, and so I would like to ask why the multiannual financial framework is not being revised at present so that it complies with this strategy, to which we have all already given our backing? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is balanced, as Mr Lewandowski has always promised us – balanced with a large number of suggestions and ideas for how we can, and should, continue to work. However, it is not what we as budget specialists in the Committee on Budgets expected. To be honest, we thought there would be an analysis of the current financial framework, and the real optimists even believed that we might also get a small revision for the remaining period of the current financial perspective. However, what we have before us now is purely a glance into the future. Almost every other section mentions how we should do things better in future with regard to our budget, whether in relation to our priorities, how to achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, better cooperation with our neighbours, better European infrastructure or our future agricultural policy and cohesion policy. This paper even presents ideas with regard to the future structure of our budget and the length of the next financial period.</p>

<p class="contents">I want to make my comments on the agriculture part in particular, because I am the rapporteur for the budget for next year. I would have some concerns about the language used in the section about agricultural policy. For example, ‘a more radical reform’, and I quote the document ‘would suggest moving away from income support and market measures and giving priority to environmental and climate change objectives rather than the economic and social dimensions of the CAP’.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a suggestion here that we have now a culture of dependency because of direct payments to farmers. We have a culture of reality that farmers are not getting enough from the marketplace to give them a decent income. Farming comes way below the average and that has got to be addressed in any future direction in which we reform the common agricultural policy, but I welcome the document. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it will provide a subject for much discussion in future. It contains quite a few issues about which, I am sure, there will be lively debate in Parliament. I would like to touch on three of them, each in turn.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the question whether all the European Union’s policies can come under the general Europe 2020 umbrella. We know that many policies which are important to the European Union derive from it. However, I do not think that the sustainable growth section is the best place for agricultural policy, for instance, or that the inclusive growth section is the best place for the cohesion policy. I believe that they are somewhat broader and it will be slightly difficult for them to come under the objectives set by Europe 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to dwell on the principles involved. One of them that is shared is the principle of solidarity, which is undoubtedly very important. However, we need to look at resources, including the Cohesion Fund, not only as a form of solidarity, but also as a means of greater convergence. We know that it has an extremely important economic impact, which is not only moral, but is also actually linked to economic results.</p>
<p class="contents">The final matter relates to own resources. In this case, consideration is also given to the granting of loans by the European Union, guaranteeing loans with the European budget and funding large projects. I think that it may be difficult for us to talk about borrowing funds without us being clear about our own resources, including those derived from cooperation with financial institutions like the European Investment Bank or about the reuse of unused funds from the European budget instead of them being returned to Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret the fact that, particularly in the area of expenditure, we have been rather timid in this communication. You know that the Committee on Budgets asks that we do not just undertake a budget review, but rather a proper mid-term review, not for the fun of it, but simply to analyse the structure of budgetary spending and to draw conclusions on certain aspects of that spending.</p>
<p class="contents">You know, as I do, that it is necessary to refocus on certain aspects of spending in the area of cohesion policy, to focus on large industrial projects such as ITER or others relating to Galileo, and also to protect resources earmarked for agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I found the Commission interesting and a little more daring in the area of revenue. Indeed, I think we cannot talk about the EU budget today without opening the debate both on own resources and communitisation, or without mentioning certain areas of expenditure. I believe this is an absolutely essential and fundamental subject for the future of the European Union. I therefore hope that together we can find ways to fund our priorities better – be they youth, education, or any of the other priorities I have just mentioned – because together, we need to identify those areas of high value-added spending, so as to avoid repeating what is unfortunately happening right now with the External Action Service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Haug said quite rightly that many of us were optimistic when awaiting the results of this communication, and we genuinely expected that they would bring a revision of the current financial framework to the table.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I must say that the document that you are presenting to us has been quite a disappointment to me, because the reason why we allowed you to wait to present this document until the Treaty of Lisbon and the Europe 2020 strategy entered into force was because we wanted something more specific. The truth is that this generalised document could quite easily have been tabled in 2007 or 2008, so I do not know why we have had to wait.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it is always important to highlight something positive, and I think that we all agree that you should finally bring the own resources debate to the table.

I think it contains some interesting things, as we have said today, and as others have said very well before me.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of own resources is obviously the most important thing we need to discuss. I also agree on the relevance of using these insights specifically to nurture the option of the Europe 2020 strategy, but I insist that there is more than just the 2020 document. We clearly need to work on it but, of course, there is also the agricultural policy and the question of transport networks, and there are two other documents with which we must concern ourselves as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I am thinking of the report by the task force on economic governance chaired by Mr Van Rompuy, which has also highlighted a number of issues related to budgetary coordination. Finally, based on what you propose, we will also have to work on all the opportunities that will be presented to us, and I am thinking in particular of another report: the famous report by Mr Monti – A New Strategy for the Single Market – which presents the other side of budgetary policies, in other words, everything relating to fiscal cooperation.</p>

As the European Parliament, we should, indeed, look at what the Commission is saying today.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, something which is very important today for us MEPs is discussion on the subject of the relationship between the 2020 strategy, which has already been spoken of today, and EU policies. If, in its document, the Commission gives the possibility of organising the budget around the 2020 strategy, then in fact, this declaration means that the possibility exists of incorporating the majority of EU policies into the 2020 strategy. We read this in the text – it is written there plainly. Reorganisation of the structure of the budget essentially means a reorganisation of EU policies. The declaration that cohesion policy is to be the main carrier of the 2020 strategy is also a declaration which pleases us, and we will certainly try to translate those statements and declarations into the language of specific decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This time, we are talking about something on paper and not – as has happened on several occasions – just words that have been spoken but not yet turned into a tangible document.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, as happens whenever one makes an initial assessment of a document, one finds both positive and negative aspects in it. Partly I see the glass half full, because it talks about own resources, a subject that this Parliament was hoping would be dealt with some time ago so as to reduce the Member States’ contributions and increase the chance of making the major investments that Europe needs.</p>
<p class="contents">On the new multiannual financial framework, it talks about a term of five plus five years, but I fear there will be another mid-term review because, if the next review is anything like the last one, for which we had to wait for such a long time, it will certainly not be a positive move. However, it also talks about a connection with the Europe 2020 strategy, and that is something I agree with, as it is one of the stated priorities of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, I also see the glass half empty, because with regard to the common agricultural policy, it makes plenty of references to the public goods and services that agriculture must produce for people but very few to primary agricultural production and the competitiveness of the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not mean that the Commissioner has not presented many problems to which we now have to give our consideration. For example, how can we balance expenditure with income? Should we cut the first and increase the second? Perhaps we should ask the question as to how to increase the effectiveness of EU resources and how to spend them more intelligently.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to begin the move from financing traditional infrastructure to financing research infrastructure. However, there must be a certain balance which takes into account the different levels of development of different Member States. We know that every euro spent from the EU budget is more profitable than a euro from a national budget. However, let us remember that every euro paid into the EU budget also gives significant benefits and a return to the one who paid it, and not only to the one who receives that euro from the EU budget. It is an important observation that net contributors also receive significant benefits from the resources which they have paid into the EU budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not only a coincidence of time and place; a clear link has been established in the debate between the budgetary review and the annual budget for 2011, or even banana accompanying measures. This is coming late, really late. Speaking frankly, we are in the middle of the 2007-2013 financial perspective, with three years behind us and another three years ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your encouragement, and thank you for being ambitious about the next step, which is the presentation of the future financial perspective. Thank you for being ambitious in discussing both sides of the budget, including own resources (Mr Daul, Mr Le Foll, Mr Verhofstadt, Mr Böge, Mr Dehaene, Mr Abad, Mr Fernandes, Mr Kalfin, Ms Durant and Mr La Via). Thank you for your encouragement to seek flexibility (Mr Garriga) and simplification (Mr Daul).</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Eickhout asked the question on the position of the financial transaction tax or activity tax. There is a delicate hint in the annex that the preference is not for taxing movable operations which are easily subject to evasion, but rather corporations, i.e. activity transactions. We do not need to agree intercontinentally to avoid evasion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Garriga and Mr Surján are disappointed about the figures. There is an annex which gives some quantification and also the impact assessment on cohesion. This is the main point which I had expected given my knowledge of Parliament's position. This is not a revision of the figures for 2011-2013, as was claimed by Mr Böge, Mrs Gardiazábal Rubial, Mrs Haug, Mr Dehaene and Mr Abad.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot simply make adjustments just like that. We need a legal base; we can adjust to Lisbon and we can adjust to EU 2020 strategy on an annual basis. This is feasible and this is an exercise which is ahead of us for 2011, 2012 and 2013, but we cannot do it at one stroke by simply quantifying without a legal basis and introducing new requirements into the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not yet know what will come out of the agreement on ITER and other large-scale programmes which should cost more up to 2013. You are disappointed, but this is my reply.</p>
<p class="contents">As for agriculture, this is a balanced position. You know, Mrs McGuinness, that there are more radical opinions of what should be done with agricultural spending. There is also a strong political defence. We are here to produce a balanced opinion, because at the end of the day, it is all about compromise and we should have the final agreement of 27 countries.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Michel Barnier, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, good evening to each and every one of you. I have just this minute arrived from Luxembourg, Mr President, where the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers met and reached unanimous agreement on the draft directive on hedge funds and private equity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am mentioning this now before Parliament because this draft document, which will remain a draft until you have debated it here yourselves, owes much to the European Parliament, to the work of your rapporteur, Mr Gauzès, and to the many amendments tabled and included for the Council of Ministers’ final vote, particularly those related to the financial supervision package which, too, owes a great deal to the European Parliament’s contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we will now work together with Parliament in order to finalise the agreement on the regulation of hedge funds and private equity. This is the first time that this sector will be subject to European regulation, and I would like to thank you already for the part you have played in this draft directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou asked me about the discussions that are under way in Basel and which are connected with the issue of regulation that I have just mentioned. Banking reform is a very important issue and, once again, I welcome Parliament’s commitment, shown by the excellent work of Mr Karas; we talked about that here two weeks ago. You will be asked to give your opinion on the proposed Capital Requirements Directive 4 that will be presented in spring 2011 to implement the Basel III accord in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is an understatement to say that we have encountered and are still facing an unprecedented financial crisis that is not over yet. According to the International Monetary Fund, bank losses attributed to the crisis amounted to EUR 2 300 billion at the end of 2010, of which half has come from European banks. This crisis, which began in the financial sector, has plunged the European economy into severe recession. European GDP shrank by 5.7%, or EUR 700 billion this year alone.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to restore confidence and stability in the banking sector, and ensure that credit continues to fuel the real economy, business, employment and growth. The European Union and Member States adopted an unprecedented set of emergency measures that were, at that time, not so long ago, funded by the taxpayer. The Commission thus approved 4 100 billion of State aid amounting to 35% of the European GDP. Combined with fiscal policies designed to bring Europe out of recession, these support measures have fuelled the deficit and public debt.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it was the citizens, the taxpayers, who paid once – will they pay a second time? I do not think so, and I hope not, because that would not be fair. Our policy is foresight, because prevention is always cheaper than cure. We need to prevent the crisis and its disastrous effects from occurring a second time, and it is precisely in order to carry that need for foresight and prevention over into our prudential policies that we will be introducing the Basel III regulations in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in the same spirit that we want to provide Europe with a prevention framework for resolving banking crises, which, again, will be based on Parliament’s opinions. I am thinking, in particular, of the work undertaken by Mrs Ferreira.</p>
<p class="contents">The G20, in its decision of 2 April 2009, made the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision responsible for making in-depth improvements to the Basel II regulations where necessary, in order to strengthen banks’ resilience and improve financial stability. EU leaders expressed their support for this goal on 19 and 20 March 2009. The Basel III regulations were drawn up in the Basel Committee by experts from the regulatory and supervisory authorities of the 27 major international banking markets, with the Commission’s very active participation on behalf of all Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The analysis made by our Commission and the Basel Committee shows that the new regulations will strengthen financial stability, limit pro-cyclicality and lead to significant economic and social benefits for a wide range of stakeholders, thanks to the expected reduction in the frequency of banking crises and the risks they entail. In particular, this reform will benefit borrowers, companies and individuals, but also creditors, governments, small and medium-sized enterprises and our citizens in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, these benefits will only become apparent over time because of the gradual introduction of the new regulations and the transitional clauses announced by the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision on 12 September 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to liquidity requirements. Liquidity regulations are subject to an observation period until 2015. Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou asked me if the new rules will accelerate mergers between banks; that is not the aim of the reform, but if some banks failed to comply with these new regulations on time and therefore had to merge with their competitors or even their partners, that would lead to greater protection for their depositors and creditors, and to increased financial stability.</p>
<p class="contents">I also understand your concern that the new regulations will disproportionately affect smaller banks. The quantitative study carried out by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors on the impact of Basel III on the banking sector has shown that small banks, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, would, in fact, be less affected by the new regulations than the top 50 banking groups of the European Union. This is mainly due to small banks’ higher level of initial capitalisation and their simpler business model.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission attaches great importance to establishing fair competition at international level. At this stage, I do not consider it advisable for the G20 to open another major debate on all the regulations defined in the context of Basel III because these were the result of lengthy, balanced discussions. On the other hand, the political governance of the G20 and the Financial Stability Board are a tool for Europe, enabling it to ensure that everyone will effectively implement the Basel accord properly and on time. That is what I can say in answer to your very important question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to reiterate that the financial crisis has shown that banks with excess liquidity have refrained from lending on the interbank market because they have very prudently accumulated liquidity for their own potential needs. Furthermore, this problem has been exacerbated due to a lack of understanding of the financial robustness of other institutions. In my opinion, the new liquidity requirements will help to solve the problem of insufficient liquidity in the markets both by improving risk management of the banks’ liquidity and by strengthening their cash reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">The transitional arrangements planned by the Basel Committee foresee that the new liquidity coverage ratio will only become mandatory, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, from 2015, which I believe should allow sufficient time for banks to comply and limit any undesirable impact on markets during the transition period.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rübig, you mentioned Basel II. May I remind us all that, in the case of the United States, which you mentioned, Basel II has not yet been implemented, nor has Basel 2.5, I might add. During my first visit to the United States, on 9 and 10 May 2010, I also made a deal, or rather reached an agreement, with the American Secretary of the Treasury – with whom I shall be meeting again next week – to ensure that the United States will implement Basel 2.5 in mid-2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rubig, your question is very important because it gives us an opportunity to state that we have international commitments. The Americans have played an important part in drawing up the Basel standards. They are closely involved in the process and therefore it would be incomprehensible ... let me say this in a more positive way. It would be quite normal for these joint decisions to be implemented jointly, in parallel. I am very mindful of this parallelism with the United States; moreover, I am going to make sure of it in a few days, during my second visit.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the impact of Basel III on both major and smaller banks, generally speaking, we will proceed very carefully with macro- and micro-economic impact studies, without improvising, and I will use all flexibility margins in order to develop good measures and good decisions that are as well-gauged as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Zemke asked me about timing. What we are going to do, Mr Zemke, in spring 2011, is draw up legislative texts, a draft directive, called the Capital Requirements Directive 4 (CRD 4); after we have carried out all the impact studies, an assessment of the Basel measures, the macro- and micro-economic impact study, and assessments of the other measures of which I am mindful and – I talked about this earlier – which involve external or internal supervision, this directive will properly implement a risk prevention system in banks, followed by a transatlantic assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">I need a few months to carry out a thorough job: listen to Parliament, listen to the financial services stakeholders, take the right steps and make good proposals. All of this will take place in spring 2011, with CRD 4 and these legislative texts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	EU-Africa summit/food security</span></p>
<p class="contents">In connection with World Food Day on 16 October 2009, the FAO has recently indicated that the situation remains unsatisfactory despite a slight improvement regarding the number of those suffering from chronic hunger in the world (925 million this year, compared with 1.023 billion in 2009). The lack of food security is threatening to undermine MDG objective 1, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In the run-up to the next EU-Africa summit (Tripoli, 29 and 30 November), many of those concerned are anxious that the strategic partnership should place greater emphasis on food security, including issues relating to access to food, infrastructures, land ownership and adjustment to climate change. Does the Commission consider it necessary to introduce a new specific partnership for food security under the joint Africa-EU strategy? Does it intend to step up coordination on horizontal issues in the context of existing partnerships, this being necessary to achieve food security in Africa? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ensuring that every citizen has access to nutritious food is a main aim of development cooperation. Reducing the proportion of hungry people by half is therefore, rightly, the first of eight Millennium Development Goals that the global community promised to reach by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">Food security will also remain a top priority for the European Union in its relations with Africa, where many countries are off track in reaching this MDG 1, where more than 70% of the population live in rural areas, and where some 90% of agricultural production is carried out by smallholders on family farms.</p>
<p class="contents">Food security was already a priority of the first EU-Africa action plan, within the partnership on the MDGs, and we will propose to maintain this as a priority area for the next action plan that is currently being drafted.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also ensure that cross-sectoral aspects with direct links to food security, such as research, trade and regional integration, are given appropriate relevance in this next action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s focus on food security goes hand in hand with the importance that African leaders themselves have attached to agriculture and food security.</p>
<p class="contents">The comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development programme is the common framework for action in this area and we will continue to support this.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I believe that we have enough mechanisms at this stage to care about nutritious food supply and that it is not necessary to introduce a new specific partnership for food security in the joint Africa-EU strategy.</p>

It is very clear that we need to take many measures now to achieve the MDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Mr Papanikolaou’s question, basically we have two facilities. Reflex mostly addressed countries in the crisis. We have also disbursed a food facility of EUR 1 billion to support smallholder farmers and this definitely produced many results in responding to the food crisis. In many countries, the food supply situation has improved. The problem is that this food security is a one-off measure, so we are helping at the time of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads us to the question I was asked by Mr Tarabella. Food security is definitely one of the areas I will propose in the Green Paper as a particular focus area for the European Union, particularly since we have had a very positive experience with the food facility.

On 30 November, we will have a consultation here to discuss with Council the very controversial issue of bus passenger rights.

<p class="contents">Every year, some 35 000 people are killed and 1.7 million injured in road accidents in the European Union. Among the statistics, one figure is of particular concern: in 2008, 1 100 children were victims of road accidents in the European Union.

<p class="contents">What specific initiatives and measures will it take, in conjunction with the Member States, to ensure more effective prevention of road accidents involving children? Will it introduce stricter safety standards and quality controls for buses used for school transport and for professional drivers of such buses (use of advanced technology equipment, more frequent checks on drivers’ professional skills and experience, and on their personal integrity via psychological testing, for example)?</p>

<p class="contents">Beyond the figures, the benefit in terms of pain and of personal and family tragedies avoided is incalculable. In the recently adopted ‘policy orientations for road safety 2011-2020’, the Commission proposed to continue with the target of halving the number of road deaths within the European Union, starting from the results obtained in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this target, greater efficiency will be required from EU and national road safety policies. This involves a strong political commitment by all Member States, in particular, those with poor safety records which should be reflected in the development of comprehensive national road safety strategies drawing on practices which have been shown to be successful elsewhere. It will also require special efforts to reduce road accidents in areas where progress has been slower, such as motorcyclists’ safety or the safety of rural roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Technological developments, in particular, so-called intelligent transport systems, will also play an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the specific issue of the prevention of road accidents involving children, in particular in school buses, it should be noted that very significant progress has been achieved during the past decade with a decrease of 70% in the number of fatalities involving children younger than 15 years of age.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully aware, however, of the need to ensure a high level of protection of children who are a particularly vulnerable category of users. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have strict regulations regulating the technical standards concerning buses, and especially school buses. I have not heard of any particular concerns about problems with school buses as such. We will, of course, follow the situation, and we propose – coming to the last question – to follow strictly the rules that all children must be properly accommodated and that seat belts should be used. I have not, however, received any signals concerning this problem of road safety that school buses is an issue that is badly handled.</p>
<p class="contents">30 000 people have died and, of course, we are all unhappy about this. Every casualty is a tragedy, but I definitely do not agree that this road safety action plan has been a failure. There has been a 40% reduction in casualties in Europe. In my own country, the reduction was fourfold over the last 15 years. We followed the same route. For those of you interested in our plans, just before the summer break, we adopted policy guidelines which are the next action plan for road safety and we have the same aim – to reduce casualties by half.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of measures which can help to achieve this goal are described, including training the people most vulnerable in traffic. The most vulnerable are always elderly people, pedestrians, cyclists and also motorcyclists, who obviously require special attention because motorcyclists are the only category where casualties have risen – the other categories have all come down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Excess transport in the Baltic Sea</span></p>
<p class="contents">The World Wide Fund for Nature international NGO announced in August that an increase in commercial activity over the next 20 years will seriously damage the Baltic Sea. Shipping, industrial activity on the high seas and tourism will more than double. In the tourism sector, the number of passengers on board ships is expected to rise from 5 to 20 million. In 2030, the number of ships will have increased from 4 000 to 9 000, and there will be a proportionate increase in the probability of environmental incidents. An annual increase of over 150 ships is currently being recorded. Unlike other seas, beaches are quickly polluted by oil spills in the Baltic as the seawater is only renewed every 30 years.</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission assess the threat posed by excess shipping in the Baltic and what measures does it propose that Member States bordering the sea adopt to resolve this issue?

<p class="contents">Maritime transport in the Baltic Sea has increased significantly over recent years, as a result of rapid economic growth. At the same time, the European Union has one of the most advanced regulatory frameworks on maritime safety in the world today. The third maritime safety package adopted by Parliament and the Council in 2009 is a significant improvement of the EU’s vessel traffic monitoring and information system. It covers all the seas surrounding Europe and introduces strict inspections on ships visiting EU ports, also known as port state control. It contains specific measures for the Baltic Sea, such as requirements for safe winter navigation and reinforced ice standards for ships.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission works closely with all the EU Baltic States to ensure the smooth implementation of these new measures. The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) also provides technical support. If an accident were to happen, EMSA has standby pollution response vessels and equipment permanently located in the Baltic. This is in addition to the pollution response measures already put in place by the Baltic States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also maintains a continuous dialogue with the Russian Federation to ensure that safety rules are applied coherently in the Baltic Sea. In this framework, the Commission is about to launch a pilot project with the Russian administration on monitoring maritime traffic in the Baltic Sea. A recently adopted EU strategy in the Baltic Sea region also addresses safety and security.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, of course, like to respond to this interesting proposal to reduce maritime transport in the Baltic Sea, but any restriction on maritime transport before its introduction has to be carefully considered and be in line with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas and with other internationally agreed conventions. The International Maritime Organisation already recognises the Baltic as a particularly sensitive sea area and this status brings with it particular maritime traffic requirements to reduce the risk of accidents and to protect the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that maritime transport is a relatively environmentally friendly mode of transport. Additional restrictions to commercial transport in the Baltic Sea could potentially promote other less environmentally friendly modes of transport with increased emissions as a consequence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	New framework for the EU common agricultural policy 2014-2020</span></p>
<p class="contents">Without a significant increase in targeted subsidies for Bulgaria, the agriculture sector there could collapse. This is especially serious in times of crisis. Bulgaria and Romania, which, in 2007, were the last countries to join the EU, receive just 40% of the amount granted in agricultural subsidies to established Member States such as Germany, France and others. The 100% alignment of subsidies under the treaty on the accession of those countries to the EU is only due to take place in 2016. Does the Commission intend to accelerate the increase in the level of subsidies granted to Bulgaria during the negotiations on the new framework for the common agricultural policy for the period 2014-2020 which are currently in progress and, if so, will the criteria be modified?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Taking account of biodiversity in the reform of the CAP</span></p>
<p class="contents">In its report of 21 September 2010 (<a href="/doceo/document/TA-7-2010-0325_EN.html">P7_TA(2010)0325</a>), Parliament clearly denounced the failure of the European strategy for halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. Increasingly intensive farming, growing use of pesticides and fertilisers, the increasing size of agricultural holdings, the development of monoculture: agricultural biodiversity is particularly affected and is in an alarming state.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to act, and act fast. As the report points out, a cross-sector approach is needed: the protection and restoration of our natural capital is not solely a matter for environmental policies. These considerations must be integrated into all of the EU’s policies: the way we see the agriculture of tomorrow is decisive.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable use of agricultural biodiversity calls for a firm commitment to an ecologically sustainable future. We need to take advantage of the CAP reform to reverse the trend and ensure that biodiversity is protected and restored. Bioconditionality is a major element in this change.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of the failure of efforts to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010, could the Commission state what criteria on protection of biodiversity will be integrated into the CAP after 2013. Would it be possible to use this new policy to restore agricultural biodiversity?</p>

<p class="contents">In George Lyon’s report on the future of the common agricultural policy after 2013, which was adopted on 8 July 2010, Parliament called for ‘a fair distribution of CAP payments’ and insisted ‘that it should be fair to farmers in both new and old Member States’.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dacian Cioloş, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>–<span class="italic"> (FR)</span> I am now going to answer five questions, which are grouped together and cover the same theme.</p>
<p class="contents">The total amount of direct payments in European Union Member States reflects their agricultural production and the average level of aid over an historical period. Due to the fact that their historical references have been used to determine direct payments, this direct aid is not distributed equally among Member States, among regions or among the various categories of farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU-12, that is to say, the 12 most recent EU Members, is in the process of phasing in funding, in other words, progressively implementing direct payments.</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU-10, direct payments will reach 100% of European Union level in 2013. As for the last two Member States to have joined, Bulgaria and Romania, who are treated equally, they will begin to progressively implement direct payments in 2016, having started at 25% of these payment levels in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, all Member States of the EU-12, that is to say, all the new Member States, also have the opportunity to top up EU direct payments with national subsidies within the limits clearly set out by the regulation and the accession treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">As prompted by the Council during the common agricultural policy (CAP) health check in 2008 and during the CAP reform in 2003, the Commission is involved in looking at ways of developing the direct payment system, especially regarding the issue of different levels of payment among Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For the post-2013 period, the Commission will study and assess the various options for reforming the direct payment system. The changes that must be made to the direct payment system and, more specifically, to the way in which the payments are distributed, in order to ensure fairer treatment among Member States and among the various categories of farmers, is at the centre of the debate on the future of the CAP. Nevertheless, there are still questions surrounding which methods and criteria to use in order to begin working towards providing more equitable support. One important matter concerning the future distribution of direct support among Member States will be to determine how to progress from the current situation to a more equitable distribution in the future and, at the same time, avoid major upheavals which could have significant economic consequences in certain regions or for certain production systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The CAP post-2013 will also have to deal with many environmental challenges, including the issue of soil degradation in Europe, which, today, is a very serious problem heightened by the issue of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Biodiversity is also a main priority for the sustainable management of natural resources within the Europe 2020 strategy. Although the goal to stop biodiversity loss by 2010 was not achieved, progress has clearly been made and the CAP has made a significant contribution to this.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the CAP supports sustainable soil management through direct payments subject to compliance with environmental requirements, especially good agri-environmental practices regarding soil erosion, soil organic matter and soil structure, as well as through specific rural development measures, especially payments for agri-environmental measures which go beyond the basic conditions set out under the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in order to ensure better soil management in Europe and to help maintain soil organic matter, the Commission tabled a proposal for a soil framework directive in 2006. One of the goals is to identify the causes of erosion and prevent it. This proposal also takes account of the tools that the CAP has to offer to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards biodiversity, today, the CAP refers to compliance with environmental requirements, including the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive, the infringement of which results in penalties. These penalties reduce direct aid and cut specific rural development measures, especially payments for the Natura 2000 regions as well as agri-environmental payments.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the CAP post-2013, the Commission is fully aware of the scope of environmental challenges to be met and is currently in the process of studying the different ways of better integrating environmental issues through all the CAP instruments, under the first and second pillars. The impact assessment in order to prepare the legislative proposals for the CAP post-2013 is under way, and a communication broadly outlining the future of the common agricultural policy is scheduled for November 2010. I shall table this communication to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 17 November. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I have said on several occasions that I think a flat-rate system – that is to say, a uniform amount per hectare for all these categories – is not an appropriate solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, based on the current historical reference system, we calculated subsidies on the basis of a production level from 10, 15 or 20 years ago. This is a system we wish to abandon and replace with objective criteria. However, attention must also be paid to ensuring that the balance is restored on a transitional basis and on a lean basis so that those hindered by these systems can incorporate this change economically. Therefore, my intention is indeed to propose objective criteria, which should be combined in some way with the starting position to ensure a manageable transition.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr La Via, the issues you are addressing can indeed be taken into account in the context of the second pillar of the rural development programme for agri-environmental measures. The intention is to maintain these kinds of agri-environmental measures, which take account of the specific nature of certain regions, and the area you are talking about is affected by erosion and it is possible certain shrubs will start fires there.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States will have the opportunity, through the regulation we shall also propose for post-2013, to take account of these specific issues in the context of environmental measures and to provide a specific support system in this area. That is why we believe that flexibility is useful in achieving a certain goal, that is to say, the sound management of natural resources, so that Member States can use specific instruments in the context of this second pillar. I believe that this issue is one that can be incorporated into this flexibility, which we can offer Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Romania and Bulgaria, during the accession negotiations for these Member States, a phasing-in system – in other words, a system for progressively increasing direct aid – was provided for by the treaty. In 2008, during the CAP health check, we said that during the post-2013 reform, we would take account of the issue of balancing the level of payments, perhaps more quickly. I therefore think that we should take account of this issue; the appropriate budgetary solution must be found to be able to speed up this process if necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would, however, also like to highlight the fact that the Court of Auditors’ report covers a two-year period, beginning shortly after the introduction of the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the first year of application of cross-compliance in 2005, the Commission has implemented a whole series of initiatives that aim, on the one hand, to help the Member States and, on the other, to ensure that they comply with their legal obligations. The Commission provides support through numerous exchanges on these subjects and discussions in the various forums dealing with these specific questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The talks on regulations have taken place in the relevant management committee, the most technical discussions have been held by a group of experts dealing specifically with cross-compliance, and discussions on the supervisory methods have taken place in certain specialist workshops.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2004, the Commission has, furthermore, regularly published guidance documents for the Member States that have helped them to adapt their national systems. The Commission monitors the Member States’ legal obligations based on information from audits carried out in the Member States themselves that the latter send them. If weaknesses are noted during the audits, financial corrections are made to the expenditure of the Member States in question, should a risk to the agricultural fund be identified. This was the case in the past and a certain number of procedures are consequently under way, including at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that all of these initiatives have led to a significant improvement in the running of the cross-compliance system, particularly since the observations made by the Court of Auditors in their 2007 report. Efforts will, of course, continue to be made in this area as the Commission places an emphasis on the smooth running of this system, which is an essential element of the common agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I also think that we have to be able to provide farmers with the means to communicate the efforts they are making, including when selling their products. In the quality system used for agri-foodstuffs which we are overhauling, we will also give farmers the possibility of using their products better to convey all the work they do and all the elements that must be taken into account, including issues related to biodiversity. This applies, in particular, to the consideration of the various agricultural production systems since this diversity in agricultural production systems means that we can also start to consider issues related to the environment and biodiversity. In the case of the common agricultural policy, supporting the diversity of production systems and direct contact between farmers, producers and consumers is another way for farmers, through the products that they sell, to better communicate all the conditions with which they have to comply.</p>
<p class="contents">Other methods are already being used. The links between agricultural production and rural tourism are another way for farmers to communicate all that they do to maintain the land and the landscape through the productive work that they carry out. I believe that all these tools, which are present within the framework of the common agricultural policy and which may be strengthened in the future, can be better used by farmers to convey the efforts they are making.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the other question. In my opinion, the rules and regulations regarding the environment or the activities that the farmer carries out to take into account the good management of natural resources are not distinct from the economic and social questions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the proposals that we will be making, which we will talk about after 17 November, the idea is not to move the focus of attention from the economic and social question to the environmental question alone, but to integrate the environmental question further in the farmer’s way of thinking so that, in the future, we can hopefully really talk about competitive agriculture. Farmers must be competitive from an economic and environmental point of view, in other words, in the way that they manage their natural resources, the soil and the water that they work with, while also considering social aspects related to creating or maintaining employment in a rural environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that we are not, as a result of focusing on the environmental aspect or rather the good management of natural resources within the framework of the common agricultural policy, going to compromise the farmer’s ability to be economically competitive by taking social aspects into account.</p>
<p class="contents">When we have the documents on the table, I will be able to prove this to you through concrete examples in proposals that we will be drafting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Greek authorities have not submitted a request to the Commission’s Directorate-General for Agriculture to modify the programme to include this guarantee fund.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to underline that, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States which propose the content of measures under the rural development programme, in accordance with the Rural Development Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the rural development programmes may be revised at the request of the Member States, after approval from the national monitoring committee and following the Commission’s examination and approval.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the Greek fishing sector, the national authorities have informed the Commission of their intention to set up a new instrument in order to help small businesses in the fishing sector.

<p class="contents">The Greek authorities have also informed the Commission of their intention to cofinance this instrument through the 2007-2013 operational programme for the fishing sector in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that there is a plan for the implementation of financial instruments in the fishing operational programme, the Commission supports the creation of such financial instruments in order to set up key measures for the operational programme, providing these comply with the legal provisions on the subject, in particular, Articles 34 and 37 of Regulation (EC) No 498/2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The amount that will be contributed to this instrument under the European Fisheries Fund could total EUR 35 million. The monitoring committee of the abovementioned operational programme will establish the criteria for selecting the beneficiary of these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greek authorities are finalising the action plan that will also include the conditions for the operation of the financial instrument.

The Commission and I have to admit that the aquaculture sector deserves greater recognition of its assets and values. The Commission therefore adopted a communication entitled ‘Building a sustainable future for aquaculture’ which identifies three strategic objectives for public authorities to pursue: promoting the competitiveness of the aquaculture sector; maintaining its sustainability; and improving its governance.</p>
<p class="contents">In this communication, the Commission identifies a number of measures to be taken by public authorities at all levels – EU, national and regional – in order to address the challenges faced by the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to support the sustainable development of European aquaculture, including shellfish production, the EU has in place comprehensive animal health and food safety legislation. We are very active at international level in establishing animal health and food safety standards for aquaculture products, including shellfish, that are essential for international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also established an EU reference laboratory for mollusc diseases, which receives annual financial support, to ensure coordination of national laboratories in the Member States and provide scientific support to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, with the concerned Member States, is also closely monitoring the abnormal mortalities observed in oysters over the past few years and has taken measures to control the virus that seems to be associated with these mortalities.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the overall strategy for EU aquaculture is concerned, the Commission would also like to recall the debate held in Parliament in June 2010, based on the report prepared by Guido Milana. The Commission appreciates Parliament’s support for sustainable aquaculture and for giving it a greater focus.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the view that sustainable aquaculture activities should be adequately supported through the common fisheries policy, and that this aspect should be covered under the reformed common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced of the need to help the sector organise itself more efficiently. In particular, we want to strengthen its producer and inter-branch organisations so as to better link production forecasts to market needs and ensure higher value for their products through marketing and labelling. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not satisfied with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Certified interim payments sent by Member States to the Commission amount to 5% of the overall EFF allocation. However, the data we have received recently from the Member States under annual reporting show that by the end of 2009, 18.2% of the overall EFF allocation was committed to specific projects. This is encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">Importantly, these figures include premiums not only under Axis 1 but also other Axes. Only Axis 4 ‘Sustainable Development for Fishing Areas’ is unfortunately lagging behind due to the long implementation process required to set up partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for this situation include, firstly, the late adoption of the EFF regulation; secondly, the delayed adoption of the operational programmes, some of which were adopted in the second half of 2008; thirdly, problems in setting up the management and control systems, the approval of which is the precondition for sending the payments to the Commission; and fourthly, the effects of the financial and economic crisis on the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">At this level of implementation, it is too early to state whether the EFF achieved its objectives. More information will be available with the interim evaluation due at the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also difficult to point to best practices in this respect as Member States have very different EFF amounts to spend and these amounts have been allocated to Axes in a diverse way which impacts on the rate of absorption. For example, Axis 1, ‘Measures for the adaptation of the Community Fishing Fleet’, is very easy to absorb. The others are not so easy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting of Directors-General organised by the Belgian Presidency last September as a remedy to the absorption problems, notably, to the problem of access to capital, the Commission recommended financial engineering techniques such as the use of facilitators or the simplification of procedures and application forms.</p>
<p class="contents">The next EFF Committee will have presentations on the use of these possibilities. The implementation of the Greek operational programme for 2007-2013 is delayed. I am sorry to say this, but it really is delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to 15 September 2010, actual payments only reached EUR 5 000 600, which amounts to 2% of the total EFF allocation. Two percent is a very small amount. This unsatisfactory situation results mainly from problems in setting up the management and control system and delays in the launching of key measures under the operational programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial crisis is also responsible for some delays, in particular, for measures under Axis 2.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently preparing its annual report on the implementation of the EFF in 2009 which will provide further information and background on the question posed by the honourable Member. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a general rule. Generally speaking, I have to admit that Mediterranean countries – the countries of the south – have bigger problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece has a special problem. We have to be very sure that we can help everybody in order to have better absorption. It is our plan to make an effort to simplify the rules for absorption. That is why we will have a funding line in the framework of our CFP reform which will be much easier for the Member States to absorb.</p>
<p class="contents">Referring to Mr Tsoukalas’s question about the Mediterranean Regulation, we have decided that this Mediterranean Regulation has to be implemented. We have had to implement this regulation since 1 June, and there is no way back. If we were to amend this regulation, we would need two or three years without any control and compliance system, so we are going to implement this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already cooperated with the Greek authorities. I have explained to them that they have to implement this regulation without any further delay. That means, of course, that all the provisions about special types of gear that are very heavy for the environment have to be met. It also means that we are going to exhaust the margins from our fund possibilities to give them funding in order to compensate them. This is something I would like to say referring to boat seines, to trawlers and to all types of gear: they have to give us a good example of compliance. We will do our best in order to exhaust our funding margins to make it possible for them to have better gear and to improve the selectivity of their gear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without constructive and fair cooperation with the Commission and with the Belgian Presidency, we would certainly not have achieved this result.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I am – as you can imagine – very pleased with the result, firstly because we have made significant improvements in relation to the old directive, and secondly because we have introduced new ways to encourage better payment practices. We have achieved the goal. Well, I would prefer to say that the course has been set for improving the liquidity of SMEs, the small and medium-sized enterprises, and for securing investments in new products, new jobs and new processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Why was it necessary to improve this directive? The legislation from 2000 was non-binding and not very efficient. In recent years, payment practices in almost all Member States have deteriorated, and this happened even before the financial and economic crisis. The reform was also requested by the small businesses that expressed their wishes within the framework of the Small Business Act. They wanted payment practices in Europe to be organised in a considerably more efficient manner.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the results, I can say, firstly, that we have trodden a new path. We have strict rules. As a matter of principle, invoices must be paid within 30 days with few exceptions, and these must be justified. We have introduced a higher late payment interest rate of 8%. We have set the recovery costs at a completely non-bureaucratic fixed amount of EUR 40, and we have made it easier than it was previously for small businesses to assert their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect to the new path, however, is the positive incentives and the new instruments, for example, the naming of customers with good payment practices, more information provided to small businesses concerning their rights, payment in instalments and the promotion of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation is also part of the ‘better regulation’ approach and it will also apply to the EU institutions. We are particularly proud of this, because – as I am sure you can imagine – not everyone was enthusiastic about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there were a few conflicts and I would like to mention some of these. Firstly, to start with, there were certainly major differences and a diversity of opinions in Parliament. The 100 amendments alone demonstrate that we first had to tussle together over this in Parliament, too. The Commission was certainly not always happy with our endeavours, including the extension of this to the business to business level, but I think that, overall, we have achieved a good result.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the Council that posed the problems. It is regrettable that the Council has not always fulfilled its objective of helping small businesses. I find that particularly regrettable for the relatively rich and well-structured countries like Germany and Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the professional organisations, I can only say that they were constructive, even though we, naturally, did not always accept or were not always able to go with their opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the next steps are that, after tomorrow’s vote, we expect the Council to conduct a final positive vote and then the Member States will be able to implement this legislation. We do not expect it to take two years for this to be implemented. Instead, we expect the Member States to begin to transpose it into national law as early as January of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonio Tajani, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, I believe this debate brings an important period of work to a close. The Commission, Parliament and the Council have decided to join together in giving a specific response to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by implementing part of the Small Business Act. A directive will, I hope, be adopted tomorrow which will enable a great many SMEs in the European Union to breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of unpaid bills has been increasing for too long: last year, there was an 8% increase, and today bad debts total EUR 300 billion. This is a problem that leaves SMEs in extreme difficulties. They are often in danger of closing down because they cannot survive due to the failure by large companies and, especially, public authorities, to honour their commitments. I believe the Union’s institutions are ready to give a positive response for the EU economy. When the legislation that we are about to adopt is fully in force, roughly EUR 180 billion will be put back into circulation, which means stimulating growth and innovation initiatives in favour of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, access to credit is key to the development and increased competitiveness of our businesses. I therefore believe that the decision to support this directive proposed by the Commission is of great importance to our economy, because it finally provides an answer to millions of European enterprises and gives hope to millions of workers who have jobs thanks to the existence of such enterprises, which form the backbone of our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for the important part it played in mediation, and I also thank all the Members of the European Parliament who have worked hard during this stage, starting with Mrs Weiler, Mr Baldassarre and Mr De Angelis, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs, who made it possible to find a positive solution.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the harmonisation of payment periods for public bodies, which will have to pay their invoices within 30 days, I think we will inject a substantial amount of extra cash into companies’ coffers. These rules will also have the effect of strongly encouraging those public authorities that delay their payments to bring their management methods up to date as well. In fact, when a public body acquires goods or services, it has already included the funds for that spending in its budget. Therefore, it should not be difficult to pay its creditors punctually. It should also be emphasised that shorter payment periods will result in savings for the public authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point in the agreement is that businesses themselves will have to pay their invoices within 60 days, unless agreed otherwise between the parties on terms that are not unfair to the creditor.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I must point out that the Member States will remain free to keep or adopt provisions that are more favourable to the creditor than is necessary under the directive. Consequently, this legislative document does not prevent Member States from adopting shorter payment periods or harsher penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, honourable Members, this new directive shows the Union’s determination to give Europe’s enterprises, and especially SMEs, a decisive boost to get through the economic crisis, which the Commission intends to tackle by means of a series of actions. We have just tabled the communication on innovation and next week, we will also table the one on the new industrial policy, and innovation and industrial policy cannot be put into practice without there being access to credit.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, Parliament, in agreement with the Council Presidency and the European Commission, will provide a concrete response to these expectations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this provision, Europe is putting an end to a procedure that has brought a great many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to their knees.

The current practice of delaying payments is pushing a great many small businesses towards bankruptcy, with adverse effects on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the provision is important: it sets the maximum payment period at 60 days, increases interest on late payments to 8% and outlaws the use of contractual terms that are unfair to the creditor. In other words, it lays down definite time periods, incentives and, most of all, no exceptions. These are measures designed to protect SMEs, stimulate our economic and productive fabric, and boost employment.</p>

Everyone involved in the work on the directive knows that reaching agreement was not easy, although all of the parties were aware of the importance of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the measures we are going to vote on tomorrow are good news for businesses and, in particular, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are going to be able to have their invoices paid more promptly. The scale of the problem of late payment is not the same in every Member State. However, we should not forget that businesses operate in the common European market and often conduct their activities in different Member States. Business operators should have a guarantee that their invoices will be paid on time irrespective of whether it is Poland, Spain, France or Malta.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I was asked by a journalist, today, if the directive has teeth and what principal instruments it has which will change behaviour in the market. Well, in my opinion, its teeth are to be found in the maximum and non-extendible 60-day settlement period for public authorities. It is extremely important that information about the directive’s main instruments reaches business operators. They have to know that they are entitled to compensation for the costs of recovering due amounts, that payment deadlines have been shortened and that contractual provisions which rule out interest on late settlements, rule out compensation or contain unjustified extended settlement deadlines are, quite simply, dishonest. Only then will businesses make use of the directive’s provisions and demand respect for settlement deadlines and other rights to which they are entitled. For payment delays should be the exception and not the rule. In my opinion, the directive is a strong signal from the European institutions that this is precisely how things should be. I would like to thank everyone for their cooperation and attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to go back over four important points achieved in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I am very pleased that there is a guarantee in place on equal treatment of the public and private sectors. The Commission was expecting heavier sanctions for the public sector, even though the latter works in the general interest. This was the result of ignorance about the reality of the state of the Member States’ public accounts, and could have resulted in a competitive disadvantage for public companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Another move forward is the extension of payment terms to 60 instead of 30 days for public health services, which have complex budgetary procedures forcing them to have longer payment terms, for which they cannot be held responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the subject of payment terms, it was essential to establish a ban on unfair contractual terms affecting creditors in contracts between companies, which often happens between a large group and a small and medium-sized enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and this relates primarily to the small and medium-sized enterprises which are victims of payment delays, the introduction of an 8% interest rate in the event of a delay and compensation to cover collection costs could encourage these companies to demand damages. Until now, they have tended to refuse to do so at the risk of this jeopardising anything.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore delighted to be able to vote on this bill which, I hope, will constitute real progress for the viability and good health of European businesses, progress that is needed not only for a more successful internal market, but also a fairer one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the first directive that can quite simply be explained in three sentences: firstly, public authorities will, as a matter of principle, have to pay within 30 days in future if no shorter payment targets have been agreed and if no special circumstances make a payment target of no more than 60 days necessary. Secondly, when agreeing payment targets, enterprises have freedom of contract within 60 days and payment targets of more than 60 days are no longer permitted, except if expressly agreed and if it does not pose a serious disadvantage to the creditor. Thirdly, if the aforementioned payment deadlines are exceeded, recovery costs of at least EUR 40 and interest of at least 8% above the European Central Bank base interest rate can be charged without a prior reminder.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will help small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to a great extent to improve their liquidity, and they will not need to accept as much credit from the banks. Debtors with a strong market presence will no longer be able to force small and medium-sized enterprises into granting longer payment deadlines, and that is a good thing. Furthermore, individual Member States will not only be able to retain shorter payment target deadlines in the form that has been customary up to now; we assume that, in fact, they will be retained, because we cannot imagine that the Late Payments Directive will lead to a deterioration in payment practices within the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Enterprises that do business within Europe know that, in future, their claims will be settled after no more than 60 days. This is a huge step forward and a further step towards the completion of the European internal market. We can be very satisfied with the adoption of this legislation. It will help small and medium-sized enterprises and it will help the European internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I include in that both the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot of talk about smart regulation at the moment, but I think this is a classic example of smart regulation. For a start, it goes to the heart of problems that many small businesses are experiencing in an economy in which they are finding conditions very difficult at the moment. We must insist that Member States implement this proposal as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission rightly analysed the problems and successes of the previous directive, and I want to remark here that this was the first directive where the agreement of the committee coordinators to invite the Commission to present its full impact assessment of any proposal was carried out to the full. We had a very comprehensive impact assessment which clearly identified the areas which needed to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, the insistence now that public authorities in particular also have to conform to the standards applied to the private sector and cannot abuse their position against small suppliers by complying with these requirements, is absolutely central. This is the major achievement, and I particularly want to thank the Belgian Presidency – and I see that they are represented here this evening – because they resisted demands from some Member States to try and get themselves a carve-out from this 60-day requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">We said to the Belgian Presidency that there is no point whatsoever in having this directive if you allow this to happen. It is devoid of meaning if you let public authorities off the hook.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this is a good example of smart regulation, but may I just conclude by making two final observations. First of all, we must get this implemented properly and consistently in every Member State; and secondly, it must result in a change of culture which says that it is simply no longer acceptable for large customers to exploit small businesses by paying them late. I think this is what this directive will achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is all too common to find that public authorities themselves are bad payers, and they often cause otherwise healthy companies to fail and seriously damage the competitiveness of our firms. They can bring about a terrible chain reaction with major social repercussions which, in the end, may sometimes backfire on the public authority which gave rise to this trail of damage, through increases in prices, costs and, consequently, spending.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of all this, it is hardly surprising if a small business is forced into bankruptcy due to a lack of liquid assets, especially in periods of economic crisis and recession such as the one we are now experiencing. It has therefore been decided that severe penalties should be imposed for such late payments. The new parameters laid down in the adopted report include keeping contractual freedom in negotiations between private enterprises, but imposing time limits (30 + 30 days); setting the term within which public authorities must pay private enterprises at 30 days; and introducing a new rule for large corporations – such as those operating in the postal service, energy and transport sectors – which compete with private companies even though they are publicly funded, in that they are equated to private companies and are therefore subject to the rules of the private market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now for the Member States to implement this provision as swiftly as possible so as to reinvigorate those companies that are still in difficulties today, as the Commissioner and a number of my fellow Members have emphasised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, the tabled amendments make the original proposal clearer, which is an improvement, and, on the other, as opposed to the original objectives, they weaken the dissuasive forces seen in the original proposal, especially on the part of the authorities. Derogation from the 30 days is particularly not allowed in the case of public authorities. We must apply a background regulation which makes this deadline possible. As regards sanctions, enterprises and authorities must be treated equally. The fundamental objective is the recovery of the economy and prompt payment in order to facilitate the financial stability of small and medium-sized enterprises. No provisions have been made to facilitate this in the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Abusing their significant market share and dominance, large multinational companies force their domestic partners into contracts stipulating 90 or 120 day payment terms, with possible notional sanctions if missed. However, the vulnerable supplier does not dare enforce the sanctions even when clearly supported by the law, for fear of losing orders. In order to avoid this, we should have statutory regulations in every case, stipulating mandatory late payment penalty charges, with fines to be imposed even on the creditor when such penalties are not charged. Thank you very much for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to thank Commissioner Tajani, who, in a way seldom seen before, accommodated the requests and the justified concerns of Parliament in the work of the Commission in an unbelievably open manner. This really was a very positive new development in the cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. In this regard, I can only endorse what has already been said about this: this is smart regulation and we could do with more of it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that we in the European Parliament were also able to help to enable this directive ultimately to end up in the Council with this result, which has already been described by many fellow Members as positive. Between the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we followed a common cross-committee strategy. We worked closely together, including across the group divide, and I must say that, as a representative of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), I would like not only to offer my thanks, but also to express my respect for the rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, for the fact that – although at the start she had a different content defined – as rapporteur for this House, she ultimately represented the vote, the majority opinion of the Committee, in a very serious and very emphatic manner. Without that, this success would not have been possible, despite the significant work performed by the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just like to mention one point. There is one area that we have so far mentioned only very briefly and that is the EUR 40 that it will be possible, in future, to charge as a flat rate in the event of a late payment. I believe that when this measure is implemented in the Member States, when consumers get to know about it, we will have to attempt to explain this many times, because in the case of a completely normal delivery of goods, EUR 40 is actually a good means of preventing these late payments that we want to put a stop to in Europe. I believe that the Commission and the Member States will still have to exert their influence on public opinion in order to enable consumers to understand why this is necessary in the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is excellent legislation, and I would like, in particular, to compliment my colleague, Barbara Weiler, on the manner in which she brought this through. It is absolutely fantastic work and an example of the type of good legislation that we can bring through. It will provide a better flow of money around our economies and therefore is good for business, small businesses and society in general. More importantly, it will help us with the big issue facing us all at the moment, which is the provision of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive will provide clear strong principles that can be communicated in markets and Member States to the effect that late payments will no longer be tolerated. This should create greater liquidity. Companies getting paid promptly are more likely to be able to avail themselves of credit, grow their businesses and generate and create employment. Furthermore, I know from recent insolvency court cases in my own country, Ireland, and particularly in the construction sector, that the many late payments end up becoming bad debts and bring companies to their knees. That has been the case for a company very close to me, and mass redundancies have resulted from this.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the provision on positive naming. I think this is a good idea. It rewards good practice and creates incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget farmers. Farmers have been suffering from failure to receive payments in time from processors and supermarkets. The multiples have been winning. Hopefully, these laws will give them a stronger negotiating position so that this vulnerable group in the food chain can also be better protected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I think that we can be satisfied with the final form.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the original Commission proposal, which seemed to me a little divorced from practice, this new amendment has managed to move closer to the reality that prevails in commercial and contractual relationships. The proposal also managed, in particular, to simplify and clarify what I consider a fundamental shift towards the better intelligibility of standards. If there is anything in particular that is worth highlighting, it is the fact that, unlike the original Commission proposal, we managed to retain the principle of contractual freedom in commercial and contractual relationships. At the same time, it is very good news that we managed to put through a provision which stipulates that European Union institutions have the same status as public authorities in the Member States. So, from now on, these institutions will have to pay on time, which will be particularly appreciated by the beneficiaries of European funding. I am also very happy that we managed to delete the very ridiculous provision that ordered public authorities which pay one day late to pay a flat penalty of 5% of the full amount owed in addition to the standard rate of interest for delayed payment. I do not need to emphasise the kind of impact that this provision would have on already strained public budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur and my colleagues for the amount of effort they have put into finding a joint compromise on the form of this report. I think that it was energy well expended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Commissioner Tajani for his personal commitment, the Council for its flexibility and, of course, my colleagues, for reaching this compromise in first reading that is so important for us in business. In particular, I thank my friend Małgorzata Handzlik of the EPP.</p>
<p class="contents">Having been a businesswoman myself before entering this House, I am fully aware that late payment is a serious issue for small companies. Sometimes, it can lead to bankruptcy. Other times, at best, it can be a cause of uncertainty and can damage business.</p>
<p class="contents">Limiting the payment period for public administrative authorities to 60 days is, of course, a major achievement, since public authorities, as Commissioner Tajani has just said, simply have to process payments, so it is a matter of reducing bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also glad that we have introduced BtoB as small businesses now have a clear legal framework to enable them to make claims for late payment from big companies, something they at times did not dare to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have found a good balance between respect for freedom of contract – which is all important – and providing small companies with the necessary tools to avoid being held hostage by bigger companies or public administration. Instead of spending their time chasing debts, they can now devote their resources to effectively exercising their right to receive payment, interest and compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this agreement should be a tool to deter late payments rather than a tool to enforce collection of late payments and, as Malcolm Harbour said, to really create a culture of paying on time which will make for a better functioning internal market and, of course, benefit all the stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">We have shown that Parliament can take concrete measures that can really make a difference, create more jobs and assist SMEs. Now, the overriding issue is for the Council and the Member States to assume their responsibility to make sure that these rules are properly enforced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this critical time for the Union’s economy, a very serious and substantiated effort is being made to strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises. We all know that late payments are often the reason why these companies go bankrupt and jobs are lost. We have managed, with a great deal of difficulty, coupled with an even greater willingness to compromise so that jobs can be saved, to broker what may be a rather harsh, but which is certainly a necessary and fair agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure you understand that, as a Greek, I personally take an even greater interest in and am especially concerned by this issue. The fact that Greece has agreed to payment margins which might be termed ‘narrow’ illustrates that we really are committed to turning round the situation in my country. The general 30-day payment rule means, in very simple terms, that our internal administrative auditing procedures for approving payments need to be changed. The 60-day exception, especially in sectors such as health, gives us a margin for handling chain payment procedures which are not always easy to audit.</p>
<p class="contents">I want us to succeed – and I believe that we shall – because we owe it to workers and businessmen in Greece and to workers and businessmen in Europe.

I regret, however, that in the final compromise, we did not manage to ensure equal status for all parties and to maintain a level playing field both for public and for private entities. While the payment periods for contracts between businesses should, in principle, be limited to 60 calendar days – and this period may be extended in exceptional cases – in the case of contracts with public authorities, including municipalities and towns, the periods should not exceed 30 calendar days. This seems to me to be wrong, because all players should operate under the same conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The justification that public authorities are at an advantage in that they can obtain financing on more attractive terms than businesses, or are less dependent on building stable relationships, may be valid for national authorities or European institutions, but is definitely not valid for most smaller towns and rural municipalities, not only in the Czech Republic, but throughout Europe. The resulting proposal is therefore largely discriminatory towards such smaller towns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The economic and political consequences of late payment on national markets and especially the European market are obvious to everyone. The ongoing economic recession has worsened the situation, damaging competitiveness and profitability even further and posing a serious threat to the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which form an essential part of the European market, create wealth and play a decisive role in creating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">This political choice by the European Commission is a step in the right direction, the same one that Mr Monti referred to in his report when he spoke of the need to intervene to make the business climate more favourable for SMEs. As for whether the public authorities will comply promptly or whether the 8% interest rate will act as a deterrent, I cannot hide the fact that I am somewhat doubtful as to the outcome, when I think of certain regions in my own country and other Member States that will really struggle to comply with the new rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this new approach can be a real opportunity for change. Now it is important to monitor the transposition of the directive into the various internal legal systems, with the involvement of regional and local authorities, to ensure that it is carried out uniformly everywhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Everyone here recognised that the present directive, which recasts the previous directive that is more than 10 years old, aims to put an end to a widespread problem: the European Union and late payment. Such delays are unreasonably long in some Member States when they involve public administration. This practice has massive negative effects on economic life, whether in terms of small and medium-sized enterprises or the internal market, and they cannot be tolerated any longer, especially given that we are experiencing the kind of economic and financial crisis that we are at present.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislative amendment brings coherence and sense to the plan for reviving the European economy and implementing the ‘Small Business Act’. This directive is sure to improve the liquidity of companies. Creditors will have an effective and efficient tool for exercising their rights against ‘bad payment behaviour’. With this directive in place, reprehensible practice by public entities will be the exception. Public administrative bodies should set a good example by paying their bills for goods and services within a month. Now it is up to the institutions involved, the Council and the Member States to ensure that the transposition of this directive is carried out as swiftly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">An agreement has now been made with the Council to update the Late Payments Directive, which would set a general deadline of 30 days for payments between businesses and public corporations. In my view, however, it is also important to recognise a general freedom of contract in business transactions between enterprises, and that is why I think that it is a good idea if payment periods in business transactions between companies can also be extended to 60 days, if that is the view of both parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The prospect of extending payment periods for public authorities is a more limited one, and late payment in public administration, in particular, has become a huge problem in some EU countries. In Greece, for example, the average payment period has had to be stretched to as much as 165 days (although things are getting better, as our Greek fellow Member pointed out here). In Spain, it is 138 days, and in Italy 128.</p>
<p class="contents">Late payment has meant that finance companies have come to benefit, because businesses have been forced to sell their accounts receivable to speed up their revenue cycle. These financial services cost money, and we need to point out that companies have a basic right to receive the money owed to them without having to pay any middlemen and incurring additional costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreed interest for late payment, the reference rate plus 8%, is acceptable, but the EUR 40 minimum recovery charge might become seen as excessive for small and, for example, repeat deliveries. We have to remember that arrears charges must be reasonable, which is to say, tied to the reasonable costs that the creditor has actually incurred. Despite these marginal comments, the Late Payments Directive will certainly be of most benefit mainly to small and medium­sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Improving the system in this respect is an ambitious objective, but it is also necessary to ensure that employees and suppliers are paid on time. The new regulations on late payment in commercial transactions should facilitate and speed up the process for companies to recover the money they are due. I believe that all the parties involved must be on an equal footing and the rules must apply to all.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last three years, more than 30 000 SMEs have ceased operating due to financial deadlock. One of the causes is late payment by the state for products and services.</p>

In particular, smaller entrepreneurs will appreciate the fact that state authorities and institutions linked to the state budget will also no longer owe money for many months for goods and services, and will perhaps pay within 30 days.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Council has agreed with the new fee of EUR 40 for recovering payments, and also supports an increased interest rate on arrears of 1% compared with now. I just think that it is not feasible when recovering minimal amounts which are due more to errors and which do not have a visible effect on the ability of companies to pay. Fortunately, this does not relate to late payments by consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that my Committee and the Council have agreed with the fact that it is not possible to introduce a dual system of penalties for the private and public sectors, as the Commission proposed. I noted the paradox that, for example, hospitals would have to pay their private creditors higher penalties than they themselves could require of their debtors.

This is a necessary, but not sufficient measure, as we are all aware of the ways in which dominant companies can exercise pressure. This is a very important and necessary measure, but it is not sufficient. Further control is very important, since it is well-known that small enterprises, including those in the agricultural sector, are particularly disadvantaged within the food supply chain, as also mentioned in the Bové report. They are exposed to the dominance of buyers and large chain stores. Mrs Weiler’s report brings an important contribution to this as well, but further efficient monitoring and control are required.

<p class="contents">However, we have one thing in common – late payments create enormous problems for small and medium-sized enterprises.

The first group comprises public bodies at various levels, from local authorities to municipal authorities and regional bodies, all the way up to the state. The second group are the large foreign contractors who often get small sub-contractors into impossible situations, particularly in the construction and agricultural sectors. Small firms usually do not have the sort of financial reserves that would allow them to pay their employees for several months without receiving payment for work carried out. Let us all hope, therefore, that the new directive will bring the expected improvements, and that the deliberate holding back of funds will become a thing of the past in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For small businesses in particular, it is unacceptable to have to wait several months for invoices to be paid. I am therefore very pleased that today, we intend to lay down fixed payment deadlines and reminder charges for both private and public contracting authorities. With this Europe-wide harmonisation, we will really help to improve commercial transactions throughout Europe, which will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.</p>

That is the case irrespective of which party someone belongs to, and it is not dependent on what branch of industry you talk to, either. So we have broad agreement. I would also like to thank my fellow Members who have indicated their agreement with this result this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention three more aspects. As I said at the beginning of the debate, we will set the wheels in motion tomorrow. However, we will have to look very closely at whether the relaxations that we have introduced for micro-businesses, for agricultural undertakings, for example, and for artisan companies, are actually sufficient to enable these enterprises to obtain the money they are owed. We will have to examine very carefully how the limited freedom of contract will work. That is something new in the European internal market that we are now going to try out and that all of us also more or less support. We will need to examine whether the 8% late payment interest rate is adequate; Parliament would have liked it to be 9%. We will see how it works, and I would like to ask the Commission to pay close attention in order to ensure that, during the process of implementation, the Member States do not water down the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I also see definite success on the horizon. I have heard that Spain has already produced new national legislation following our methods, and I know that the same is true of other Member States. In any case, our Committee will monitor the situation or carry out an impact assessment according to a directive, so that the Member States also know that, when the parliamentary term comes to an end, we will know who has implemented the improved payment practices as we intended and who has not. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this result, including the Belgian Presidency, which has perhaps not received enough recognition for its contribution. We know how efficiently and constructively you conducted the negotiations – a small country, but I would say a country with very intelligent and efficient methods for achieving results in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once this directive has come into force, it will punish authorities which are bad payers and offer business people important leverage for recovering their debts.</p>
<p class="contents">Such legislation was a necessity in order to balance the market and offer the private sector guarantees that the authorities are a player with equal powers, which can be held to account when they break the rules of the game. The directive offers a reasonable timeframe of 30 days for making payments, with derogations of up to 60 days in special cases such as hospitals, not to mention compensation and late-payment interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the form of the directive which was voted on is more lenient towards authorities which are bad payers than the European Commission’s initial proposal, it offers adequate support both to small and medium-sized companies and to large companies which, in many European Union Member States, encounter difficulties in recovering their money for the services they have provided.</p>

The current trend is to pay the invoice immediately before it is due or when it is overdue. The measures contained in the proposal submitted could lead to a new business culture in which timely payments are the rule and late payments are considered to be an unacceptable abuse of the customer and a breach of contract. A new rate of 1% could be imposed for reimbursing the costs of recovering late payments – for individuals, businesses and public authorities – whereas in the event of late payments of individual instalments, the interest rate and penalties would be calculated exclusively for late payments. A fixed period of 30 days is proposed as the payment period. Exceptions are allowed only in special circumstances. Here, it is necessary to define clearly what counts as a special circumstance. The rapporteur proposes setting a period of 60 days as the maximum payment period for public authorities, which I fully support. The interest on late payments should be progressive in order to motivate the debtor to pay the amount due as soon as possible. The legalistic approach, including penalties, should, in my opinion, be supplemented further by so-called soft measures by the Member States: for example, the promotion of electronic invoices, the adjustment of payment regimes for a large volume of work or services or positive publicity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Back in February this year, a draft law by the CSD was approved in Parliament which establishes that the state is to begin paying default interest when the delay in payment exceeds the limits set out in the contract or in law (30 or 60 days). The CSD has also been advocating the possibility of compensation of claims between state debts to companies and corporate debts to social security or the tax authorities for several years, attempting to make life easier for companies that, not being paid by the state, are still being confronted with the obligation to pay its social and tax contributions. We are therefore completely on board with the text that has now been approved, and which will establish an average period of 30 days for the state to pay its debts to suppliers. This term may be extended to 60 days in specific cases. It will also establish the obligation to pay default interest for late payment These are rules based on absolute justice, and they can help to alleviate the situation of many companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions is one of the most positive examples of this type. Late payment for the receipt of goods and services is a practice that is noticeable in Member States. Furthermore, on several occasions, it is public bodies, which should theoretically have no problems in settling bills, that act in this way. This is a significant impediment to the activities of businesses and prevents them from developing. This sort of practice must be brought to an end. The biggest winners from this directive will not only be businesses that operate wholly within the borders of a particular Member State but also especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be able to export goods and services to other Member States without needing to worry that they will need to wait several months to be paid. All European consumers will, for their part, be winners from the increased competition and supply that the new rules will ensure. The directive is a significant step towards the improvement of the payment culture in Europe. By taking these sorts of decisions, we are building a Europe that is an attractive place for investors and our own businesses. It is also essential for us going forward to take courageous decisions to encourage development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Small and medium-sized enterprises therefore serve as banks for public corporations or large businesses. The internal debts of small and medium-sized enterprises accumulate, giving rise to an economic poison in the form of invoices with long payment periods which are hard to enforce. This reinforces economic inequality and also significantly reduces competition. Small and medium-sized enterprises are forced to cover long payment periods with credit, which they always get under worse terms than could be obtained from banks by large firms or the public sector. The new conditions and rules for all parties significantly help small and medium-sized enterprises to defend themselves against this disguised credit. The fixed interest rate for late payments, proposed at 8%, is an adequate deterrent for large firms too, the fixed 30-day payment period is balanced for supplier and purchaser, and the 30-day delivery verification period prevents abuse of the verification procedure for extending the payment period. Above all, as regards the European rules, they prevent the public sector and large companies from distorting the legislation adopted at a national level in the Member States. I sincerely thank the rapporteur for this extremely valuable report and excellent result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kristalina Georgieva, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, I would like first to express my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and to all those who are affected by the industrial accident that occurred on 4 October in Ajka, Hungary. I also would like to recognise the decisive and effective actions of the Hungarian authorities to contain the impact of the spill and its spread from the rivers Torna and Marcal downstream into the Danube and into neighbouring countries, and also to prevent the risks of new spills by building additional protection walls.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the opportunity to thank Minister Sándor Pintér, the Hungarian Minister of the Interior in charge of civil protection, for all the efforts of the various services involved and for the bravery and dedication of the first responders.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just come back from the site of the accident where I witnessed both the catastrophic impact of the red sludge on people, homes, land and the ecology of the region, and the significant efforts of the Hungarian response teams.</p>
<p class="contents">While the causes of the disaster and its full impact are still under investigation, it is clear that the most severe damage is in the immediate vicinity of the accident and the directly affected human settlements, agricultural land and ecological systems. 7 000 inhabitants, mainly from the villages of Kolontár and Devecser, have been affected. Nine people died and 130 have been injured, about 35 of them first responders.</p>
<p class="contents">Around 1 000 hectares of agricultural land and four Natura 2000 sites have been affected, and there has been substantial damage to flora and fauna in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information provided by the Hungarian authorities, the red mud does not contain high concentrations of heavy metals and is therefore not considered as hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, dust from the sludge presents a health risk and therefore, precautionary measures are necessary for the population and the emergency personnel in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hungarian authorities have deployed massive human resources and equipment. The day I was there, yesterday, there were around 1 200 rescuers from the civil protection, environment, health and police departments working tirelessly on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to stress that the emergency phase is broadly over now, because the damage downstream to the Danube is stopped and the risk of a second spill contained. Steps are now being taken towards the next phase of decontamination and rehabilitation. Machinery and staff continue to work on the removal of the red sludge and its disposal in appropriate sites. Houses and structures beyond repair are being demolished; protection dikes have been built to prevent the risk of a second spill and are being reinforced. Monitoring is being carried out and information on precautionary and sanitary measures is being provided to the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the EU response. On 7 October, the Hungarian authorities triggered the civil protection mechanism requesting an EU expert team. It was deployed immediately for a week in the affected area. This team delivered a number of suggestions for measures to further enhance the Hungarian Government’s comprehensive remedial and recovery plan. These include: minimising the further spread of red mud via air and water; steps to assess the risk to human health and mitigate them; steps to assess the risk of further damage and mitigate them; environmental monitoring; and remediation and revitalisation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond this initial emergency response, the Commission stands ready to deploy the civil protection mechanism to assist further with expertise, as well as equipment, if the Hungarian authorities so require.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the structural funds could be mobilised to address the consequences of the disaster, and that was made clear. The government was informed of that. If they were to decide they wanted to redirect funds, the Commission would look favourably on such requests.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the mobilisation of the EU solidarity fund is very unlikely to be possible in this case due to the strict conditions of the current regulation, under which only natural disasters can be considered; these conditions also include a 0.6% threshold of damage to GDP, and that is unlikely to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the Commission is very clearly concerned about the need to make the solidarity fund faster and expand its scope. It is very difficult to explain to citizens in Member States why we can help people in Pakistan immediately, but we cannot help the people living in the Ajka area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also looking into the question of environmental legislation. At a first analysis, the existing EU waste legislation, the directive on waste from extractive industries, the upcoming Industrial Emissions Directive replacing the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, the directive on the control of major accident hazards, the so-called Seveso Directive, and the Waste Framework Directive provide a sufficient framework for regulating potentially dangerous industrial activities and managing waste in a way that does not pose risks to human health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the view that the focus must not be on new legislation but on ensuring the proper implementation and enforcement of existing legislation by all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have environmental legislation that deals with post-accident damage, namely the Environmental Liability Directive. It applies to the installation and consequently, the necessary remedial measures that have to be undertaken, by the liable operator who should bear the full cost of remediation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report on the implementation of the environmental liability directive shows a rather slow take-up of the financial security instruments to cover for liabilities, and this is the case in Ajka. We are considering how to strengthen this in the future and, if necessary, make this mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Ajka sludge accident, the Commission will take stock of the lessons learnt at European level and, in particular, the appropriateness and the correct implementation and enforcement of European environmental legislation; the measures needed to make sure that the affected population and industry at risk are covered by appropriate insurance schemes; and the way forward to strengthen European disaster monitoring and response capacity and enhance our instruments to express solidarity with our members and our citizens in moments of need.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning this last point, I would like to mention that next week, the Commission will adopt the communication on the reinforcement of EU disaster response capacity which will address the response to various types of disasters, including industrial accidents, and will strengthen our capacity to respond collectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for its strong support in this area of strengthening EU disaster response capacity. I look forward to hearing your questions on the specific case in Hungary as well as any comments you might want to make on the broader issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that she visited Budapest and expressed the same thoughts there. This is obviously welcome by those who have been working on damage control day and night for more than a week. You have just talked about the possibility of mobilising structural funds. I would like to ask you to elaborate on this in somewhat more detail in your response, in your closing thoughts, and let us know what you mean by this.</p>
<p class="contents">You also mentioned that you are thinking about mandatory assistance as well. I would also like to learn a little more about what this would involve. I believe that this tragedy which happened in Hungary, as well as the tragedies which happened in the past 10 years in various areas, from Spain through France to Belgium, are warning us that such industrial disasters can happen and be repeated at any time, anywhere. At the same time, this disaster also focused our attention on the fact that the Union has no means available to it, and I think we should phrase this clearly and unambiguously. Yes, it has no means to handle such situations. You have also referred to this earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the time has come to review the list of hazardous substances, and I think red sludge should be put back on the list. I also think the time has come to impose mandatory liability insurance on plants engaged in hazardous activities, which happen to be the plants which are largely responsible for the large industrial disasters of the past 10 years. And I also think that the time has come for us to establish a new financial system that can provide efficient assistance, namely, real and rapid assistance for the affected country. We will soon hand over our proposal in this respect to the Commissioner, and I hope she will show the same open attitude in receiving it as in her introductory thoughts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tragic event in Hungary is also a loss for Europe. The purpose of today’s debate is to turn the solidarity intentions of the EU into concrete assistance, and to think about the prevention of future environmental disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Fellow Members, I propose that we transform the solidarity fund. It would be practical to extend the range of support to industrial disasters as well and to reduce the threshold of the monetary equivalent of the damage. This is even more justified in view of what we have heard from Mrs Georgieva, that we have used only 10% of this fund in the past 10 years. Today’s debate must also provide answers to five technical safety issues related to long-term environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, all the reservoirs still in operation or abandoned should undergo a technical and environmental review, according to uniformly established EU principles. Member States should enforce compliance with the jointly established technical discipline, and the European Commission should verify compliance. Secondly, industrial units which do not store red sludge appropriately should be included in the category of hazardous industrial plants. Thirdly, Member State implementation of the Mining Waste Directive should be accelerated. Fourthly, as I also proposed in a written question, the EU should support research programmes aimed at recycling red sludge. Fifthly, during the Hungarian Presidency, as part of the Danube strategy, we must start to clear up and recultivate the industrial and mining waste reservoirs in the catchment area of the Danube.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, the only industrial activities allowed in 21st century Europe should be those which ensure the decontamination and recycling of their waste. This is how Europe can be made safer and the natural environment more habitable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are also some issues that need to be discussed in the light of this disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, thank you, Commissioner, for the information that a communication will be issued next week on the emergency intervention measures, which are, of course, essential. We should be in a position to come to the aid of our fellow citizens in the event of natural and industrial disasters alike.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am not happy that this very toxic sludge – the television reports have included images of people who have burns as a consequence of coming into contact with the sludge – is to be classified as inert waste. That is wholly unacceptable. The Commission must initiate a review of the list of dangerous waste products, with a view to including the sludge and, at the same time, establishing whether other types of product could be added to the list.</p>
<p class="contents">The key issue here is the <span class="italic">de facto</span> implementation of Community law, and in this regard, Commissioner, I feel that it is vital that the Commission should have the resources necessary to monitor the actual implementation of Community legislation. This does not simply mean transposing directives, but rather means implementing the legislation in all businesses within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve that aim, the Commission requires supervisory powers that it clearly does not have at present. We do not need more rules; we actually need to apply existing Community law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to help the people. What happened there is dreadful. Yet I wish to make three comments following your speech, Commissioner Georgieva.</p>
<p class="contents">You said, or your words implied, that, at first glance, most European legislation is being properly observed. Yet I wish to ask the Commission to carry out an in-depth investigation. As Mrs Lepage pointed out, there is a wide range of European legislation: the Mining Waste Directive, the directive on emissions from certain industrial installations and the Environmental Liability Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">This accident was able to happen, and yet apparently all the environmental legislation was observed? That is impossible; there has to have been a mistake somewhere. Did the Hungarian authorities shoulder their responsibility? Did they carry out sufficient checks? Therefore, I think that a kind of stress test, an investigation, is needed into the application of European legislation and whether this has been carried out correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, our friends from the Hungarian Greens have insisted that an independent investigation commission be sent to the area to establish objective data on the pollution. I do not believe that such an investigation can be carried out by the Hungarian authorities alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the issue of inspections. Environmental inspections are vitally important. We have already debated the subject in Parliament, and we adopted a resolution on it on 20 November 2008. We want to see a legislative framework for these inspections as a matter of urgency. Environmental inspections must be carried out; there must be not only inspections by national inspectorates but also, in particular, control and supervision of the supervisors; control of the controllers. We urgently need sound environmental inspection throughout Europe and, in particular, proper implementation of the environmental directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Chief Executive Officer was arrested even before the investigation was launched, well before it could show any results. The investigation will determine the responsibility of the company, but I think we can already draw one conclusion. Responsibility lies not only with the company but also with the authorities and local governments. Damage control is very important, and the Commissioner has spoken about the most important things we have to do in that respect, but prevention is at least as important. In Hungary, the administration, the central government administration, and even local governments, are not sufficiently prepared to prevent such disaster situations. Administration is extremely fragmented, it has no means, and there are neither human nor financial resources to prevent disasters. I propose that we draw the conclusion and take this into account in terms of local government and administrative reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, I have listened to you carefully, and what I heard made me want to say that up until now, it seems to me that the most effective action, whether by the national or the European authorities, has been to ensure silence.</p>
<p class="contents">Industrial accidents can and should be avoided. There is European legislation for this, and it seems clear that the law has been violated. There has been inefficiency, delayed response and neglect of those affected, particularly the most disadvantaged. People have died, and many are still under the threat of what might happen to their health. It is impossible to calculate the total costs, and it is immoral to fail to take care of victims.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask you, Commissioner, how it is that we can know the news through reports from Hungarians, yet the authorities see and tell us nothing? That is why I would like to ask a few questions. How can the bank be allowed to put pressure on people with a mortgaged house in the affected area, asking them to pay what they owe, since their houses have lost value? How can you consent to telephone operators cutting off the only means of contact for people in this disaster zone? How is it that the company responsible for this disaster is already back in business?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, you spoke of mitigating the effects of the sludge. I would like to ask: what are the reasons for continuing to play down the true scale of this human tragedy? This way, it seems as though we are always starting from square one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has become clear with the passage of time, in this case, too, it is innocent people from the affected communities who are paying the highest price for the carelessness of those who should have taken care of the upkeep and safety of the reservoir, and therefore also the safety of these houses. I am pleased that among the first to come forward with voluntary offers of assistance to the affected citizens were rescue specialists and volunteer firemen from Slovakia. Slovaks did not hesitate to leave their own homes and families immediately in order to help the unfortunate people affected in neighbouring Hungary.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that it will take a very long time to heal the wounds in Kolontár and Devecser, but we must now give thought to the fact that around Europe, there may be more of these neglected, hazardous reservoirs containing chemicals and other waste. One was even found in an impromptu inspection by the Ministry of Agriculture in my own country. It seems that the depositing of industrial or mining waste in dumps is not a good solution for society or for the environment. We should therefore start to consider seriously the demand for every industrial or mining activity to be licensed only when the resulting waste will be immediately and completely destroyed or neutralised as part of the manufacturing or production cycle. Only in this way will we be able to prevent similar accidents to the one that is now affecting the inhabitants of Kolontár and Devecser. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, we had the same situation when we discussed the Slovak language law.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, in the experts’ opinion, the disaster at Kolontár was the result of uninhibited profit making and a serious breach of technological discipline. Unfortunately, after two weeks of investigations, the people responsible for the accident have still not been identified, and there is less and less hope of getting to the truth. What makes the situation even more serious is that the victims cannot even count on the Solidarity Fund, as this is not a natural disaster, and the value of the estimated damage does not exceed the prescribed EUR 591 million, but it is a case of serious human negligence. In addition to this, commercial banks are sending out the most outrageous demands to owners of mortgaged properties, asking them to repay all their debts immediately, in one amount, in view of the fact that residential properties in the region have become completely worthless. This reminds me of Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, who said in his editorial of 4 September that credit is a drug, banks are drug dealers, and the central bank is the Godfather.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to solve this situation urgently, it is essential to have European social solidarity that can mitigate the damages. It is our duty to provide the victims with every assistance, to help them restore their normal living conditions as soon as possible. In addition, the Criminal Code should be made stricter without delay, to avoid the occurrence of similar disasters taking human lives in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, back to the matter at hand. I believe this debate is too important to try to score cheap political points from it.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to express my solidarity with, and my sympathy for, the victims, particularly those who are helping and risking their lives to halt and ward off this disaster. However, it is now important for us to keep a cool head and carry out an analysis of the current situation and, above all, to attribute responsibility. I fully agree with the Commissioner when she says that we need to see whether the directives that we have produced for such incidents here in Europe have been properly transposed and implemented. That is the first step and, in this regard, I am very eager to see the Commission’s report and what conclusions it will draw.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, I would like to ask the Commission to be much more stringent and much swifter in calling to account the Member States that do not transpose the law that we lay down here. That is the Commission’s job, and I would say that it is sometimes a bit lax in doing this. In this regard, the Commission would be well advised to remind the Member States of their responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, here in Europe, we have the principle that the polluter should pay. I believe that is a very good and important principle, and I do not think that the responsibility for such incidents should be passed to the public purse. I therefore consider the call for an extension of the Solidarity Fund to be unjustified, because we have an obvious polluter here and this polluter should pay for the damage that has been caused. When such disasters occur, we should, of course, consider whether individual companies are in a position to bear the costs. Here again, I am looking in the direction of the Commission, which ought to examine whether we should introduce insurance solutions in order to be able to provide appropriate compensation to people who have suffered damage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For this reason, I call on the European Commission to get directly involved in managing the situation, to provide every means available to support Hungary and to ask the responsible authorities to supply the following documents and data: a report on the effects of each chemical compound identified in ecosystems, to include the quantities spilt and give details of the spill’s impact on flora and fauna, and a report on the measures taken by the Hungarian authorities, more specifically, the quantity of chemical substances which were thrown on the spill as a counter-measure and the environmental impact of the new substances.</p>

There is no good explanation for this. What do you mean by it? Is this really enough?</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the directive on integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC Directive), under which this aluminium factory falls, also requires the application of the best available techniques. These techniques include, for example, two protective walls. There was only one protective wall. Thus, there are clearly problems there, too, and so I should like the Commission to carry out a much clearer analysis of whether the legislation is really satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the inspections. Photographs in June already showed leaks, yet national supervisory authorities said that there were no problems. Those inspections were inadequate.

As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, when I read in the newspaper that red sludge had escaped from a reservoir there, I asked myself how something like this could possibly happen, because for years we have been adopting rules and legislation in order to isolate and contain precisely this kind of toxic substance to ensure that this sort of thing does not happen. Clearly something has gone wrong here, and clearly there are people responsible who have not implemented the rules and legislation of the European Union. In that case, we quite simply have to call these people to account. The question of who was, and who was not, responsible needs to be answered.</p>
<p class="contents">I admire the Hungarian people, who responded very quickly and averted an even bigger disaster. However, that must not mean that we leave everything as it is. We must determine who was responsible and these people must be named and shamed.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not – and I would warn against doing this – alter the Solidarity Fund now on account of this incident. It was established in 2002 when the floods happened. We have rules, and we cannot shift the mismanagement of one country to Europe and allow the damage to be paid for here. That must not be the result of this. That is not the purpose of the Solidarity Fund. It is intended to be used for unforeseeable events that can quite simply just happen. We need to keep funds in readiness for these events and not for incidents such as the one that has just occurred in Hungary.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to make a suggestion. When the floods occurred in 2002, we did not even have a Solidarity Fund and we were able to use resources from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), together with a reduction in cofinancing in this area, for example. That also helps the countries by enabling them to use their resources for other things. We could therefore take a different path here in order to make these funds available. The Commission ought to follow this recommendation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Merkies  (S&amp;D). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(HU)</span> I would like to express my sympathy to all affected Hungarians. Your environmental disaster focused the attention of the whole world on Hungary. This disaster made one thing clear to everyone, namely, that the maintenance and checking of old industrial facilities are of primary importance. The costs of maintenance must not be reduced during the economic crisis, either. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> I shall now switch to Dutch. An environmental disaster in Hungary has attracted everyone’s attention in Europe and, if one thing is clear – you have heard it here already – then that is that supervision of maintenance and the maintenance itself are essential, not least in the case of older installations and industries from times gone by. Even in these times of economic crisis, we really cannot skimp on maintenance and supervision. Proper transposition and implementation of the directives on waste is central and necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, just to mention it, waste is the raw material of the future and must represent an opportunity rather than a hazard. Waste storage such as this – lakes of waste – really must not recur. Waste must be recycled or reused. Europe’s environmental and raw materials plans are very ambitious. The Member States must be at least as ambitious and must make haste to act in the interests of human beings, the environment and industry and to take more action on waste recycling and reuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I join the calls for Hungary, and also the Commission and the other Member States where this could conceivably also occur, to ascertain whether the directives on waste, not least in the field of industrial waste, and the environmental safety requirements are being properly implemented. In addition, there is supervision of maintenance. A human and environmental disaster of this nature must never recur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not an urgent matter to come up with another new law, another legislative package. We already have a full environmental <span class="italic">acquis</span> in the European Mining Waste Directive. The problem in Europe is not about having a proper legislative framework, but about the proper implementation of these laws by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, companies have had way too much leverage in negotiating with national authorities over what constitutes hazardous waste that should fall under the strictest safety standards. Furthermore, I am honestly worried when I hear of the large number of toxic deposits all across the Danube region and of over 1 000 contaminated sites in Romania alone. I think the first priority in terms of prevention should be to list these sites in Europe. We cannot afford to wait until 2012 for this to come into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States should voluntarily share this information with the Commission as quickly as possible. This case also demonstrates that the Commission should be given more means to ensure correct implementation of environmental law, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. It also shows that the Commission should also be given more resources to investigate quality control and inspection of these dangerous sites.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I should like to emphasise that the basic principle should be that polluters pay for the environmental damage they cause. This is why I am unsure that the use of the EU Solidarity Fund for natural disasters would be appropriate, as it may undermine this principle at the core of the Environmental Liability Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the assessments by Green Peace, this accident is much more serious than the one which occurred in Baia Mare in 2000. I should point out that there was no loss of human life then and the impact was relatively small over time. However, Hungary’s MEPs have tabled a resolution in which they have called for a ban on the use of cyanide technologies in mining, without submitting an alternative, with the sole purpose of blocking the Roşia Montana mining project.</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, a few people have already mentioned to you that the European legislation that we have in place is, to a certain extent, inadequate, and that it is also inadequately transposed and not monitored sufficiently by the Commission. One example of such legislation is that relating to liability. There is a real gap here insofar as the party that causes such disasters must be called to account and made to pay. What legislative amendments do you intend to introduce here to ensure that the polluter has to pay? What do you intend to do with regard to Hungary to enable independent investigations to be carried out, and what is your opinion of the proposal – as Mrs Hassi has already mentioned – to set up our own EU task force?</p>

You gave a good coverage of all the issues that we are facing. Before I get into answers, just let me say the following. When I arrived in the villages affected yesterday, the thought I had in my mind was: thank God it happened during the day, because if that accident had happened during the night, many more people would have died.</p>
<p class="contents">Actually, from a distance, the houses look like somebody has painted half of them in red. Obviously this goes above the level where there are beds in which women, men, kids, elderly people sleep. When we are faced with something like this, it is really appropriate to have a thoughtful discussion and to make sure that we draw lessons from it. Then we can have a feedback into preparedness, prevention and response in the case of any future disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">So I take the comments that have been made here in this Chamber in this respect very seriously. Let me try to respond to them.</p>
<p class="contents">First, on the question of legislation and the role of the Commission. My exact wording was that, from the first analysis we have carried out, it does appear that we have the appropriate legislation in place and that, where we are still lacking sufficient action, this lies in the implementation of that legislation. I am emphasising the words ‘first analysis’ and, in my conclusion, I did stress that we would look into whether we have gaps in the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, based on what we have in front of us in this case and in many others, the focus really has to be on implementing the legislation we have rather than on saying: ‘Oh well, let us go out and write another piece of paper and stick it on top of many other pieces of paper’, when we know that the critical issue is implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about what we might specifically be looking into from a legislative point of view, there are two specific issues at this point, though there may be more when we finish taking stock.</p>
<p class="contents">The first one is on the question of classification of the red mud as hazardous or not. We do not say that in every case when we have red mud, it is not hazardous. It may be hazardous if there is a high content of heavy metals, and if specific technical qualifications are met. In other words, there could be cases when red mud is classified as hazardous. At this moment of time, on the basis of the information that was provided by the Hungarian authorities, we can say that, on the basis of their information, this red mud is not hazardous, but obviously we need to carry out a more thorough analysis. Then the question would be how we deal with an issue like this and whether there is a need to tighten up the definition of hazardous waste. That I cannot answer today, but I can assure you that it will be looked into.</p>
<p class="contents">The second legislative issue that is very important is the question of liability that has been raised by a number of speakers. Do we have in the Liability Directive enough teeth to bite when it comes down to the implementation of the ‘polluter pays’ principle? I said at the very beginning that this is an area where the Commission is already initiating work to assess whether there is a need for tighter regulation of how companies act in terms of having the means to meet their obligations as polluters. That again would be work we will follow up very thoroughly.</p>
<p class="contents">The second set of questions concerns financing. What can we do? Hungary has dedicated structural funds and rural development funds at its disposal. We know from experience that, in the process of implementing programmes, there is always some room for manoeuvre. Basically, no country has ever achieved 100% utilisation of structural funds, and priorities shift over time. Therefore, it is possible for Hungary, if the government judges this a very high priority, to use structural funds or rural development funds for environmental monitoring for treatment facilities, for the rehabilitation of damaged infrastructures and the rehabilitation of agricultural land. They can also be used for changing land use, because it may not be possible for the land I saw to be quickly rehabilitated for its conventional agricultural use, but it may be possible to use it for energy crops which do not need to meet the same test in terms of dangerous materials.</p>
<p class="contents">We also had quite different views on the Solidarity Fund. I would say two things here. One is that I agree that it is the responsibility of the polluter to pay, but at the same time, when communities are hit by a disaster of this nature, it is a matter of European solidarity and compassion to be able to give them a hand at this moment, because by the time that the liabilities of the company are met, months and months will have passed.</p>
<p class="contents">I find myself in an awkward situation, as Commissioner in charge of humanitarian aid and disaster response, when I can help the victims of the floods in Pakistan quickly, but there is nothing in my hands as an instrument to help the victims of this disaster. This summer, when we had floods in Romania and Moldova, I could very quickly provide funding to Moldova, but I could not do anything for the victims of the floods in Romania – and I am talking not just about myself; I am talking about us as European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a question to be looked into to see whether indeed, with the increase in disasters both at home and abroad, we should have in our hands an instrument that allows us to show compassion to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">And by the way, our citizens are perplexed as to why we can help Pakistan when we cannot help Ajka.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been questions that were directed to the role of the Commission. Let me make this very clear. The inspections and the monitoring are a Member State responsibility. We do not have a mandate in the Commission to do it. What we do try to do – through training activities, awareness raising, lessons learnt – is to bring all Member States up to speed in terms of their capacity to monitor and inspect. One of the speakers here said there are clearly institutional shortages in this area. We can help with training, but we do not have a mandate to be inspectors and to substitute for national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not mean that we should never have this mandate, but we do not have it today and, frankly, I think it is much more important for the national authorities to be better equipped to perform their duties than for more and more layers of inspection to be built up. Make sure that the people who do the job are equipped to do that job.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been questions relating to the recycling of red sludge. The directive does provide for incentives for research, and our environmental legislation encourages the transition to the best available technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically for this installation, it should be in compliance with the highest standards by 2012. Of course, it is terrible that the disaster happened in 2010. Obviously – and I will finish with this point because I am well over my time – we have to learn from this case and raise our alert level as regards other places in Europe that could potentially be a source of danger in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">For a hazard not to turn into a catastrophe, the key is in monitoring, preparedness and prevention, and I could not agree more with those speakers who have hammered on this point. We do have a policy on preparedness and prevention and again, as is the case with the legislation we discussed, the critical issue is for this policy to be turned into reality in our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we will bring you a proposal, a communication to strengthen the EU’s disaster response capacity, and we will come back to you with the lessons learnt from this disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This disaster in Hungary also proves the need for stricter community regulations in the area of civil protection. The Treaty of Lisbon makes this possible, since it makes disaster management the joint responsibility of the community and Member States. The disaster in the vicinity of Ajka can be the first real test of the Environmental Liability Directive that came into force in 2007, and we will now see whether we can fully enforce the ‘polluter pays’ principle. Among other things, the law proposes that companies create financial reserves to manage the consequences of potential industrial disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth considering whether we should make the creation of such financial reserves mandatory for companies working with hazardous materials. I urge the Hungarian Government to start negotiations with the European Commission as soon as possible on the redistribution of environmental protection and rural development funds for the purposes of disaster management. I welcome the proposal made by the European Commission in the communication concerning the budget review, published on Tuesday, that the Solidarity Fund should also be made available in future for the elimination of the consequences of industrial disasters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this is a time when we need to show decorum, without making a great fuss or putting on displays on the subject or without exploiting the images of this unfortunate industrial accident. We can learn an important lesson from the incident in Hungary. Economic activity is not dangerous in itself, as long as the stringent environmental protection regulations are observed. It is only when the regulations adopted at EU level are ignored that the risk arises of whole ecosystems being destroyed. The accident in Hungary also provides an example of European solidarity. A team of experts from different countries has gone to this country to help the authorities in their efforts to counter the disastrous impact on the population and environment. I also believe that it is the right time for us to raise for discussion again the provision of backup from a European civil protection force. This must be constantly available to provide prompt, professional intervention in places affected by various disasters, which continue to grow in number not only on our continent, but worldwide too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although different, both disasters have something in common – they both could have been avoided or could at least have been smaller in scale if environmental protection had been given more consideration. Unfortunately, in a number of countries, both within the EU and beyond, the environment and environmental requirements are often not a priority when planning, building and operating installations that have a significant impact on the environment. Therefore, I am convinced that if we looked around, all of us would find numerous installations where, sooner or later, there may be an environmental disaster on a greater or smaller scale. In many places, we can find instances where there is scant regard for environmental requirements (whether deliberately or through incompetence), the construction of installations is permitted very close to residential areas, and the environmental impact assessment is only conducted in a superficial manner without residents being properly consulted and its results are somehow always favourable to the client. When operating such installations, residents’ complaints are also often simply brushed aside. I call on both the European Commission and the Member States to open their eyes for once and to take action once they have seen the true situation – to initiate legislative amendments tightening monitoring of the implementation of environmental requirements and responsibility for non-compliance with such requirements, and guaranteeing an independent environmental impact assessment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am certain that the most important thing, today, is to answer the question which is being asked so often: could this tragedy have been avoided? Or, rather: how should this have been done and what should we, as the European Parliament, be doing today to ensure that such events do not happen again? We know there are many more such reservoirs in Hungary. However, that is not all. For example, in Poland, in Lower Silesia, we have the largest liquid waste dump in Europe, which was established in the 1970s. Can we sleep peacefully in a Europe in which such an event has taken place despite the existence of numerous binding legal regulations which were supposed to guarantee appropriate supervision of chemical substances? We have the REACH Regulation, which has been in operation for three years and is being implemented by the European Chemicals Agency. We have other legislative documents, such as the CLP Regulation of 2008 on substances and mixtures and the Globally Harmonised System, which classifies substances and mixtures according to the hazards with which they are associated. We must carefully and thoroughly examine existing Union law and its implementation in Member States, and we must specify clear priorities in order to ensure effective hazard prevention and efficient crisis management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Non-governmental organisations have submitted complaints relating to the creation of illegal and secret databases for storing personal information in connection with racial and ethnic origins, and have stated that they are appealing to the relevant authorities. The French authorities, however, deny the existence of such a database. The Minister for Immigration has previously declared that biometric data on the deported Roma may be retained in the OSCAR database and in a new database that is under construction. It is said that even the Netherlands and other countries of the European Union are registering data on ethnic and racial origin. In connection with this, the Council is discussing a draft of the conclusions relating to mobile criminal groups in a very controversial way, and without informing the European Parliament of this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, what the Commission is doing, with regard to evidence on the existence of the MINS database in France, to verify such information. If the Commission finds that the database breaches the principle of non-discrimination, what measures will it adopt to correct the situation? Is the Commission considering bringing proceedings against Member States in connection with a breach of law, and with regard to recent developments in other Member States concerning the creation or existence of databases linked to racial or ethnic origin? Will the Commission launch investigations in order to obtain information on such databases and to verify whether they are lawful in relation to the principle of non-discrimination? I would finally also like to ask what the Commission is doing to ensure that Member States do not adopt ethnic profiling in their administrative and criminal law proceedings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Reding, you are quite rightly delighted today that France has responded to the European Commission's infringement proceedings at the eleventh hour and has provided a legislative programme for establishing procedural rights as required under the directive on the freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">According to your assessment, these promises are genuine and, as a result, the infringement proceedings have been put on ice – as opposed to cancelled. We have taken note of your comments but as Members of the European Parliament, we would also like to be able to monitor these commitments. That means having information about the promises made and the timetable provided by the French authorities. However, let us not forget that you also asked France about individuals who have been escorted to the border and required to leave the country, an enquiry intended to confirm that these administrative procedures were not discriminatory. What has happened to those enquiries? Have you received a response?</p>
<p class="contents">Just as the press revealed information about the villainous and discriminatory August circular, information was recently published about a file – a database – which contains personal information including details of ethnic or racial origin. Has this new twist not dented your confidence in the promises made by the French authorities and the accuracy of the information provided?</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Reding, would you not agree that the logical next step is now to tell us the current state of play in the ongoing examination of the documents requested by the Commission, both on the alleged discriminatory practices in France, but also regarding the potential infringement of data protection standards as laid down in Community law?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that today’s European citizens are entitled to demand a responsible Commission which may publicise its successes but will also be determined in persevering with proceedings against the French authorities. After all, this is what you are doing more generally for all EU Member States which, it is widely recognised, have fallen into bad habits in relation to the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also point out that the CNIL has itself confirmed the existence of four illegal files which contain personal data, in which the subjects are described as Gyppos, Gypsies or Roma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, you will not be easily held back by anyone and you do not usually need nudging. If you want something, you go straight for your goal. I wish you would be as determined in this particular case.</p>
<p class="contents">Just this week, you published the Commission communication on the effective implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The communication states that the Commission will make full use of its powers to ensure that the Member States apply EU law, in full respect of fundamental rights, and that you will not hesitate to initiate infringement procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of France, I wonder why the Commission relies exclusively on the declarations of the government when, as Hélène Flautre has just pointed out, there has been a series of declarations which, with hindsight, turned out to be unreliable. Why does the Commission not start its own investigation? We have asked for this before. You know that a majority in this House is behind you. We know that there is a lot of opposition from the Member States, but we are behind you, Ms Reding.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to the situation in France, the situation in Italy – which seems to be even more serious – and the situation in my own country. First of all, I would like to know whether the existence of these databases can be confirmed. Do we have proof that they exist or do not exist? Do we have a list? In the case of the Netherlands, I know there is a list because the municipalities which created the databases are quite proud of it; they think they have done a very good job. They probably did it with good intentions. If the databases exist, would you take the view that this is legal or illegal? If it is legal, we do not need a debate. If it is illegal, we need to start infringement procedures. It is that simple.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not hesitate in other areas. For example, you tackled the opposition head-on when you wanted to sort out mobile phone roaming rates. If there are cartels, then the Commission does not hesitate for a second. In this case, I think that the Commission should act. Ms Reding, this is the time for the EU to prove that it is a community of values and that it will intervene if fundamental rights are being violated. Citizens are watching us.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Hélène Flautre, I would like to ask you to come to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to explain to us what the situation is and what action the Commission intends to take. I too, as a Member of Parliament and as a European citizen, expect to obtain full access to all the correspondence that has taken place with France and possibly other Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we now hear that ethnically motivated databases on the Roma – and I believe these databases as such are prohibited – are being set up by the French Gendarmerie, but also by other countries, and, to a certain extent, for preventative purposes, then that really is the limit. Both in France and in the EU, databases that are primarily used to compile personal data on the racial or ethnic origin of people are quite simply prohibited due to the high risk of them being misused and on account of the risk of discrimination. Only under very particular – purpose-specific – circumstances, which take non-discrimination into consideration, can the collection of data of this nature be carried out at all. The Roma must not be criminalised, and that is the crucial point. Ethnically motivated databases for the purpose of preventing crimes are unlawful. The Roma must not be the subject of the special collection of data on account of their way of life, and we expect the Commission, in other words you, Mrs Reding, to repudiate any form of ethnic or racist data collection and to work hard to ensure that this is indeed stopped in the relevant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, I ask myself more and more what it is other than talk, talk, talk that actually happens in this Parliament and in the framework of the EU, and what, in practical terms, we have actually managed to do to improve the situation of the Roma in Europe other than talk, talk, talk. If we look at the collection of data, we see that the Roma have become scapegoats and people to push around in many Member States of the EU. They are being deported to Kosovo and, in doing this, France has been contravening EU treaties for months, the principle of anti-discrimination is being violated – and the Commission behaves as if it is satisfied – and I see this rather differently to the previous speaker – with the promise by the French Government to provide the legal basis for transposing the directive on freedom of movement by the beginning of 2011. In the interests of decency, however, it must be said that France has to put a stop to the deportations of Roma, and it is also important for those Roma who have been unjustly deported to have their return to France facilitated.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the databases, I would like to ask you: what definite information to you have, what initiatives will you take, if these databases actually exist in this way, and will you initiate treaty infringement proceedings in such cases? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having said that, there have been many debates, many scandals and many actions in the last weeks, and I think this Parliament should look at what has happened in France and the reaction in the European Commission to what was some kind of a historical event. There has never been, so far, in the history of our European Union, a court case started because of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We have started court cases because of commerce, because of the economy, because of finance, but this is the first time, on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon and on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is included in this Treaty of Lisbon, that the Commission has said enough is enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission decided – all 27 Commissioners – on 29 September to start infringement proceedings against France on the basis of non-implementation of those rights of the human being, the rights of the individual citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not need to tell you all the pressures which have occurred since that moment, but the Commission said unanimously that it will start court procedures and will put an ultimatum to France. If France has not answered in a positive, acceptable way before 15 October, this court procedure is going to be implemented. That is the normal way we proceed with all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, what has happened? Well, France has given an answer. And this was the first time, it was unique in terms of the way questions are handled, and I believe personally that it was the first moment of the European of the Citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Let historians one day look at that. We are in the middle of the proceedings, we are in the middle of the fight, so we might see it from a different point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, objectively, what has France done? France has done exactly what the Commission has asked it to do. Under the 2004 directive, there are material rights, we also call them procedural rights, which exist for the sake of protecting citizens against an unacceptable action by the authorities when they are imprisoned. And these procedural rights have not been implemented in French law. So we said to France: by 15 October, we need to know the ways in which you intend to change French law implementing the 2004 procedural rights and showing us a credible timetable of how you are going to introduce that into French law.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, we got it. We got it one hour before the end of the deadline, but we got it. Since 08.00 on Saturday morning, my experts have been looking at the papers and I have come to the conclusion today that all the points on the basis of law which the Commission asked for from France have been answered – though, of course, not yet applied in national French law, because first they have to go to the Senate and then be introduced <span class="italic">de facto</span> into French law and applied in real terms.</p>
<p class="contents">We decided we are happy with what the French authorities gave us, but we cannot close the case, because these promises, these elements of law, these proposed laws, are not yet implemented. So we have said that we are freezing the case, but are leaving it open. We are leaving it open until the moment the French Government has really applied this legislation<span class="italic"> de facto</span> in day-to-day proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">That is one thing that I think is some kind of a victory. Think about everything which has happened. Now the French will say there is no problem, there never has been any problem. Well, there was a problem and they are bringing us the law which they are going to change. Let us see if they do it. I believe they are going to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a second question and that is how the individuals were treated during the summer period, and whether they had procedural guarantees as individuals, as European citizens, or were discriminated against.</p>
<p class="contents">Why did I not start infringement proceedings like those we started on the basis of the laws? Simply because if we want to act, we can only act on the basis of legal evidence. We cannot act just because we have a feeling, because we are persuaded something is wrong. We have to have the legal proof and that is why we have asked the French Government to supply us with the dossiers on the individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have got dossiers on individuals, several piles of them. My experts are analysing those and they have told me they will certainly have supplementary questions to the French Government, and they think they will finish this analysis with answers from the government in four weeks’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">So, as of today, we have these two cases. This is, I think, a very important fact because I would also like to tell Members very frankly that the implementation of the 2004 directive on free movement is not brilliant. What we are seeing now, because the Commission has been strong, is that all the countries who are not perfect either – not imperfect to the extent of France, but not perfect – are starting to say that they are now going to implement it perfectly.</p>
<p class="contents">So something has happened. I think that all Europe has understood that we are not joking any more and that the rights of the individual, of our citizens, and the values of our society must be handled seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">That is enough about the French question, because a decision has been taken by the Commission on that matter, but it is not finished and is still an open procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the question on the database allegedly held by the French Gendarmerie and possibly containing ethnic elements. First, the Commission is closely following developments in these matters. We have again been given assurances by the French authorities that everything is all right, but a different system applies here, because there is a French law here on data protection and the handling of data which is checked in accordance with our rules by the French data protection authority CNIL. It is in line with the rules that CNIL has carried out an inspection and made a preliminary public report last week. You have seen CNIL’s results. I have read them too. The way it is reported sometimes in the press is not complete, because CNIL has also said, very seriously, that there might not be ethnic elements, but there are certainly databases which have not been authorised by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards compliance with EU legislation, the information provided has to make sure that the situation is covered by the Data Protection Directive. This might be the case only for immigration-related purposes. For immigration, there are a series of guarantees and safeguards which apply to what we call ‘sensitive data’. Sensitive data can only be processed in exceptional cases, in cases of public interest; they are subject to suitable safeguards, and those suitable safeguards have to be provided by the country concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Should the data processing not come under the Data Protection Directive, then the 2008 framework decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters could apply.</p>
<p class="contents">There, we still have a problem because this framework directive applies only as from 27 November this year. So, on the basis of this directive, the powers of the Commission are rather limited.</p>
<p class="contents">I will answer the very concrete questions which have been asked in addition to the French case. Are there other Member States where we could verify the possible existence of databases containing data on ethnic or racial origins?</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Data Protection Directive, the processing of such sensitive data is authorised by way of exception and has to be notified to the national data protection authorities. The data protection authority in France is CNIL. And these exceptions for reasons of substantial public interest also need to be notified to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">When such notification is made, the national data protection authority and the Commission are in a position to assess if the measures are in line with data protection rules, and here we have the result of the preliminary analysis by CNIL which clearly says that such authorisations have not been asked for. So, we should allow the judicial work in France to be done by the judicial authorities which are not just authorised, but also responsible, for doing this kind of work.</p>
<p class="contents">What about the Netherlands? There were several databases where the processing of sensitive data was provided for and was notified by the Netherlands to the Commission in 2005 and 2006. The most controversial database related to criminal activities of youngsters of Caribbean origin. This database has since been deleted.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, one municipality in the Netherlands planned to create an ethnic file, but it cancelled its project in response to the recommendation of the Dutch data protection authority. This shows that the system under the directive – whereby the data protection authorities, the national data protection authorities, are responsible – works.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, I would like to tell Parliament that I am working on the reform of the Data Protection Directive, partly with the aim of reinforcing the independence and the intervention opportunities of the national data protection authorities within a European framework.</p>
<p class="contents">That will have to be that for the time being: I have to shorten my speech because there is no interpretation after 24:00, so let us cut it off there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very easy to prove that there is no basis for these allegations. You have the conclusions of the CNIL report submitted to the prime minister. I imagine that you will also have received, as I did, the report from the Director-General of the National Gendarmerie, Mrs Reding. You have mentioned a number of points which you apparently consider unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">You champion human rights, but we should not limit ourselves to defending the rights of minorities. The rights of all humans need to be defended, and we are all entitled to respect. We are also honourable in France and I can guarantee that the Mens file has never existed. Mrs Reding, the CNIL has investigated, looking for various unpleasant keywords such as Gypsies, Gyppos, Roma, and has not found any evidence that the National Gendarmerie holds any such files.</p>
<p class="contents">The only criticism that can be levelled at the National Gendarmerie is the failure to declare this database, but the files do not contain genealogical information. It is just that the National Gendarmerie has a number of files which …</p>

Recent revelations about the existence of a database on the Roma and travellers in France have demonstrated how important it is that the Commission should continue its investigations in order to obtain additional information about the existence of these databases but also to establish whether the databases are legal and compatible with the principle of non-discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I do not entirely share your enthusiasm regarding the answer provided by France a few days ago, but I do understand why you have expressed yourself in these terms.</p>
<p class="contents">You tell us that France claims to have plans to transpose the directive on freedom of movement and will provide a timetable. On the question of this much-discussed directive and its transposition, there are two possibilities. Either France has given a purely formal commitment, which would mean that the Commission has not received an answer and has forgotten past history, or, alternatively, France has given a full answer, in which case we would like to know the details. You mentioned a timetable, a timetable for transposition which is in progress. France is currently transposing the directive on freedom of movement as part of the fifth revision of its immigration laws in seven years. I can guarantee that the revision will extend far beyond European principles on freedom of movement. Consequently, I think that you will need to monitor the process very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by expressing my hope that the Commission will stand firm and uphold the principle of non-discrimination. I hope that you will not allow yourselves to be lulled by amicable agreements or mere promises, even when they are made by the French Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This morning, despite the very clear explanations which you have just given us, another new French information website has been found which contains a Roma database, illicit of course, which contains detailed and extensive information including surnames, first names, nicknames, parentage, social contacts, car registration numbers and models, and partners’ names. Once again, the authorities have claimed that they were not aware of the existence of such files.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, irrespective of whether the information found on this site turns out to be true, there is still an underlying risk of discrimination linked to the existence of these databases in France and various other European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, in view of your comments and your reputation for strength of purpose, what do you intend to do? What other evidence do we need to provide in order for you to act and react given this failure to uphold the principle of non-discrimination? In other words, and without wishing to be controversial, let us try to uphold the law in France, in the Member States of the Union, and amongst those who make up this half-hearted European democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard about the expulsions in France this summer, the circular issued on the 5 August – which fortunately was later withdrawn – the Mens file, and more. We have listened with great interest to the arguments that you put forward this evening. You have told us today that you are happy with France’s promise, made last week, to amend national legislation in line with the European directive dating back to 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Like my fellow Members, I would like to be given access to these documents so that we can share your view and your commitment to reinstating the rule of law. From your comments this afternoon, it sounds almost as though you have capitulated.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude this long debate, let me stress that it has served one purpose; it has shown us the overriding need to address the nub of the problem, by encouraging national efforts and European policies as part of the rule of law on which European democracy is based. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This generated a huge degree of expectation for all those of us who still believe in the European project. Finally, someone in the Commission was daring to stand up to a strong Member State on the issue of fundamental rights, which had always been the most important thing in terms of words, but not always in terms of actions.</p>
<p class="contents">This surprised us a little, and it was not, shall we say, properly understood that when the proceedings were brought, they would not be brought on the basis of discrimination but only on the basis of free movement. I believe that this was, to some extent, a deficit, but in any case, we continued to applaud your commitment at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s decision has therefore left us a little confused, and that does not only apply to us but to all those people who were hoping to see a courageous response in this action on your part. This is particularly the case as we know that the confidence that you have in the French Government has been more than shown to be, at the very least, debatable.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this is particularly the case because we know that in the review of the Free Movement Directive, alarmingly, some moves are being made in favour of introducing concepts and redefining the concept of travelling groups, which would, to some extent, allow these groups to be criminalised once again.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the frustration that some of us are feeling today should not be fuelled even further. We therefore ask you to please allow us to hold on to the hope that you gave us with your ‘enough is enough’ statement, because here, we still believe that the problem exists and that we need to stand up to the French Government on this issue, along with other governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet it has also become a debate on the crucial provisions that govern our work in the European institutions. This means knowing whether a Member State is acting in good faith, whether it is providing reliable information to the European institutions, and so on. Moreover, in view of this, it has also become a debate about whether we, the European institutions, are able to ensure that both these principles and provisions are respected, whether we are able to speak clearly, and whether we can be uncompromising in their defence if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we already have clear answers as to the question of good faith. There are Member States, particularly France, which have not acted in good faith. They repeatedly deny the existence of documents, copies of which later appear in public. This also occurred during the summer and it is happening now with databases. How can it be claimed that there are no databases when we have published a database called Roms on a French website on the Internet today, with the cities of origin and a variety of information about Roma people, including those from the EU: from Bucharest, Belgrade and Timişoara?</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to the other question is also very important. You said that we had an historic moment, Commissioner, and that historians will recognise that the Commission was clear for the first time. I doubt that greatly, Commission, and I am a historian. I have many doubts because even the journalists have doubts. The day after having gone to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, some newspapers, like the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, wrote that the Commission will not prosecute France. Other newspapers said that it would. Even today, the news is that the case against France has been suspended or, elsewhere, that it has been dropped.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission is not speaking clearly – and evidently its words are not understood clearly – I would like to say that it will have a formidable ally in Parliament if it does want to speak clearly. If the Commission hesitates, Parliament will not neglect to pursue this case: it will not be a case that occurred during the summer and simply died. It will continue to be spoken of in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This creates a good breeding ground not only for the development and dissemination of extremism, but also for political manifestations naming particular ethnic groups as threats to security and connecting minorities and migrants with crime. The French Government started to drive out the Roma from France on ethnic grounds, which is unacceptable. We have good reason to assume, as mentioned by several people, that the French Gendarmerie, as well as other European states, have not stopped the collection of ethnic data yet.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is proved, we sincerely hope that the Commission will truly act as a guardian of the treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and will initiate a procedure for breach of commitments. The police plays an important role in maintaining public order, but ethnic profiling cannot be allowed to become part of standard police practice. This undermines the minorities’ trust in democratic institutions and can constitute grounds for discrimination. The majority of Roma people live in deep poverty in Europe, and in addition to poverty, they also have to suffer discrimination. While we have ambitious plans to combat poverty in the 2020 strategy, what we often see is a fight against the poor, which we must definitely stop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are those who think that, based on the forceful nature of your subsequent statements – in line with Parliament’s demands – and on the explanations that you are giving us tonight, our only conclusion can be disappointment that there are no proceedings against France. It should be pointed out that the debate was not on France, and certainly not against France; it was a debate in favour of fundamental principles of European integration such as the free movement of persons, because Europe does not only mean free movement of goods and capital, but, above all, free movement of Europeans by right and without discrimination, and, of course, without discrimination on ethnic grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that if there is still something to investigate regarding ethnic records that have not been fully clarified, it remains the work of the Commission. What should be pointed out, however, is that this work has not been completed, because it also involves Parliament remaining vigilant against the temptation of populism, which looks for scapegoats for the problems of social exclusion rather than solutions or responses.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as tackling populism and its temptations, this work also involves working to integrate those who are excluded, those who have been marginalised for a long time, and, of course, the Roma population.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must sponsor a conference on the integration of the Roma community. Parliament must also say that the work is not yet done; in fact, it has scarcely begun, and we still have a long way to go.

<p class="contents">The situation regarding fundamental rights within the European Union is becoming increasingly critical rather than improving. Against the background of the economic and financial crisis, governments in a few Member States are increasing the acts of discrimination: deportations and databases based on Roma ethnic criteria are actions which have already been highlighted. As long as the Commission is unable to guarantee the exercise of fundamental rights in the EU, its image as a defender of these rights will suffer. It is a risk which this institution cannot afford to run.</p>

In spite of this, certain Member States are often suspected of covert discrimination against minorities living in their territories. I do not wish to talk about covert discrimination at this point, but would like to draw your attention to an existing law which openly places an ethnic minority community at a disadvantage. While the new Slovak Government amended the law on national language protection in a good direction, the law still stipulates fines. Therefore, this law is perfectly able to intimidate and keep citizens whose mother tongue is not Slovakian in a situation of uncertainty. In its position on this law, the Venice Commission clearly explained that the law contradicts the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and limits the use of the minority language to an unjustified extent. I would like to ask the Commission, the Commissioner and the European Parliament to examine thoroughly and condemn every practice in the territory of the EU that can be used for ethnic or racial discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have told us very clearly and with enthusiasm and resolve about everything that you have done up to now, for which you have also received strong support from us. In our opinion, however, you have now taken a step backwards, because the call for treaty infringement proceedings to be initiated on account of there being discrimination on grounds of ethnic origin has just been supported once again by the documents that a few speakers have already mentioned and which have been referred to in French newspapers today. It is perfectly clear that there has been discrimination against the Roma on account of their ethnic origin and it was not only their freedom of movement that was violated.

We see that in Holland, they are considered a national security risk, and databases are coming to light there, too.

It has been postponed because we need to wait for the implementation of law in practice and cannot pass judgment on legal proposals. The legal proposals are acceptable, but they need to be implemented so that we can close the case. The case is, therefore, still open.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the ethnic databases which the CNIL, the independent French data protection authority, is inspecting in accordance with French law, and, in this case, in accordance with the European directives, we have to rely on the independent national data protection authorities because they are responsible under European law for carrying out the analysis. I think that the French independent data protection authority has shown that it is very capable of doing so. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Having said all that, I do think it is very important to remind ourselves of the real issues at stake here.</p>
<p class="contents">Excluding those in France, there are 10 million Roma in Europe, who make up the largest minority in Europe. I myself come from a country with 500 000 citizens. There are 10 million Roma, so you can appreciate the scale of the issue. The Roma live in most of our Member States in extreme poverty. They face housing, education, health and work problems and to me, the real scandal is that these problems have still not been resolved. So I hope that the current activities will continue – I think that they are to be welcomed because we should not tolerate this kind of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The current activities will at least have served as a wake-up call for Member States. I have not forgotten that at the ministerial meeting held in Cordoba in April of this year, only three out of twenty-seven Member States were represented at ministerial level. So, one year on, we will call another ministerial meeting after we have conducted a detailed investigation, in conjunction with the task force, into the situation of the Roma and the question of whether or not European funds are being utilised, so as to establish what is really happening. As I said, we will convene another ministerial meeting, one year on, in order to see exactly what commitments each Member State has made in terms of national strategies for the Roma within the wider European framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the current, rather ugly, situation will at least have served to ensure that the Roma are no longer sidelined when we come to formulate policies for tackling extreme poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not succeed this time round, now that we have an opportunity to do so, the next generation of Members of the European Parliament will find themselves having exactly the same discussions as we have had over the past few weeks. We do not want that to happen, so let us take action now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, when the criteria used to collect data focus exclusively on race, ethnicity or religion, they should be considered discriminatory, and thus illegal. It is legitimate for the authorities to carry out identity checks and monitoring in their respective territories as a way of safeguarding public order and security, and in order to prevent crime and monitor illegal immigration. However, the physical and ethnic characteristics of individuals should not be seen as an indication that they are criminals or that they are in the country illegally.
