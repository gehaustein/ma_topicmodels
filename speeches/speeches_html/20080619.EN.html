<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Zita Gurmai, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">− </span><span class="italic">(HU)</span> Thank you very much. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in our everyday lives we depend increasingly on transport. The European economy too relies on having efficient road transport. Increasing traffic, however, has given rise to serious social problems. It causes congestion on roads and in urban areas, results in serious environmental and health problems, wastes energy, and above all causes accidents. Very briefly, here are a few shocking statistics: annual carbon dioxide emissions from road traffic total 835 million tonnes; 40 000 people die on the roads every year; the costs associated with traffic congestion in the European Union amount to EUR 50 billion annually, equivalent to 0.5% of the Community’s GDP, and this figure could rise to as much as 1% of EU GDP by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I do have one piece of good news, however: the problems can be mitigated. Electronic stability control could save the lives of around 4 000 people every year, and if the in-vehicle emergency call system e-Call were fully deployed throughout Europe, the number of road injuries and fatalities could be reduced by as much as 5-15%. This would save more than 2 500 lives every year and represent financial savings of EUR 22 billion. Appropriate software and real-time information in traffic centres would enable a 40% reduction in congestion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear even from the few figures I have cited that intelligent vehicle systems have undeniable advantages, but use of these systems so far remains limited; in the United States, on the other hand, electronic stability control is to be made mandatory in all new cars from 2012. The primary reason why they are not more widespread is that these systems are expensive, and the appropriate information and intelligent infrastructure are lacking. We must ask ourselves, however, whether we can permit a situation in which the citizens of Europe are unable to enjoy their rights? You see, I believe every one of them, and every one of us too, has a right to safe, sustainable and efficient mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">Because mobility has increased and continues to rise constantly, the problems I have mentioned are European in scale, and if mobility is less than optimum or unsafe we must respond at European level. Market obstacles must be eliminated, demand for intelligent communication technologies must be fostered, and European-level, interoperable intelligent infrastructure must be developed. Results already achieved in European research and development in the field of information and communication technologies must be maintained and improved, especially with regard to appropriate driver-vehicle interaction. All these things are indispensible for the European economy and society, and they are also in the interests of European industry, given that the industrial sector in Japan and the United States (to cite only one or two examples) are major competitors. European decision-makers have recognised this, and this is why the Intelligent Car Initiative is a flagship project within the i2010 initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, therefore, I welcome the Communication from the European Commission, and I support the efforts being made by the parties concerned to expand appropriate deployment of intelligent information and safety technologies in vehicles. We must acknowledge that the process is still in its infancy, but we now have information on the developments that have taken place since the launch of the Intelligent Car Initiative. The work we have already done is not inconsiderable, and we are making reasonable progress. At the same time, however, I await the next progress report with great curiosity, and I am confident that I, too, with my modest resources, have contributed to the goal of fostering the deployment of life-saving, environmentally sound, traffic-optimising systems on as wide a scale as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who assisted me in my work: the Information Society and Media Directorate General of the European Commission, the secretariat of the European Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism; I thank my fellow members of this House and those who are unable to be here today for their comments and proposals for amendments, and I thank the professional organisations for all their useful advice, invitations and explanations. Thank you all for your cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have a duty to consider this initiative a political priority; citizens are watching us and young people in particular are expecting us to provide them with answers, advice, suggestions and ideas so that they can use the European Union’s roads without running the risk of losing their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why today’s debate, like yesterday evening’s debate, is of extraordinary importance and why the events that the European Commission is organising are of extraordinary importance. An initiative for young people is to be held in Brussels on 10 July, giving them a chance to discuss road safety, and a series of events on road safety will take place during the French Presidency, the most important of which will be held in Paris on 13 October, although there will also be events geared towards action in this sector in other European cities, with a view to raising public awareness and in particular the awareness of young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, from the point of view of today’s debate I should like to thank Parliament as a whole and congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent and comprehensive report. I particularly welcome the fact that her report recognises the major potential of the technologies and systems promoted by the ‘intelligent car’ initiative. Parliament’s support is crucial if these systems are to filter down to road users.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens have been the focal point, the target, of this initiative from the very outset. As road users, citizens are having to face increasingly difficult choices in the area of mobility and the messages that the public and private sector are sending out are in some cases confusing or even conflicting. Therefore, I welcome Parliament’s call for the introduction of further measures, such as incentives, training for drivers and information campaigns for users, to help safer and more ecological vehicles to gain more of a market share.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very encouraging, especially for me, as a Member of this Parliament for many years, to see this House recognising eCall as one of the key priorities of the ‘intelligent car’ initiative. We have made a great deal of progress as a result of eCall and at the end of this year the Commission will present a new communication to Parliament and the Council setting out the final stages for the achievement of eCall.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also grateful to Parliament for its support for our efforts to discover the best way of achieving energy efficiency and reducing CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions through intelligent technologies and for guiding us on the possible measures that could be taken. This sector is nevertheless only in its beginnings, and the regulation on CO<span class="sub">2</span> emission reduction targets has for instance to be implemented; I am again thinking of further measures in the transport sector based in particular on an integrated approach. Parliament’s support in this respect will be crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, along with the report we are discussing today, I call for more research into, and education about, the safety benefits of driver-assistance systems. Most people have no practical experience whatsoever of these systems and cannot therefore appreciate, first of all, that driver-assistance systems possess undisputed safety potential – after all, driver error is the cause of some 80% of road accidents – secondly, that they make driving less stressful, thirdly, that they support drivers and ease the burden on them without usurping their ultimate responsibility and, fourthly, that they encourage economical and environment-friendly driving behaviour. According to recent studies, driver-assistance systems could prevent up to one third of all serious accidents if all drivers used them.</p>
<p class="contents">Systems such as adaptive cruise control (ACC), lane-change assistance, and electronic stability control (ESC) are technically well developed and highly reliable. On the other hand they, too, must undergo regular technical inspection and must be tested after major accident repairs. Intelligent vehicle systems help to avoid risky situations altogether and, by easing the burden on drivers, are conducive to a more relaxed and foresighted driving style.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, these systems are not yet standard vehicle components. In spite of <span class="italic">Vision Zero</span>, traffic accidents will still happen in future. From the end of 2010 all new vehicles are to be equipped for the electronic satellite-based eCall emergency call system, so that professional help can be given within what doctors call the ‘golden hour’ immediately after an accident.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the European emergency phone number 112, the emergency call centre and the emergency services receive rapid automatic notification of an accident and its precise location. Until the emergency services arrive, however, each of us should be able to administer first aid. In modern vehicle cockpits, however, there is also a danger of sensory overload. The increasingly complex operation of everyday functions such as air-conditioning, car radios and navigation systems, combined with audio and visual signals from assistance systems such as automatic parking systems, bumper-control devices, alcohol and overload interlocks and other devices can distract or even overburden drivers.</p>
<p class="contents">For all this potential, there remains the problem of replacing the vehicle fleet. That is primarily an issue of affordability. Sadly, the average age of our vehicles is increasing rather than decreasing. Vehicles must remain affordable. That is our responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let me express my warmest thanks to Mrs Gurmai for her outstanding work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to congratulate Mrs. Gurmai for her report and I am convinced that, due to her as well, the roadmap to be drafted by the Commission in the autumn of 2008, for speeding up the introduction of incentives for intelligent cars, will be more ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">Launched in 2006, the “Intelligent Car” initiative is a main project in the e2010, which represents the strategic framework of the Commission for the Information Society until 2010. One of the components of the eSafety programme is the implementation, by 2010, of the eCall system, which will automatically call the emergency services and supply data regarding the exact location of the vehicle. Nevertheless, it is important for the Member States to sign the memorandum of understanding. I support the introduction of this system as standard equipment for all new vehicles as of 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">4000 lives might be saved every year in Europe by introducing the Electronic Stability Control system, which reduces the risk of skidding. Unfortunately, according to the strategy of car manufacturers, these devices are available in a rather small proportion and often in a package of very expensive options. I believe it is not enough for us to set the goal that, as of 2012, the stability control system should be available for all models, but it is also important to introduce incentives for the purchaser to choose this option. It has been found that 60% of front-rear collisions could be avoided if drivers had brake assist systems and accident avoidance technology. Also, the visibility improvement systems equipping cars with adaptive headlights could reduce deadly accidents involving pedestrian victims by 30% and the number of accidents involving bicyclists by 15%.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it is extremely important to ensure the confidentiality of data and I draw attention to the fact that the legal clarification of responsibility in the case of accidents for cars equipped with brake assist devices or skid control devices has become urgent. The car industry should adopt the European Code of Good Practice for development and testing of advanced assistance systems for manufacturers… for car drivers drafted by REPONSE.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I consider the existence of Community and national financial support schemes for the purchase of intelligent cars to be vital for the large-scale use of these systems. I would like to congratulate Mrs. Gurmai for her report and, indeed, we are waiting for an ambitious plan for the introduction of intelligent cars from the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During these few days we have been discussing various issues that are to improve road safety and the quality of transport. Two days ago we were speaking about the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, yesterday we were discussing the transportation of hazardous materials and safe road systems. Today we are considering vehicles themselves, that is, how to make the vehicles used by people on roads within the European Union as safe as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">For us the goal is clear, which is to enable EU citizens to move about more effectively and make their lives more comfortable but, at the same time, they should feel safer, so that, thanks to our regulations, we can tell our electors, tell the people, that we have made a positive contribution. Specific measures taken by the European Parliament show the importance not just of this House, they also show that European legislation and European institutions bring something positive and tangible into the lives of everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that when we are debating initiatives to make vehicles safer, there are two things to bear in mind. Firstly, it is the car itself and all the systems that we are considering: systems for speed control, for stability control, for maintaining distance between vehicles, all these support systems, together with navigation systems, are all very important things that improve the functioning of the car, which is the tool that is used by those travelling by road.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should also remember, and it is appropriate to point this out in these speeches, that, for our citizens, for those travelling by road, the issue of communications is also very important, should there be a tragedy, an accident, or some misfortune. Our citizens should feel confident that, thanks to technical equipment and the systems that we are introducing, they will get help as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Both these issues are very important. Both, that means effective information systems so that help can arrive in case of an accident and, at the same time, systems that improve the vehicles themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In discussing this report, which my political group supports, we have also to remember its limitations. First of all, when we speak of an intelligent car, we must not forget that a very important part of an intelligent car is an intelligent driver. This is no small matter and the educational issue is very important. We have found on a number of occasions that technological progress was not accompanied by improvements in safety. Why? Because, despite improved technology and faster cars, drivers felt impregnable when driving their cars. Better roads meant they could drive faster. For this reason the issue of education, showing what is useful in modern technology, but also its limitations, and also showing how drivers should not abuse the modern technologies that we, I hope, will implement, is also very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of market forces has also been raised, as there are no guarantees that the regulations introduced by ourselves, however good, useful, appropriate and beneficial for drivers they may be, will result in an immediate exchange of vehicles in favour of cars that we consider to be safer, more efficient and easier to use. There are no guarantees because there is, of course, the barrier of price. This barrier could severely restrict access to these vehicles. I am not a supporter of systems that involve funding and also, both for the Commission and for all of us, it is something of an intellectual challenge to know what to do, not just to make safer vehicles and better roads, but to make our citizens, the citizens of the European Union, want to use them and to have the financial capabilities needed for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur very much and to express my strong support for this report once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can certainly compliment Mrs Gurmai on the wealth of ideas that been incorporated into this report with a view to enhancing the technical sophistication of the vehicles on our roads.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of introduction, however, I cannot resist a remark on the expressions ‘intelligent vehicle’, ‘intelligent infrastructure’ and ‘intelligent safety devices’. As I have already said in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I consider it downright unacceptable to apply this term to cars and roadways. <span class="italic">Intellegentia</span>, <span class="italic">intellegere</span>, <span class="italic">intellegens</span> – these Latin terms have to do with discernment, perception and understanding. They refer to the cognitive capacity of human beings, their ability to understand, to abstract, to solve problems and apply knowledge. From a purely linguistic point of view it is utter nonsense to speak of intelligent vehicles and intelligent roads!</p>
<p class="contents">In the statement explaining her report, Mrs Gurmai writes, ‘Ever-increasing road traffic generates serious social and environmental problems: congestion of road networks and urban areas, damage to the environment and to public health, energy wastage, accidents and, above all, the needless loss of lives’. I wholeheartedly agree. Nor do I seek to deny that cleverly conceived technology of the kinds with which this document abounds can help to make road traffic less dangerous and kinder to the environment. It only goes a limited way, however, towards solving the real social and environmental problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I have recently been in quite a few school classrooms. During these visits, I have taken the opportunity to ask several pupils from intermediate and senior secondary schools what they considered to be the main causes of the numerous road accidents. The first answers were always ‘too fast and dangerous speeds and drink-driving’. The solutions we are coming up with here, however, are almost exclusively the kind advanced by the motor industry, which seeks to sell more and more new and technically sophisticated vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">If rising fuel prices are a problem, if there is an urgent need to reduce energy consumption in general, if the irresponsibly high levels of CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions need to be lowered, and if we want to do something to combat climate change, we shall not put these things to rights with a philosophy of more and more, higher and higher, faster and faster, ever more sophistication and ever more mobility but much rather by adopting a different lifestyle, in which slower, more modest and thriftier are the order of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point I must dispute. The rapporteur writes, ‘For the consumer affordability is a key issue. Many consumers simply cannot afford the systems in question. It is therefore important that intelligent transport systems become affordable and widely available as soon as possible’. The Heidelberg-based Environmental and Forecasting Institute (UPI) calculated a few years ago that, once all direct and indirect transport costs have been taken into account, the average car in Germany is subsidised by the government, in other words by the taxpayer, to the tune of some EUR 3 000 a year. It is unacceptable that destruction of the environment and risks to public health should be subsidised. On the contrary, those who cause the damage should pay in accordance with the principle of cost transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Road construction and maintenance are not the only cost factors. There are also the use of land and the many forms of damage to nature and human health. Please do not misunderstand me, I am not opposed to better technology, but I am opposed to this blind faith in technology. If we want to subsidise mobility, we should primarily support rail travel, local public transport, cycling and walking. That would be more intelligent, healthier, safer and greener. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of us use vehicles on these roads. They are equipped with technologies that are constantly improving: catalytic converters, ABS, ASC, lights, seat belts and so on. However, as always, there is a ‘but’. Generally speaking, this electronic equipment is fitted to expensive cars that undergo safety tests, have crumple zones, and are fitted with many air bags or special belts. These vehicles can withstand almost any accident but, unfortunately, most of the vehicles on our roads are medium or low priced. What is even more important is that sales of these cars is constantly increasing and, according to the automobile magazines, we shall soon be inundated by a wave of cheap cars from India, China and other countries. Obviously price is linked to quality and equipment. Cars costing between EUR 2 000 and EUR 5 000 have little other than an engine, steering wheel, wheels, seats and, possibly in some countries, a single seat belt.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very encouraging that, in such a situation, there are people who are trying to make us safer. Prices are constantly falling and compulsory equipment can be constantly extended. Not just seat belts or ecological engines. Perhaps, in the future, ABS or automatic stability control systems, ASC, may become compulsory.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Zita Gurmai on her innovative report. I am sure that, despite the complicated names and functioning of these items of equipment, the report will be greeted with understanding and support. We are trying to combat an enormous number of fatal accidents and our political group will support this report, as we did the previous ones that were discussed yesterday by my fellow Members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has chosen the right approach. Mr Kusstatscher is of course right in his philosophical criticism of the term 'intelligent car'. Obviously we are talking here about artificial intelligence and so we also have to include that word.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three points that need to be made clear in the resolution on the intelligent car. Firstly, the development of the intelligent car must be in the interests of a clean environment. Secondly, its development must have a positive effect on road safety. I am pleased that those points were also made clear in the report by Mrs Gurmai. I should also like to make the following comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I think it is important that an effort is made when developing the intelligent car to meet the European Union environmental targets. The report mentions that the European Commission objective is for new passenger cars and light-duty vehicles vans not to emit more than an average of 120 grams per kilometre of CO<span class="sub">2</span>. I would add that the objective for 2020 is 80 grams per kilometre. I believe that the development of intelligent cars can also be helpful in reaching that target. In the sustainable development of energy sources for cars, there are certainly a number of other intelligent possibilities for achieving CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emission targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would say that the development of intelligent cars is also in the interests of road safety. The report has discussed that at length, so I shall not say any more about it here.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as recital J is concerned, it must be clear that, regardless of whether technological progress makes drivers feel safer and therefore less responsible, it is up to each individual driver to drive carefully. That principle still has to apply and it is excellent if drivers are reminded of it.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comments are on the report as a whole. It is very important that the development of intelligent cars should not be looked at separately from the development of an intelligent car environment. That combination in particular offers many possibilities for reducing pollution and improving road safety. A good traffic system is of vital importance to society. We do need to face up to the fact that transport is at the expense of the environment and will continue to be associated with accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the development of intelligent transport systems can certainly help to minimise these negative effects of transport. I should therefore like to draw attention again to recital 13. I expect strong support from the Member States and the European Commission for the introduction of ecological and vehicle safety arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">I also stress that it is important for knowledge of intelligent transport systems to be properly shared out. It is, after all, likely that the knowledge will be available in Member States that, comparatively speaking, suffer less from the negative effects of transport that I mentioned earlier. In that case, it would be good for a system to be developed that, on the one hand, ensures that this important knowledge is also made available in Member States that have a strong interest in it and, on the other hand, takes due account of the intellectual property rights of the developers of the intelligent transport systems. In my opinion, the Member States should make clear arrangements between themselves on that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Italy there was, until recently, a terrifying advert on the television; it showed the disappearance, from the Italian landscape, of a whole village, a whole municipality equivalent to and of the same demographic size as those 40 thousand and more European citizens who disappear from our Europe every year. Every step must therefore be taken to bring about a drastic reduction of the number of deaths, and also to reduce the numbers of people who do not die who represent an enormous social cost because so many of them are disabled for life or have other levels of disability and weigh heavily on our social systems and on our consciences, and therefore everything has to be done from that point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that technology applied to vehicles and infrastructure is extremely important for safety – no stone can be left unturned when it comes to safety and assistance, as Mr Piskorski and Mr Kuc have said – but it is also necessary for drivers to be intelligent and informed. In my opinion, therefore, drastic measures are also needed to limit speed and step up the sanctions that can be taken when drivers are liable, and here I have to say that the new Italian Government is also coming up with some interesting answers.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder, for instance, by what criterion cars capable of unthinkable speeds are still being marketed and, to take up Mr Kusstatscher, if there is no intelligence on the part of consumer motorists who buy cars of this kind and drive them in our towns and cities, then the responsibility lies with those who administer and are responsible for deciding on the freedom of persons who can never be allowed to limit the freedom of others who are unfortunately often physically eliminated in such cases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The development of new information and communication technologies has made it possible to achieve the political and social objective of reducing the number of victims of road accidents, that avoidable scourge of European roads.</p>
<p class="contents">If the potential thus made available is to be exploited to the full, however, awareness-raising campaigns must include brief, clear and comprehensible information on the new intelligent vehicle systems and must reach the largest audience possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to ensure that the development and deployment of ICT-based ‘intelligent vehicle systems’ is increasingly accepted at international level, and the need remains to ensure that Member States and industry encourage and support investment in such systems.</p>
<p class="contents">An integrated approach to these problems will also allow a variety of common safety and environmental objectives to be taken into account, particularly in connection with infrastructure and driver behaviour, as many of our fellow Members have already stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is, however, that not all aspects of this process are functioning well. The marketing of these systems is still weak. Their high costs, which even now mean that the safest cars are luxury cars for many people, and the lack of dissemination and awareness-raising campaigns on their benefits prevent greater market penetration.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very important to ensure that the negotiations to make the eCall system standard on all new vehicles from 2010 are successful, as the Commissioner has already said. It is estimated that this initiative alone could save up to 2 500 lives every year after it is fully rolled out in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Another fundamental aspect of this report, Mr President and Commissioner, is the objective of a 100% take-up of electronic stability control for all new vehicles from 2012, something that will also save thousands of lives and avoid many injuries on European roads every year.</p>
<p class="contents">We would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether he is in a position to assure us that this objective still stands for the date scheduled, 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all feel once again that we are involved in combating death on European roads by seeking effective and sustained solutions for applying the new technologies to the road transport sector. It is consequently essential for the interested parties to coordinate their activity and for the Commission and Member States to support research into new information technologies, and for drivers to be made aware of their safety benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, everyone must work together to make these systems a commonplace and financially accessible product on the market so that consumer demand for them increases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I said last night in one of the debates that we are in a week when there is a lot of soul-searching in the European Union about what the idea of Europe is for, and how we can re-engage with our citizens and really show the people of Europe that we are doing a worthwhile job and protecting them, their families and their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this is another example, where we are looking at safety measures and at using the most modern technology to help them when they come into difficulties; we are trying to argue that cars should be better equipped. Of course, this has a Europe-wide dimension, because cars are made in nearly every European country (far fewer are made, I have to say, in the United Kingdom than they were before). People drive cars that are French, Italian or German, that are made in Spain or Britain and assembled elsewhere and, of course, we must have transnational legislation to support the highest possible standards. If this means, through this initiative, that we can save lives through getting medical aid around and we can help people who might not otherwise have done to survive when they have an accident, then this is something that the British citizen and the citizens of the other European countries and Ireland should be able to gauge into.</p>
<p class="contents">We may look at this initiative and think this is very much futuristic and not going to happen for while. But it was not such a long time ago – I am thinking of 30 years ago when I got my first car, and I look around the room and perhaps Members here may have got their first car longer ago than that – that cars did not automatically have radios in them. Now, I do not know whether it is possible to buy a car without a radio, CD player or those sorts of things. Now cars, as the previous speaker said, are made to go faster and faster and are more sophisticated than ever: satellite navigation systems, e-systems, as we are talking about here, will be in cars very shortly and they will probably be standard in 20 years’ time. This is something we should welcome, and we should spread the news. Therefore, I congratulate all involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many arguments in favour. The first of these is the need to improve the safety of drivers and other road users. There are 41 600 fatal accidents on European roads each year. The resultant disability as well as harm to the health of many more thousands of road users is a strong argument for all of us. There would be many fewer fatalities if emergency assistance came earlier to those in need, so the introduction of an automatic accident notification system is a vital solution.</p>
<p class="contents">A third important factor that has a significant impact on the number of accidents is the state of the roads. Investment in roads is vital, especially in the new Member States and in backward regions with poor infrastructure. When modernising and extending road networks it is important to pay attention to the surroundings. Roadside trees growing right next to roads are a significant factor increasing the number of fatalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovation in the automotive industry does not just mean vehicle safety or the safety of people. It also involves reducing harmful environmental effects caused by CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions from cars. It is good that the rapporteur has also addressed this problem as well as many other issues. For this reason I would like to give my warm appreciation for a job well done.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing I cannot agree with is the name ‘intelligent car’. I agree with the previous speaker, who said that this concept is reserved for sentient beings. If we follow this line of reasoning, then we shall finish up with a situation where ‘intelligent cars’ will be driven by technically efficient drivers. In such a situation, whom would we involve in the educational activities that are so important to improve road safety and to benefit from civilisation’s technical achievements? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of these signals relates directly to the subject of our debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, but especially in our towns and cities, we are finding it increasingly difficult to raise enough money for major developments to our hardware, by which I mean our roads. There are also numerous good reasons for not doing so. Accordingly, we need to use the appropriate software, in other words intelligent vehicles and equally intelligent organisation of traffic flows, to ensure that better use is made of the scarce resource that is our road network. Congestion, then, is one problem for which we undoubtedly need new and better technology.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context we organised a hearing as part of our deliberations in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, where we were told by the industry representatives – not entirely surprisingly – that anything was possible. Many things are possible, but the motor industry needs timely signals on the one hand, while care must be taken on the other hand to ensure that these driver-assistance systems, once developed, are fitted to the great bulk of vehicles and do not remain the preserve of a privileged few who can afford very well-equipped cars.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an argument that has rightly been advanced during our discussion today. It cannot be a matter of reserving the best new technological developments for a very few vehicles, leaving the large mass of drivers, in fact, with the same old problems, compounded by the fact that the systems are not really compatible with each other. Accordingly, if we really want to explore the subject of traffic movements and the problems they cause us along with the opportunities offered to us by personal mobility, we need a large number of very closely coordinated actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context let me put forward one final argument, to which Mr Koch rightly referred. New, good, improved technology can make cars safer and road traffic less dangerous, but it can also be misused and foster a misconception among drivers that, since their car can do everything, they no longer really need to devote much attention to safe driving. Relaxed driving is a fine thing, but I believe it is far more important to drive safely and, above all, to be aware of the consequences of one’s driving behaviour. This is, therefore, another area in which we must not lose sight of the psychological impact of new developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today we are talking of an intelligent car. Let us not worry about whether the description ‘intelligent’ is good or not. Yesterday we were talking about intelligent roads, without actually calling them intelligent roads. Yesterday we had many more reservations than today. Today we understand each other better. There is of course a third factor, which is the intelligent driver. What should the driver’s intelligence involve? Firstly, he should want to benefit from an intelligent car. We need to convince drivers that there is an economic calculation to be made. How much pain are we ready to suffer, how many days in hospital, to save EUR 1 000 by buying a less technologically advanced vehicle? To be aware that this technologically advanced car and road can mean fewer accidents, less serious accidents, and a better quality of life and that this can be within our reach provided that, and I repeat, that we understand that it is worth spending those EUR 1 000 on this new technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very important that he is here for this significant debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pay tribute first of all to Zita Gurmai, who has done an excellent piece of work, not just in putting this report together but also in promoting the whole of the Intelligent Car eSafety programme.</p>
<p class="contents">But I just want to say to the Commission that it is a remarkable example of how a Commission initiative can bring people together across their own services, because as you will know Mrs Reding and her predecessor Mr Liikanen were actively involved in this. I am pleased to see my friends André Vits and Juhani Jaaskelainen sitting behind the Commissioner, because they have been instrumental in engaging all the participants together and really making progress; and I echo what Robert Evans says, it is a remarkable example of how the European institutions can cooperate together without heavyweight legislation and with a clear vision to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">My only regret today, Mr President – and I hope you will take this up on behalf of Parliament – is that the other principal actors in the whole of the Intelligent Car programme are notably absent from the front row here, because the Council has a crucial responsibility here. The Member States are responsible in large part for much of the detailed legislation that will help introduce these programmes and help our citizens. Where are they here to listen to this debate?</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to make a couple of remarks to follow up what colleagues have said about the crucial issues of cars and roads. Let me say to colleagues who have talked about safety features in vehicles that the whole process of evolution of the industry has been one of technological progress; indeed it is true that safety innovations have started first on more expensive cars with lower volumes, and have then trickled down to become available on cheaper cars. Now all cars sold in the European Union will have anti-lock braking systems. That is an intelligent system because intelligence, in my view, is collecting and using information. This is what these systems do. Once you have that information collection system on, you can then use it for anti-skid systems. The incremental cost is much lower.</p>
<p class="contents">But if we have the eCall system, then we have all cars equipped with that external information-collection system which is what we want to interact with the intelligent highway systems too, where we are also collecting information.</p>
<p class="contents">Back in my region – and by the way, Robert Evans, the United Kingdom is now producing cars close to its historic high level and we have more car producers making cars in the United Kingdom than any other European Union country, so please do not run down our car industry – on my local motorway, we have Britain’s first intelligent highway which opens lanes and controls speeds according to the traffic flow, and I can tell you that not only does traffic flow more smoothly, but fuel consumption has also been improved: it is a win-win-win situation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what this is all about. It is about winning by using intelligence and I hope you will all support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We live in a society dominated by information technology. This kind of equipment is with us from dawn to dusk. We found out very quickly that it makes life easier and we quickly learned to benefit from it. For this reason it has been an excellent development that, as part of the overall strategy of the Information Society and Media, the European Commission has found an issue that touches us very closely, namely the safety of people and road safety, and has prepared this ‘intelligent car’ initiative. I like the name ‘intelligent car’, I do not have any issues with it, as I understand that it is being used figuratively. It is an interesting name, ‘intelligent car’, it attracts people’s attention, catches the media, it is not meant literally. For me, this name is a symbol of modern European transport which, thanks to new information and communications technology, will become even safer, more ecological and more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary purpose of the intelligent car is to help people. In second place are the benefits for the environment, and thirdly it should make European transport more efficient. I do not know if the intelligent car will need enormous promotion and advertising. People are naturally curious and like to buy novelties, especially when they are financially accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that, even if this type of car is a bit more expensive, that everyone who buys it will feel they are investing in their own safety. I also believe that they will not feel they have wasted those few euros in ensuring their safety. The only thing I would say is that users have not only to know what there is in the intelligent car, but also to know how it works, and need to learn how to operate the modern technology to which so often we have a theoretical access, but never actually use.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see that as part of its safety brief, the ‘intelligent car’ should disallow use of mobile telephones and that mobile telephones in cars should be installed in such a way that they do not take the driver’s attention away from the road.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that even the most intelligent car packed with all the latest gadgets and technology will not fulfil our expectations if the driver makes a mistake and if the road system in Europe is not as good as it already is in certain European Union countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate Madame Gurmai for this extremely necessary report.</p>
<p class="contents">Dear colleagues, the price of oil has increased alarmingly and the efforts to replace traditional fuels have not produced the forecasted results yet and, for the moment, solutions are either too expensive, or controversial, or insufficiently tested from the technological point of view. Nevertheless, the car remains the most popular means of transport for Europeans and, unfortunately, this preference causes numerous problems, both from the social point of view and as regards the environment protection, as well as accidents with material damage and, especially, human losses.</p>
<p class="contents">The large-scale use of intelligent transportation systems and, first of all, of the electronic stability control is necessary. This way, thousands of human lives can be saved, pollution can be reduced, traffic can be decongested and both the car drivers’ comfort and safety and the relations between road traffic partners can be improved. Member States and private entrepreneurs should get involved ever more actively both in developing and implementing the eSafety initiatives, and in designing new accident avoidance systems, new materials and types of sensors interconnecting both the cars and the cars with the roads. It is clear that the “Intelligent Car” initiative cannot be separated from the intelligent road initiative. I support without any reserve the Commission’s proposal to launch a programme for implementing cooperative driving systems, as well as ensuring the availability of the related radio frequencies, whose benefits are visible in experimental phases in various countries and, with all costs involved, will produce long-term results.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that these systems address mainly the highway and TEN-T traffic. I insist on the fact that, over time, it is imperative for the differences between the major infrastructures and the other categories of roads to diminish, especially in the new Member States. It is necessary for Member States to efficiently use the European funds provided to them and also find other financial and technical solutions to draw up and put into practice long-term strategies for implementing assisted and cooperative driving in areas that are truly problematic as well: on national, regional and local roads, bypass routes for the transport of goods, on linking roads with conurbations from... in peri-urban areas and in the cross-border sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the European Commission and the Member States should continue their efforts to harmonize the legislative framework for eCall, as well as for the emergency telephone number 112, which are the pillars of essential safety and to consolidate durable mobility and for the welfare of European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are well aware that in terms of the development of society, mobility is a source of wealth, growth and, consequently, the capacity to promote solidarity between territories and between people. If we want sustainable development we must combine the various transport modes to improve the traffic flow in towns and in the country. Although we certainly do not want to build our society around the car as in the past, the motor vehicle nonetheless remains a vital means of achieving the intelligent and sustainable mobility to which we aspire. If we want to make that a reality, we must design intelligent and sustainable vehicles, based on three requirements: they must be safer, cleaner and more intelligent. Over and above that statement of principle, Europe must give practical support to this initiative with directives and policies that will, in the long run, integrate all the electronic systems, nomadic or not, and make it possible to control the processes and to drive cars that are safer and cleaner, with lower CO<span class="sub">2</span> and particulate emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, we must encourage car makers to consider even at this stage introducing all these electronic systems into the design of new cars, with a view not just to greater efficiency and ease of driving but also, as a result of all this, to reducing costs and simplifying manufacturing and installation.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to achieve sustainable mobility, we must also broaden the scope of these policies. Research projects and innovations should eventually generate intelligent roads, which will improve safety, reduce energy costs, use dialogue between vehicles and improve traffic flows. The European Union wants to promote a knowledge-based society and sustainable development. These initiatives must take pride of place in that context.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by emphasising the vital need to be really ambitious, to set ambitious targets and create the conditions for growth and progress in Europe. Echoing the report by our colleague Zita Gurmai, the European Parliament is convinced that the Commission will respond to that expectation and to these needs by setting a new frontier for the European intelligent car and finally allocating the necessary funding to achieve that ambition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Vice-President, the time has arrived to implement intelligent transport systems and in doing so to open up a new era in the history of European transport. We know that implementation of intelligent transport systems is one of the most important instruments – we could even say weapons – at our disposal if we wish to respond appropriately to climate change. Just two years ago, here in a plenary session of the European Parliament, I said that, in my opinion, one of the most significant challenges facing transport today is clearly that of making intelligent transport systems widely available in Europe. Then, one year later, I presented the European Parliament’s review of the White Paper on European Transport Policy to this House, and Parliament unequivocally supported intelligent transport, as it does now, as one of the key priorities of European transport policy. Why, then, are we making such slow progress? The technology is widely available.</p>
<p class="contents">This includes the intelligent car, for example, and ICT-based urban traffic management systems; the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay System (EGNOS) will be on stream from 2009, and the Galileo system from 2013. One of European industry’s great strengths is its automotive sector, where we are highly successful in global competition, not least thanks to highly innovative small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the sector. Nowadays, moreover, developments in this sector span western and eastern Europe. In Budapest, for example, there are two important knowledge centres of European-level significance operating alongside the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The sector is therefore committed. Now it is time for action on the part of the Community, and above all on the part of the Member States. In the case of the Equal programme, for example, it must ensure that the necessary infrastructure investment is in place; in the case of the intelligent car and intelligent infrastructure initiative, it must provide an appropriate economic environment to foster their development. Of course it is not easy to introduce new technologies, but we can help to promote this process by means of judicious public procurement. We have a plethora of instruments at our disposal. We ask the Commission to draw up an appropriate, cross-sectoral strategy to facilitate implementation of intelligent transport systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s citizens waste valuable minutes, indeed hours, travelling. Meanwhile, vehicles pollute the atmosphere unnecessarily and personal mobility is under threat, in part because the price of fuel for vehicles used in this way is becoming prohibitive. Intelligent transport is a key component of the solution to these problems. As far as European citizens are concerned, people are now open to consider any means of resolving the problems outlined here. Let us therefore take action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know you, Zita, as someone who, when she tackles anything, does so with a ready wit, determination, intelligence and vigour. In my opinion, that is precisely the spirit that underlies this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to take the opportunity to follow up a point that Mrs Grabowska made. I do not believe that cars are something that should be mainly for men. I am more inclined to take the opposite view. If we can trust the statistics that exist on this subject, women drive with greater foresight and care and more safely. In other words, they drive more intelligently, and I believe this is one of the reasons why it was only right that a woman drafted this report.</p>
<p class="contents">To come to the point, we are all aware that road traffic consumes a great deal of energy and emits huge volumes of exhaust fumes throughout Europe. It is one of the main risks to human life in Europe. Large numbers of people die or are injured in road accidents every year. It is therefore important that the European legislature should try to reduce these figures. Accordingly, it is imperative that vehicles should be made more intelligent in the truest sense of the term, so that these things do not happen so often in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this report points in the right direction. The key to success, however – and I agree entirely with Mr Rack here – is that these systems should be available to the great mass of car owners, that they have a general impact and do not remain the privilege, as it were, of a small class of people. I believe the report expresses that view quite clearly too. This is why I believe it is right for us to adopt it today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a serious problem. We cannot forget the 42 000 deaths in 2005. I cannot forget that Portugal recorded 150 fatalities per 1 000 000 inhabitants in 1993, although these figures have been falling.</p>
<p class="contents">The contribution of this report and our colleague’s work is crucial, and there are two aspects I would like to highlight.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays mobility is essential to the running of European society. We all depend on transport in our everyday lives, and the intensity of transport and mobility causes increasing social and environmental problems. The appropriate response must therefore be given in stages, but it does have to be given and given quickly. The constraints facing consumers and the automobile industry must be taken into account, but they must not prevent us from achieving the objective of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is information. Consumers must be informed about intelligent infrastructures and cars. Information must be clear and comprehensible and must be given at the right time. Car dealers and sales staff, all the agents involved, Member States, regions and local authorities have a great responsibility in this area, as does the media. Such cooperation must be ensured by the European Union, because on our own we cannot achieve the final objective, which is without doubt the objective of the Commission and of our rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, it is technology this is coming to the fore, and all the proposals she makes in her enterprising report will help us to continue making progress in the logistical development to which the European Union is committed.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that after the agreement reached about the deployment of Galileo, the ‘intelligent’ car is going to be one of the initiatives that will add content to the Galileo deployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, without going further, we approved the Directive on road safety infrastructure, which already highlighted the need to develop intelligent and interactive systems and vehicles. If we already have the infrastructure, all we clearly need is the intelligent vehicle.</p>
<p class="contents">The intelligent car will also help improve the prevention and control of traffic offences, especially regarding interaction with traffic lights, speed limits and anti-alcohol blocking. In the field of road safety, of course, everything connected with mass sensors for pedestrians and other vulnerable toad users will be crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the <span class="italic">eSafety</span> system, which is too far behind schedule, Commissioner, we have already called for it to be included in all vehicles and not only in <span class="italic">premium</span> vehicles and Mrs Gurmai wants to see this implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we had also envisaged that it would include vehicles for occupational use, especially in agriculture, where the isolation of the driver make the consequences of any accident worse as time passes.</p>

These systems benefit drivers and make traffic flow more efficient. They aim to make driving easier and reduce the risk of loss of concentration. Intelligent car technology makes it possible to mitigate or even eliminate these problems. I support the rapporteur’s view that at present penetration rates for intelligent car systems and applications remain very low in relation to their potential. I am also convinced that we must fully exploit these systems and applications in due course. Intelligent cars also need the support of an intelligent infrastructure but the ‘intelligent road’ is not yet ready. It is quite clear that the active safety elements in cars help to reduce the number of road accident fatalities. The eCall system is an effective additional feature of the overall system for protecting road users. I congratulate the rapporteur on her report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonio Tajani, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold">− </span><span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that as a result of Parliament’s work, as a result of the text of the communication drawn up by Commissioner Reding for whom I am standing in, and also the excellent work by Mrs Gurmai, we have today given an important signal to the citizens listening to us in the gallery, who in theory represent the five hundred million European citizens, that the institutions are listening to citizens and are trying to find answers to citizens’ needs, something which has to be the first priority of this Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Only in that way will we close the gap between the peoples of Europe and the institutions. The best response that we can give to the sceptics, those who voted ‘no’ in the referendums, is to show that Europe is close to citizens; we have to send out a positive message and have the courage to press ahead and make it understood that people, that citizens’ needs, are our top priority, and I am therefore pleased to take up your invitation, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">Road safety will be, as far as I am concerned, and as far as the Directorate-General which answers to the Commissioner for Transport is concerned, the priority – I said so in the speech through which I was able to gain the confidence of this House, which I thank again, having been here for so many years, for the confidence it has shown in me – as I was saying, the safety of citizens: the individual has to be at the heart of our initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened to the whole of this debate with a great deal of interest, and there was indeed a resolve today on the part of the institutions to provide answers, to save human lives; every human life that we are capable of saving through our legislative work, through our commitment, will be commendable work that will be to our credit. It is for that reason that we need to press ahead and for that reason that I share the stance of so many Members who have today stressed the importance of intelligent instruments and intelligent cars, although we have to ensure beforehand that man is intelligent because the first responsibility lies with citizens at the wheel who have to be aware that there are other citizens whose lives depend on their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Technology undoubtedly has to be at the service of man, the human and fundamental element, and it is for that reason that I share the stance of those – and I said this during my presentation speech – who argue that drivers need to be educated, that citizens need to be informed about the new instruments that technology and research enable us to place at the service of the citizen. Otherwise, it is pointless to spend public money, or private money, on research, if the discoveries that are made, if the initiatives that are brought to a successful conclusion are not placed at the service of citizens in order to save human lives. It is for that reason, I repeat, that the road safety sector will be a priority – and that is a commitment which I formally make to the European Parliament – and one of the main undertakings that the Commission and the transport sector will pursue in forthcoming months.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like briefly to answer the question raised by Mr Pribetich as regards timing. On the basis of the results of a consultation launched on 23 May 2008, the European Commission has proposed a regulation on type-approval requirements for the general safety of vehicles which states that, from 2012, electronic stability control systems are to be installed in new vehicles in order significantly to improve the safety of those vehicles. The regulation refers to the technical regulations harmonised within the World Forum of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mrs Ayala Sender, as regards heavy vehicles, in November 2007 the UNECE World Forum for harmonisation of vehicle regulations approved a text relating to the compulsory installation of ESC and related technical standards. That text has been supported by the European Commission which means that it will be compulsory to install ESC in new models of the most common categories of heavy vehicles from 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the occupational vehicles to which she referred, especially those in the agricultural sector – in Europe there are unfortunately still deaths from accidents caused by agricultural vehicles, in some cases as a result of the irresponsibility of drivers failing to drive with due care – at present no provision has been made, as priority has been given to cars and heavy vehicles. I welcome her suggestion, however, as regards my own area of competence and I shall also pass it on to Commissioner Reding because it seems to me to be an important proposal and would meet a need in rural areas in particular. In the agricultural sector, I repeat, there are unfortunately still many deaths which are not deaths on roads but on agricultural land and we cannot pretend that this is not a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I thank you, Mrs Ayala Sender, for your suggestion, and I thank all the Members who have spoken; the Commission, I reiterate – I am concluding, Mr President, and I apologise if I have taken a few extra minutes, but I feel that this issue is important enough for us to overrun the times laid down by the rules. As I was saying, we welcome the report by Mrs Gurmai who I also thank for her enthusiasm, because we have to show that we are enthusiastic about our commitment to defending the rights of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Parliament’s encouragement, its support for the eCall system and the measures to promote its implementation, and I therefore believe that the outcome of today’s debate is positive because the Commission, Parliament and I hope the Council, Mr President, have agreed to be on the side of citizens through this endeavour to save as many human lives as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of Europe, thank you very much for your comments and opinions. I believe this is indeed a new era in the history of European transport, as my fellow Member Etelka Barsi-Pataky put it. It is very important that everyone present in this House has voiced support for the report; it is a plain fact that one has to be as green as possible in order to please the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and we are delighted that in the end they too have given their support to this report. I must stress how very important this is. I agree with you, Commissioner, that if we manage to save even one single life on the roads, then we have achieved something; you see, I believe that the most important thing we can do as European decision-makers is to protect human lives. Several of you have cited the shocking statistic: 41 600 people die on the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">I also thank you for your support because in order to bring this matter to a conclusion we need to have everyone on board. I am very proud of Viviane Reding and her team, André and Juhani, who are sitting here. They have seen this whole process through. Not just over the past month, but over the past few years, because the technologies had to be tested to see if they really worked. Do you remember there was a time when there were no safety belts, and now we take them for granted? Or, as Robert Evans put it, there is a radio in every car nowadays. The new technologies will one day become as natural as safety belts and radios are today. We need the citizens of Europe, who will buy these intelligent systems once they have clearly seen the benefits they can bring. It is important also to have the vehicle manufacturers on our side, because 17 million cars are produced annually in Europe and 2 million people are employed in this sector. It is important that the Member States should be with us on this issue, although I must concur with Malcolm Harbour: the Council is notably absent.</p>
<p class="contents">There is little point in the Commission and the European Parliament doing everything in their power if the Council does not take this matter sufficiently seriously. The Council must be aware, however, that it too needs to represent the citizens of Europe. Let us therefore work together. I am asking you this because actions speak louder than words. It is in our common interest to recognise that everyone stands to gain if we achieve results in this area, as we will be able to travel in safety, traffic will be optimal, environmental pollution can be reduced, and Europe’s industrial sector can become a leader in the field of information and communication technologies. This is an opportunity to make a real difference. Let us not miss our chance.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for your attention. I am very optimistic that Commissioner Tajani will do everything in his power to make this dream a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not related to the Gurmai report because we have spoken about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst you were speaking, indeed whilst Mrs Gurmai was summing up her report, I noticed that there were members of the public coming into the visitors’ gallery. I warmly welcome them and I think it is very good and important that people are coming into the visitors’ gallery, but I am also conscious that as soon as I sit down from this momentous speech that I am making, what will happen is that you will suspend the sitting until 12.00 for the voting period.</p>
<p class="contents">These poor people, who have come many hundreds of kilometres, will not have the benefit of hearing a debate and a speech this morning. They are getting a little bit from me, but I wonder if it would be possible for you and your assistants to go back to the relevant authorities and look for a way of ensuring that, in the event of the debate finishing at 11.30, as it has done this morning, with nothing scheduled until 14.00, something could be put in to fill the half-hour gap between now and 12 noon, whether it be the urgencies from this afternoon or something else of mind-boggling importance?</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking on behalf of these perhaps 100 or so people in the gallery who have come to hear people speaking and all they are going to hear at the moment is me rabbiting on for two minutes about nothing – but making a very serious point.</p>

Certainly the document’s tone of solidarity and mutual help is a step in the right direction. The Barnier report challenges us to take practical steps and in this regard the Commission communication shows the way forward. Indeed we must ensure compatibility and strengthen cross-border cooperation between our countries’ protection forces at different levels. Unfortunately, I was unable to support the resolution because our oral amendment was not adopted. In this amendment we oppose creating legally binding instruments that would affect national legislation, policies and programmes and so affect the element of solidarity. I simply believe that we will achieve better protection against the impact of disasters by supporting the protection forces in our Member States, through coordination and investment in their equipment, not by drawing up new legislation that will do nothing more for the whole process than create more bureaucracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Forty years of the Customs Union has been a substantial achievement and it has provided benefits for EU business and citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the resolution by Mrs Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the 40<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary of the Customs Union and I voted in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to globalisation and technological progress, the Customs Union is having to cope with challenges such as counterfeit goods, increased imports of dangerous products and the need to set up electronic customs systems. Only mutual cooperation between the customs administrations and surveillance authorities at international level will be able to protect the EU market against imports of dangerous and counterfeit products, thereby strengthening consumer protection. I became convinced of this when visiting the national customs authorities and customs administrations in Prague, Antwerp and Washington, as well as Beijing and Shanghai.</p>

<p class="contents">What I think most British people understood by the Common Market was that there would be mutual product recognition, that if you could sell something in the UK, you should also be allowed to sell it in Germany, France and Spain and the other way round.</p>
<p class="contents">But of course what we have instead is standardisation. Something is required to contain certain ingredients, to be of a volume of not less than ‘x’ and not more than ‘y’, and even if that product was never intended for export, even if it never crosses frontiers, it can find itself criminalised and prohibited in its own country; and this is often because a rival somewhere in the EU – as often as not in Britain – which happens to meet all of a group of specifications anyway, uses the mechanisms of the European Union in order to pass on its costs to its rivals.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is a shame that we have lost the original concept of free circulation of goods and services in favour of harmonisation, which reduces consumer choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When I give speeches in my constituency of London – for those of you who may have heard of London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world – it is often pointed out to me by my constituents that they thought in 1973 that we were joining a customs union.

So clearly, there is a misapprehension of the nature of the project in my constituency.</p>
<p class="contents">My plea to you, those of you in this Chamber who support the project, is: please be honest about its intentions.

First of all, there is a lack of scientific data on the environmental and health impact of using the substances that are proposed. Secondly, given the regime under which poultry producers operate, it is unreasonable to have two different standards, both from the perspective of the producers and more importantly from that of the consumers.</p>

<p class="contents">Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to explain the way I voted on this important debate. But what I would say to my colleagues in the House is, actually, let us look at what the real problem is. Whenever there is an international crisis, you seek to blame that for the problems in the fishing industry. Actually it is not the rise in fuel prices that is the real problem in the fishing industry. It is the common fisheries policy, a system of central planning that the Soviets would have been proud of. I find it amazing that colleagues in this House are so willing to espouse Soviet economics.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at some of the more successful fish preservation systems around the world. If you look at the ones, for example, in Iceland and New Zealand, you will find that they are based on the rule of law and property rights and transferable property rights. If we really want to solve the problem in the fisheries industry, it is time to trust the rule of law; it is time to trust property rights; it is time to trust the free market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every year an enormous quantity of dangerous goods, such as chlorine and petrol, is transported by inland waterway in the European Union. No rules have so far been drawn up on that, although there is legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road and rail.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by boat is badly needed, not just for safety reasons but also to regulate protection of the environment and public health at European level. Much of the transport of this kind is cross-border. Furthermore, European rules are also to the benefit of businesses, which at the moment have to comply with different national requirements in the various Member States. Inland waterways transport also emits less greenhouse gas. It is therefore very important to harmonise the requirements for the various forms of transport. It will then become more attractive to combine several modes, for instance with part of the journey being done by rail and the freight then continuing by boat. Not only is that efficient, it is above all sustainable. I therefore hope that transport firms will actually opt more often for a combination of different modes of transport. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason is that this report runs flagrantly counter to the principle of subsidiarity: ‘a larger entity should not exercise functions that can be carried out by a smaller one’. This principle should be maintained with all possible care. Unfortunately, even in this House, I have often witnessed this principle being breached. I hope that on this occasion we managed to safeguard the principle at least partially, but how much time was spent doing this! Our legislative work was not directed towards the creation of good law, but to amending a poor legislative proposal. I am not, however, under any illusion that this will be the last attack on the principle of subsidiarity. This is paradoxical really, as these attacks come from the same quarter as the loudest criticisms of Ireland, a country that, a few days ago, rejected the Lisbon Treaty. People are just not making the connection that the citizens of that country said ‘no’ precisely because it is well known that this principle is regularly breached by the European Union. In fact, it is just this example, that of Ireland, that should make us aware that we cannot just ignore subsidiarity, or sacrifice it to what are allegedly higher goals, such as road safety. Sooner or later, and probably sooner, this will come back to haunt us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All citizens have the right to safe and sustainable mobility. The current progress in information and communication technologies enables us to manufacture and buy vehicles that are smarter, safer and cleaner. Consumers must have access to information that will enable them to make informed choices in favour of intelligent cars and it is important for these cars to become affordable.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the report by the rapporteur, Mrs Zita Gurmai, offers European citizens the opportunity to benefit from the potential road traffic safety in the near future, I voted in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Road accidents are caused both by human error and by poor vehicle condition. By introducing intelligent technologies, 16% of accidents can be prevented. Modern systems can reduce the number of road accident fatalities by as much as one third. The Galileo programme also represents a significant contribution in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the full deployment of the pan-European in-vehicle emergency call system, the eCall system, the EU Member States have a large responsibility. The aim is to have a full-scale roll-out of eCall by 2010. Therefore, I would encourage the Member States that have not yet signed the eCall Memorandum of Understanding to do so now, in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking into account that, according to the statistics, there are 41 600 deaths on European roads every year, we need to launch a new era in the road sector. By saving any number of human lives we will be doing a lot for European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to use modern technology as much as possible to make transport safer and more efficient. Estimates indicate that if all cars were fitted with electronic stability control (ESC) there could be as many as four thousand fewer fatalities in the EU each year. Another important safety feature, which has not yet been generally introduced, is the pan-European in-vehicle accident notification system known as eCall. Research indicates that its introduction throughout the European Union could reduce traffic fatalities by two and a half thousand each year. The final issue that should be considered is the large amount of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases emitted by cars, comprising 12% of total CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions in the EU. I think that cars with the lowest CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions should be marketed using social campaigns.

Yet these heartless generals take little notice of what we tell them. Instead, they continue their firm hold on power in a most disgustingly pompous and irritating manner.</p>

An example, of course, is the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who led the National League for Democracy to victory in elections held 18 years ago and has spent 12 years in detention – and recently the junta decided to further extend the period of her house arrest.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the time has come for more severe measures to be taken against the monstrous junta in Burma.

<p class="contents">There used to be an American play called ‘Same Time, Next Year’. Our Parliament is a bit like that with Burma. Every year we meet and discuss the situation in Burma. To be honest, there is no real, significant change. I agree with the facts presented by the previous speakers. A situation where a woman, the leader of the opposition, has been held under house arrest for so many years is unheard of in the world. We should not get used to this situation. I hope that we can overcome the divisions in this Parliament and speak with one voice in defence of democracy in Burma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In September 2007, after the Buddhist monks’ protests had been brutally crushed, a news embargo was imposed. Last month, international organisations were prevented from helping the victims of the cyclone. There was a lengthy delay before aid workers were able to reach the people in distress, and for some the aid came too late.</p>
<p class="contents">Now other reports of an equally alarming nature are filtering out, such as the news of the arrests of cyclone victims who had sought help from UN offices. In addition, security forces shot dead or seriously wounded inmates who were trying to flee from a prison destroyed by Cyclone Nargis. The EU did not turn a blind eye. It imposed a trade embargo, although that has not yet had the desired impact. It threatened to apply tougher sanctions if the human rights situation did not improve. Yet the Burmese leaders have not moved an inch.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not relax our demands. The country’s political prisoners must be released. The house arrest in which Aung San Suu Kyi has been living for decades must be lifted. The courageous commitment shown by that Nobel prize winner would be anathema to any dictator. The Burmese generals must ultimately be held to account for the way they have dealt with their own country’s citizens, many of whom are still missing. The dialogue with the United Nations’ Special Rapporteur and the assurance that he would be allowed to visit the country constitute a first step. The governments of the Member Countries of ASEAN should also use their influence to bring the junta to its senses. There is a need to increase pressure on China too, which is probably the only remaining supporter of Burma. If necessary, the Council and the EU Member States must tighten their sanctions. Commissioner, we are truly waiting for you to act – the people of Burma need our solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It demands unanimous support from the population in defending those values.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish that claim were true and that the people of Burma could be happy with the situation in the past 40 years, but what are the values that the regime is defending? Four characteristics come to mind. Firstly, privileges for a military caste; a closed armed group controls the administration and the economy. That group can enrich itself, while others stay poor. Secondly, the repression of national minorities, the groups in the country with a different language and culture who want self-government. Their territories were added to Burma in the British colonial period, but there they are relegated to the status of third-rate citizens. Thirdly, foreign revenue is earned with exports based on competition through extremely low wages or forced labour. Fourthly, the systematic refusal to consult with groups that want to change that situation, even though they once won the only free elections this regime dared to hold.</p>
<p class="contents">With the aid after the flood disaster, we realised how much the regime fears the possibility that foreigners will see at first hand how bad the situation is or that they will influence the population. Internal refugees have to return quickly to devastated villages that have not been rebuilt, purely in order to prevent contact between disaffected masses. Immediately after the disaster, priority was given to holding a referendum whose main purpose was to exclude the democratic opposition permanently from power by means of a false result. The imprisonment of people on political grounds is a means of survival for such a regime. The outside world must stand up for those prisoners and other opponents. China and India should do so, as well as Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have before us two reports relating to the situation in Burma. The first was produced by the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the second is a report from the Special Rapporteur of the United Nations on the human rights situation in Burma. These reports are unequivocal. They speak of the imprisonment of parliamentarians, assassinations, terrible conditions in prisons for political prisoners and a catastrophic situation for civilisation in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Acting as the European Parliament, we must put pressure on the authorities in Burma. For the situation to change over the coming weeks and months, what is needed is concerted action by all democratic parliaments throughout the world, as well as the cooperation of countries such as India and China, to put pressure on the authorities in Burma, so that there may be a real improvement in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to speak of the fate of parliamentarians who today are imprisoned in Burma, both the members of parliament who were arrested in the autumn of 2007 and those who disappeared or died in unknown circumstances, when they were arrested, as well as those who were assassinated and who died in unexplained circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by the United Nations rapporteur is clear. The immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi would be a start for talks with the authorities in Burma on democracy and improvements in the human rights situation in that country. Guaranteeing freedom for political prisoners and, first and foremost, providing medical assistance to those prisoners, is of fundamental importance and this we must force onto the authorities in Burma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, the whole diplomatic effort should go, on the one hand, towards supporting even a weak and barely visible opposition, and, on the other hand, another solution would be if international political organisations, if international pressure, were supported by force.

Unfortunately, the debates and the resolutions that were passed have not changed the political and social situation in that country, where, since 1962, the army has held to power in one of the most infamous political regimes in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past 40 years thousands of people who have been persecuted and convicted for political activity have been imprisoned in this country, which has experienced disasters inflicted not only by the regime. The population of Burma is forced to work and even children are conscripted into the army. The Secretary General of the League for Democracy has spent thirteen of the last eighteen years as a political prisoner under house arrest and, recently, 1 900 people were arrested — and are living in conditions that breach human rights — for expressing the desire to have democracy in Burma, or even for asking for humanitarian aid, which was needed after the passage of the cyclone.</p>
<p class="contents">The regime in Burma does not just persecute the opposition. In addition, it breached human rights by making it impossible to provide humanitarian aid following the cyclone and this has put the lives of its citizens at risk. It has also forced cyclone victims to leave temporary camps and to return to homes that were destroyed in the disaster. Appeals from the UN Secretary General and other organisations have resulted in more arrests and killings of its tormented citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we support a resolution that contains not only our opposition to the persecution of the Nobel Laureate, but also the proposal to release other political prisoners and to carry out an investigation, under the auspices of the UN, into the allegations of killings of prisoners by the army during the recent disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who was also awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, has been imprisoned without trial, despite pressure from international organisations. 1 900 opposition activists are being held in jail in inhuman conditions in Burma. What is also worrying are the reports of the murders of 36 prisoners in a prison facility in Rangoon, and the wounding of a further 70, as a result of the panic caused by the cyclone that devastated Burma in May this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The ruling regime should immediately lift all restrictions on free speech and fundamental rights, including bans on peaceful political activity. Burma has a responsibility to provide aid to cyclone victims and to give free access to the affected regions to international humanitarian organisations. Strengthening existing economic sanctions and controls over the junta’s access to EU aid, as well as increased political pressure from ASEAN, will certainly improve the chances of stabilising the situation in Burma. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The military regime is becoming more aggressive as regards political prisoners.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charlie McCreevy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is unfortunately not here today, so I shall – on her behalf – share with you a few remarks about the situation in Burma/Myanmar.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s motion for a resolution focuses on the political situation and in particular on the continued detention of political prisoners. Before commenting on this issue, I would like to inform you about the Commission’s activities in response to the cyclone which devastated the delta of the Ayeryawaddy River six weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s response to the cyclone was quick and substantial: we have approved EUR 17 million in humanitarian aid, including EUR 5 million in food aid. We have also activated the civil protection mechanism – the cooperation with the EU Member States having joined the mechanism has worked very well. We cover water purification, boat transport, primary health care and other issues of importance in the post-disaster context.</p>
<p class="contents">The humanitarian emergency is not over. So far, approximately half of the survivors reached, that is, one million, are still in desperate need. Accessing the disaster-hit areas and distribution of aid is not without difficulties. This has as much to do with the size of the disaster as with the bureaucracy. Our field workers in Myanmar report gradually better cooperation from authorities. Our own humanitarian activities continue with reasonable efficiency. We recognise that the international NGOs are in a more difficult situation, as regards access to the stricken areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In the mean time, the ASEAN countries have taken the lead in coordinating external assistance. They are a member of the so-called ‘Tripartite Mechanism’, which comprises the ASEAN countries, the Government of Burma/Myanmar, and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Government has issued new ‘guidelines’ for external aid. We have no evidence yet whether they are being used to narrow the space for aid delivery.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, the cyclone and its terrible consequences are a purely humanitarian issue. We defend the concept of ‘needs-based’ humanitarian relief.</p>
<p class="contents">On the political situation in Burma/Myanmar, the Government seems committed to proceed with its so-called ‘Road Map to Democracy’. We read this road map as a tightly controlled, slow transition towards a civilian government where the military still plays a dominant role. The Government seems committed to deliver, at its own pace and without regard to views and comments from outside. Realistically, there is hardly an alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">National reconciliation would require an inclusive dialogue. Such dialogue cannot take place with political stakeholders in jail or under house arrest. This is why we continue to push for the release of all political prisoners. My colleague, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, has said publicly that the Government has missed a chance to send a signal of reconciliation at a moment of national distress when the Government again extended the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Burma/Myanmar would deserve a system of government which focuses on economic and social development, and on the participation of the electorate in the political process. For Europe, expressing our indignation and isolating the country is clearly not an adequate response. The people of Burma/Myanmar shall not pay the price of a political stalemate. They deserve better.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to highlight our commitment to follow closely the situation in Burma/Myanmar. This includes continuing to push for a release of all political prisoners, and for an inclusive dialogue, including legal political parties and ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue a balanced approach. We are not up to confrontation for the sake of confrontation. Our ultimate goal remains to help a peaceful transition to a legitimate, civilian government. This is why we are fully supportive of the good offices of the UN Secretary General and his Special Advisor for Myanmar.</p>
<p class="contents">The interest of the Burmese people is best served with a balanced policy, including substantial assistance. The Commission has carefully chosen the areas of assistance to help the most vulnerable class of society. We have already significantly increased funding and hope that – in a coordinated effort with other donors – the overall funding level could reach the equivalent of what is spent per capita in comparable countries, like Laos and Cambodia. The people of Myanmar deserve a better future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We would also like to ask the Commission, represented here today, to propose a rapid, considerable increase in European Union financial resources for Somalia, particularly on the occasion of the intermediate review of the 10th European Development Fund, and also an increase in its physical presence in that country. I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commission to ask what it is doing or plans to do in this regard.</p>

Thousands of civilians have died as a result, and hundreds of thousands have suffered and are still suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community has taken some action and, it has to be said, with some limited success. But the plight of the Somali people continues, and the killing of civilians in that region, unfortunately, has now become a routine matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Bold and effective additional action is necessary, mainly – in my view – as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the UN arms embargo on Somalia must be strictly enforced. This must include China, which is the usual culprit in such situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it must be ensured that all UN and EU aid going to Somalia reaches those in real and legitimate need and does not enter the pockets of war lords.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, pressure must be exerted on the UN Security Council to proceed urgently with the implementation of its unanimous decision of 15 May 2008 to deploy a sufficiently strong UN peacekeeping force in the region – making sure, of course, that such peace-keepers are not of the same quality as those who recently were accused of committing crimes against the local population they were supposed to protect.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the African Union must, once again, be made to understand that it bears primary responsibility for what is happening in African regions such as Somalia, and – instead of much ineffective rhetoric – it must take urgent and practical action against all those regimes or other parties or factions that are throwing African people deeper into primitive and desperately dramatic situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Somaliland still has a degree of independence and stability, as does Puntland. But Mogadishu is a name synonymous with violence, murder, riots, hunger and a failed economy.</p>
<p class="contents">So what do we do? Well, we cannot do that much. Certainly not individually; probably not as Europe. But we can work with other international players to put pressure on the players inside the country to agree to halt the ongoing conflict, to halt violence, to stop the violations of international human rights and to work towards peace.</p>
<p class="contents">We have got to persuade them to allow humanitarian assistance to reach those most in need, and we have, perhaps, to help them ensure the safety of those humanitarian aid workers.</p>
<p class="contents">We must appeal to those outside who can help. We appeal to Kenya to allow Somali refugees to have access to the El Wak border and the right to assistance in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">We appeal to everyone, as has been referred to already, to ensure that we have the embargo on the sale of arms to that country.

In the south and centre of the country there has been fighting between the militias of various warlords for years and in the north the administration of the territory of the former British colony of Somaliland that is operating there is not recognised internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">Then a conflict broke out between the Union of Islamic Courts and the army of neighbouring Ethiopia. Talks about reunification of the country never received general support and those who did support them often stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">The years of chaos soon turn support from the rest of the world for any transitional government into interference in insoluble armed domestic conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past few years I have warned a number of times that, by helping to finance failing structures, the European Union is being tied to one of the warring parties without any prospect of a lasting and widespread solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe certainly has to help if a solution is possible, but over-hasty interference leads to disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">In a previous urgent debate on Somalia on 15 November 2007, this Parliament adopted a resolution calling for an end to foreign military intervention and for dialogue and reconciliation within the country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be welcomed that the resolution that has now been tabled speaks out against European Union support for warlords who are trying to re-establish their power, against the use of child soldiers and against further arms supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday there was an unsuccessful attempt to murder the Transitional President, Abdullahi Yusuf. Armed troops are still in sharp conflict with each other. We now have to see whether the agreement reached last week to end the violence within 30 days and to replace the Ethiopian intervention force with a United Nations peacekeeping force has a real chance of success.

The only option, in my view, is for the UN force to be deployed, but it must be supplemented by appropriate civilian structures. As far as the Transitional Federal Government is concerned, we have to ask where the transition is leading. It is either a transition to a viable autonomous structure, or else it is necessary to establish an international civilian structure, as has happened in other countries. If we do not get this right, we shall ultimately have the entire nation dependent on humanitarian aid.

Such personnel face significant risks on a daily basis in their attempts to deliver food to those most in need.

<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to share your concern about the continuing conflict and political instability in Somalia. Somalia remains a context where fundamental rights and respect for basic human dignity continue to be shunned by armed entities perpetrating systematic and widespread attacks against civilians. Seventeen years of statelessness have seen loss of civilian life, mass displacements and destruction of physical infrastructures. One third of the population, corresponding to 2.6 million people, depends on humanitarian aid today. The European Union, together with other key international actors, is committed to helping at this critical juncture.</p>
<p class="contents">At the political level, the EU will continue to provide its full support to the UN Special Representative of the Secretary General in his efforts to coordinate the action of the international community and to facilitate inter-Somali political dialogue. We are now examining – together with other donors – the appropriate ways and means to better assist Somalis to effectively implement the Djibouti Agreement reached on 9 June. This agreement offers fresh hope for long-term peace and stability to the people of Somalia.</p>
<p class="contents">At humanitarian level, the EU is mainly focusing on supporting basic sectors such as health, nutrition, food assistance, shelter and non-food relief items, water and sanitation, as part of a range of activities particularly targeting central and southern areas of the country that have been badly affected by civilian strife and extreme natural hazards.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2007 our Humanitarian Aid Department managed to provide EUR 18 million in humanitarian assistance. In response to the worsening humanitarian situation and to the increase in food prices, the level of assistance should reach a total of EUR 27 million for this year.</p>
<p class="contents">At the development level, the EU is already the main aid donor for Somalia, providing medium- to long-term support for establishing a peaceful and self-sustainable society.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Country Strategy for Somalia allocates more than EUR 212 million for the period 2008-2013, under the 10th European Development Fund. One third of this programme will be spent on education, which is relevant to respect for human rights. The critical goal is to encourage reconciliation, democracy and the development of governance structures at all levels. However, without peace and security it is not possible to engage effectively in longer-term development. Priority is therefore given to promoting a peaceful and secure environment in which human rights are respected and democratic processes and institutions can develop.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Michel met with the Somali President, just a few days ago, on the margin of the IGAD Summit in Addis Ababa. On that occasion, President Yusuf made a strong appeal for international assistance to support a better, secure environment for people living in Somalia. We gave a commitment to provide strong support for the Somali Government to this end. The European Commission is already financing the training of Somali police forces through the UN, and funds are also being contributed to the costs of the AMISOM operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately the political process of reconciliation and stabilisation will also depend on the engagement and support of key regional players, namely Ethiopia and Eritrea, which have used the Somali theatre for a ‘proxy war’. In this respect the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops from Somalia is a key element for any political breakthrough.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Michel, who met Prime Minister Meles of Ethiopia and President Isaias of Eritrea last weekend, urged them to support the Djibouti process, which, although far from being perfect, offered a real if not the only opportunity to bring together the different Somali actors.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the difficult circumstances, the Commission will continue its programme of aid to Somalia, which has been designed with Member States, in order to alleviate the suffering of the Somali population and to establish the ground for a peaceful society.</p>
<p class="contents">Some questions were raised about piracy and I would add that, although it is not competent for the deployment of naval forces as foreseen by UNSC Resolution 1816, the Commission has set up, together with the Council, a working group composed of the relevant directorates-general – namely the Energy and Transport DG, the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries DG, the Development DG and EuropeAid – to study the best way to implement the UN resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Iranian judiciary has the sad record of imposing the second highest number of executions per capita in the world. Only China carries out more executions than Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned in the resolution, two important agreements, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ban the death penalty as punishment for crimes committed when the perpetrator is under 18. The most serious aspect is that Teheran has ratified both agreements. Although ratification is positive, the country does not respect these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping and drugs trafficking are punishable by death in Iran. Most of the children were sentenced for murder, but many sentences seem to be based on unreliable confessions, obtained by torture and during interrogations at which the detained were denied the right of access to a lawyer.</p>
<p class="contents">The courts routinely ignore evidence presented by defendants showing that the accused acted in self-defence.</p>
<p class="contents">The execution of children in Iran will be one of the issues included in the report to the General Assembly by the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in September.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask Iran to stop these executions once and for all, including those of at least 85 people who are sentenced to death for crimes committed when they were children.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not want to finish without saying I consider that, this week, Parliament and the European Union have lost a certain moral credibility to defend the rights of children, when yesterday this Chamber approved a shameful directive that allows the imprisonment of children for committing the crime of coming to Europe without papers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a completely different situation from the issues we have been discussing, like the matters debated today with regard to Somalia or Burma. In these situations it is not an issue of some internal disorder, it is an issue of a different civilisation. It reminds us of Huntington’s book ‘The Clash of Civilisations’, or of the books of the great historian and philosopher Feliks Koneczny, who spoke of fundamental differences in civilisations. If we wish to resolve these problems, then we must think how we can influence these regimes to change their mentality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also against forcing our values and our lifestyle on different cultures for one reason alone, namely opening the door to supra-national capital leading to the sources of raw materials on this planet and so to latter-day colonialism. However, I opposed the barbaric acts that are still being carried out although the reasons for doing so have long gone. Moreover, there is no justification in Iranian culture for the barbaric acts of executions of juvenile offenders and even political opponents committed by the Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s Iranian regime. In the past, this country used to carry out the death penalty only in exceptional cases and public executions took place only as a punishment for mass murders or child murders. Under the current Iranian Government, however, hundreds of executions take place each year, and many of them involve juveniles, such as 17-year old Mohammad Hassanzadeh, who was executed on 10 June. Recently I saw photographs of public executions in Iran. Believe me, they are among the worst things I have seen in my life.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group, the GUE/NGL Group, is using the European Parliament to call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease executions with immediate effect, especially the executions of people who committed a criminal offence when they were juveniles. Under Mr Ahmadinejad, Iran has long been sending not just mass murderers to the gallows but also people who have committed acts that in developed countries receive much lighter punishments or are not even considered to be against the law. The country must review its understanding of the law and modify it to ensure that human life is respected. Until this happens, Iran will stay on the margins of the civilised world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Can I please clarify that it is often a case of relations between juveniles of the same sex, for example, which are not even a crime, and which lead to death sentences and public executions, as has already been seen in films recording the barbarity of the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">This barbarity is not confined to juveniles, however, and is not confined to execution by stoning, to the records of the execution. It also involves the external dimension of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore ask the European institutions once again why they continue to encourage the terrorist regime in Tehran to classify the opposition Iranian People’s Mujahedin as terrorists, as our fellow member Mr Matsakis has stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it that instead of condemning terrorism and human rights violations, they use economic and trade packages to encourage Tehran to condemn the victims of terrorism? This is completely immoral and indefensible and is a policy that will inevitably lead us to a confrontation, to war, if we do not challenge it quickly.</p>

This is not the first such decision from the Iranian justice system. Fortunately Iran is one of just a few countries that sentence teenagers to death and, what is worse, actually carry out these sentences. In addition, over the past three years, Iranian sentences have constituted over two thirds of all sentences of this type in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is outrageous that Iran should breach international conventions, to which it is a signatory, and which categorically prohibit such measures, in such a blatant manner. This raises a question of a much more general nature: does the international community have any mechanisms and instruments to deal with such countries? In other words, is it possible for breaches of undertakings made voluntarily by a given country to result in some tangible and meaningful sanctions?</p>
<p class="contents">This brings two things to mind. The first is the need to reconsider the much-used concept of rule of law. Convictions of teenagers for homosexual behaviour may be in accordance with the law in force in Iran, but we cannot, of course, agree with rule of law understood in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that if we demand that others should comply with their undertakings as well as with reasonable laws that comply with basic freedoms, then we should respect these laws ourselves.

<p class="contents">The Commission shares your deep concern about this harrowing question. While, as you know, the Commission lacks a representation in Tehran, it follows the human rights situation very closely and acts in close concertation with the EU Member States’ embassies represented there. It is important to note that the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission have taken a coherent and consistent line. The seriousness of our concerns has been clearly stated through the three statements published by the EU Presidency over the past two weeks: on 4 and 10 June, over the cases of Mr Fadaei, Mr Shojaee and Mr Jazee, all facing imminent executions for crimes committed when they were minors; and on 13 June, on the execution of Mohammad Hassanzadeh.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully supports the principle and the content of these statements: there can be no justification for the use of the death penalty by the Iranian authorities in the case of juvenile offenders. This explicitly runs counter to the legally binding provisions of international law, which Iran has ratified, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we have had to issue so many statements at such a rapid pace obviously reflects the growing number of executions in Iran, including of minors. The moratorium decreed by Iran’s Chief Judiciary, Ayatollah Shahroudi, on youth executions is blatantly violated by his own judges.</p>
<p class="contents">But, unfortunately, the tone and the frequency of our statements on Iran also reflect the fact that our dialogue and démarches on human rights in general and on the issue of juvenile executions in particular have not been effective. The Iranian authorities increasingly turn a deaf ear to our calls for compliance with international human rights law and we have therefore no choice but to resort to the so-called ‘megaphone diplomacy’ via public statements that Tehran claims to abhor and reject.</p>
<p class="contents">Iran must face up to its own responsibilities. For its part, following the execution of Mr Hassanzadeh, the Commission has explicitly told the Iranian authorities that such an act could only cast a shadow over’s Iran’s international reputation and our relationship. Without a concrete improvement of the human rights situation, our common objective of developing substantively the relationship between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran is hindered.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the European Parliament and all EU partners will agree to this line and act accordingly. Therefore, I solemnly reiterate our call to the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran to abide by the international conventions to which it is party and spare the life of all minors still on death row. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In the second half of 2008 three important international meetings will be held: the Third High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (Accra, 2-4 September), a high-level event on the millennium development goals (New York, 25 September) and an international conference on monitoring financing for development to review implementation of the Monterrey Consensus (Doha, 29 November-2 December).</p>
<p>On 27 May 2008 as part of the preparations for the participation of the EU at these meetings, the Council adopted decisions on the EU as a global partner for development: speeding up progress towards the millennium development goals, in which the ‘The EU strongly reaffirms its long-term financial commitment with developing countries to achieve a collective ODA target of 0.56% GNI by 2010 and 0.7% GNI by 2015, as set out in the May 2005 Council Conclusions, the June 2005 European Council Conclusions and the European Consensus on Development’.</p>
<p>In 2002 and 2005 the European Union adopted commitments of historic importance, in order to contribute to the progress and success of international development financing, but is seriously concerned about the reduction in the amount of common official development assistance (ODA) from EUR 47.7 billion in 2006 to EUR 46 billion in 2007. Despite this, Europe remains the biggest donor in the world, especially in Africa, and judging from the Commission report the reduction in assistance is only temporary. If the forecasts from Member States for 2008 are accurate, the level of assistance this year should again reach a record level.</p>
<p>In order for the EU’s commitments to be more credible in the eyes of the international community, the Council has strongly urged Member States, taking into account the monitoring conference in Doha, to formulate as soon as possible a continuous orientational multi-year time frame, which will show how they intend in national budget procedures and in the context of current competences to achieve the ODA targets.</p>
<p>As for the millennium development goals, the EU will – if possible by the June 2008 meeting of the European Council – draw up an action plan that will define the specific landmarks and measures, along with time frames, in key areas such as education, health, gender equality, water, agriculture, growth and infrastructure, which will contribute to fulfilling the millennium development goals by 2015.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0370"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council of the European Union is aware of the position of the Islamic movement Ahmadiyah (Jamaah Ahmadiyah) in Indonesia. The Council is concerned at reports of violence and intolerance towards this movement, and also because it would appear that the Indonesian Government is considering a ban or restrictions on its activities.</p>
<p>We know Indonesia primarily for its democratic, pluralist and tolerant society, and these developments could stain its reputation, which of course it has earned.</p>
<p>On 9 June the Indonesian Government decided that Ahmadiyah could continue to function in the future as a religious community. It had to be enabled to profess its faith and hold religious rites. It was necessary, however, to prohibit all activities of this movement aimed at spreading different interpretations of the ‘basic teachings of Islam’.</p>
<p>The EU Council’s Working Party on Human Rights (COHOM) raised the issue of attacks on the Ahmadiyah community in its May meeting. On 28 May 2008 the EU troika delivered to the Indonesian Director of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs at the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs a coordinated demarche in which it called upon the Indonesian Government to do its utmost to provide for the safety of members of the Ahmadiyah community and to protect their mosques, as well as to conduct a proper investigation into a fire at one mosque. The Director responded to the concern of the EU regarding the attacks and possible ban on the movement with her own expression of concern, and gave an assurance that the Indonesian Government would address this issue seriously and at a high level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0372"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the burning issues to which the Member has drawn attention. However, the debates on both directives are still at a very early stage. For the moment the three institutions have not yet agreed on appropriate levels for both targets. One of the Council’s objectives in further negotiation will be to ensure the harmony and proportionality of the agreed targets.</p>
<p>It is very hard to make a direct link between the two targets. The target of the proposed directive on renewable energy sources relates to all types of renewable fuels for transport, involving not just biofuels, but for instance also hydrogen and electricity obtained from renewable sources. It also relates to all forms of transport, including air and maritime transport. However, the aim of the fuel quality directive is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fuels used to power road vehicles and off-road mobile machinery. The use of biofuels is one of many possibilities that the relevant industries could use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other possibilities include reducing flaring off at wells and increasing the efficiency of refineries. The scope for using biofuels therefore depends on their availability, relative costs and the saving from greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The three institutions have also agreed in principle that biofuels must adhere to sustainable criteria for reducing possible negative direct effects that might arise through production. The substance of these criteria, which are still a subject of debate, would also influence the spread of biofuels in the market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In the weeks following Cyclone Nargis the EU focused on providing emergency assistance. In close cooperation with the European Commission, on 14 May 2008 the Presidency called an extraordinary session of the GAERC Council (development), at which the humanitarian conditions in Burma/Myanmar were addressed. In its conclusions the Council called upon the authorities of that country to enable unimpeded access to areas in Burma/Myanmar that had been affected by the cyclone.</p>
<p>At the May meeting of the GAERC Council, development ministers again appealed to the authorities in Burma/Myanmar to fulfil the promises they gave to ASEAN and the UN at the donors’ conference in Rangoon (25 May 2008) concerning access for humanitarian workers and humanitarian assistance to the affected areas. The Council took the view that it would be more appropriate if special attention was focused on humanitarian issues, since this could help more victims of the disaster.</p>
<p>The Council publicly regrets that the house arrest of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was extended on 27 May, and again calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners and detainees. Furthermore, the EU regrets that the authorities of Burma/Myanmar conducted the constitutional referendum on 10 and 24 May in an overall climate of intimidation; for this reason the results lack credibility.</p>
<p>The EU trusts that multiparty elections, which the authorities have announced for 2010, will be prepared and carried out in a way that ensures a credible transition to democracy. Only real dialogue with all politically interested parties will help Burma/Myanmar achieve stability and prosperity. The EU will continue to strive in this direction in the future (including in UN forums), specifically through expression of support for the further activities of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and Special Adviser Ibrahim Gambari, and through the actions of the EU’s special envoy Mr Fassin, who has just returned from Southeast Asia.</p>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is greatly concerned at the continuously deteriorating situation in the north of Mali and Niger. This situation actually signifies a continuation of the major crisis resulting in part from drought, desertification, insufficient development and the infiltration of political Islam, which has affected the entire Sahel, from Somalia across to Mauritania.</p>
<p>The Council is therefore striving to be able to contribute to resolving this crisis. The deployment of European forces (EUFOR) in Chad (and in the Central African Republic) is contributing in a certain way to stabilising the entire Sahel. If the Chad containment collapses, however, the entire Sahel would be threatened by anarchy and violence.</p>
<p>This issue, which especially affects Mali and Niger, is regularly addressed within the Council. The issue is also being closely followed by the SG/HR: both the Malian president and the prime minister of Niger have been received in Brussels. The SG/HR was also represented at the investiture of President Touré. His envoy discussed the Sahel issue for a long time with responsible persons in leading positions in Mali. In talks with the highest authorities of Algeria and Libya, which are playing a key role in the current efforts to calm the crisis, the SG/HR regularly addresses this matter. In this connection it should be pointed out that all efforts are based on the agreements concluded in Algiers in May 2006. The SG/HR also addressed this issue with the executive secretary of ECOWAS, Dr Mohamed Ibn Chambas, specifically at the recent meeting of the troika with that body, and on 23 May 2008 the SG/HR published a statement on the recent attack in Abeibara.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0378"></a>

<p>On 15 May 2008, the President of the Luxembourg Central Bank stated that the quality of the guarantees provided by the commercial banks to the ECB's refinancing service had sharply deteriorated.

These banks are preparing securities consisting of low-rated debts with a view to exchanging them for higher-quality treasury loans with the ECB. Long-term refinancing operations carried out by the banks with the ECB on the basis of such securities of dubious value have considerably increased in the last months, and one may quite justifiably be highly disturbed by this state of affairs.</p>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is well aware of the consequences of rising energy prices for European citizens, as well as their negative impact on the European economy; this issue was also addressed at recent meetings.</p>
<p>For some time the Council has supported the active policy in the area of energy efficiency and diversification of energy supply, which can contribute to a slowing down in the growth of energy prices, while the different routes of energy supply concern countries and regions, transport routes and types of fuel.</p>
<p>In 2003 the Council, together with Parliament, adopted Directive 2003/30/EC on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport; this directive expressly provides framework targets for a minimum proportion of renewable fuels that Member States would have to place in their markets within specific deadlines. The Council advises that at the spring session of the European Council in March 2007, the action plan ‘Energy Policy for Europe’ was adopted. This sets the binding target of a 20 per cent share of energy from renewable sources in the entire consumption of energy in the EU by 2020. In line with these targets it is currently studying the Commission’s proposal for a directive on promoting the use of energy from renewable sources, which will, when it is adopted, be an additional contribution to reducing the use of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Another important area of action is energy efficiency, which in its appeal for greater energy efficiency was also confirmed by the spring European Council of March 2007 – specifically that 20 per cent savings in energy consumption be achieved by 2020. The valid legislation is contributing to the fulfilment of this target, for instance the directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services, which was adopted in 2006 by Parliament and the Council. Moreover with the aim of promoting energy efficiency on a global level the Council actively supports the establishing of an international platform for cooperation in the area of energy efficiency.</p>
<p>The Council emphasises that there is a need to improve the transparency of oil markets, promote competition in energy markets and strengthen dialogue with oil-producing countries. The Council would also draw attention to the agreement reached in 2005 in Manchester, under which we should avoid any tax-related and other political intervention that would distort competition, since this would prevent economic subjects from adapting appropriately. The measures intended to mitigate the consequences of higher oil prices for the poorer sections of society should be short-term and goal-orientated, and should not distort competition.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0405"></a>

<p>Because of obstructionism on the part of the US authorities, and their systematic refusal over the past two years to grant them to the relatives, visas now take longer to obtain: the waiting time required has risen on average to about a year and can run to as much as two years, as in the case of Elizabeth Palmeiro, the wife of Ramón Labañino, who has not been visited by family members since June 2006. Antonio Guerrero has been denied a visit from his relatives for more than 17 months, and Fernando González has not received any visit for over a year. As a result of the actions of the US authorities, Adriana Pérez has been prevented from visiting Gerardo Hernández, her husband, since 12 September 1998, and Olga Salaneuva has been unable, for the same reason, to visit her husband, René González, since August 2000.</p>

Negotiations continuously progress at regional level, while their objective is the earliest possible conclusion of EPAs in the agreed timeframes and with the inclusion of different sectors.</p>
<p>The negotiation process for an EPA is one of the most important matters in the work of the Council. In its session of 27 May 2008 the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) adopted a new package of decisions on economic partnership agreements (EPA). The Council emphasised once again the development-orientated nature of such agreements. The Council welcomes the initialled comprehensive EPA with the CARIFORUM region, which will be signed on 23 July 2008 in Barbados and which it believes to have a promoting role in the processes of regional integration in that region. As regards other regions, the Council has found that the initialling of temporary agreements has prevented the danger of disturbance to market flows, which was of great importance. Now the temporary agreements need to be signed and the WTO informed of this. However, the temporary agreements can be considered merely to be a first step, since only comprehensive regional economic partnership agreements will be able to fulfil the full development potential of the relevant regions.</p>
<p>In its decisions the Council has found with satisfaction that at the start of continued negotiations in 2008 the parties emphasised the common desire to continue negotiations aimed at concluding comprehensive regional economic partnership agreements. The Council strongly supports these joint efforts and is aware of the reservations expressed by ACP partners, and requests that flexibility be incorporated into the deliberation of unresolved issues, both in terms of substance and the actual process of adopting temporary or complete EPA agreements, along with asymmetries compatible on the level of the entire WTO.</p>
<p>The Council believes that economic partnership agreements can play a key and positive role in the regional integration of ACP countries, and that they should be built on existing processes of regional cooperation. The Council is also prepared to support regional integration and economic partnership agreements with trade assistance funds, but points out that trade assistance does not depend on the signing of an EPA or a temporary agreement. The Council emphasises the importance of the current political dialogue with ACP regions regarding EPAs, in order to strengthen the spirit of partnership under the Cotonou Agreement, and will continue to monitor the process on the side of the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0417"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>You are most probably aware that in recent years, promoting the development of a framework for research and innovation on the regional level has been one of the main priority tasks of the EU policy in the field of research and innovation. As for research policy, the Seventh European Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (2007–2013) includes a range of very effective instruments and special programmes (especially the ‘Cooperation’, ‘Capacities’ and ‘People’ programmes).</p>
<p>The new ‘Regions of knowledge’ initiative should also strengthen the research potential in European regions, especially by promoting and supporting the development of regional, research-orientated clusters, bringing together universities, research centres, companies and regional authorities throughout Europe.</p>
<p>We should also mention five common technological initiatives, the initiatives under Article 169 and the initiatives associated with the ERANET system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, effective support for innovations and the introduction of technology at regional level is ensured by the Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation (2007–2013). This is aimed primarily at small and medium-sized enterprises, so it is actually regional innovation and development that has the greatest direct benefit from the programme.</p>
<p>The Slovenian Presidency of the Council also supported the Stockholm Conference on Regional Innovative Clusters in Europe in January 2008. In direct partnership with the Committee of the Regions, the Council committed itself to the creation of a handbook aimed at those involved in research and innovation, and this would contain information on how to exploit the possibility of financing from all existing Community sources, including the Structural Funds; the European Commission is expected to publish the handbook this summer. In this regard attention should also be drawn to the exceptionally important reorientation of Structural Fund operations, which promises much; they should be harmonised with the goals of the Lisbon Strategy regarding competitiveness, innovation, growth and new jobs.</p>
<p>Regional development and prosperity should also be promoted by the Commission initiative for the leading market. The principles of this initiative were confirmed by the Competition Council at the meeting of 29 and 30 May 2008.</p>
<p>Implementation of the aforementioned Lisbon objectives at regional level should also be accelerated by the future mid-term review of the financial framework for the period 2007–2013.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0422"></a>

<p>This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on the Member States, was not given orally during questions to the Council at the June 2008 session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is very aware of the possible difficulties described by the Member in her question stemming from the commitment of Lithuania, under the Act of Accession of 2003, to close by 31 December 2009 at the latest Unit 2 (the last unit in operation) of the Ignalina nuclear power station and then dismantle that unit.</p>
<p>In relation to the assumed obligations under the relevant Protocol 4 to the Act of Accession concerning the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania, the Council advises that all Member States have taken on obligations; any kind of change in such obligations, such as the multiannual extension on the operation of the Ignalina nuclear power station mentioned by the Member, would require an amendment in accordance with the procedure under the Act of Accession, especially Article 7 therein.</p>
<p>The Council wishes to draw the Member’s attention to Article 4 of Protocol 4, which states that up until 31 December 2012, in a special case where ‘if energy supply is disrupted in Lithuania’, Lithuania may invoke the general protection clause referred to in Article 37 of the Act of Accession. It should be emphasised that the aforementioned Article 4 would be applied ‘without any prejudice to the provisions of Article 1’, which sets the date of closure.</p>
<p>The Council is aware that many different measures will be needed to limit and eliminate the possible consequences of shutting down the Ignalina nuclear power station. Measures include, but are not limited to, developing new production capacities, a large number of long-distance electricity transmission lines between Lithuania and other Member States, improving energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources. If the Commission decides to submit proposals for such measures, the Council will give them due attention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0354"></a>

<p>The Commission is following closely the expansion of Heathrow airport and its environmental impact. The competent UK authorities have now finalised the environmental impact assessment of the project, with the public consultation closing in February 2008. The Commission has also received up to date air quality data which confirm exceedance of limit values in the London region.</p>
<p>According to European Union (EU) legislation, it is the responsibility of the United Kingdom (UK) authorities to assess the impact of particular infrastructure projects and ensure that all relevant environmental standards are respected before, during and after the implementation of the project.</p>
<p>The Commission follows UK implementation of provisions in the relevant Community legislation. The 'Project for the sustainable development of Heathrow'<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> includes the UK government's commitment to consider adding a third runway only after public consultation and whilst “complying with strict conditions on air quality and noise”.</p>
<p>On the basis of available information the assessment of environmental impacts has complied with the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, and the public consultation has taken place as required. The Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive 2001/42/EC<a href="#defann_18_3" name="refann_18_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> has not been applied as the process was launched before it was applicable.</p>
<p>The model results of the impact assessment include explicit projections of the exceedance of the annual nitrogen dioxide limit value, even after 2015. This is five years after its attainment date, and beyond maximum possible postponement conditionally allowed under the new Air Quality Directive<a href="#defann_18_4" name="refann_18_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. This is a cause of concern. The UK may however introduce further abatement measures to compensate for the increased environmental pressure.</p>
<p>The air pollution originating from the potential expansion of Heathrow airport should be included in the update of the air quality plan for greater London. Projected compliance with all the limit values by their respective attainment dates must be demonstrated in the plan by identifying the abatement measures chosen.</p>
<p>In summary, the Commission is aware of the significant environmental pressures, in particular in noise and air pollution, caused by the increase in air traffic throughout Europe. It therefore follows with interest the developments at the EU's largest airport, and monitors implementation of relevant provisions under Community legislation. After the limit value attainment dates, the Commission will enforce compliance with these standards where necessary. Specific decisions related to airport development, such as building the third runway, are under national competence.</p>
<p>The Commission confirms its willingness to discuss these issues further with MEPs and stakeholder groups.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Commission Regulation (EC) 1451/2007<a href="#defann_19_2" name="refann_19_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the 10-year review programme for active substances used in biocidal products also requires that participants in the review programme make all reasonable efforts to submit a collective dossier. Otherwise, they have to detail in their dossier why co-operation was not possible. The Member States designated as Rapporteurs for the active substances are responsible for verifying compliance with this obligation.</p>
<p>It has to be noted that, while the Directive is against any duplication of animal testing, it does not go as far as to make data-sharing mandatory. For this reason, the Member State in charge of evaluating the active substance has to appreciate in each case what constitutes "reasonable efforts" and whether these have been made or not.</p>
<p>The Commission is not aware of any cases where a Rapporteur Member State declared a dossier complete without checking, where applicable, that data-sharing efforts were made. However, the Commission is aware of a case where a company submitted several incomplete dossiers (vertebrate animal studies missing) within the same deadlines as the notified participants for the active substances in question, and requested additional time to negotiate an agreement with the notified participants to refer to their animal studies. These were initially refused on the grounds that the active substances they are defending are not chemically identical to the ones supported by the company. This claim was challenged by the company and duly examined by the Rapporteur Member State; it appears that it is not correct.</p>
<p>None of the dossiers submitted by the company have been rejected so far as incomplete. The notified participants have meanwhile agreed to discuss data sharing for one of the substances and submitted legal arguments against data sharing for the others.</p>

<p>Following the closure of its one nuclear power station, Lithuania, like several other EU Member States, is going to have to rely on other forms of more environmentally-hostile electricity production, such as solid fuels (like coal and oil), or natural gas, market prices for which have risen considerably. Certain forecasts suggest that in 2010, Lithuania's greenhouse gas emission will for this reason alone have increased from five to seven million tonnes per annum, while electricity prices will have doubled against 2008 prices. Furthermore, a 20 to 30% price increase needs to be taken into account as a result of the emission quota trading system. Lithuania, unfortunately remains isolated in energy terms within the EU and is entirely dependent on its domestic production or on electricity imported from Russia. In view of this exceptional situation as regards its energy supplies, and its socio-economic impact, Lithuania is asking the Commission for a compensation mechanism - i.e. a temporary derogation - in the shape of free and gratis greenhouse gas emission quotas for its power stations, which are going to have to produce the electricity currently produced by nuclear energy (4.5 million tonnes of CO2 per annum) until a new nuclear power station is built.</p>
<p>How does the Commission intend to resolve the problems encountered by Lithuania and other Member States as a result of this exceptional situation as regards energy?

<p>Electricity prices freely determined in a well functioning and competitive electricity market are essential in terms of both fighting climate change and security of electricity supply. In this context, the European Union (EU) emission trading scheme integrates the cost of carbon dioxide (CO<span class="sup">2</span>) emissions in electricity prices. However, EU emission trading is not linked to the liberalisation of the Lithuanian energy market, which would be the main driver for higher electricity prices.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that rising electricity prices may entail cases of social hardship.</p>
<p>For this reason, its proposal to amend the EU Emissions Trading System provides the possibility for revenues from auctioning allowances to be used to address social aspects in lower and middle income households. Through the distribution of auctioning rights, Lithuania would be able to raise substantial revenues that can be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that, in overall economic terms, Lithuania is expected to benefit from the implementation of the climate and energy package as proposed by the Commission, notably through the redistribution of auctioning rights. This will provide sufficient scope for Lithuania to address potential social impacts.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to highlight that the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power plant is a separate issue.</p>
<p>Detailed provisions on the closure are laid down in Protocol No 4 attached to the Accession Treaty of the ten new Member States including Lithuania. The Council and the Commission have acknowledged the need to help Lithuania in decommissioning Ignalina and in providing alternative energy sources making up for the generation capacity lost through the shut-down. In 2006, the relevant legal framework has been extended up to 2013, providing another € 837 million from the Community budget to this end, which adds to the € 285 million granted for the period 2004 to 2006.</p>
<p>The shut-down of Ignalina has also been fully taken into account in the decision on the Lithuanian National Allocation Plan for the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> trading period of the EU ETS from 2008 to 2012: Lithuania has received one third more allowances than its 2005 verified emissions to cater for the closure of Ignalina.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0391"></a>

<p>On 23 May 2008, the Italian Government issued a decree law under which, in the name of the waste emergency in Campania, derogations are granted to many national laws transposing Community directives, such as Directive 1999/31/EC<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on waste and Directive 85/337/EEC<a href="#defann_21_2" name="refann_21_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on environmental impact assessment. In particular, the decree in question does away with the distinction between waste which can be accepted at non-dangerous waste tips and that which cannot, which in practice means that waste, including toxic waste, can be delivered to sites to which it should not. It classifies sites at which waste awaiting treatment is stored for over a year (and even over 3 years) as ‘waste facilities’, when these are quite simply tips. It permits the construction of waste tips without geological barriers, or with geological barriers that fail to meet the relevant standards, and allows the practice of the mixing and dilution of waste.</p>

<p>The waste crisis in Campania has now existed for more than a decade.</p>
<p>To date, whereas over 7000 tonnes of waste are produced daily in Campania, the waste management capacity of the Region is close to zero.</p>
<p>On 6 May 2008 the College therefore decided to refer Italy to the Court of Justice for failure to establish a sufficient network of waste treatment facilities compliant with standards set by Community law accompanied by a coherent long-term waste management strategy with a view to boosting recycling and separate waste collection.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that Italy is making serious attempts in solving the waste crisis in Naples. Italy is aware that now a point of no return has been reached.</p>
<p>The new law decree of 23 May 2008 no.90 which was presented to the Commission in a technical meeting on 30 May 2008 appears to be a rigorous step in the right direction, making separate waste collection plans and targets obligatory as well as providing for new waste infrastructure such as additional landfills and incinerators.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has already expressed on a technical level its deep concern about provisions in this new decree allowing for a wide derogation of Community law, notably key provisions of the Landfill Directive 1999/31/EC<a href="#defann_21_3" name="refann_21_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and other Directives.</p>
<p>Even where the situation appears difficult, Italian authorities must comply with Community environmental legislation.</p>
<p>Compliance with the acquis is not a bureaucratic exercise. Community environmental law establishes a framework for the protection of human health and of the environment. It would be paradoxical if, in order to face sanitary risks in the short term, human health and the environment were again put at risk, for example by not applying key provisions of the Landfill Directive providing for long term sanitary requirements which depend on the nature – hazardous or non-hazardous – of the waste to be landfilled.</p>
<p>The Commission is ready to assist Italy in identifying certain flexibility mechanisms as provided for by other acts of Community legislation, including the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive<a href="#defann_21_4" name="refann_21_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, to help Italy to tackle the current crisis without breaching EC law.</p>
<p>However, the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaty, will stay firm in its position that no derogation of any binding acquis will be permissible.</p>
<p>The Decree-Law of 23 May 2008 is now before the Italian Parliament for conversion into Law, and the Commission will closely scrutinise the legal text which will be finally enacted. Should Italy put legislation in force allowing undue derogations from the acquis, taking legal action under Article 226 of the Treaty would be the only option available to the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission does not regard EU legislation as encouraging the relocation of waste treatment facilities to new Member States as this legislation applies in all Member States.</p>
<p>Installations for the treatment of hazardous waste are covered by the Waste Framework Directive<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Directive on hazardous waste<a href="#defann_22_3" name="refann_22_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and – for installations with a capacity exceeding 10 tonnes a day – by the Directive on integrated pollution prevention and control<a href="#defann_22_4" name="refann_22_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.

<p>Following a successful tiger day organised in the European Parliament, MEPs expressed the gravest concerns about this majestic species becoming extinct in 17 years. This demise is largely due to illegal poaching and trafficking of tiger-related products which are sold across China and East Asia.</p>
<p>Could the Commission explain what actions it will undertake immediately to halt this extinction? In particular, will it provide technical and financial assistance on enforcement of poaching laws to India? Will it ensure that the issue is raised at all meetings the EU has with tiger range states, including India, China and Nepal? What measures can the Commission propose to change attitudes in countries which trade and consume tiger products?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the grave concern about the poaching and illegal trade of tigers.</p>
<p>Under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) commercial international trade in tigers and tiger products has been prohibited since 1975.</p>
<p>However, in several countries poaching is ongoing and poses a big threat to wild populations of the species.</p>
<p>The Community is fully committed to CITES and plays a key role within the Convention, in particular in order to ensure that its provisions are effectively implemented and enforced.</p>
<p>The Commission has urged China on numerous occasions to step up its efforts to tackle illegal wildlife trade. It understands that China has made progress in improving enforcement of CITES, but intends to raise the matter with them again at relevant opportunities in order to ensure that CITES is being enforced effectively.</p>
<p>The Commission has been critical of the slow progress by India on taking enforcement measures and setting up a specialised wildlife crime organisation, but has noted that this country has now recently taken new measures.</p>
<p>The Commission has expressed on many occasions its willingness to provide funding and technical assistance to India in order to support conservation programmes for the species and to address poaching. It is the Commission's intention to raise this further with India in appropriate bilateral meetings.</p>
<p>Although such funding and assistance has not yet been requested by India, the Commission has provided funding through its multilateral programme for an Asian CITES implementation and enforcement workshop in China in 2005. This workshop addressed enforcement issues and regional cooperation in combating illegal trade in tiger products.</p>
<p>The Commission also intends to provide funding for a CITES enforcement meeting due to take place next year, which will focus on illegal tiger trade as well.</p>
<p>The European Community fully supported the decisions to strengthen existing measures under CITES at the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention in June 2007. These decisions include in particular a requirement that the countries concerned improve international cooperation in conservation and trade controls for tigers. It also calls for the set up of regional enforcement networks.</p>
<p>The Range States, including India, China and Nepal, are due to report about progress made to the next CITES Standing Committee meeting in July 2008. The Standing Committee will review the progress and consider any further actions needed. The Commission is studying the documents presented by the Range States and will call on the Standing Committee to ensure that the agreed measures are indeed taken by the countries involved.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully convinced that urgent steps are needed in order to ensure the protection of the species, and will use appropriate opportunities in its regular contacts with the countries concerned to express this view.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0402"></a>

<p>Inhabitants living in the vicinity of the River Nestos and environmental organisations in the area have complained that the section of the river on Greek territory has once again been filled with large quantities of waste originating on the Bulgarian side. This is a regularly repeated occurrence following heavy rainfall when the areas around the dam at Thisavros are swamped by huge quantities of refuse, pesticide cans, hospital materials, tyres etc. emanating from Bulgaria. The Greek authorities have repeatedly raised the matter with the Bulgarian side and meetings have taken place at prefectural and regional level between the two countries but with no result. It should be noted that more than 200 000 hectares of arable land are irrigated by the waters of the River Nestos!</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of the magnitude of the problem and in what way will it exert pressure on the neighbouring country to compel it to honour its commitments to implement the directives on the protection of surface waters and the environment and put an end to the pollution of the River Nestos? Is there any possibility of immediate funding for a programme to monitor contamination levels in the River Nestos in order to control and deal with the pollution emanating from the Bulgarian side?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Clear and ambitious environmental legislation is in place addressing the quality of our waters as well as environmentally safe collection and disposal of solid waste</p>
<p>–	the Water Framework Directive<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and</p>
<p>–	as regards waste, the Waste Framework Directive<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the Landfill Directive<a href="#defann_24_3" name="refann_24_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In particular, the Water Framework Directive provides</p>
<p>–	for an obligation to achieve or maintain good water quality ('good status') for all waters (rivers, lakes, groundwaters, coastal waters) as a rule by 2015;</p>
<p>–	for an obligation to develop for each river basin district the necessary plans and programmes by 22.12.2009, taking into account all human activities;</p>
<p>–	for an obligation, in the case of river basins shared between Member States (such as the Nestos/Mesta basin) for coordination and cooperation between the Member States concerned.</p>
<p>Complementary to this, the EU waste legislation provides for a set of key obligations such as:</p>
<p>–	ensuring that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and the environment, and that waste management plans are drawn up;</p>
<p>–	prohibiting abandonment, dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste;</p>
<p>–	taking appropriate measures to establish networks of disposal installations;</p>
<p>–	or ensuring that only waste that has been subject to treatment is landfilled.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that the quality of Europe's waters is – despite efforts taken in past years and improvement achieved – not yet fully satisfactory. This is notably the case of the waters of the Nestos / Mesta river basin shared between Bulgaria and Greece.</p>
<p>Both countries will be obliged to jointly develop the necessary plans and programmes by December 2009, and to implement the necessary measures, based on the Water Framework Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission is closely following the implementation measures being prepared and taken by Member States based on this key piece of legislation. The Commission's first Implementation Report was presented to the European Parliament and the Council in 2007<a href="#defann_24_4" name="refann_24_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. The Commission can assure the Parliament that it will continue to monitor this closely in all Member States and where necessary take legal enforcement action.</p>
<p>As regards waste management in Bulgaria, the Commission has received information about possible problems with a number of landfills, and has accordingly written to the Bulgarian authorities.</p>
<p>As regards funding possibilities, EU funding instruments are in place to support achievement of environmental objectives.</p>
<p>Measures relating to water management and waste management, from data collection and planning to operational implementation, are eligible under both the Cohesion Fund and the European Fund for Regional Development.</p>
<p>It is however ultimately for Member States to select – within these eligible measures– their priorities and projects.</p>
<p>It is also worth recalling that, whilst funding under the European Fund for Regional Development is available for all Member States, funding under the Cohesion Fund is targeted at certain Member States, inter alia Bulgaria and Greece.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Tackling deforestation is therefore a priority and not only will this contribute to emission reductions but also to other policy goals, in particular poverty eradication and stopping the loss of biodiversity.</p>
<p>Deforestation has been a prominent topic of discussion at recent international negotiations on climate change and on biodiversity. To further develop the policy at European level the Commission is working on a Communication that will explore the options of combating deforestation in developing countries, where the rate of forests loss is on a steady rise.</p>
<p>The total European Union (EU) forest area has been increasing steadily over recent decades. The expansion of forest area in the EU far outweighs the loss of forest land to infrastructure and urban planning.</p>
<p>The issues that will be covered by the Communication include capacity building in developing countries, incentive measures to conserve forest resources as well as a renewed commitment to ensure policy coherence at EU level.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has been funding actions to fight deforestation under the environment and tropical forests budget line (B7-6200), and will continue to do so through the Thematic Programme for Environment and Sustainable Management of Natural Resources including Energy<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (ENRTP).</p>
<p>The question of a new global financial mechanism to cover activities to fight deforestation in developing countries –is a question that is still being debated although a possible source of funding could be earmarking a percentage of the proceeds from the EU-Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) auctioning after 2012.</p>
<p>The timing is important as the period before Copenhagen is key for shaping the future climate change regime, including actions to reduce emissions from deforestation.</p>
<p>The Commission is preparing a stakeholder consultation and is working on an impact assessment study. Based on the results, the Commission will work towards an adoption of the Communication by the end of 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The competent national authorities, as well as the general public, will have an opportunity to express their views and submit their comments during the consultation procedure. These views will be taken into account in the development consent to be granted by the national authorities. It is clear that all relevant information, including the environmental report, will be available also to the Commission and Parliament.</p>

<p>In recent years, various EU Member States have undertaken large-scale regularisation programmes for illegally residing third-country nationals on their territories. Certain countries are currently considering the introduction of national frameworks with general criteria for regularisation. Given the lack of information on this issue at EU level, the Commission announced - in its communication of 2006 on the fight against illegal migration (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2006&amp;nu_doc=0402">COM(2006)0402</a>) - that it would launch a study in 2007 a study on current practices, effects and impacts of regularisation measures in Member States, which would also assess whether there was a need for a common legal framework on regularisations at EU level. Furthermore, Council Decision 2006/688/EC<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 5 October 2006 set up a mutual information mechanism between the Commission and the Member States on planned national asylum and immigration measures.</p>
<p>Can the Commission clarify when the results of the study on regularisation measures can be expected? Does the Commission have data about national regularisation programmes? Does it envisage proposing a common legal framework on regularisations at EU level?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In an area without internal borders ("Schengen"), regularisations conducted by one Member State may have repercussions for the other Member States, in particular large-scale amnesties.</p>
<p>We are facing a severe lack of up-to-date information on Member States´ approaches to regularisations as well as the outcome and impact of such programmes. At the same time, the presence of persons who have been illegally staying, often for many years, and who are unlikely to be returned is an issue in all Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore launched a study which looks into Member States´ current regularisation practices and, in particular, the policy effectiveness of such measures. Results of this study are expected for the end of July 2008.</p>
<p>The study will also include country reports, that is, detailed information about regularisation programmes that have been conducted in Member States in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>With this study, we will have a solid basis for future discussion, including on whether there is a need for common criteria for regularisations at European Union level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Does the Commission not consider that the penalties introduced under the decree law that are imposed on anyone renting out accommodation to people whose situation is irregular may conflict with the ‘right to … housing assistance so as to ensure a decent existence’ laid down in Article 34(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The ‘security package’ has not yet been notified to the Commission. According to the information available to the Commission, Decree Law No 92 of 23 May 2008 on urgent measures concerning public safety came into force on 27 May 2008 and is already applicable; however, it will have to be confirmed by the Italian Parliament within 60 days. The Commission’s position will depend on the final text of the Decree Law. The Commission is also aware of the adoption by the Council of Ministers on 21 May 2008 of a draft legislative decree concerning the free movement of Community citizens; however, it does not have at its disposal the final text of the decree.</p>
<p>With regard to the introduction of automatic expulsions to which the Honourable Member refers, according to Directive 2004/38/EC, measures taken on grounds of public policy or public security must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual concerned which must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. This involves an individual assessment of each case. The Directive also stipulates that previous criminal convictions could not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures. Accordingly, the existence of a criminal conviction can be successfully argued only in so far as the circumstances which gave rise to that conviction are evidence of personal conduct constituting a present threat to the requirements of public policy. As confirmed by the Court of Justice, Community law also precludes provisions of national law based on a presumption that nationals of other Member States who have received a particular sentence for specific offences must be expelled.</p>
<p>All Directives adopted in the field of asylum and immigration already contain ‘public order’ clauses which allow Member States to withdraw residence permits and to expel third-country nationals who constitute a threat to public policy or public security. It should be noted that the European Convention on Human Rights and the general principles of Community law still require an individual approach with regard to expulsion on grounds of public policy or public security. Each case must always be considered on an individual basis taking into account the severity and type of offence, the danger that emanates from the person concerned, the duration of residence in the territory of the Member State, the consequences for the person concerned and family members and links with the country of residence. National legislation which provides for the automatic expulsion of third-country nationals in cases where the person concerned is sentenced to more than two years’ imprisonment leaving no room for individualised consideration to take into account the above-mentioned aspects could be considered to be contrary to Community law.</p>
<p>With regard to the introduction of a new aggravating circumstance to which the Honourable Member refers, the right of EU citizens to reside in a Member State derives from the Treaty and is not dependent upon their having completed administrative procedures such as obtaining a registration certificate, which may under no circumstances constitute a reason for expulsion on grounds of public policy or public security. Moreover, the application of such an aggravating circumstance to offences committed by non-national Union citizens would be contrary to the principle of proportionality and to the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality.</p>
<p>As for the amendment introduced in Legislative Decree No 286 of 25 July 1998 on immigration which provides that owners who rent apartments to foreigners staying illegally are punished with imprisonment of six months to one year referred to by the Honourable Member, this Decree does not appear to apply to EU citizens.</p>
<p>According to Article 1(1)(b) of Council Directive 2002/90/EC of 28 November 2002 defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, each Member State shall adopt appropriate sanctions on ‘any person who, for financial gain, intentionally assists a person who is not a national of a Member State to reside within the territory of a Member State in breach of the laws of the State concerned on the residence of aliens.’ Article 1 of the Council framework Decision of 28 November 2002 on the strengthening of the penal framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence<a href="#defann_30_4" name="refann_30_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> provides that ‘each Member State shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the infringements defined in Articles 1 and 2 of Directive 2002/90/EC are punishable by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties which may entail extradition.’</p>
<p>Accordingly, some owners of property rented to illegal immigrants could be covered by these provisions if they, for financial gain, intentionally assist them to reside illegally within the territory of a Member State. National legislation which introduces penalties applicable, in a general way, to all landlords who, for financial gain, intentionally assist illegal immigrants to reside within the territory of a Member State constitutes implementation of Directive 2002/90/EC. Legislation that goes beyond implementation of this Directive is a matter for national law. The Commission notes that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in accordance with its Article 51(1), applies to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission contributes to the fight against cross-border organised crime by devising measures and actions which find their tangible expression in legislation, the establishment of networks for the exchange of best practice and disseminating knowledge and information (statistics, threat assessment, etc.) and the funding of cooperation projects.</p>
<p>As part of the fight against cyber crime, the Commission has established a comprehensive policy in its Communication of May 2007 entitled ‘Towards a general policy on the fight against cyber crime’<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission has established an ad hoc public-private group to assist it in the preparation of proposals for specific recommendations that will affect, in particular, the exchange of operational and strategic information, the setting up of permanent public-private contact points and the establishment of a public-private structure for the training of experts.</p>
<p>Trafficking in human beings is also a priority for the European Commission. At the initiative of the Commission, the Council adopted a framework decision that criminalises trafficking and an action plan with specific measures to combat trafficking<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The Commission has developed a set of indicators to assess the quality of national policies against trafficking and has established active dialogue with non-governmental organisations (NGOs). For 2007, the Commission has already funded projects to the tune of more than EUR 7 million. The Commission has also set up an Expert Group to provide a basis for its discussion, and a study is under way to consider the feasibility of a European ‘hotline’. On 18 October 2007, the Commission organised the first EU Anti-Trafficking Day, putting the rights of the victim at the heart of the European anti-trafficking strategy, and issued a set of recommendations, endorsed by the Council, relating to assistance to and protection of victims of trafficking.</p>
<p>With regard to the protection of minors against sexual exploitation, the Commission has started discussions on the need to update the Framework Decision concerning this issue<a href="#defann_31_3" name="refann_31_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, including the introduction of the crime of soliciting children for sexual purposes using information technology (‘grooming’). The Commission will promote operations conducted by specialised law enforcement units that are aimed at identifying child pornography sites and networks and prosecuting those responsible or at identifying the child victims appearing in the images. It will also encourage the formation of an alliance between the various parties involved (financial institutions, Internet service providers, etc.) with a view to assisting in the search for criminals and in the termination of contracts used to purchase images of child pornography on the Internet. The Commission is also committed to establishing a system for exchanging information on criminal records that will enable the judicial authorities of the Member States to take into account convictions handed down in another Member State.</p>
<p>As part of the fight against corruption, in February 2008, the Commission adopted a staff working document which examines the link between corruption and organised crime<a href="#defann_31_4" name="refann_31_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. This document identifies the specific vulnerabilities to corruption within private sector organisations and considers the countermeasures to be taken. Based on the conclusions of this document, the Commission is shortly to launch a study whose results will also complement the work of the Commission’s Expert Group on the policy needs of data on crime and criminal justice, specifically in relation to its promoting the development of harmonised operational definitions and statistical indicators on corruption. In March 2008, the Commission received the results of a Eurobarometer survey on the subject of corruption. According to this survey, 75% of EU citizens believe that corruption is a major problem in their country.</p>
<p>The confiscation of the proceeds of crime helps to step up and strengthen the fight against organised crime and terrorism by depriving criminals of their illicit gains and preventing them from reinvesting them in all kinds of illicit trafficking. Various legislative instruments have been established at European level to assist, in all stages of criminal proceedings, in the identification, freezing, confiscation and recovery of criminal assets through the harmonisation of national law and the mutual recognition of judgments. Given the delay in the implementation of these instruments, the Commission is drafting, for late 2008, a communication aimed at improving the effectiveness of EU action in this area.</p>
<p>As for the fight against the financing of terrorism, the EU’s policy is based on the comprehensive EU strategy presented in 2004<a href="#defann_31_5" name="refann_31_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> which sets out the Commission’s objectives: the effective use of financial intelligence and cooperation between financial intelligence units (FIUs). A report on the implementation of Council Decision 2000/642/JHA was adopted in December 2007<a href="#defann_31_6" name="refann_31_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> and a follow-up evaluation is under way.</p>
<p>The Commission is also channelling funds into the establishment of a network of national financial intelligence units, particularly through a project of almost EUR 2 million for the development of such a network.</p>
<p>The statistics currently available on crime at EU level are lacking, particularly in terms of comparability of data between Member States. The Commission services, including the Statistical Office of the European Communities (Eurostat), have launched a large-scale exercise and are now putting into practice, in coordination with the Member States and relevant organisations, an action plan for the period 2006-2010<a href="#defann_31_7" name="refann_31_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>. The aim is to improve the quality and comparability of the criminal and judicial statistics of Member States, coordinate the collection of data across Member States and publish statistics and analyses on the Commission’s websites.</p>
<p>In December 2006, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Decision<a href="#defann_31_8" name="refann_31_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a>; firstly, to replace the current Europol Convention with a Council Decision, so that Europol’s legal framework can be adapted more rapidly in response to trends in crime; and, secondly, to replace intergovernmental financing with Community funding. On 18 April 2008, the Council reached political agreement on the text of the Decision, which is expected to be adopted in the autumn.</p>
<p>The financial programme for 2007-2013, ‘Prevention of and fight against crime’, is an important tool for the Member States. Under this programme, Member States may receive cofinancing for cross-border projects in priority areas identified by the Commission. The annual work programme, drawn up and adopted by the Commission, is modulated so that it may respond more effectively to ever changing needs and focus Member States’ efforts so as to create genuine synergies. In 2008, more than EUR 50 million have been made available.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The impact of climate change on migration movements is a topic of growing political interest worldwide.</p>
<p>As the recent paper on Climate Change and International Security prepared by the High Representative and the European Commission<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> pointed out, climate change may act as a 'threat-multiplier', exacerbating trends, tensions and instabilities which would already have an influence on migration patterns.</p>
<p>Although there is strong anecdotal evidence pointing to the interconnection between climate change and migration, establishing a direct and exclusive linkage between the two phenomena is difficult due to lack of reliable research data and conclusions. Individual decisions to migrate are usually the results of complex considerations: personal, social, economic and also environmental factors that cannot typically be transformed into one single relationship of causality. Presently available studies also highlight that environmentally-induced migration takes place in most cases in an intra-state context.</p>
<p>"Environmental refugee" does not exist as a legal term in the international human rights regime and is not used by Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). However, the European Union's cooperation programmes with the countries in question do aim at improving living conditions and stimulating economic growth which has an indirect effect on migration patterns. Beyond this, the European Union (EU) endorsed in November 2007 a proposal by the European Commission on establishing a Global Climate Change Alliance<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, aimed at raising significant resources for adaptation action in the most vulnerable developing countries, to ease the negative effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Overall, the Commission is convinced of the need for a comprehensive strategy on climate change addressing both its causes and consequences. However, in order to be able to formulate informed policy decisions on some of the interlinking issues such as migration, emphasis should be placed first on filling the knowledge gaps. An ongoing two-year EC research project on Environmental Change and Forced Migration Scenarios (EACH-FOR)<a href="#defann_32_3" name="refann_32_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>focuses on the trends of multiple environmental problems and the associated socio-political and demographical aspects in a large number of regions and countries, including those of Northern Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>As regards the multilateral scene, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Social and Human Sciences programme has recently begun working to develop knowledge, research and capacity on urban policy, giving consideration to the environmental impact of uncontrolled urbanization of rural and coastal territories due to climate change-related migration and consumption. The UNHCR is also planning to look into the issue of environmentally induced displacement from a human rights/protection perspective<a href="#defann_32_4" name="refann_32_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>These processes may also contribute to a more advanced multilateral thinking on conceptual questions like the definition of environmental migrants or the development of more inclusive international human rights protection regimes. The Commission is following closely this international work so to ensure that any future EU policy response designed to address the nexus of climate change and migration can take full account of these developments.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to promoting better coherence among our policies. The comprehensive European migration policy under development seeks to explore and strengthen the coherence between migration and environment. Moreover, the ongoing work on the Commission White Paper on Adaptation will involve aligning external policies in the broadest sense in accordance with the emerging global challenges that climate change poses.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>One of the main objectives of the recently adopted Directive 2007/64/EC on payment services in the internal market<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which has to be implemented by 1 November 2009, is to provide a single set of rules with regard to the information requirements and the rights and obligations linked to the provision and use of payment services, including, among others, strict rules on execution time of electronic credit transfers. Under these rules, banks and other payment service providers will need to guarantee the maximum time it takes to make a payment and that this will be standardised for all credit transfers within the EU, no matter which Member State the payment is coming from or going to.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 69(1) of the Directive, from 1 January 2012 all credit transfers without any currency conversion must mandatorily be carried out at the latest by the end of the next business day (i.e. the so-called "D+1" basis). This "D+1" rule will apply to: a) euro currency payment transactions, both national and cross-border within the EU; b) national payment transactions in the currency of the Member State concerned; c) certain payment transactions involving currency conversion between the euro and the currency of a non-euro Member State. However, the Directive recognises that banks need time to upgrade existing products and systems. Therefore, up to 1 January 2012, this provision allows parties to agree on a maximum execution time of "D+3" for credit transfers. Furthermore, the Directive allows the parties to agree on an extra business day for paper-initiated payment transactions.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to underline that the "D+1" execution time under Article 69(1) of the Payment Services Directive is only a maximum period. Hence, where payments are currently carried out within one day, this practice should be maintained. To guard against the risk of payment services providers actually increasing the execution time, Article 72 of the Directive allows Member States to opt for a shorter payment time for purely national payment transactions. In addition, the Directive always allows payment service providers to give customers more favourable terms.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would point out that with respect to the funding of EU transport policy, it is important to distinguish on the one hand between funding from the Community budget, and on the other hand funding from Member State budgets.</p>
<p>1.

<p>2. Decisions on funding from Member State budgets are (if they amount to State aid falling within Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty) subject to State aid control by the Commission.

Following that Communication, the Commission has worked, during six months, with national authorities and industry to obtain the following results:</p>
<p>–	agreement among the National Enforcement Bodies on a clear division of labour and responsibilities in complaint handling and exchanging information;</p>
<p>–	making progress towards a common interpretation of some parts of the relevant legislation.</p>
<p>These new procedural agreements among the National Enforcement Bodies need to be applied and the application will be closely monitored by the Commission; if appropriate, infringement procedures will be initiated against those Member States which do not fully comply with Article 16 of Regulation 261/2004. Furthermore, National Enforcement Bodies together with the airlines have confirmed that the burden of proof as regards the existence of extraordinary circumstances is with the airline and not with the passenger. If an airline would not present substantial and detailed evidence to the designated national authority, the National Enforcement Body concerned will decide on the basis of the facts presented by the passenger.</p>
<p>In the light of the progress realised between April and November 2007, it would be untimely to propose new amendments to Regulation 261/2004. At the same time, the Commission keeps up its intensified activities related to the monitoring of application and enforcement by the Member States through their National Enforcement Bodies but the Commission has no competence whatsoever to directly impose sanctions on airlines neither Member States for the Regulation concerned.</p>

<p>The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member that proper levels of safety are provided for children transported in motor vehicles.</p>
<p>Since May 2006, all children have to be transported in suitable seats which comply with technical criteria as specified under Regulation 44 of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva.</p>
<p>With regards to the safety provisions for child restraints, the Commission is of the view that the requirements of Regulation 44 can and need to be improved. For this reason the Commission has ensured priority is given to updating these requirements in the Geneva working goup responsible for these issues. The need for such improvements has been widely recognised by members of the working group and, consequently, the group has accepted side impact protection as a high priority.</p>
<p>The review of requirements for child restraints is now underway and it is now agreed that a proposal for amendments, to strengthen the security provided by them, will be developed under the current forum in Geneva. Three meetings have been held for that purpose during the first semester of 2008.</p>
<p>It is intended that this topic will be maintained on the agenda of the main working party under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in forth-coming sessions in Geneva.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to be closely involved in the work of this group and ensure that the necessary changes will be adopted by the Geneva parties in an aceptable timeframe taking account of the safety aspects of this topic for children.

<p>As regards priority project No 17, the Paris-Strasbourg-Stuttgart-Vienna-Bratislava railway axis, the Commission decided to grant substantial subsidies to the tune of EUR 438 million, in particular for the three cross-border sections and the Stuttgart-Ulm bottleneck.</p>
<p>No funding has been provided for the Munich-Mühldorf-Freilassing section because of the absence of a comprehensive approach to this section, although such an approach would allow international trains to run via Mühldorf rather than via Rosenheim. The European Coordinator appointed by the Commission in July 2005, Péter Balázs, included a detailed analysis of this section in his second annual report. He emphasised the need for an integrated approach, including electrification. Given the absence of such an approach, the Commission has decided not to award a grant for this section.</p>
<p>As you are aware, the Commission consulted the European Parliament on its proposed multiannual programme on 19 November 2007.

<p>The Basel-Karlsruhe section is extremely important for the links to the Swiss Alpine tunnels. At the same time, priority project No 17, Paris-Bratislava, and priority project No 24, Lyons-Rotterdam/Antwerp, intersect at Appenweier. Where the two lines cross, future capacity must be guaranteed by the construction of a ‘flyover’ (Überwerfungsbauwerk) so that trains do not cross at grade.</p>
<p>Finally, the amount of EUR 94.5 million has been allocated under the TEN-T Multiannual Programme 2007-2013 for the construction and rehabilitation of the entire Basel-Karlsruhe section, including the Katzenberg Tunnel. The German Government is cofinancing the project.</p>
<p>Based on information obtained by the German Government, it seems highly probable that the development of the entire Basel-Karlsruhe section will be completed in 2020. Accordingly, the completion of the Katzenberg Tunnel is scheduled for 2011. Under the Multiannual Programme, the Basel-Karlsruhe section is regarded as a bottleneck.</p>

<p>The response to the Honourable Member will consider ocean energy in a wider context, which includes energy converters for the exploitation of wave, tidal and current energy, as well as salinity and thermal gradients.</p>
<p>Ocean energy is part of the Commission's current overall strategy for research in the field of new and renewable energy sources aimed at raising substantially the share of renewable electricity production in the EU, while taking into account the different regional conditions where sufficient economic and technical potential can be identified.</p>
<p>The existing Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> sets a 21% indicative share of electricity to be produced from renewable energy sources in total Community electricity consumption by 2010. On 23 January 2008 the Commission adopted a new energy and climate package<a href="#defann_39_2" name="refann_39_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> including a proposal for a new Directive on the promotion of the use of renewable energy, setting national binding targets for the share of renewable energy consumption, aimed at together achieving the overall 20% EU target. Once adopted, this Directive will take over and strengthen many of the provisions currently included in Directive 2001/77/EC.</p>
<p>At present, most efforts in research, development and demonstration activities are concentrated on tidal currents and wave power. In 2007, there were worldwide 53 ocean wave energy converter technologies at different development stages. Since it is not yet clear which schemes will be the most cost-effective in the harsh marine environment, more research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) efforts are needed in this field, notably to select and optimise the most promising design solutions.</p>
<p>Research should increase overall conversion efficiency, cost efficiency, significantly drive down the cost of electricity production, enhance process reliability and further reduce the environmental impact and eliminate existing obstacles such as electrical grid connection challenges, absence of assessment guidelines and standards, administrative barriers linked to licensing and permitting processes.</p>
<p>Under the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP6) (2002-2006) the European Commission supported 14 ocean energy projects with a total EC contribution of €21 million. This effort is already being continued under the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme (FP7) (2007-2013) with 2 EU-funded projects for a total EC contribution of about €7.5 million in the first call in 2007.</p>
<p>The current cost of electricity generation from the first-generation prototype plants varies from € 0.08/kilowatt hour (kWh) to € 0.20/kWh. It is expected that a continued effort in research and development (R&amp;D) should lead to an electricity cost of around 0.05 €/kWh in the coming 10-20 years.</p>
<p>A global comparison of EU Member States' performance in research and development in this area shows UK, Ireland, Portugal and Denmark as having the largest number of projects and the biggest budget spent in this field. This is essentially due to the fact that along the western coast of Europe the wave climate is highly energetic and thus particularly favourable to this kind of application.</p>
<p>Other EU Member States (notably Belgium, Finland, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden) are also developing ocean energy technologies, mainly in the field of wave energy.</p>
<p>The European Commission, together with 11 other member countries, also participates in the International Energy Agency Implementing Agreement on Ocean Energy Systems (OES), and the membership is expected to increase to 18 members in 2008</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Islands and in particular small remote islands have since long occupied a special place in Cohesion policy. Article 29(3) of Council Regulation (EC) n° 1260/1999 on the Structural Funds<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> for the 2000-2006 period foresaw the possibility of a Community co-financing rate up to 85% (as opposed to the normal ceiling of 75%) for the outermost regions and the outlying Greek islands.</p>
<p>In a similar spirit, Article 52(f) of Council Regulation (EC) n° 1083/2006 on the Structural and Cohesion Funds<a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> for the 2007-2013 period provides for the possibility of modulating co-financing rates under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective specifically in the case of islands. Moreover, Article 10 of the Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006<a href="#defann_40_3" name="refann_40_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> provides that programmes co-financed by this Fund, covering areas facing geographical and natural handicaps as referred to in point (f) of Article 52 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 shall pay particular attention to addressing the specific difficulties of those areas. To this purpose the ERDF may, in the cases of islands, contribute towards the financing of investments aimed at improving accessibility, promoting and developing economic activities related to cultural and natural heritage, promoting the sustainable use of natural resources, and encouraging sustainable tourism.</p>
<p>Concerning the programming period 2007-2013 in Greece, most islands are covered by the regional operational programme "North and South Aegean islands and Crete". The Ionian islands and the Sporades are covered by, respectively, the regional operational programmes "Western Greece, Peloponnesus and Ionian islands" and "Thessaly, Continental Greece and Epirus". For each of the regions covered by these programmes, a specific priority axis addresses needs in terms of accessibility infrastructures and services. Because the South Aegean region has become part of the Regional competitiveness and employment objective, the relevant priority axes have been reinforced by additional national resources allocated specifically to the South Aegean islands, in order to compensate for the relative decrease of available Community funds for this region.</p>
<p>Apart from these regional programmes, all islands are eligible to receive support under the thematic operational programmes "Improvement of accessibility" and "Environment and Sustainable development", of which the former covers accessibility infrastructures and services.</p>
<p>As concerns small island communities, in 2005 the Greek authorities and the Commission agreed to create under the Third Community Support Framework a special package in support of such islands. This same idea has inspired the inclusion, in the 2007-2013 regional operational programme "North and South Aegean islands and Crete" already mentioned, of a specific priority axis to address the needs of small islands in the South Aegean region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would like to thank the Honourable Member for her oral question regarding resolution of the conflicts in Mali and Niger.</p>
<p>In general, and in the particular case of the violent acts perpetrated in northern Mali and the clashes between the Tuareg Niger Movement for Justice (MNJ) and the army of Niger, the Commission is strongly in favour of a negotiated settlement and does not approve the use of armed force. The Commission particularly disapproves the use of anti-personnel mines which have already resulted in deaths among civilians in both Niger and Mali.</p>
<p>The aim is certainly to strengthen the dialogue on the challenges to be faced regarding peace and security as outlined by the proposed document for an Africa-EU Strategic Partnership. The Commission is in favour of seeking a solution at regional level and is prepared to back any action taken towards that end, whether in the form of conferences to be proposed at this time by officials in Niger and Mali or support for regional organisations, such as the Economic Community of the States of West Africa (ECOWAS) and the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD).</p>
<p>In the case of Mali, the EC has always been supportive of the approach based on dialogue and peace adopted by the Malian Government and the Democratic Alliance of 23 May for Change which led to the Algiers Agreement in July 2006.</p>
<p>According to the latest official statements made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mali, this Agreement and the resolutions adopted by the March 2007 Kidal Forum continue to apply for the purpose of resolving the conflict. The Commission welcomes this.</p>
<p>Dealing more particularly with Niger, the Commission is closely monitoring the situation. It is particularly concerned about the deterioration of the security situation in northern Niger, a situation which affects the civilian population already afflicted by the difficult living conditions in this region. A sense of instability also permeates every aspect of the ongoing cooperation in the north of the country.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission supports the initiatives announced by the Presidents of Mali and Niger to hold, in the near future, a Sahel-Saharan regional conference on security, peace and development.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission seeks to make every effort to contribute to the development of northern Mali and Niger, the region most affected by the conflict. Against this background, the Commission would point out that the Country Strategy Papers and the Indicative Programmes for both Mali and Niger have recently been approved for the period 2008-2013. Under the 2008-2013 programme, a very substantial amount has been allocated to support the development of these two countries, particularly in the area of governance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0377"></a>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The Bettembourg-Perpignan Rail Highway (BPRH) was inaugurated in 2007. This event constituted a first step towards a future network of rail highways in a transport-oriented EU which is environmentally aware and wishes to break with the 'lorry or nothing' mentality. However, seven months after its entry into service the BPRH is operating at only 30-40% of its capacity. The reason for this under-usage is that EU Directives 96/53/EC<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and 97/27/EC<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (which restrict the maximum height of lorries to 4 metres, with a 1% tolerance) are not being observed. Most semi-trailers operating on EU roads are of a height which exceeds the 4-metre limit by over 30%, which means that they cannot be transported by rail on account of the limited clearance within tunnels and under catenaries. This state of affairs compromises the development and even the existence of rail highways within the EU.</p>
<p>What action does the Commission intend to take in order to ensure that rules on the height of lorries operating within the EU are actually observed?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The issue raised by the Honourable Member concerns the difficulty that l’Autoroute ferroviaire Bettembourg Perpignan (AFBP) has in ensuring its freight trains are full due to the fact that tractor/semi-trailers are turning up with heights above the 4 metres limit set by the rail infrastructure operators.</p>
<p>Directive 96/53/EC, which lays down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorized dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorized weights in international traffic, and Directive 97/27/EC which concerns the vehicles construction standard, stipulate the maximum height of 4 metres, 96/53/EC regarding free circulation within the Community and 97/27/EC regarding the vehicle's construction, albeit with a minor permitted tolerance.</p>
<p>However, these Directives do not prohibit the normal circulation within Member States’ territories of vehicles or vehicle combinations for the national transport of goods which are not in conformity with the maximum height limit.</p>
<p>Consequently, Member States may authorise for use in national transport, vehicles that are higher than 4 metres and they may also either be non specific about the size of the load carried or set limits that are outside the vehicle maxima specified within Directive 96/53/EC. France does not stipulate a maximum height limit.</p>
<p>Therefore the stipulation of a maximum height of 4 metres by the infrastructure managers because of potential tunnel clearance problems exists outside the Community regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the difficulties that arise as a result of the lack of harmonisation of certain vehicle and load dimensions. It has launched a study that looks at the effect of adapting the rules on weights and dimensions of heavy commercial vehicles as established within Directive 96/53/EC and that will include the potential for stipulating loading limits. The results of this study are due in the Summer of 2008 and the Commission intends to draw the appropriate conclusion from that analysis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

As it is a small country's interests which are at stake here, and since at the same time Mr Verheugen is lobbying on behalf of a large country's interest in the building of the Nord Stream gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea, hoping that Finland will agree to attach little importance to the environmental problems associated with the pipeline, would it not be true to say that Germany too is treating Russia like a Third World country in this context, and does not the German Commissioner, as Commissioner for Industry, have any interests to defend other than Germany's?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

On 26 May 2008, a Gibraltar-flagged tanker, the 'Leoni Teresa', carrying 1500 tonnes of sunflower oil into Greece, was 'blocked' by the port authorities of Elefsina.

The vague references in the directives to cleaning the tanks and to subsidiarity do not guarantee the protection of public health, as evidenced by the transportation into Greece and other Member States of sunflower oil contaminated with mineral oil.</p>

<p>Analytical data for the sunflower oil contaminated by mineral oil originating from Ukraine indicated that the mineral oil is of high viscosity. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded that exposure estimates indicate that the sunflower oil contaminated with high viscosity mineral oil, although undesirable for human consumption, would not be of public health concern. It is therefore not correct to talk about extremely dangerous consequences for public health.</p>
<p>Investigations as regards the source of contamination are still ongoing but there are for the time being no indications that the contamination is linked to transport in tankers which have been used for the transport of products other than foodstuffs.</p>
<p>The availability of sea-going vessels reserved for the transport of foodstuffs is insufficient to ensure the supply of oils and fats intended for or likely to be used for human consumption. The derogation foreseen by Commission Directive 96/3/EC of 26 January 1996 granting a derogation from certain provisions on the hygiene of foodstuffs as regards the transport of bulk liquid oil and fats by sea<a href="#defann_45_3" name="refann_45_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, as amended by Directive 2004/4/EC<a href="#defann_45_4" name="refann_45_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, is to ensure sufficient availability of sea-going vessels for transport of oils and fats. However this derogation is subject to strict conditions ensuring equivalent protection of public health and safety of the foodstuffs concerned.</p>
<p>The list of acceptable previous cargoes has been established following scientific evaluations demonstrating that, on the condition that the hygiene provisions and cleaning requirements are fulfilled, the protection of public health and safety of the foodstuffs concerned is guaranteed equivalent to that assured by transport in sea-going vessels exclusively dedicated to foodstuffs.</p>
<p>Therefore the above mentioned legislation, which provides the derogation for the transport of foodstuffs in sea-going vessels not exclusively dedicated to foodstuffs, does not put public health at risk, as the strict legal conditions for this derogation ensure an equivalent level of food safety as that assured by transport in sea-going vessels dedicated for transport of foodstuffs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the meeting of Parliament’s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in Strasbourg on 20 May 2008, Commissioner Fischer Boel stated that it would be necessary for modulation (the transfer of funds from direct payments to rural development measures) also to be applied with regard to the new Member States from 2012. Without questioning the thinking behind this arrangement, I would, however, point out that modulation should take place only when the level of support per hectare of farm land is identical in the old and new Member States.</p>
<p>According to Csaba Sándor Tabajdi’s report of 20 March 2007 on the integration of the new Member States into the CAP (<a href="/doceo/document/A-6-2007-0037_EN.html">A6-0037/2007</a>), which was adopted by Parliament with a large majority, the average level of support per hectare in the new Member States is only 62-64% of that of the old Member States.</p>

<p>The Honourable Member has raised a question concerning the principles of applying modulation, which has been proposed as part of the Health Check of the 2003 reform. The Commission proposal has been designed such that all farmers in the European Union Member States are treated equitably with respect to the levels of payments received.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will note that the basis of calculation are the levels of direct payments expressed as a percentage of the then applicable level of such payments in the Community as constituted on the 30 April 2004 (EU-15). On the other hand, the report cited in the question refers to the average level of all agricultural support in the current Financial Perspective.</p>
<p>In the Health Check proposal, modulation shall only apply to farmers in new Member States when their level of direct payment is equal or higher than the level in EU-15, which will not take place until 2012. In this case, the applicable modulation rate is the difference between the two levels of payments.</p>
<p>In the calendar year 2012, the level of payments in EU-15 will be reduced by a total of 13% (that is the current 5% plus an 8% increase in basic additional modulation). This means that an EU-15 farmer will receive 87% of the full payment.</p>
<p>In 2012, the level of payment in EU-10 as indicated in the schedule of phasing in of direct payments will reach 90%. Therefore, to ensure equal treatment, a basic rate of 3% modulation will be applied to EU-10 farmers receiving above € 5 000. In other words, farmers in EU-10 will also be receiving 87% of the full payment in this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0388"></a>

<p>The Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet), the highest religious institution in Turkey which exercises supreme authority over all mosques and imams, recently posted on its website a wide range of recommendations for women’s conduct. Women, it said, must 'behave decently', and 'cover themselves sufficiently' so as not to show their bodies to other people and not to provoke men. Outside the home, women should avoid any contact with strange men and should not be together with men in closed rooms. Women who leave the house should also not use perfume or deodorant because the Prophet Mohammed regarded this as ‘immoral’.</p>

<p>Diyanet is the Turkish Religious Affairs Presidency. One of the main tasks of Diyanet is to inform people about religion.</p>
<p>In this respect, Diyanet commissioned a study by specialised religious scholars to prepare a "religious guidance book".</p>
<p>This book was published in Turkey in 2002 and on the Diyanet's site in 2005.</p>
<p>According to Diyanet, the religious guidance book provides information on the way the teachings of prophet Mohammed have been understood and implemented historically by the Islamic communities.</p>
<p>For instance, information is provided on polygamy. However, as Diyanet claims in its press release of 29 April 2008, this does not mean that Diyanet allows or encourages polygamy.</p>
<p>In addition, as again Diyanet claims in the same press release, they make an effort to also outline the current legal framework applicable on the issues. This includes the Civil Code that regulates marriage and divorce and defines the details of the Family Law.</p>
<p>In the context of the accession negotiations, the Commission is discussing with the Turkish authorities in detail the current Turkish legal framework on these issues. We have looked into the Turkish Constitution, the Civil and Criminal Codes, the Family Law and other relevant pieces of legislation on matters mentioned in the Oral Question of the Honourable Member.</p>

<p>Short-term priorities in this area include improved access to radio and TV broadcasting in languages other than Turkish and the adoption of appropriate measures to support the teaching of such languages.</p>
<p>The Commission follows closely developments on the ground. Progress was made as regards the use of Kurdish in daily life. In 2006 broadcasting in languages other than Turkish was allowed. The national public channel currently broadcasts in several languages nationwide, while four local radio and TV stations broadcast in Kurdish in the Southeast. However, time restrictions apply, with the exception of films and music programmes.</p>
<p>Most recently, the Turkish government has announced that the national state-owned television company will fully dedicate a national channel to broadcasting in Kurdish and other languages. Legislative adaptations are ongoing in this respect.</p>

First, the energy component has a higher weight in the consumption basket in Belgium than in the euro area (10.3% versus 9.6%). Second, the lower taxes – in particular excise duties – on fuel and heating oil in Belgium than in the euro area on average causes rising oil prices to have a larger impact on consumer prices which is a purely mechanical effect. On top of this, energy prices rose more in Belgium as the main providers decided on an important increase of the transport (electricity) and distribution (electricity and gas) fees, after a court order annulled the tariffs imposed by the regulator. Although the higher inflation rate in Belgium also relates to the sharper increase in processed food prices than in the euro area (8.3% versus 6.9%), this difference exists since mid-2006 and should thus not be seen as one of the main factors contributing to the widening inflation differential since the beginning of the year. Price increases for non-energy industrial goods, unprocessed food and services were in line or even below these observed in the euro area until April (no data for the euro area available yet for May).</p>
<p>As the differential can be largely explained by the particular developments in the energy component, core inflation – i.e. inflation excluding the energy and unprocessed food component – remained below the euro area average in April (2.2% versus 2.4%).</p>
<p>However, in the future, it should be avoided that the automatic (but incomplete) indexation of wages in Belgium further drives up inflation, leading to price-wage spiral with a negative impact on the competitive position.</p>
<p>Since inflation erodes the purchasing power of households, especially at the lower-end of the income spectrum, it is indeed important for governments to make containing inflation a priority and, together with the other euro area governments, support the European Central Bank in maintaining price stability.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0408"></a>

<p>The issue of terrorism associated with the Khalistan movement, seeking independence for a Sikh nation (Khalistan), needs first to be seen in the larger context of Punjab’s recent political history. The Indian state of Punjab, marred by violence for over 15 years due to Sikh separatists in the 1980s, returned to normalcy after the movement was successfully handled in the mid-1990s. After years of direct rule from New Delhi, the democratic process was successfully revived with a democratically elected government in 1997. The latest State election in 2007 resulted in putting back the Akali Dal party (representing exclusively the interests of the Sikhs) at the helm.</p>
<p>There have been articles in the Indian press indicating that a surviving network of terrorism continues to exist, in particular outside India, which can partly explain how Sikh militants managed to trigger a bomb blast inside a cinema hall in Ludhiana (seven dead, including a 10-year old child, and 40 injured) on October 14, 2007. The Commission’s analysis, however, is that the ideology that inspired a decade and a half of terrorism in Punjab has been rejected by the population.</p>
<p>In reply to the Honourable Member’s first question, the Commission believes that it is mainly for India, whose authorities have declared having evidence of Khalistan movement leaders’ presence in Pakistan, to request their extradition.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, the Commission has not received any application for assistance from Khalistan advocates to fulfil their separatist agenda.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0409"></a>

<p>New versions of the Agriculture and non-agricultural market access (NAMA) (Industrial Goods) negotiating texts were issued by the World Trade Organization (WTO) Chairs of those respective negotiating groups in mid May and discussions are underway on this basis. If negotiations progress sufficiently, there are prospects that a Ministerial meeting may be convened by the Director General of the WTO shortly.</p>
<p>In the area of agriculture, the Commission has sought on behalf of the EU to engage with third countries, in a manner which responds to their ambitions but which remains within the framework of the 2003 reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. It is the view of the Commission that these dual objectives can be met on the basis of current proposals, even if further issues remain to be clarified and agreed. This approach was however undertaken solely on the basis that this negotiation is a single undertaking and that concessions in one area should be balanced by gains in other areas.</p>
<p>The Chair's new NAMA text still provides for a wide range of possible negotiating outcomes. It is therefore difficult to assess at this stage whether the final result is likely to be acceptable to the EU. The EU is pushing for an agreement to fulfil the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) mandate, i.e. to create real new trade opportunities in industrial goods in developed and emerging economies. The principal means for achieving this is via a so-called "Swiss formula" for tariff reductions, as well as by introducing stronger disciplines to address non-tariff barriers. For this to be effective, it will be important to ensure that flexibilities granted to emerging economies are carefully circumscribed, and that the parameters for liberalisation for industrialised and emerging economies are such that real and new market access is created not just in North/North and North/South trade, but also in South/South trade. Whilst the EU fully accepts the principle that the poorest developing countries (Least Developed Countries and Small and Vulnerable Economies including all Sub-Saharan African countries except South Africa) should not cut their applied customs tariffs, it cannot accept that major emerging economies do not take their responsibility towards the rest of the world. This position has been made clear to other WTO Members. There may also be scope for progressing on sectoral tariff reduction agreements. In this context, the EU has tabled a proposal to negotiate a sectoral agreement on textiles, and continues to push hard to target tariff peaks in developed and emerging countries in this area, as well as in other sectors of important export interests to the EU.</p>
<p>In the area of fisheries subsidies, discussions have also been underway for some time in the framework of the so called "Rules" negotiation. There is as yet no agreed position on this issue. The EU is promoting disciplines which ban all harmful capacity enhancing subsidies while allowing those that positively contribute to the sustainable exploitation of available fishery resources and mitigate the negative impacts of adjustment measures on fishing communities. The EU also advocates strong and effective enforcement and transparency mechanisms which would ensure that the disciplines on fisheries subsidies are respected by all.</p>
<p>Negotiations are also moving ahead in services, geographical indications, non-tariff barriers, trade facilitation, and trade and environment, with differing levels of progress. The EU remains committed to securing useful results across all these areas.</p>
<p>In services, it will be essential that any WTO Ministerial set out common conclusions on the need for an ambitious outcome in this area. A plurilateral signalling conference, aimed at gauging with key partners areas of common interest, will be held in the margins of any WTO Ministerial. The results of this Conference will therefore feed into the EU's overall assessment of the balance likely to be achieved across the negotiations as a whole.</p>
<p>Finally, it is vital for the Commission that common conclusions agreed in any Ministerial Conference should also make significant progress on the issue of Geographical Indications.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0411"></a>

<p>One of the main aims of the proposal for a Regulation concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is to maintain a high level of protection for humans, animals and the environment.</p>
<p>The proposed criteria for approval of active substances are essential to achieve these objectives: substances which are persistent in the environment, accumulating in living organisms or very toxic should not be approved for the use in plant protection products.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not acceptable that farmers or consumers are exposed to substances which are proven to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction.</p>
<p>It must be avoided that either humans or animals are exposed to substances which can affect fertility or reproductive behaviour.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the severe overall competition with which European farmers are faced and it is its duty to ensure that they are not disadvantaged by the measures. This is why, for example, the Commission has proposed an authorisation system (the zonal system) which will increase the availability of pesticides to farmers between Member States and give incentives to industry to develop products for small cultures. It will reduce the administrative burden for producers of plant protection products and the competent authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that its proposal, which might lead to the withdrawal of a limited number of active substances, will not have severe effects for European agriculture. On the contrary, the Commission believes that it is an incentive for the development of new safer products.</p>
<p>This responds to the wish of many stakeholders, in particular farmers' unions and the industry. It also streamlines the authorisation procedure to give quicker access to the market to new pesticides, thus improving opportunities for innovation with new solutions ensuring sustainable plant protection and food safety at the same time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>How can the Commission guarantee that the dietary advice is developed on a broad-based platform that takes into account the findings and viewpoints of national authorities, independent scientists and consumer and environmental organisations?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European branch of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI Europe), coordinator of the EURRECA project, complies with the rules for participation in the 6th Research Framework Programme <a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As an eligible proposal, EURRECA (Harmonising nutrient recommendations across Europe with special focus on vulnerable groups and consumer understanding) was evaluated by the Commission, assisted by independent experts, against the criteria<a href="#defann_59_2" name="refann_59_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> for the relevant call for proposals.</p>
<p>EURRECA is a Network of Excellence with the overall objective to create a sustainable collaborative network which advances knowledge on scientific evidence underpinning existing nutrient recommendations. Consequently, it is not in the remit of this Community funded project to formulate dietary guidelines to be applied across the European Union (EU).</p>
<p>The EURRECA consortium is composed of 34 partners, including 19 universities and public research institutes, small and medium size enterprises, national and international public health organisations, including the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, as well as consumer associations.</p>
<p>The project is reviewed yearly, against the objectives and expected results defined in the technical annex to the Commission contract<a href="#defann_59_3" name="refann_59_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, by independent experts.</p>
<p>The Directorate-General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) as well as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are members of the External Advisory Groups.</p>
<p>DG SANCO requested EFSA to provide scientific advice on population reference intakes (on macro and micro nutrients) as well as guidance for developing food-based dietary guidelines for the EU population. This scientific advice on nutrient intakes is the basis for Community action in the field of nutrition. This work is currently ongoing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, DG SANCO always engages its stakeholders via the Advisory Group on the Food chain, and Animal and Plant Health, created in 2004<a href="#defann_59_4" name="refann_59_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> to consult citizens in an open and transparent way at the European level during the preparation, revision and evaluation of EU food legislation, as required by Regulation 178/2002/EC<a href="#defann_59_5" name="refann_59_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. It is composed of 36 European organisations representing the food chain, animal and plant health which can be consulted on a wide scope of issues, namely “food and feed safety, food and feed labelling and presentation, human nutrition in relation to food legislation, animal health and welfare, and plant health”<a href="#defann_59_6" name="refann_59_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>. Environmental organisations can participate in technical working groups under the auspices of the Advisory Group on issues related to their activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
