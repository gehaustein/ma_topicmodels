An open declaration – I do not need to go into the details – means in the eyes of Parliament that the contents of the declaration must be laid out clearly and unambiguously on the table, so to speak. In 1979 it was turned into a disguised declaration and, since that time, the argument has run and run. It is running in Member States and has long been running here in Parliament and in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Right up to the time the Commission presented its proposal, the Commission services tried to make it clear to us that this was an open declaration. This assessment was finally reaffirmed in its own proposal. Parliament then approved this fine proposal after making a few improvements, calling for a positive list for example. Then it went to the Council, where a bit of wheeling and dealing went on, which resulted in a half-open declaration. That was only to be expected from the Council. What disappointed us was the fact that the Commission adapted its proposal, which was reasonable and urgently called for an open declaration, to suit the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I had been in contact with all the associations which were involved in this area: the cooperatives, especially the Association of the Compound Feedingstuffs Industry and the Rural Credit Association of Germany. All of them tried their hardest to explain that this open declaration would not in fact be permissible or implementable. This continued in the Council when the associations were unsuccessful in Parliament. The Council and, as has already been said, the Commission reacted to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have a situation where we have a disguised half-open declaration. Interestingly, the then Federal Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany worked on this. He did not, however, issue a protocol stating that he, in fact, wanted the open declaration. When the BSE crisis hit, this Minister wrote to me saying that, as rapporteur and chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I should make sure the open declaration was implemented with no ifs or buts. And that was the very Minister who had been in favour of the half-open declaration. A real lesson in political culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are faced with a different situation in Member States, especially in Germany, and once again we have a wave of excitement over BSE. Now, all those who before had their foot on the brakes are coming and telling us to implement the open declaration. This is now our task. My suggestion is that we stick with the original Commission proposal and our amendments. We, in this Parliament, will implement the open declaration. We will enter into negotiations with the Council and, if necessary, we will frustrate them in Parliament and put the blame on the Council if political groups do not get what they want.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioners – those of you who are involved in this – I guess you will just have to get used to the fact that this Parliament will endorse my recommendation. I hope we have you on our side and that, in your role as mediator, which you have to assume, you will support our position in the negotiations which must get under way with the Council, as we are now at the codecision procedure stage. We are on the right track. We want the open declaration with no ifs or buts and we also want the positive list. Mr Byrne, in our proposal for an amendment, we are giving the Commission a goal to aim for. Not immediately, we know this is not possible, but by the end of the year, we want at least a Commission proposal which will signal to us what direction it could go in. You see, we are prepared to make compromises here too.</p>

I would like to clarify the issue of so-called protein deficits. On 4 December last year, the Commission was invited by the Agriculture Council to analyse the situation of the market for protein-rich plants and to draw the appropriate conclusions from this analysis. At the time the invitation was extended, it was made clear that all Commission proposals had to move within the framework of the financial forecast agreed in Berlin.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days later, the European Council in Nice defined the Commission obligation more precisely and called for a detailed analysis of supply and demand for oleaginous and protein crops to be carried out under strict compliance with the financial parameters agreed in Berlin. The Commission was happy to accept this invitation. It made a detailed investigation of the issues that had been raised and summarised its findings in a working document and in a Council communication to Parliament. What were these findings?</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000, approximately 3 million tonnes of animal meal were produced in the European Union. Some 2 million tonnes were exported to third countries and a further half a million tonnes were used in the production of pet food. The remaining 2 million tonnes or so were used as pig swill and poultry feed. With the Council Decision of 4 December last year, the use of such feedingstuffs and such animal protein was banned for all agricultural livestock. As you know, until then they had only been banned for ruminants.</p>
<p class="contents">The key issue here is to determine whether replacing the shortfall in animal meal by vegetable crops is a problem and, if not, how this should best be brought about. To be able to assess the changed demand for feedingstuffs we must first take a look at the development of meat consumption and meat production. The analysis contained in the working document is based on the assumption that the per-capita consumption of beef in the wake of the BSE crisis of 1996 will start to recover in the coming three to five years. This should mean an increase in both the consumption and production of pork and poultry meat. There are also two factors which determine the demand for feedingstuffs in pig and poultry production, firstly, the lack of animal meal and, secondly, the expected rise in production.</p>
<p class="contents">To replace animal meal in feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry, primary consideration will be given to soya meal, then rapeseed and sunflower meal, peas, beans and sweet lupins. Cereals are also taken into account even though the protein content of cereals is relatively low. In practice the composition of feedingstuffs will be determined by the price and availability of raw materials and technical constraints.</p>
<p class="contents">The combined effect of all these variables is difficult to predict and it is even more difficult to isolate the changes brought about by the ban from normal market adjustments or the consequences of political measures. The current price ratio between cereals and soya will trigger three main reactions in the feedingstuffs industry and among farmers. Firstly, as prices for oilseed meal are relatively high in comparison with cereals, the proportion of protein-rich feedingstuff ingredients will be reduced to the physiologically requisite minimum. As a result, in comparison with previous years, especially 1998 and 1999 when soya prices were extremely low, the total quantity of raw protein in animal feed has fallen.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the proportion of cereals in animal feed should increase. Cereals are admittedly suppliers of energy rather than protein, but with an average protein content of 10% to 12%, the 5 million extra tonnes of cereals which will be fed to animals this year will supply half a million tonnes of raw protein.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the remaining gaps will be filled by additional imports of soya meal. In view of the slight drop in the total quantity used and the additional quantity resulting from cereals, there is expected to be a soya requirement in the order of one to one and a half million tonnes.</p>
<p class="contents">What options have we examined to close these expected gaps? Firstly, we have looked into the possibility of increasing the aid quotient to EUR 74 per tonne, rather then keeping it at the same level as cereals, namely at a level of EUR 63 per tonne, as was decided in Agenda 2000. The disadvantage of this option is that it would re-introduce crop-specific aid for oilseeds and production would be subject to the upper ceiling set out in the Blair House agreement. Furthermore, if this option were chosen, around EUR 1 270 per tonne of soya meal equivalent more would have to be spent on additional subsidies, which is 6 times more in additional subsidies than soya currently costs. The budget costs for this option would amount to some EUR 475 million a year.</p>
<p class="contents">The second option we have examined is to increase the aid quotient for peas, beans and sweet lupins by EUR 6. We opted for EUR 6 because such an increase would be covered by the peace clause in the WTO. Simulations have shown that, with the current price ratio between protein crops and cereals, this increase would only lead to a very small increase in cultivated areas. This would lead to extra expenditure, which would be higher than the price of any additionally imported soya, since the entire crop has to be paid for out of this increased subsidy.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have assessed the consequences the planting of protein-rich crops would have on set-aside land. If crops are sown on set-aside land which are then in competition on the market with cereals and oilseeds, this would result in the blue-box eligibility of land premiums in cereal production being called into question, quite apart from the fact that such a step would trigger severe international criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have examined the possibility of increasing the guaranteed maximum quantity for green meal and dried feedingstuffs together with a reduction in per-tonne guaranteed aid. As you all know, dried feedingstuffs are primarily used for ruminants and not for pigs and poultry, and our problem is primarily the keeping of pigs and poultry. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether increasing the guaranteed maximum quantity by 10% would in fact lead to an increase in produced quantities, if we already have an estimated dried feedingstuffs surplus of 12% in the 2000/2001 financial year. The increase in guaranteed maximum quantities would most likely be used to cover existing surpluses.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, from an economic standpoint, there are no convincing reasons for introducing new support measures for protein production or for extending the scope of existing support measures. The availability of soya meal on the world market is not a problem. Quite the opposite, the extra quantities needed will increase current imports by just 3% to 5%. The expansion of soya production in South America and the USA will bring more soya meal onto the market than the European Union can use. What is more, the current budgetary plan does not allow for any leeway to implement the options we have assessed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, Commissioner, I think, and I am sure you know, that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wanted to give a clear signal with the Auroi report that promoting the planting of protein crops on set-aside lands would be given more support. I am convinced that Parliament will take this line.</p>
<p class="contents">Back, however, to the first issue. The chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Herr Graefe zu Baringdorf, said that how the production of mixed feedingstuffs had evolved over the years had been an eye-opener. How different positions have been put forward at different times here in Parliament has also been an eye-opener. The path has not always been smooth, it has had its rough edges and there has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing. I think, however, we are now on the right path towards showing even greater transparency and not only promoting it but implementing it as well. There have been hostilities and demands from industry against which Parliament and representatives in Parliament, with a clear majority, have always stood their ground. From the outset, Parliament has followed a clear line for more transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Cards are being shuffled in the production of compound feedingstuffs and wherever cards are shuffled we need to be especially careful about whether we are actually dealing with a game of cards or the production of feedingstuffs. We have been careful to implement transparency more visibly than in the past, which is only right and proper. You are smiling, Commissioner Fischler. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf talked about a half-open declaration, which has been something special in recent years. I would like to say that it would have been more correct not to talk of a disguised but a half-disguised declaration. That may have brought about more movement in the direction we now want to go in.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency and the positive list are necessary and would be a further improvement to the Commission proposal. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take an example from another area of the food industry, and that is the purity regulations for beer. The purity regulations were introduced and became law in Bavaria in 1516, which was right and proper. A positive list was introduced then and a positive list should be introduced now.</p>

This does not tally with the notion of comprehensive transparency in the production of feedingstuffs, which we have called for on numerous occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers do not yet know what and how many primary products are contained in feedingstuffs. That is why the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports the recommendation of the rapporteur, who systematically integrated the open declaration of feed materials in the text of the draft directive. He also repeated the demand for a legally binding positive list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs. The Commission has been requested to put forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2001. This too has our full support. Surely it cannot be so very difficult to draw up a list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs. At least we know what the various feedingstuffs should as a rule contain, or perhaps, after what has been said, we do not.</p>
<p class="contents">The eight months proposed by the rapporteur seem to me to be a reasonable and adequate time within which to draw up such a list. This list is urgent, since we cannot do without industrially produced feedingstuffs in the future. Just like people, animals need balanced nutrition. If they are only fed water, hay and cereals, which was called for in the past, this would not satisfy current conditions for agricultural production and is, in my opinion, a far cry from reality. Given that feedingstuffs are the most important part of meat production we must ensure that these feedingstuffs are safe. How else can we restore consumer confidence in meat.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the Council would be well advised to accept Parliament’s proposals without amending them and to demonstrate that it has learnt from past mistakes. We cannot wait until it is too late and then tinker about with the symptoms.</p>

It was unfortunate that they did that but, at that time and with the system we have in place, farmers were in no position to know exactly what they were giving their animals.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are discussing the food and feedingstuffs chain, we must ensure that the whole chain, from A to Z, is imbued with a number of concepts – transparency, information and public access to documents. We have inherited a chain with many links and with large gaps between each link and the next. That also applies to feedingstuffs. Whether their farms be large or small, ordinary farmers buying feedingstuffs cannot at present be reasonably expected to know what these contain. They have no laboratories available to them and, given the way feedingstuffs look nowadays, they can glean no information about the content from either the appearance, smell or taste. Farmers therefore need significantly more transparency and significantly more precise information. I think that this proposal is too complicated and that, in the long term, we ought to be able to find common principles for food and feedingstuffs which are somewhat simpler and somewhat more comprehensible both to the farmer and the final consumer of the food, for example a declaration of contents in descending order of volume and precise information upon request. As the situation at present stands and in view of the fact that we are now at the <span class="italic">beginning</span> of this food safety process, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will nonetheless be voting in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, we think that, although recently timid proposals have been made regarding the possibility of developing vegetable proteins, the Commission tends to insist that this is problematic on the basis of two arguments: the cost and agreements with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth pointing out the close links between cereals and protein crops. The budgetary impact of protein crops is derisory in comparison with that of cereals and, although the United States set out requirements for protein crops, this was in exchange for accepting the high level of support for export refunds on Community cereals. That is to say, protein crops also suffer from the consequences of balances of the CAP, and their cultivation could develop more if support for respective production was balanced out.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, there should be due evaluation of the benefits of pulses for biological diversity and reducing the use of nitrogenous fertilisers, and their positive effects on soil preservation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, there are important reasons that we need to take into account: we are currently dependent on imports for 75% of our vegetable protein needs. This is an unacceptable strategic weakness and means that we must accept genetically modified organisms in our food.</p>

Clearly there is no wish to call into question the Blair House agreements, which reduce<span class="bold"> </span>the amount of Community land available. We are in an odd situation, on the one hand, the ban on the use of animal meal to feed production animals too has increased the requirement for plant protein; on the other hand, as of the next growing year, there is to be a sharp reduction in the amount of protein crops being grown. We feel that these crop productions must be guaranteed to protect the farmers and oilseed producers. The Commission needs to present a comprehensive report on the effect of the Agenda 2000 decisions on the management of the land dedicated to oilseed crops in the different production areas of the Community, and a proposal regulating the labelling of feedingstuffs containing GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that sufficient incentives must be provided for the production of plant proteins in the interests of the environment, of the meat consumer, who has to be able to trust the Community production chain, and of the oilseed production chain, which has made specialised investments and which is in danger of a sharp fall in employment. It is worrying that the Commission says it considers that it makes more economic sense to increase imports of soya meal. In this case, the economy is in open conflict with the interests of the Community agricultural sector and, in particular, with safeguarding the health and confidence of the citizen, which is not economically quantifiable. Yesterday, Parliament adopted an amendment which reads: “Health should not be considered as a commodity, which can be the subject of political or financial compromises”. Today, the Commission has told us that this is not so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can imagine that, in the cabinet of that pharaoh, the plagues affecting the country were discussed on a daily basis, much like here in Strasbourg this week, where first foot-and-mouth disease was discussed, and now the effects of BSE are on this morning’s agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Europe is not holding a people against its will, but we cannot simply skim over the plagues which are hitting our agriculture. We need to take stock of our agricultural policy and reconsider the standards on which the policy is based. I have stated in the foot-and-mouth debate that animals, as God’s creatures, are more than production units. I repeat this statement in the light of the fact that we have fed herbivores, in other words plant eaters, their own species. We have turned them into cannibals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf was right to comment in his report that farmers are entitled to accurate information on the ingredients in cattle feed. The Council wants to leave the labelling to the feedingstuffs industry. Meanwhile, he suggests that farmers, upon request, are entitled to comprehensive information from the industry. That is completely ambiguous, if the farmer is entitled to comprehensive feedingstuffs information, it is only logical that this information should reach him without any obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">‘From stable to table’ is translated freely into Dutch as ‘from farmer to plate’. In that translation, the liability for the food process is emphatically placed with the farmer. In order to be able to bear that liability, the farmer must be able to avail himself – without any beating about the bush – of information on the cattle feed which he feeds his animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The ban on the use of meat meal in cattle feed, which has been in place since December 2000, leads to a shortage in the protein supply in cattle feed. Alternatives for animal protein include soybean and other oilseed crops rich in protein. In the findings of research into alternatives, which Commissioner Fischler outlined here this morning, the recommendation is made that soybean should be imported from the global market. Other alternatives are being described as too expensive and leading to distortion. A real problem with the import of soybean is the fact that we have no insight into the production method. I very much doubt whether we are really better off if we feed our animals genetically modified soybean instead of meat meal.</p>
<p class="contents">The BSE crisis poses new dilemmas. The excuse that the European Union should not extend its acreage of oilseed crops due to WTO agreements is untenable. All the more reason for abandoning these WTO rules. I regret the ease with which the Commission rejects the growing of oilseed and protein-rich crops on fallow agricultural land. It is clear that the reason for leaving land untilled is in order to reduce the production of cereals, among other things. Less clear, however, is why the production of protein has to be reduced too in the light of an increase in demand on the European market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last few months, with the BSE crisis and the ban on animal meal, it has been increasing at 300 000 tonnes a month.</p>
<p class="contents">So what does the Commission propose in the face of this? It proposes to take no particular initiative but to go to the great world supermarket for agricultural surpluses and buy the proteins we need as cheaply as possible. Well, I can see at least three reasons for rejecting such a spirit of resignation and surrender. The first is that it puts food safety at risk. It is vital to strive for self-sufficiency in such an important product. The second lies in the environmental advantages of oil- and protein-rich plants: bio-diversity, crop rotation, nitrogen balance. The third is the need to respond to consumer demand for more traceability and visibility. And we have the means: support for bio-fuels, the safety net for oil-rich crops, supplementary aid for protein-rich crops, intensification of the public research effort and agri-environmental aid for farms which include leguminous fodder in their rotation.</p>

Mind you, we are not only dealing with a systemic crisis in the sector but with the need for confidence-building measures in favour of consumers. The ban on meat and bone meal in feedingstuffs is a measure which will restore consumer confidence. There must also be a European protein plan to wean Europe off imports from third countries because these imports contain genetically modified soya. We must find a model which enables European farmers to react to these new requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel this complex problem is connected with the WTO. The Commission proposal, however, to allow organic farmers only to plant legumes does not go anywhere near far enough. I therefore support the line taken by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that planting can also be permitted on set-aside land of farmers who adopt environmental measures on the basis of Regulation (EEC) No 1257/00.</p>
<p class="contents">If we talk of confidence-building measures, then we must stand up for an open declaration and for a positive list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs. I believe that being honest with consumers can get us out of this crisis and take account of the dramatic situation of farmers and the threat to very many livelihoods. I am also hoping for support from the feedingstuffs industry to make an open declaration of feed materials. If such a statement truly reflects what is in feed materials, surely this cannot be a problem for the industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s study is disappointing, as it is not very ambitious and is based on exclusively economic criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s situation with regard to its deficit of vegetable proteins, due to the Blair House agreements, in which we agreed to a reduction in our vegetable protein production while in the mean time we were feeding our livestock on meat meal from dead animals, required that the Commission take a more ambitious and broader approach to this study. It does not take into account, as has already been said, the strategic significance for European livestock breeding of being dependent on imports from third countries for the supply of vegetable proteins, and of the fact that those imports consist almost exclusively of genetically modified food. Nor does it take into account what it would mean to increase these crops that are rich in vegetable proteins in order to re-establish the balance and capacity to supply of the whole of the European Union, which would undoubtedly be very beneficial for achieving more extensive and better quality livestock.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the study does not take into account any of the elements on which our agricultural policy should be based: food quality, protection and development of the environment and sustainable development, because neither is there any element in the study that tells us what an increase in these crops would mean in terms of creating another economic activity in agriculture, and in terms of the farmers themselves using them and processing them into food for their livestock, which would also mean a considerable increase in income in the rural economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, what the Commission is telling us about it being better to continue importing and depending on third countries because it is cheaper is not correct. We have experience of the cheapest thing not being the best thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From the point of view of producers, Parliament’s objective is to be supported. The more precise information there is on the content of feed the better. We must remember that this practice of declaration is not in itself important for the security of feedingstuffs. It is more important that all feed materials in compound feedingstuffs should be named in the declaration and that the feed materials meet with the requirements under the legislation on animal feedingstuffs. I think we should achieve a rational result quickly, as the new legislation is necessary. We must therefore move forward flexibly in the legislative conciliation process, bearing in mind that the second stage will be monitoring the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be expensive and in some ways impossible to start asking feedingstuffs manufacturers to ensure that each sack of feed should exactly correspond to the amount written on the declaration regarding percentages or that this should be monitored by the authorities. The most important aspect of this legislation is that we should invest in monitoring to a greater extent than is the case now. Safety will only be guaranteed if the acts are complied with. </p>
<p class="contents">As for the idea in Amendment No 4 of a positive list, there too it has to be borne in mind that it would be a very arduous task of administration if all feed materials used in EU countries had to be compiled in one list. There is already a list of prohibited materials in EC legislation and, in addition, there are general quality requirements for feed products. In my opinion the matter should be discussed, but its benefits and drawbacks must be considered in precise detail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My view is that the common position by the Commission is excellent. Let me just go back to what Mr Pesälä has just said: what is the real problem facing the food industry today? It is usually fraud. If we look back over the recent food scares, if we look at the problem of foot-and-mouth, it was a misuse of swill feeding; if we look at the problems of dioxin, there are sufficient measures there to prevent it. It was the illegal use of an oil in a mixture. Then there was sewage sludge which we had in one other Member State, and BSE which was all to do with changing temperatures. But the legislation is present. The first and primary position of this House is to guarantee that the Commission does everything it possibly can to ensure that the present legislation and the common position are put in place and enforced. Therefore, I call upon the Commission, first of all, to promise us that the present legislation is enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the protein situation, Commissioner Fischler would not be surprised to hear that I would slightly disagree with his position on whether or not we grow our own proteins or import them. But could he actually give me a guarantee: I understand that the European Union has regulations in place at the moment about the volume of GM crops allowed in and the percentage at present is – and I stand to be corrected on this – about 1% maximum of GM crops. Could the Commission now guarantee that none of the soya entering the Union in current and future imports will exceed the 1% maximum?</p>
<p class="contents">The US has strict measures and regulations on imports. We in the European Union must follow these regulations and ensure that we follow the same patterns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Mr President, Members of Parliament, today we have an opportunity to discuss another important food safety issue which is the labelling of compound feedingstuffs. I appreciate the work which has been done by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf who is very committed to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal in question has its origins in the legitimate expectations and demands of both the farming community and consumers. This includes full transparency in giving livestock farmers details of the composition of compound feedingstuffs that they buy for their animals. One of the lessons of the dioxin crisis was that there was often a lack of such information. This is clearly not satisfactory. This information should be available, not only to ensure transparency but also to assist in the traceability of products. The labelling of compound feedingstuffs must be sufficiently accurate to allow the stock farmer to make an informed choice as to which feed to use and many of you have already made that point in your contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am satisfied that this objective is met in the Council's common position. While it falls short of the Commission's original proposal of full and precise listing of the quantities of all ingredients, it nonetheless strikes an acceptable compromise. In my opinion we have an excellent instrument for improving the existing labelling rules for animal feed. The common position provides for all ingredients to be precisely named and for the quantities to be expressed in five percentage bands. It also requires operators to notify the exact composition of the compound feedingstuff on the request of the stock farmer or any operator.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind you that, from the very beginning, there were difficulties in the Council in reaching an agreement. A majority of Member States were opposed to the obligation to indicate on the label the precise composition of a given compound feedingstuff. For this reason, the Commission accepted the French presidency's compromise which had the unanimous support of all the Member States. I also consider that the common position provides us with a level of safety equivalent to that set out in the Commission's initial proposal. The most important fact is the presence of an ingredient in the compound feedingstuff and not necessarily its exact quantity. These exact quantities have a commercial value but they are not linked to health protection and that is the important issue in this consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf to reconsider seriously what he said earlier in his contribution that if there is not a change in the Council position in relation to this, he will be happy to see his entire proposal fall rather than compromise on this particular issue. I believe I am correct in saying that the issue of public health and food safety is related to the presence rather than the quantity of what is contained in the compound feedingstuff. We should focus on that and not lose the benefit of this important piece of legislation. We risk pursuing a particular point to a degree of accuracy that is unnecessary and thus cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that if the amendments which the Commission cannot accept are adopted, we will embark on a long and difficult conciliation procedure which will postpone the improvement. I would also underline that the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading have been accepted in the common position except for the proposal that the Commission present a positive list of feed materials that may be used in animal feed. This is inappropriate in the context of the labelling directive. If you want a positive list, the first issue to be discussed is how to establish the criteria by which the positive list will be managed. I therefore intend to launch a feasibility study on the criteria which could be used for managing the positive list and the resources which this would involve. We can then report back to you, possibly with the proposal for legislation. I do not expect this to be possible within the timetable mentioned in the amendment. Unfortunately our resources and other priorities do not allow the Commission to set a more ambitious timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to amend slightly an answer I gave to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on the question of foot-and-mouth disease the other day and correct the record. The point he made was that the Commission had delayed in its response to the issues arising from the foot-and-mouth disease issue. I responded by saying that the Commission had been notified on 20 February of the outbreak in the United Kingdom and that we had put forward proposals to the Commission the following day and that in my view that indicated a prompt rather than a delayed response.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one further piece of information that I should have added to this in fairness to the official working in my Directorate-General who by implication was criticised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf. Mr van Goethem was told at 9.30 p.m. on 20 February and by 10.30 p.m. that night he had sent a fax to every single relevant minister in the Member States of the European Union. I want to add that particular piece of information to the answer I gave the other day which included the fact that, on the following day, the issue was brought before the Commission promptly. It may be an opportunity for Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf to correct the suggestion he made about the delay, not for my sake but for the sake of the officials who work hard in my Directorate-General and who did an excellent job in this instance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank you all very much for your committed contributions but I must also remind you that the task the Commission took on was to investigate the impact the ban on bone and animal meal in feedingstuffs would have on supply and demand. It was not to examine the policy of oilseed production in the European Union. These are two separate issues. We must therefore separate the current additional protein deficit from the situation we already had in the Community. It is a fact that approximately 30 million tonnes of soya and soya equivalents are imported every year. It is not possible to make up for this deficit, at least using currently available options. There is one thing we must not forget: soya beans cannot be planted throughout the Community, but only in regions with a favourable climate. We cannot compensate for this on the basis of a policy of subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I must remind you that the implementation of this policy is subject to the precondition that no distinction is made between promoting protein crops, cereals or other crops. This is simply not possible, unless we offer appropriate compensation. But what argument can we use to persuade the Americans to renounce the Blair House agreement if we have nothing to offer in return? Please tell me what we can offer to make the Americans agree to our introducing a specific subsidy for protein crops to enable us to produce more proteins.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me back to the current protein deficit. The Commission is criticised for looking at things purely from an economic angle. I must ask Parliament whether it is justifiable to pay six times as much in additional subsidies for a kilo of extra soya production than a kilo of soya would cost on the market. There is no way round this issue, as we also have a responsibility to the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I would like to point out that the comments I have made here have nothing to do with the report we discussed yesterday evening. Naturally, the Commission will continue to ensure that organic farmers will still be able to plant clover and clover grass and other protein crops on their set-aside land as we proposed. I only mentioned that this morning because clover and clover grass have only been introduced to a limited extent in pigswill and poultry feed and are used primarily in feedingstuffs for ruminants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Byrne, thank you for your comment and your answer. Once again let me make myself clear. It was not my intention to criticise you personally or Mr van Goethem, whom I respect for his good work. What is at issue is whether the Commission worked out a disease plan in consultation with the Member States which made clear what had to happen if the disease broke out. My view is that not enough preparation was made. My comment was not aimed at individuals but rather at the Commission, as an institution, and at the Council, which did not do any preparatory work at all. This mess, which we had to go through in the public gaze, was scandalous.</p>
<p class="contents">My criticism was also levelled at the culling strategy, which had not been properly thought out, and the fact that vaccination and vaccination plus assessment had not been incorporated into the strategy. This has now been conceded by the Commission, which is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler, I would like to put another question to you.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   C<span class="italic">ommission</span>. –<span class="italic"> (DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the issue of the Morocco Fisheries Agreement, I have been very committed from the outset, that is, since I assumed responsibility for the fisheries sector. Before the previous agreement came to an end, I made contact with Morocco with a view to concluding a new fisheries agreement. However, that was roundly rejected by Morocco for many months. Concrete talks of a new agreement only became possible following a meeting with King Mohammed VI in Casablanca in October last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, seven political rounds of talks and thirteen technical rounds of talks have taken place. From the very beginning, the European Union was at pains to show the greatest possible flexibility so as to comply with Moroccan wishes and interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Following my visit to Rabat in February this year, I had to conclude that the gulf between the two positions could not be bridged, in particular, because of the compensation demands by Morocco for the catch facilities that were being offered. As regards fishing facilities, especially under the technical framework conditions of the fisheries sector, in other words, in which zones, at what times, and in what vessels, fishing could take place in Morocco, there were, in some cases, major differences of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Following my return in February, I immediately apprised the Council of the situation so as to sound out alternatives with the Fisheries Ministers. The Council requested me to make a final attempt to reach an agreement on the basis of the existing negotiation mandate. On that basis, on 26 March, I met Minister Chbaatou in Brussels. Unfortunately, however, this meeting too was a total failure.</p>
<p class="contents">During the course of the negotiations, the Commission put forward a number of proposals to promote the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector, for example, to provide resources to develop the port infrastructure and services sector in Morocco, to promote and develop coastal fisheries, to promote training and research and to develop aquaculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have accepted very extensive landing obligations in Moroccan ports, which would have meant a radical change in the traditional fishing activities of many Spanish and Portuguese fishermen, but would also have contributed to the development of the Moroccan sector. Moreover, we agreed to increase the proportion of Moroccan crewmembers on board vessels so as to improve the employment situation and the level of training in the Moroccan fishing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we would have accepted further extensive reductions in catches in order to maintain resources in Moroccan waters. For example, in the first year we would have accepted a drastic reduction in the presence of the European Union in Moroccan waters compared with under the previous agreement. The following two years would have seen a phasing out of cephalopod and shrimp fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also have accepted new technical conditions which would have been less advantageous for the Community fleet and would have reduced fishing costs. Despite this raft of concessions and despite the progress the Moroccan side has made following the negotiations, the following basic differences of opinion remain.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the fishing conditions proposed by Morocco would have meant that the economic benefit for our fishermen would have been lost as we would have had to fish with considerably fewer ships in fewer fishing zones, and we would have had to accept longer periods in which fishing was banned.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Union is of the view that financial compensation must be reasonably proportionate to the offered catch facilities. Not only is this our general political guideline, it is also stated in the negotiation mandate of October 1999. In any case, we evaluated the financial part not only in purely economic terms; we also took political considerations into account, such as the need to have good political relations with Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">In return for our proposal for a fisheries agreement we offered Morocco compensation of EUR 70 million for the first year, 60 million for the second year and 40 million for the third year.</p>
<p class="contents">This offer was very advantageous to Morocco for a number of reasons. Firstly, we calculated our financial compensation package on the basis of the fishing facilities in the final year of the previous agreement and not on the basis of the average of the last agreement. That alone means a price advantage of 15% for Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in our calculation we made no distinction between types of fish, even though we would have accepted greater reductions in the case of more expensive and, for the European Union, more interesting types of fish such as cephalopods and shrimp. This also gives a price advantage for Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we did not take the landing obligations in Morocco into account in our calculation. Fourthly, in the end I increased the compensation resulting from the calculation by 20% in order to demonstrate that we understood Morocco’s concerns about the development of its own sector.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of all that, at the last meeting with the Moroccan Fisheries Minister, Mr Chbaatou, I once again made it clear that our offer, which I have described above, was a more than fair price for the catch facility. I also told him that we were once again prepared to fork out EUR 5 million a year to prove our good intention for the conclusion of an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Moroccan Minister stressed that Morocco had no room for manoeuvre. Given the stance taken by Morocco, I do not see any possibility of concluding an agreement on the basis of our mandate. That is the message I will be taking to the Fisheries Council on 25 April. But the question of what will happen to the affected ship owners and fishermen, who have now been condemned to idleness for more than a year, is becoming increasingly pressing.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, since 1 December 1999, we have made compensation payments to ship owners and fishermen out of the Fisheries Fund. We have made all our preparations in line with the conclusions of the Nice Summit. There is currently a Commission proposal with Parliament and also with the Council, whereby compensation payments will be extended to 30 June of this year. We have also proposed leaving the 4% limit out of consideration for compensation payments. We estimate that, so far, a total of approximately EUR 80 million have been paid out to affected fishermen and ship owners, 20 million of which were raised by the Member States themselves. This equates to a Community share of EUR 60 million, some 51 million of which have gone to Spain and 9 million to Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is clear, however, additional measures and funds are necessary to secure the future of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing sectors. In my view, we must act in three key areas. Firstly, we should try to find alternative fishing facilities in other third countries, at least to a certain extent. Secondly, we must help to develop alternative employment opportunities for the affected populations, perhaps in aquaculture, or in tourism, or in the service sector, or wherever an opportunity arises.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, as we do in other cases, we must also support the breaking up of vessels for which no alternative use can be found. To this end we will exploit all the room for negotiation at the disposal of the Commission. However, we will have to approach the budgetary authority in this connection regarding the 2002 budget. The next step must be for us to report back to the Fisheries Council. Finally, I would like to stress that I very much regret the unbending stance adopted by Morocco, which has made an agreement which is advantageous to both sides impossible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Others left you a veritable time bomb preventing you from reaching another agreement: the promise and the agreement in the previous one not to renew it.</p>
<p class="contents">We all knew that it was difficult for you. Even so, after seventeen months, thirteen technical meetings, your personal involvement on seven occasions and that of the President of the Commission himself on one occasion, which is unprecedented, Morocco was persuaded to sit down and negotiate. It was little more than that, however. Morocco never wanted the agreement and showed it by imposing its intransigence and its unfair and unacceptable conditions, which the sector itself rejected as uneconomical and impossible to take on.</p>
<p class="contents">We always said that we would prefer no agreement to a bad agreement; and this is what Morocco is proposing, despite the generous, reasonable offers from the European Union, which are beneficial to both parties. Morocco is within its rights but, having got to this point, should we carry on?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that if Morocco wants an agreement with the European Union, it knows perfectly well what it has to offer. However, if it has not been reached in seventeen months, I think it unlikely that it will be reached now.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr Fischler, you should take note of this and inform the College of Commissioners of Morocco’s intransigence in co-operating with the European Union. We will be watching the development of bilateral relations between the European Union and Morocco very carefully, both in political terms, as you mentioned, and in economic, financial and trade terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is Morocco rejecting more than EUR 200 million in three years, investment from European ship owners, the possible creation of joint ventures to develop its sector, the wealth that the catches could generate in its ports? Why is it rejecting a gradual reduction of the European fleet over three years, while in private it authorises private Asian companies to use its fishing grounds? This is quite legitimate, but can the European Union not guarantee better than anyone that its resources will be rationally preserved and fished responsibly? Who in Morocco is really going to benefit from the lack of an agreement? These are the key points.</p>
<p class="contents">I stress, Mr Fischler, that you should take careful note of all this but, following this upset with Morocco, I think that we must look to the future. The situation is of course difficult, serious, and unprecedented. It is not impossible to solve, however. I therefore ask everyone for generosity and solidarity, employers and fishermen, unions and political parties. And we need to ask the European Union to make a special effort.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nice European Council, incidentally at the request of the Spanish Government and José María Aznar, agreed – another unprecedented thing – to support the demands and, if they failed, the negotiations and, if these did not succeed either, asked the Commission for a specific action programme, as set out in No 59 of the Nice conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you, Mr Fischler, for your commitment and understanding. Fishing in the European Union asks for it now more than ever. I ask for your personal political commitment to get involved in the pending fishing negotiations with third countries, Senegal and Mauritania first of all, and to open up new negotiations and explore new fishing grounds. This is the future for redeploying the fleet, which is the priority aim; and at the same time, with the funds not used for Morocco, I ask you to support a broad social programme for fishermen and for the most affected areas, with alternative economic projects to restart their economies. Your experience with the CAP should be useful to us so that, for the first time, programmes of this type can be adopted in fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that Morocco dealt a hard blow to the European fisheries sector and therefore to the European Union. Now, however, we have to adopt a realistic, constructive and responsible attitude. It has the support of Parliament, which will actively defend the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Those affected in my country feel that they have been deceived by their political leaders, who have always denied the problems in the negotiations, and the fact that there were deadlines for concluding them. This is not the case for you, Mr Fischler. How are they are going to believe in relocation to other fishing grounds if we all know that increasing the fishing effort would put resources at risk or would make the activity unprofitable?</p>
<p class="contents">Why did the negotiations fail? Despite your efforts as Commissioner, which I recognise, a common strategy was lacking, not on your part, but on the part of the Commission, and above all, the Council. You reminded me of the responsibility of ministers, whom you said were informed at all times and had taken part in the most recent rounds of negotiations. Although the formal responsibility for negotiating lies with the Commission, the governments can and should prepare the way for agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">You said that what the European Union was offering was not bad; the attitude of the Moroccan Government was not that of a loyal partner. We think, however, that the framework for negotiation was the association agreement with Morocco. Maybe eleven months ago it was not right to mix fisheries and agriculture, but we have to remember that Morocco is still benefiting from agricultural concessions obtained in parallel with the fishery negotiations in 1992 and 1995, and that the European Union is the main importer of Moroccan fisheries, agricultural and industrial products.</p>
<p class="contents">You said to me at the time that no good would come of such a mix and that it was better to trust our partners. We have trusted them and we have seen that on the same day that the negotiations broke down, Morocco was signing a fishing co-operation agreement with Japan, and while it was giving us the reasons of preserving resources, it was granting licences to Community and other vessels and fleets.</p>
<p class="contents">The sector and the public want to know what measures the Commission is going to take following the collapse of these negotiations. In your speech you talked again about another mandate. Is another mandate possible? Do you think that we would change anything with another mandate? Do you think that the negotiations have finished for good, or is it possible to restart them with a new mandate? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are calling for fair agreements which will be of mutual benefit, in line with the whole range of economic, social, political and human relations established in 1995, defining the neighbourly relationship between our countries and the Maghreb State. They are calling for an agreement on appropriate terms, which has been repeatedly approved by this Parliament and they do not accept the negotiations undertaken without faith or conviction by the Commission over the last 16 months to be valid or fitting. Nor do they accept the failure that has been announced.</p>
<p class="contents">For the same reason, I cannot accept the dismantling of the European fleet in Canary-Saharan waters and nor is it feasible to relocate or transfer them safely to other fishing banks where, furthermore, it would compete with other European boats. Nor can we leave 4400 fishermen redundant and the coastal communities that live mainly from fishing are not in a position to find new ways of earning a living overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not accept that their future lies in early retirement for the older people or in emigration for the younger ones. The communities I represent demand that the Commission returns to the negotiating table to conclude the fishing agreement with Morocco. They demand that the Member States, specifically the Spanish Government, abandon their passive or complicit attitude and bring into play the political and economic resources necessary to conclude new negotiations. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are facing a European problem that is affecting European citizens and which is undermining the very credibility of the Union’s institutions and their ability to address a critical aspect of international relations for which they have responsibility, such as fisheries. There is no reason to consider the agreement to be in conflict with preserving Morocco’s fish stocks. I am convinced that this will benefit the collective interests of the Moroccan people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 1995 my group maintained that the fisheries agreement with Morocco should be included as part of the text of the European association agreement with Morocco. The reason was obvious: between partners facilities need to be established in both directions. Morocco needs access to the Community market, and the Community fisheries sector needs access to fishing grounds that it has traditionally worked in.</p>
<p class="contents">Morocco’s reasons cannot be found in preservation of resources. Due to a lack of time, I am not going to give examples. The association agreement took an unambiguous stand on Community concessions to Morocco and today we find ourselves without a fisheries agreement. The consequences of the lack of an agreement are the loss of 4 000 direct jobs and 20 000 on land.</p>
<p class="contents">There may be a solution in seeking other fishing grounds for part of the fleet, but it is very difficult for the small-scale and inshore fleets. If Morocco is intending to act as a partner, it should open up its waters to the Community small-scale fleet immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, among your measures, you yourself talked about increasing the European Union’s room for manoeuvre. Soon the association agreement will have to be revised and Morocco will surely once again make demands for trade concessions that will even affect the same Community regions that are currently being seriously affected by the lack of a fisheries agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I hope that the European Union finds this room for manoeuvre when the time comes to revise the association agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been, to a certain extent, surprised, after the last debate that we held in this House, in which we were informed that an agreement was possible, at the sudden news that the whole thing has collapsed.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the complexity of the problem and I am shocked at the intransigence of Morocco’s position. Nevertheless, I wish to ask the following questions: with regard to the difference in financial compensation between the European Union’s proposal and Morocco’s and according to the information I have, it has been more than compensated for by the sum of Community aid allocated to Morocco under various headings and also by the trade compensations or advantages it has gained under other agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is whether the Commission is able to produce an overall strategy with Morocco. I understand a country deciding to sell its resources to the highest bidder – it has political freedom to do so – but I also consider that any country that does so will have less need for international cooperation aid. I should also like to remind you, on this subject, of what the resolution adopted in this Parliament in 1999 said: ever-closer cooperation between the European Union and Morocco cannot exclude existing relations in the field of fisheries, I should also like to know what support measures for converting the fishing fleet are being put in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand Morocco’s wishing to place a high value on its fish stocks but the lives of communities and of their economic relationships are founded on compromise. The European Union has made concessions to Morocco, by opening up its markets to many of that country’s products, including agricultural produce, and by opening up its doors to several million Moroccan citizens who have adopted the European Union as their homeland. This is why it is so difficult to understand this absence of any reciprocal attitude on the part of Morocco. I hope that the European Union will draw conclusions from this episode, both for its future cooperation with Morocco and for its own common fisheries policy. My second observation is that the effort made by the Commission and especially by Commissioner Fischler, have stood in stark contrast with the passive approach of the Council and of the various presidencies of the European Union, including that of my own country. Can this be because the agreement directly served the interests of only two countries? Or can it be that the governments of those two countries were not sufficiently forceful to protect their own interests? These are questions that require answers. My third observation is that we need to lay the ground for the future, but this cannot be done with financial compensation alone, when fisherman are standing idle and when we are compensated for ships to be scrapped. The failure of these negotiations must give the European Union food for thought with regard to the future of its common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I see three main routes here. Firstly there is the need to create new political and financial instruments for facilitating new methods of cooperation and business partnership with countries that are rich in fishing resources. Secondly, the next agreements with third countries must demonstrate serious political commitment. Thirdly, there is a need for a genuine revolution in the management of fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Morocco’s refusal is a mystery to me. Is it possible to find out the real reasons for this refusal? If we can discover the reasons, why can we then not consider a possible new negotiating mandate? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in a political assembly. We are not market traders; we are politicians. This is the viewpoint we should adopt when considering the failure of this agreement with Morocco. It seems that Morocco has behaved arrogantly towards Europe and the Union must really not forget this. I personally shall not. It is also worth asking, however, and in fact it has been asked, whether the Council may have adopted a somewhat aloof or passive attitude. This question remains to be answered. We might also ask whether the fact that this issue only affects two of the Union’s countries may have had some influence. This is undoubtedly true, and the Union has lost credibility in the eyes of the Portuguese people – and of the Spanish people too, I presume – and this is the main political concern that I wish to highlight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our position has always been that we hoped an agreement would be reached, but with one extremely important proviso, namely that the agreement had to be mutually acceptable and beneficial to both sides. It turns out that such an agreement is not possible. That is unfortunate, but we must respect the right of Morocco to determine how to exploit its resources in its own waters. It has the right to self-determination and it has the right to look for the best deal possible for itself. In its Green Paper, the Commission sets very great store by the legitimate aspirations of developing states to develop their fishing industry, and the Greens very much agree with this principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue in the Green Paper is the commitment of the European Community to the precautionary principle and the conservation of stocks. The April 2000 report by the Scientific, Technical Economic Committee for Fisheries reviews the status of the stocks off Morocco, as well as other countries in west Africa. They do not paint a very optimistic picture for anchovy, cuttlefish, demersal fish, black hake and sardinella. The report says that there is no information on the status of these stocks. The report also notes that octopus and hake fisheries are over-exploited and reductions in effort are needed. It was also pointed out that there was a huge ignorance of the amount of fishing actually being conducted by EU vessels and this is a really important and very worrying point. There was also the lack of guarantee for the protection of small-scale coastal fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are pleased that compensation and funds for restructuring of fleets has been made available, but we also have to look at the overall fisheries policy within the European Union. We cannot keep searching around the world for more and more places to transfer our over-capacity to. We have to be realistic and realise that we must solve the problem from within. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The question I would like to put is whether it is still possible to begin the negotiation of a new fisheries agreement with Morocco, with acceptable conditions. The Moroccan proposals on reformulating the previous agreement were unacceptable and some people in the sector even wondered whether a bad agreement was really better than no agreement. In any event, as a result, Portugal now has around 30 boats and over 600 fishermen without any visible future. In addition to extending aid, it is becoming crucial that the European Union guarantees compensation support for the fleet, to the fishermen and the areas affected, by supporting a programme of converting the boats that fished in Moroccan waters, guaranteeing the relocation to other fishing grounds covered by Community fisheries agreements and, of course, by considering changing the common fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To begin with, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the start of a new agreement, or the start of negotiations for a new agreement, was always going to be difficult because no agreement had been reached in the previous agreement that there would be a successor agreement. That naturally meant that, for months, the Moroccan side put forward the argument that, so to speak, there was an agreement that no new agreement would be concluded at all and that the Commission and the negotiators of the previous agreement had promised this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must be clear about one thing. I do not believe we are sending out the right signal, if we say that there must be an agreement at all costs. I have drawn your attention to the fact that the Moroccan side has said that it is not prepared to grant us more or better fishing facilities than they did last time or to back away from its financial demands.</p>
<p class="contents">If we accept, however, the financial demands for the fishing facilities that are being offered, then we will be creating a precedent for all the other third country agreements that we have. We will drive up the cost for all these other agreements to an extent that would simply be irresponsible. Naturally, the Moroccan side is at liberty to send us an improved proposal. I told the Minister as much. It would be a good thing, however, if that were to happen before the Council of Fisheries Ministers is held. Given the current circumstances, I do not believe it makes any sense. You must bear one thing in mind, however. If we conclude this agreement as it stands, there will be no economic benefit for the fishermen of Spain and Portugal, which means we will have to restructure the fleet from scratch. That, however, would take place under conditions whereby very few resources would be available to us because most would be bound up for the next three years in a bad agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to stress just how important it is that we set about supporting the sector in question as well as we can. We are all called upon to do that: the Commission, the budgetary authorities, Parliament and the Council.</p>

<p class="contents">The proposal establishes the priority of implementing new technologies, using IT networks, possibly making satellite monitoring systems standard practice, training officials responsible for policing and the intervention systems which need to be introduced in order to meet the Union’s obligations to regional fisheries organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Although in general the Commission’s proposal is acceptable, there are two aspects that conflict with the line adopted by the Committee on Fisheries and the European Parliament in other matters closely related with the one that we are dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has highlighted in recent reports on regional fisheries organisations that responsibility for control and surveillance within them should be solely that of the Community, and that it should be up to the institutions of the European Union, and particularly the Commission, to adopt the necessary measures to meet these obligations. As a result, it is logical that the action should be funded from the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the regional fisheries organisations are going to increase in importance in the future of the common fisheries policy, it is appropriate to follow the line defined by previous reports adopted by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Commission proposal it can be understood that in the future the contribution to the work of the regional fisheries organisations would also be entrusted, at least partly, to the Member States, as would the tasks of inspection and monitoring. While there is a common fisheries policy and the Community has powers in the area of fisheries, it should act as such and equip itself with the human and financial resources to deal with its obligations, as required by the principle of sufficient resources for the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Applying this principle has financial implications and requires legal developments and perhaps giving up some sovereignty, but, if a certain model of political construction is accepted, the resources need to be put in place so that the model can be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation does not exactly square with this model, as core responsibility for control lies with the Member States, and there is a need for a reasonable period for adapting the structures to the aforementioned model.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to the Member States, on a transitional basis, perhaps for the three years covered by the programme contained in this decision, to continue to exercise these responsibilities as representatives of the Union. However, this is no obstacle to reimbursing the Member States immediately for the full amount of the expenditure arising from these Community obligations, and for that reason, instead of co-funding, 100% of that expenditure should be reimbursed. This is the aim of Amendment No 1 of the draft report.</p>
<p class="contents">The reference in the Explanatory Memorandum to the decision to establishing a reduction of EUR 41 to 35 million per year in spending on control operations is surprising, since it is very likely that the establishment of an adequate infrastructure for the control and surveillance programmes will require that today’s financial burden be increased rather than reduced in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 raises the percentage of Community funding for acquiring and modernising inspection and control equipment from 30% to 35%. The majority of investment has already been made in this respect and the majority of future action will be in terms of modernisation. In any case, as the investment is costly and – we should not forget this – we are talking about control of a common policy, the percentage of Community funding should be slightly increased.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I must confess that I was tempted to begin a more detailed discussion about the future of the control system after the reform. However, the experiences of recent reports which, by looking into the future, have lost some of their effectiveness, led me to take a more modest and immediate approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we believed solely in the declarations of intent, it would seem that the Commission really does see the fisheries control policy as a top priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Explanatory Memorandum to this proposal commends the importance of this policy as part of the common fisheries policy, which it describes as crucial, a description that with which we all agree.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper that was recently presented goes even further, saying that either the system must be improved, or a fatal blow will be dealt to the credibility of the CFP. However, when the moment of truth comes, we are once again seeing that, following great declarations, two of the three essential elements are missing, and neither are the sufficient resources provided to carry out the measures, nor is the essential policy of transparency followed in order to make them credible. It is impossible to understand how, when this policy is such a priority, and it is so essential to reinforce it, the budget allocated to it on this occasion is not only not being increased, but is being decreased from EUR 41 to 35 million per year.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, this being the third decision from the Commission going the same way, this time the Commission has not made the report on the results of previous measures public, so that we do not know, aside from whether the choice of the measures to be funded was more or less correct, whether they achieved practical results, including the highly desirable results of linking the sector to this policy, which until now was described as discriminatory and confused in Community waters and weak and lacking credibility outside them.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support the more than pertinent comments from the rapporteur in this respect, and all of his amendments and, more specifically, those that stress to the Commission that this House believes that, if the Commission has the powers regarding the regional fisheries organisations, it also has the political and financial responsibility for implementing the appropriate measures. This of course includes control measures, in which the European Union is putting the credibility of its supposed commitment to sustainability of resources on the line in the eyes of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can well understand this as the consequences of the failure to conclude a fisheries agreement for the Iberian Peninsula are enormous for all of us. I had the opportunity to convince myself of that just a short time ago. Nevertheless, we must not remain paralysed; we must look at other important aspects of the CFP which were covered by the report tabled by Jové Peres.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me get straight to the point. Surveillance of fisheries is not everything, but without surveillance everything else is pointless. We know from our day-to-day experience that, without real and effective controls, the European fisheries policy would be nothing but a bubble of air. We need to make progress and adapt ourselves to modern developments. At a conference organised by the Commission last October in Brussels, reference was made to the international aspects of control. We need a global approach. The proposals tabled to this effect by the Commission are just as important as the provisions in the new Green Paper on the reform of the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for the carrying out of controls is clearly regulated. It lies with the Member States. Financial support from the Community is of course imperative, particularly if we are talking about an equal, across-the-board level of control. We need the support of the Community to bring about efficient modern controls in the future. I am using the word ‘modern’ quite deliberately and here the Commission has set the right priorities: the introduction of modern technologies, the use of information networks, the use of satellite surveillance systems and better training of surveillance staff. We must, however, think carefully about whether reducing the resources for the implementation of control measures is the right approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, in implementing these controls, we should be sending other signals, namely in terms of the priorities of the CFP. So an appropriate budget is of paramount importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your report shows that, by and large, we are in agreement. The financial involvement of the Community in the surveillance expenditure of the Member States has so far yielded very positive results. Since, however, there are still many shortcomings to rectify in the area of surveillance, it must continue. Indeed the new measures must be adapted to current circumstances, as you called for in your report.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I will come to the amendments. The Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 and 6 as they stand. Amendment No 3 seeks to add an additional recital, Recital 12, on the budgetary mechanism. We agree with you on the merits of the issue. There is no problem with that. But we do not think it is necessary to present the entire budgetary mechanism in the form of a recital. Moreover, it is also superfluous, because there is no equivalent in the procedural part of the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is unable to accept Amendment No 4, which calls for the reimbursement of up to 100% of the expenditure of Member States by the Community, as this would mean that the Community would not only take on 100% sole financial responsibility but also the accompanying sole political responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendment No 7 is concerned, the Commission is unfortunately unable to keep to the proposed date of 30 June to take a decision on the choice of surveillance expenditure which will be co-financed by the Community. The reason for this is that the Member States are to be given time up to this date to send us their reports on their surveillance expenditure. And we can only take a decision afterwards. But in future years we will be able to take our decision by 30 June. A change to the comitology procedure in this case, as you propose, is unfortunately not impossible.</p>

I would like him to hear my speech, but, in any case, I feel it necessary to inform you and all the Members that the comments made by Mr van Velzen about myself were unfounded. Mr van Velzen has criticised me twice in this House, in my absence. According to him, I was not consistent and correct in upholding human rights while I was in Cuba with Mr Wiebenga and Mrs Eriksson for a meeting of the Interparliamentary Union. I would like to say that, at the very moment when Mr van Velzen was making this point in this House – at about 5 p.m. on Monday in Strasbourg, which was 11 a.m. in Cuba – I was talking to Mr Elizardo Sánchez, the director of the Cuban Committee for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, who, in the hall of his house, was showing me the photographs he had taken with José Maria Aznar, Felipe González and our fellow Member, Mário Soares. Moreover, together with Mr Sánchez were all the representatives of the Cuban opposition. Now, this is a fact, not empty words. The delegation of the European Parliament represented this institution correctly, meeting with all the organisations of the Cuban democratic opposition even though we were not bound to do so by duty.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not asking Mr van Velzen to apologise because there is no need. I would like to thank all the Members, my group Chairman and Mr Seguro for what they said, but I am sure that there will be no need next time. Should I be criticised over human rights in the future, there will be no need for Mr Barón Crespo or Mr Seguro to take the floor because Mr Wim van Velzen will be the first to rise in this House. I repeat – he does not need to apologise – next time, he will be the one to defend me against any totally unfounded accusations or criticism.</p>

The reasons in brief, are as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendments Nos 1 and 10 on predicate offences, the Commission cannot accept coverage essentially limited to organised crime. On the treatment of the professions covered by Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13 and 22, the Commission considers that the legal professions are a special case deserving special treatment. It is unwilling, however, to extend that same treatment to all the professions. It also believes that certain types of advice, not covered by legal privilege, should fall within the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 7 and 11 on the competent authorities and Amendment No 9 on the definition of financial institutions, the Commission has a preference for the text of the common position. Amendment No 14 constitutes, in the Commission's view, an excessive extension of the coverage of non-financial activities. Regarding Amendments Nos 15 and 16 on client identification, the Commission is satisfied that the common position offers the necessary flexibility. Amendments Nos 17 and 28 deal with the special case of client identification where there is no face-to-face contact. While sympathetic to the objective of Amendment No 28, the Commission cannot accept these amendments as they stand.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 18 calls for a revision of the exemptions from client identification for certain insurance contracts. The Commission believes a detailed study is needed prior to such revision. Amendments Nos 19 and 20 deal with identification in casinos. The Commission has a preference for the common position text dealing with this matter. The Commission believes that Amendments Nos 21 and 24 bridge the basic no tipping-off rule. Amendments Nos 23 and 25 amend provisions of the 1991 directive which, in the Commission's view, do not need to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendments Nos 26 and 27 refer to the role of OLAF. At the request of the Council, the Commission will table a separate proposal on this issue. The amendments are, therefore, unnecessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will explain why. Many of us in this House, probably all of us, want the neighbouring countries of Macedonia and Greece to reach agreement on the name – whether it is going to be FYROM or Macedonia. If a vote on this takes place today, I am afraid that it will not turn out positively, or at least with a very small majority, which would not be in line with what the proposers intended. I would therefore like to ask that this proposed amendment be withdrawn. The proposers’ feelings have been expressed, and these are the feelings of many of us in this House, but I believe that the amendment as it stands should not be presented today, especially since Greece and Macedonia/FYROM are on the brink of an agreement.</p>

Moreover, Macedonia has been declaring for the past ten years that it has no desire whatsoever to change its national borders. I therefore see no reason whatsoever why Macedonia could not choose its own name. In all honesty, I do not welcome the fact that the Greek Members of the large groups have, in my view, once again managed to hold their groups hostage. Having said that, it would be even worse if a majority of this Parliament were to declare that Macedonia should be denied this right. That is why I am prepared to withdraw the amendment now, but I would call on the Greek Members finally to face the truth and grant Macedonia the right to choose its own name.</p>

<p class="contents">Public funding, however, must be for public facilities and public services. Now the ambiguity facing the European Union, which recurs in this report, revolves specifically around the future status, public or private, of port installations. On the one hand, the Council is promoting the trans-European networks, while on the other, it is planning privatisations in these sectors, as in the directive presented on 14 February on opening up competition for port services, for example.

Unfortunately, apart from one amendment, Amendment No 2, which extends the obligations of the directive to chartered accountants, and one other, Amendment No 27, which mentions OLAF and a possible European public prosecutor, Mr Lehne’s report does its best to reduce the scope of the directive. As he, himself, puts it: ‘the right of clients to confidentiality must not be undermined, even when the aim is to fight money laundering’. Absurd pretexts are then added to that argument (complicated and completely useless obligations), and escape clauses which allow the professional associations to establish the necessary rules themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we are in favour of total transparency in capital operations. We recognise the absolute need to maintain the right to be defended but in no case should this mean impunity for anyone committing a crime.

In particular I recognise the importance of common standards and rules in helping to overcome the legal obstacles that can be put in place of successful prosecution.</p>
<p class="contents">In Ireland, in order to combat the types of crime mentioned in the debate, we established the ‘Criminal Assets Bureau’ (CAB) which is a multi-agency organisation, headed by a legal officer and a chief superintendent of the police. These have been very successful in seizing the assets of drug dealers and other criminals as well as gathering evidence for further prosecutions. This has worked to bring a lot of criminals to justice and to follow the money trail to seize the proceeds of those criminal activities.</p>
<p class="contents">However great our desire may be to prosecute criminals, we must ensure that the normal rules of procedure and justice are not ignored. In the present report, the desire to put accountants and auditors on the same level as lawyers is important to maintain this right of defence. The move within the common position to allow information gathered in a ‘money laundering case’ to be put to other uses for prosecution goes too far I believe.</p>

The war against money laundering can no longer be waged by an isolated government. For it to be effective, cooperation between the Member States must be organised. It is essential to extend the definition of money laundering, because restricting it to drug-trafficking no longer corresponds to today’s reality. Account must be taken of every type of crime that generates major financial flows, fraud against the financial interests of the Communities, and any kind of corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">It has become absolutely necessary to involve the legal professions in the operation against money laundering, otherwise the European system of preventing and combating dirty money will be ineffective. There is no question, however, of lawyers accepting any threat to professional secrecy or the confidentiality of their relationship with their clients. So those amendments are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, professional secrecy remains the fundamental rule in the exercise of the profession of lawyer. It is incompatible with the expression of suspicion, worse still, the expression of possible suspicion. What is more, restricting professional secrecy amounts to restricting citizens’ fundamental rights. Lawyers are officers of the courts, not police officers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is just not the case. It makes no sense that lawyers cannot settle an insurance claim or that brokers cannot draw up a plan until they have established their credentials.</p>
<p class="contents">It makes just as little sense to demand that cash only be handed over from person to person. Such a demand would mean that bank night safe-deposit boxes would have to be set up immediately. This would cause problems, however, for business people, especially from small and medium-sized businesses, who, for obvious reasons of security, deposit their day’s takings in the safe-deposit box of their bank after the banks have closed. That, however, has absolutely nothing to do with the laundering of money from criminal activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully endorse the reasonable position adopted by the rapporteur, which the Finance Ministers could also live with. They at least should know that any further delay in amending the money-laundering Directive is irresponsible, especially since the money-laundering mafia is becoming increasingly adept.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Member of the European Parliament who comes from Luxembourg, the effectiveness of the fight against the laundering of money from criminal activity lies very close to my heart, as the Grand Duchy has some of the strictest laws on money laundering. These laws and their application as well as the cooperation resulting from the 1991 Directive must not be undermined by a too broadly interpreted definition of ‘criminal activity’, which is what is called for under the common position adopted by the Council. For reasons of efficiency, the directive should essentially be limited to combating the laundering of money from organised crime, which was its original objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their view is that the government should not interfere in their profits and possessions. Attempts are once again being made, rightly so, to get a tighter grip on money-laundering practices. On the one hand, that requires the proposed measures to be as fool proof as possible, without escape routes for profiteers who refuse to meet the legal requirements. I have the impression that the Council’s proposals are still too weak in this respect, and even the adjustments proposed by the rapporteur at second reading still leave something to be desired. On the other hand, there is the fear that lawyers have been required to act as investigation officials at the expense of their clients. In this case, this may be justified. Nonetheless, this sets an undesired precedent. Lawyers should not be required to act against those whom they have to protect. By, however, drawing a distinction in recital 16a between the actual role of lawyers and this profession’s other activities, it might be possible to avoid this precedent. I will therefore give the proposal the benefit of the doubt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Billions of pounds are lost every year across the European Union due to money laundering and fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">When we think of crime, an image of burglaries, violent muggings and knife attacks by gangs of youths on our streets often springs to mind. Money laundering is an unseen crime, but it costs the taxpayer dearly and those found guilty should pay the price. Those misusing the financial system should be caught and punished. Moreover, money laundering is responsible for financing the evil trade in drugs, trafficking in humans and other horrific crimes. We should not turn a blind eye to crimes of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">We must crack down on banks and professionals, encouraging them to report clients under suspicion to the authorities. We should even extend the scope of this proposal to include high-spending gamblers and auctioneers at the top end of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, this issue is an important one at a European level. Money laundering is not simply restricted to Manchester or to Madrid. It knows no borders, and tainted money changes hands across regions and countries. It is not enough to enforce purely British legislation, but measures must be taken across the EU. We must work together to tackle this challenge. Therefore, I applaud the efforts of this House to curb the use of the financial system for money laundering. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The compulsory definition of acceptable raw materials in compound feedingstuffs for animals is also crucial, bearing the BSE and dioxin crises in mind. We must also ensure that all materials that put human and animal health at risk are banned.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this report was framed during a broader discussion of animal feedingstuffs, on which the Commission made a statement regarding the options for encouraging the planting of protein crops in the EU, taking account of the Agricultural Council of December 2000, which bans the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs for breeding animals, and insists on the need to replace animal protein with vegetable protein.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal is based mainly on budgetary consequences, forgetting the basic principle of the sovereignty of food, when it states that the best and cheapest solution is to increase Community soya imports by 5%. This will make the EU more dependent for its vegetable protein, particularly soya meal, which could threaten food safety, on imports of genetically modified soya from the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">Using the pretext of WTO rules and costs, the Commission is refusing to increase aid for growing oilseed crops because they contravene the Blair House agreement. Similarly it refuses to support the use of fallow land under the set-aside system, because this would be in conflict with the WTO’s blue box that requires agricultural aid to be conditional upon production-limiting measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, the Commission is refusing to encourage production within the EU. This is an unacceptable position, which we should reject, although we support the report, for which we have voted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that, in times like these, it is a political imperative that we give people a feeling of security. We need openness, labelling and transparency. Politically mature citizens want to decide for themselves what to eat.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that this demand cannot relate solely to the end product. So we have a fundamental interest in documenting the history of our food and making it transparent. Farmers on the ground are responsible for animal protection and food safety. They must be held accountable for what they feed to their animals, not only to secure their own economic success (though this is a factor we should not lose sight of) but also to satisfy consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">When I look at individual actions, I sometimes get the impression that time is running away from us. My own <span class="italic">land</span> in Germany, Rheinland-Pfalz, has introduced a seal of approval for beef which aims to guarantee not only the origin of the animal but its history and what it has been fed.</p>
<p class="contents">The feedingstuffs industry has come on board of its own free will and offers an open declaration of feed materials and stronger controls. Farmers would otherwise buy their feed elsewhere: only with this information can they get the seal of approval. I hope in future there will be more such self-imposed obligations. This would set the wheel in motion and feedingstuff manufacturers would be practically forced to make an open declaration out of economic necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">In the here and now, however, it is a question of taking a political decision and establishing the legal bases, which must be the same for everybody. That is why we need the open declaration. We need traceability and we also need controls. I hope that the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf will set the wheel turning.

However, there is one element which I am struggling with.</p>
<p class="contents">Recital 14 and Article 4 provide for the possibility of government aid being deployed for the use of infrastructure. This is also possible pursuant to the amendments. In my opinion, this exemption from the ban of government aid is undesirable.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all because the starting premise is wrong, for transport by road already pays the lion’s share of the external costs. Secondly, it is not judicious to grant extra support for the use of infrastructure. Take rail, for example: the costs are not the most important reason why transporters do not opt for rail. We need an increase in quality and reliability, and market discipline is then the best incentive. I fear that this incentive for a modal shift, of which we are of course in favour, is counterproductive, brings about distortion of competition and undermines the work that has been done in the framework of the rail liberalisation package.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore be voting against recital 14 and Article 4. They do not belong in this Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I had a certain reservation in supporting the report because at present there is an alarmingly one-sided quality in our approach. Too little attention is given in our debates or in the instruments upon which we vote to vital issues of civil liberty. These concern the rights of persons accused of crimes who are entitled in all our systems to the presumption of innocence until guilt is proved.</p>
<p class="contents">These rights are guaranteed under Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Experience shows, however, that interpretation of the rights in question is variable throughout the Union. Sometimes prosecuting authorities ignore them with apparent impunity. I call for greater and better attention to these points. For example, when are we to see proposals for a EuroBail system? Mutual recognition should facilitate common provision for conditional release pending trial. It is a scandal that in many Member States people awaiting trial may spend many months needlessly in detention prior to trial. This requires the most urgent attention of everyone in this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With the expansion of the single market and with the introduction of the euro currency, there are now greater opportunities for cross-border trade and commerce in Europe. Also, with the wider globalisation of the marketplace, there is a necessity for a greater co-operation and understanding of different legal systems. In any democratic system, the arm of justice must not only operate effectively but must be seen to do so and it must command the respect of the people. The quicker and easier it is for the resolution of legal conflicts, then the better it is for the protection of legal rights and also to guarantee the conditions concerning the certainty of trade. Therefore, the setting up of the EUROJUST programme with the co-operation of the judiciaries within the various EU Member States is a very important movement towards building a greater understanding of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this should not be seen as an attempt to subvert or subjugate the systems operating within the various Member States of the EU. Rather, it should be seen as an enhancement to implementing a speedy resolution of disputes by introducing a greater clarity in legal judgements.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly recommend the point in relation to the establishment of a centralised electronic European Union judgment registry, which has been initiated by an Irish lawyer Twinkle Egan. This will make it easier to understand differing judgements and to help build a greater consistency in how precedents operate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I fully support this common-sense strategy which broadens the system of cooperation between national authorities. This will not only simplify judicial cooperation between the Member States, but it will also facilitate cross-border legal procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Increased judicial cooperation is an important step forward for my constituents in the North-West who are sometimes desperate for help with a case in another EU country. For example, a young parent whose children have been abducted by the other parent from the UK to France, will certainly be assisted by greater understanding between the British and French legal services. So would the elderly couple who have exchanged their hard-earned cash for a holiday home in the south of Spain and have faced legal battles with the purchase.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant that this network becomes part of the existing trans-European network for the electronic exchange of data. In light of enlargement, the applicant countries should also be allowed to participate in the contact meetings. Data will therefore be exchanged on the European judicial network from England to Estonia, making life remarkably easier for the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I very much welcome increased judicial cooperation which will be of tremendous benefit to all our citizens seeking legal advice or bringing forward cases across the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Reading the Commission’s report on vegetable proteins in the context of the ban on meat and bone meal, I was deeply shocked by the authors’ apparent contempt for their fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">First, contempt for consumers: the Commission’s position takes no account of the clear, strong and growing demand on the part of consumers for traceability and visibility in product origin. Here the proposal is simply to go on buying the proteins we lack as cheaply as possible in the great world supermarket for agricultural surpluses. So what if they contain GMOs?</p>
<p class="contents">Then, contempt for farmers: the Commission’s resignation is an insult to European farmers, suggesting they are incapable of producing the vegetable proteins we need on our own soil. The measures proposed in the Commission’s seven- point plan (authorising the production of fodder legumes on land set aside on organic farms) is sympathetic but in no way commensurate with the challenge. Between organic production and massive imports of genetically modified soya, there is a margin for the creativity of European farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact one could say the Commission is trying to find technical, regulatory and budgetary arguments for refusing to act. It is presenting us with a ‘non-plan’ for proteins.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is demonstrating an accountant’s logic which is not even economically relevant: the fact that soya is cheap at the moment does not mean it will always be cheap. A price rise is bound to come.</p>

The Commission’s proposal was one-sided and limited and sought to make it possible, only for organic farms, to grow fodder on land set aside under the COM in cereals.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the Community deficit in vegetable protein production, the limitations of the Blair House agreement and the ban on the use of animal meal in feedingstuffs for breeding animals, it has become necessary to create a genuine internal system of support for the production of fodder legumes and protein crops.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur’s proposal, which I support, seeks to open up the same opportunity for conventional livestock farms and for farms covered by any agro-environmental programme in order to achieve a broad concept of fodder legumes, bearing in mind the importance, as we proposed for Portugal, of beans, sweet lupin and yellow lupin.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the proposal lacks a real system of incentives for fodder legume and oilseed production, which might require the use of aid under the set-aside scheme or tying this partially to the production of fodder legumes, or through a change to set-aside assistance when fodder legumes are grown there.</p>

In other words, the CAP should have been reviewed in its entirety, encompassing both the feedingstuffs sector and the farming sector which produces feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the quota system should have been reviewed, especially in the Mediterranean countries, and in Greece in particular, where quotas are far below self-sufficiency and potential production levels and where the method of producing animal proteins is far healthier than the method used in the economically advanced countries of the EU, where quotas far exceed requirements, with the result that they export the dangers inherent in their feedingstuffs to all the countries with shortfalls, including Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also examine the system for pricing and subsidising fodder crops, so as to support fodder legumes, with a view to guaranteeing cheap, top quality vegetable proteins and protecting the environment, given that legumes restore the soil and are ideally suited to crop rotation programmes, especially with the soil and climate in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of which, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has used various tricks, believing that the problem of BSE will be forgotten in time, in an endeavour to restore animal protein in animal feedingstuffs in six months’ time. In other words, it is endeavouring to restore meat and bonemeal which, it has now been proven, is responsible for BSE, disregarding public health in order to serve the interests of the Community feedingstuffs industry. These endeavours are confirmed by decisions on the matter so far and discussions taking place in official circles.</p>
<p class="contents">The alibi which the Committee is using for these endeavours takes the form of the proposal to cultivate certain land set aside from arable crops with fodder legumes, allegedly in order to increase the production of vegetable proteins; at the same time, however, it bans the production of seed on this land and restricts it solely to hay production, and unsubsidised hay production at that.</p>
<p class="contents">Under this proposal, little or no vegetable proteins will be produced, even in countries with extensive set aside. For Greece, however, and perhaps for other Mediterranean countries, the proposal is meaningless because they have little or no set aside.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal does absolutely nothing to resolve the problem of protein in Community fodder, and, as a result, it deliberately and consciously finds a ‘solution’ either in the Community meat and bonemeal responsible for BSE or in modified soya from the United States, which may well be equally dangerous to public health, as well as making Community livestock farmers dependent on the multinationals which market soya and soya products.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the Commission proposal does not make use of the productive potential in the Member States in order to resolve the problem of proteins, and feedingstuffs in general, once and for all and in a way which safeguards public health, because the purpose of the proposal is to mislead farmers and consumers, so that the dangerous method of producing proteins for animal feed can continue, and because I have no desire to help, even indirectly, in perpetuating this serious public health problem and deceiving arable and livestock farmers, I shall not vote in favour of the Commission proposal. I believe that my vote will act as an incentive and that the production of healthy and suitable feedingstuffs will become the subject of an objective fight on the part of the people of the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a background we have the ban of the use of meat and bone meal – a temporary ban that many of us trust will become permanent – and the now long-term EU deficit of vegetable proteins.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is going in the right direction but it limits itself to proposing a symbolic modification, the impact of which, limited solely to organic farming, is not going to give visible results.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Auroi’s report, with the amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, correct this timid proposal by extending it to farms that operate in accordance with Regulation 1257/99 on rural development, and by including, from 2002, the growing of leguminous fodder crops on land left fallow in conventional livestock farms.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way we may be able to effectively counteract the EU’s dependence on supplies of proteins that are in many cases genetically modified and, as they are used to feed livestock, are introduced into the food chain without any opportunity for control on the part of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Party of European Socialists therefore supported the amendments adopted in the Committee responsible and there is nothing more for us to do than hope that the Commission will take them into account along with the successive requests from members of this House for effective progress to be made towards a visible correction of the European deficit of vegetable proteins. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Public opinion is doubtful, and it is right. So the resolution we have just voted on is rightly geared towards authorisation of urgent vaccination, either in a particular region affected by foot-and-mouth disease, or in a ‘buffer’ region, or in the case of rare breeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond these urgent measures, we might wonder why foot-and-mouth, once common in the countryside of Europe, and not usually fatal to animals (let alone humans), should now be producing a national crisis. The answer is two-fold.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the disease spreads faster than before because agriculture has become massively geared towards production, and is therefore highly specialised and fragmented. One animal can spend different stages of its life in several parts of a country, or even of Europe. It is transported many times, the link with the original breeder is broken and traceability becomes unreliable. So we think it is important to re-establish more stable rearing, where everyone knows who is responsible and where animals are not treated like inert merchandise. That is part of the agricultural reform we are proposing for the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the massive slaughter seems to be motivated by economic reasons which are not always transparent. One of these appears to be a determination to maintain exports at any price, because some purchaser countries regard meat from vaccinated animals as indistinguishable from meat from sick animals. Under those circumstances vaccination would be useless from the economic point of view, because in both cases the meat is worth less. I find this financial reasoning absurd. Surely exports could be accompanied by a vaccination certificate? And why must absolutely everything be subordinated to exports? That just contributes to productivity-driven farming and necessitates subsidies which cost the taxpayer dear, all to achieve, ultimately, the destabilisation of farming in less developed countries. The system is verging on insanity, and things will have to be put back on an even keel in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Foot-and-mouth, though, is an ancient disease. It does not affect humans and the majority of animals recover from it. With the development of the world market in cattle and meat, however, agri-industry has given it an international epidemic dimension it did not have before. The market imposes its own health requirements too, with tragic consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of vaccine has been banned on purely economic grounds, ‘economic’ here being reduced to commercial regulations and an estimate of the financial costs which is in some respects questionable. Hundreds of thousands of healthy (or curable) animals are being slaughtered purely in the name of an accountant’s calculation of profitability. The decision-makers have only the market rules they have invented themselves to set against the despair of the farmers whose herds are being destroyed. Elementary respect for life, protection of local economies, maintenance of a thriving social fabric in the rural environment, and the living and working conditions of country people have all been ignored in the definition of health policies in response to the foot-and-mouth epidemic.

It has penalised farmers and has increased people’s lack of confidence in the safety of agricultural produce. The liberalisation of agriculture and the free movement of goods have increased the risk and the spread of animal diseases with a CAP that, in the name of competitiveness and constant price reduction has promoted the concentration, intensification and centralisation of production.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current context, those who have been penalised most heavily are the producers, although we have not seen the necessary aid for compensation or sufficient contingency measures, in this case for foot-and-mouth disease. I have therefore proposed the creation of a specific budget line within the EU budget, to support farmers and measures for eradicating animal diseases, given the food, health and veterinary crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the spread of the disease, it makes sense to temporarily suspend the movement of animals between Member States and to increase controls on meat that is sold, and it is regrettable that the recent Agricultural Council did not take a decision on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to short-term measures, however, we also need a new type of agricultural policy, which protects production and supports changes in production methods. We need a policy that promotes the quality and safety of food in line with the precautionary principle. We need a form of farming that is sustainable and which promotes the specific characteristics of each region and a greater variety of aid for agricultural produce, bearing in mind the varying levels of agricultural development. We need a form of farming that contributes to economic and social cohesion and which is based firmly on family farming and on small and medium-sized holdings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Based on the notion that this will strengthen Europe’s position on the global market, silly measures are being imposed on all Member States. The course of affairs with regard to foot-and-mouth is the latest illustration of this failing. Between 1956 and 1992, we had managed to control this animal disease effectively thanks to a massive preventive vaccination campaign. Due to the one-sided consideration of export interests, we are back where we were half a century ago. Instead of introducing preventive vaccination and banning the transport of live animals over long distances, a choice is now being made in favour of pointless mass slaughter in order to destroy healthy animals. In the absence of the possibility of vaccination, this primitive approach is considered to be the only means of curbing the further spread of the disease. Even rare animals in nature reserves and zoos are now being sacrificed to the mad ban on vaccination. Farmers are bewildered and at their wits’ end. Restricted emergency vaccination and taking time out for further research are not solving the problem. In my opinion, the Member States can no longer adhere to the vaccination ban and must carry out vaccination immediately, even if this should lead to an even further setback in exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They give the impression of a Europe with its tentacles in everything, which does not distinguish big issues from small, or the national level from the European.</p>
<p class="contents">That is damaging to the whole Union. The European Council, which is taking on increasing weight in the institutional balance, ought to present especially clear conclusions. To make the necessary improvements the preparation for Councils must be reformed, but also, more profoundly, European powers must be clarified and lightened, and those issues should be on the agenda for the next Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, rational and well-ordered conclusions ought to consist of three parts:</p>
<p class="contents">the first part should be devoted to certain vital issues of strategy, which the Council would have discussed thoroughly, and on which it would have taken some real decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part would give instructions for implementation to the various Councils of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the third part, which should be the most substantial, could set out certain guidelines that the Heads of State and Government intend to follow in their respective countries, particularly as regards managing the economy and social affairs – which was on the Stockholm agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">These guidelines would not be restrictive, and the expression of contrary opinions would be tolerated. They would thus demonstrate a determination to develop free, informal and open coordination, respectful of national democratic choices.</p>
<p class="contents">Reading the Stockholm conclusions, we can see how far away we are from that. In fact our motion for a resolution calls for thorough reform of the Treaty, involving the restoration of numerous powers to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet again, the summit’s sights were set on pension and social rights, with workers being called on to work more and receive less.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from their joint declaration that the Heads of State or Government of the ΕU are anxious about the increase in the number of pensioners, which they feel "will create substantial pressure on social welfare systems, in particular pensions, health care systems and care of the elderly";. In other words ‘prosperity’ is being jeopardised by the increase in longevity. And the solution is to increase employment in the 55-64 age group by 50% by 2010, at a time when workers, especially young people and women, are suffering from the scourge of unemployment and under-employment.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the Balkans, they are continuing their policy of controlled destabilisation and, alongside their supposedly friendly stance towards the FYROM, they are endeavouring to promote the KLA as an equal negotiating partner with the government of the country. It is perfectly obvious that the imperialist plans for the region have not yet been completed and that the people will be unable to live in peace until ΝΑΤΟ withdraws. As far as Palestine is concerned, they are continuing their policy of maintaining the same distance from the state terrorism being applied by Israel and the just fight of the Palestinian people for a homeland.</p>
<p class="contents">On the economic front, they have limited state aid and subsidies, taken further steps to liberalise telecommunications, postal services, the railways and energy and have prepared to complete the sell-off of the public sector to the multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint motions for resolutions not only accept the summit conclusions, they also welcome the arrest of former President of Yugoslavia, Mr Milosevic, and call for him to be handed over to the ‘International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia’ in The Hague, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To say that ‘unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since 1991’ is an involuntary way of recognising that it is still as high as it was ten years ago, when it was already catastrophic. In addition, the balance sheet for these ten years includes the widespread introduction, throughout Europe, of poorly paid casual work and the decline of wages as a proportion of national income.</p>
<p class="contents">Only big companies and their proprietors and shareholders, can be happy about the exceptional level of profits, because that result has been obtained at the expense of working people, as well as public services and social provision.</p>

In fact, had it not been for the announcement of the joint Franco-German decision to postpone setting a deadline for the full liberalisation of the energy market until there is greater mastery of all the consequences and all the effects, the summit would certainly have been overlooked by the newspapers and TV. It was an important summit in economic and social terms, however, and entirely in line with the Lisbon Summit, with the reaffirmation of the need to take action to secure full employment and skilled jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As it turns out, those guidelines have immediately run up against the brutal announcement of redundancy plans at Danone and Marks and Spencer, with no consultation and without even having any genuine economic reasons. Veritable ‘dictatorship’ by the stock exchange and frenzied profit-seeking to the detriment of employees, when they are in fact the prime wealth creators, has demonstrated – to anyone who did not already know – what a vast gap there is between the soothing speeches of politicians and the reality experienced by employees on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">So unless we want to acknowledge the death of the European social model, we cannot stand by and do nothing, and personally, since 31 March, I have been lobbying the highest European and French authorities to propose measures to end this diabolical spiral. I am now waiting, like many in this Chamber, for precise and relevant responses. If these are not forthcoming, there will be no point in organising any summits on employment and social policy in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I support Francis Wurtz’s proposal to create an ad hoc structure within the European Parliament, a sub-committee or observatory to monitor and analyse the adjustment strategies that powerful economic groups base entirely on staff reductions. There should be a European summit on this vital issue for the equilibrium and future of Europe, in the course of 2001.

In Stockholm, the fate of Macedonia would appear to have been dealt with in a few minutes. Farmers must make do with European ‘solidarity’ to cope with foot-and-mouth disease and rule out a return to the vaccination programme, cancelled a few years ago to save money. This time financial services emerge as the great victors. Between now and 2003 a single market in securities will be established to allow a few profiteers to speculate in shares and bonds. So, in the utmost opacity, financial dealings are encouraged and will revolve even more rapidly in the hands of a few industrialists, playing with the fate of millions of employees in passing.</p>

<p class="contents">Finally, the private operators have obtained confirmation of the liberalisation of juicy public services – the post office, electricity and gas.

The path has therefore already been mapped out. As in the story about the half-cup of water, some will see it as half full and some as half empty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon strategy to speed up liberalisation, particularly through privatising transport, postal services, electricity, gas and telecommunications, was, despite everything, consolidated at the Stockholm Council. Furthermore, the process of integrating the financial markets was also speeded up.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to recovering ‘full employment’, this does not necessarily mean an increase in the number of quality jobs, particularly if this increase takes place at the expense of greater job insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the so-called ‘modernisation of the European Social Model’, new attacks were made on the pensions system and changes to social security, with the method of open coordination in this area being started up and with this objective being included in the EU’s annual economic guidelines. It is worth highlighting, however, that the tiny echoes from the social part of the Lisbon strategy are due to the efforts of the workers and all progressives who want to see an economy that pays more attention to people’s problems and sustainable development.

<p class="contents">First of all, where the Balkans are concerned, I must criticise an unacceptable and flagrant example of interference and blackmail towards the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by the USA, which is trying to whitewash and cover up the responsibilities of NATO and all those who waged a war against Yugoslavia, in blatant breach of the UN Charter and from within the Security Council itself. This was a war in which arms containing depleted uranium were used, the chemical and radiological effects of which on the population and on the environment have still not been fully assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">The causes of the current situation in the Balkans are complex and deep-seated, but I must highlight the interfering role of the USA and the EU, which have significantly and, at times decisively, contributed to undermining a process whose consequences for the situation throughout the region are far from resolved. A strategy of selectively and arbitrarily criminalising certain political leaders is therefore unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and bearing in mind the extremely serious situation in the Palestinian territories, I consider the resolution’s provisions to be quite inadequate. The resolution does not clearly and explicitly condemn the escalation of aggression by Israel, the bombings and the repression by the Israeli army against the Palestinian population or the intensification of the blockade imposed on the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must be extremely concerned about the absence of criticism of the current militarisation of the EU, which has the instrument of the common defence policy, as the European pillar of NATO, and the absence of criticism of the North-American anti-missile shield project (AMS) whose completion would contribute to relaunching the arms race and to greater insecurity throughout the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It comes as no surprise because despite the fact that the United States signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, at successive United Nations Conferences designed to finalise the rules for implementing the Protocol, it has presented various excuses to block negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is serious because national self-interest has won the day. It is unacceptable that, given the increasingly dramatic predictions of the effects of global warming, the country mainly responsible for greenhouse gas emissions has refused to participate in the only international instrument designed to limit these effects.</p>
<p class="contents">As serious as this decision is, however, we cannot waver or hesitate over the need to implement the Kyoto Protocol, with or without the United States. It is crucial that we put a brake on climate change and the Kyoto Protocol – and no other type of agreement – is the most appropriate political instrument to achieve this objective. The non-participation of the United States does make the Protocol less comprehensive, but does not detract from its raison d’être. This may make application of the protocol more difficult, but it does not make it impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">The statement by the United States and the fact that COP6 part II, a conference designed to adopt the rules for implementing the Kyoto Protocol, forces the European Union to redouble its efforts and demonstrate effective leadership in this political dossier. Both internally, by countering the very harmful developments in greenhouse gas emissions in most Member States and externally, by negotiating the rules for implementing the Protocol with as many countries as possible to ensure that it is ratified and implemented by 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The European also has the task of fighting to ensure that the rules of fair trade are implemented so that the United States cannot gain any illegal economic advantages from not ratifying the Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment therefore, rather than insisting on a dialogue of the deaf with the United States, the European Union must implement an action plan that will enable us to implement Kyoto across the board, in other words, with as many countries as possible, and as a matter of urgency, by 2002. This action plan must enable us to achieve the following set of timetabled goals:</p>
<p class="contents">I) To negotiate, even before COP6 part II, the rules for implementing the Kyoto Protocol with Russia, Japan, Australia, Canada and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in order to reach an agreement that can be ratified by more than 55 countries, corresponding to more than 55% of emissions, which is the minimum level required for the Kyoto Protocol to come into force;</p>
<p class="contents">II) For the EU to ratify the Kyoto Protocol by the end of 2001;</p>
<p class="contents">III) To adopt National Reduction Plans for greenhouse gases by the end of 2001;</p>
<p class="contents">IV) To present the directive on the implementation of the European Emissions-Trading System by the end of 2001;</p>
<p class="contents">V) To present, under the European Programme for Climate Change, a raft of copper-bottomed directives on policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the industry, energy, services, agriculture and mainly, transport sectors, in which emissions are increasing most rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">VI) For the European Commission to draft an economic study on the competitive advantages that American products, particularly in the field of energy, will gain illegally over European products as a result of the European Union not implementing the Kyoto Convention;</p>
<p class="contents">VII) For the European Commission to draft a legal study to determine the way in which, within supranational institutions, particularly the World Trade Organisation and the Transatlantic Economic Partnership, these illegal advantages, to which I referred in my previous point, can be minimised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can greet the Commission but I cannot greet the Council whose absence I deplore when this resolution on human rights in China is primarily addressed to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell the Council, or whoever is reporting to the absent Council, what a failure, not to say disaster, the EU’s China policy has been. We all know there are growing social and political contradictions in that country. The risk of explosion is imminent and we can all imagine the disaster that will represent in a country the size of China, not only in regional terms, but also in world terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Our duty as elected representatives and citizens is to make the Chinese leaders, legal, yes, but certainly not legitimate, understand that only democracy and the rule of law can guarantee stability not just in China itself but also in the whole of the Asian continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is our duty to remind the Council, and the Commission where it is appropriate – that the right way to bring the Chinese Government round to the basic principles of democracy and the state of law, is this resolution tabled by the United States due to be voted on in the next few days by the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. It is our duty to remind the Council that the European Union cannot continue to take a hypocritical stance and that it must support this resolution, sponsor it and work actively in the Human Rights Commission for its adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">Without intending to be either anti-Chinese or pro-Chinese, I repeat that China is a fundamental country in a regional and continental context where Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and many other countries are experiencing enormous problems, and where Vietnam and Laos too are still ruled by a one-party regime. China can play a fundamental role providing it finally adopts a democratic system based on the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we must make clear to the Chinese leaders. We have two goals: democracy for the Chinese, the Tibetans, the Uigurs and the Mongols, and the stability of the entire continent of Asia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel that if the countries of the European Union stick by their decision not to sign the resolution on human rights in China, that would only be confirmation of that inability. There is absolutely no reason, other than hypocrisy and defeatism, why we should not sign this resolution, for in not doing so we are not achieving anything at all that could justify taking this standpoint on a subject upon which there is such wide consensus from our public.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, our resolution – which is not the first and, I believe and fear, will not be the last – seeks to make the Council change its mind, thereby ensuring that, at least at the level of condemnation from the civilised world, this time, China gets what it deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a matter which should be resolved with great urgency by the Chinese authorities before its consequences spiral out of control. The US Administration has expressed its regret, which we share, particularly over the loss of a Chinese fighter pilot, but now is the moment to bring this matter to an end by releasing the American aircrew and enabling recovery of the American aircraft. Otherwise this matter will become a running sore, poisoning international relations at a very sensitive time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chinese Government seems anxious to play a fuller part in the international community, particularly in terms of economic development and eventual membership of the WTO. But it has not yet realised the need to adjust attitudes in other areas or recognise that political confrontation needs to be replaced by a more conciliatory approach. This applies not just in the field of international relations, but in terms of domestic policy as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be an enormous leap forward when we no longer have to table resolutions on human rights abuses in China but we see very little progress being made and the catalogue of abuses continues to expand. The Falun Gong movement is violently suppressed and some 80 of its members are reported to have died in custody in China in the past 18 months. The sustained violence and intimidation against Tibetan Buddhists is little short of a programme of ethnic cleansing. A great country like China is surely sufficiently robust and forward-looking that it can give real freedom to all the peoples living under its authority. It must show that it recognises the individual humanity of its citizens and will exercise the duty of good government by providing protection for all under the rule of law. We urge the Council and the Member States to take strong note of the likely resolution of this Parliament and to support the resolution of the United States at the UN Commission in Geneva deploring the state of human rights in China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even setting aside this event, reports from China are, nevertheless, pouring in thick and fast. They almost always concern acts of cruelty against its own citizens. Commentators the world over are agreed that the human rights situation in China is becoming worse and worse. We are talking here about the situation in Tibet and Sinkiang and about the widespread increase in the torture and persecution of dissidents, active trade unionists and representatives of democracy. We are talking about the frequent use of the death penalty and the opposition mounted against freedom of expression on the Internet. We are talking, in particular, about the arrest, torture and persecution of Falun Gong practitioners. The Chinese régime’s objective of breaking this movement will not succeed. The persecutions must therefore be halted immediately and a dialogue entered into.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament agrees about the situation in China. I know that the Commission shares this view, and Commissioner Patten has defended human rights in China several times in this Chamber. The world’s most populous country is systematically violating its citizens’ rights. Europe cannot remain silent and watch this happen. The signals coming from the Council are, however, conflicting and hypocritical and help weaken the international struggle to get the Chinese régime to change its policy. This lack of unity benefits none other than the Chinese régime, and at the expense of the Chinese people. The Council <span class="italic">must</span> therefore get its act together and show that all the talk about unity is not just idle chatter but can also be expressed in action. It must also support the resolution against China in Geneva in a couple of weeks’ time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had also asked for this earlier in the European Parliament. But we did not get that far. We are not too keen ourselves on co-sponsoring with the United States, and would have preferred to have our own European position. We will be voting in favour of the resolution because, ultimately, we are naturally all agreed on the human rights situation in China. That is why we are delighted about the fact that the European Member States have decided in the Council to vote jointly for a resolution after all, if it is submitted. Apparently, it is not up to us to submit this resolution, but if the United States submits one, then we can support it. That is an advance on last year, when the Member States were still divided. Although he cannot speak on behalf of the Council, maybe Mr Lamy can give us this information here.</p>
<p class="contents">The exciting thing for both Europe and China is, of course, that we have an incredibly strong financial market. We need a sound human rights policy to match. Foreign policy and the economy must be consistent and, in a completely different way, this also applies to China. China is extremely generous when it comes to giving free rein to economic processes. At the same time, the country is incredibly oppressive and dictatorial in its political policy. This will, of course, generate impossible tensions, fundamental also in terms of human rights. They sign international conventions, which they struggle to implement and then contravene. It would be extremely positive if we could encourage all those powers in China which inject more consistency into the fabric. Any partnership which we as Europe can enter into with China in this respect is very welcome. At the same time, we must continue to speak in clear terms on human rights and condemn as and when appropriate. That is why this resolution is so pertinent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, the Commission is examining the problem in depth and we share many of the concerns which have just been voiced. Broadly speaking, our position can be summarised as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">The living conditions of the bulk of the Chinese population have improved over the last twenty years as economic reform and liberalisation have given citizens a certain degree of economic and social freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately – and I do stress unfortunately – the same cannot be said of civil and political rights, and the human rights situation still falls considerably short of the commitments that China has entered into internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, back in 1996 we set up a bilateral dialogue with China, which provides a suitable forum for frank exchanges of views which I can bear witness to, having attended the last summit meeting between China and the European Union during the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of positive signs have emerged, such as the ratification of the UN Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights on 28 February and the signing, last November, of the outline agreement with the UN High Commission for Human Rights which, we hope, will now be implemented. We are clearly concerned, however, to see more tangible results on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main preoccupations are the same as yours, the continued persecution of political dissidents, the restrictions imposed on religious freedom, the application of the death penalty, the ratification of the UN covenants and their implementation, especially as regards political and civil rights, the treatment of ethnic minorities, arbitrary detention and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the United Nations is concerned, during the General Affairs Council meeting on 19 March, we decided to back the resolution on China tabled by the United States within the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, should that resolution be put to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agreed that the European Members of the Human Rights Commission would vote against any non-action motion that is tabled and would lobby to ensure the other members did the same. We feel that the very notion of non-action is totally opposed to the spirit of dialogue that we have tried to establish. We restated our position in Geneva on 29 March that we take the issue of the violation of human rights seriously wherever it occurs in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the question of co-sponsoring the resolution, we feel that the dialogue on human rights between the European Union and China is a privileged channel of communication working to improve the situation in the many spheres of concern to us. This is in fact the position which was endorsed by the Council, because we feel that it may have a positive impact.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards this year’s decision, namely that we will support a motion for a resolution which we do not co-sponsor, this does not mean to say that we rule out the possibility of returning to this mechanism at a later date. Dialogue is clearly an acceptable option only if it leads to progress on the ground. This is the position which was adopted in January on the EU-China dialogue and in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council meeting on 19 March. We will therefore support this resolution if it is put to the vote. We will not co-sponsor it since we think that direct dialogue still has potential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Bush’s decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol is an indication of his immense lack of responsibility regarding the future of humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Social Democrats also wish to strongly emphasise the fact that his attitude is, more than anything, irresponsible with regard to the developing countries. The USA’s own emissions of carbon dioxide account for around a quarter of those now produced around the world. The USA produces per head of population more than ten times the amount that would represent sustainable development if that were the average figure for everyone on earth. </p>
<p class="contents">The unilateral decision taken by the American President will tend to have an adverse effect on dialogue on either side of the Atlantic. To avoid any greater confrontation Bush should reverse his decision and embark on an active dialogue with the EU and other parties to the agreement on climate to ensure that we can together take adequate action to prevent climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in any event, the European Union must keep to its obligations. Europe, and presumably the United States also, today have all the technical facilities to ensure that emissions from industry can be reduced by a third from the levels for 1990 by the year 2010. Now enormous effort, greater than ever before, must be made in the energy production and traffic and transport sectors. There is no economic justification either for abandoning the aims and obligations of Kyoto. Sustainable development does not threaten economic prosperity, on the contrary, it promotes the rational use of natural resources and is an assurance of prosperity and jobs for generations to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Social Democrats in the European Parliament would like to make a strong plea in favour of strengthening the action to prevent climatic change, ensuring that it does not in any way weaken and that the Gothenburg summit will send a clear message regarding the wishes of Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Major American oil concerns, such as Exxon, Texaco and Chevron have helped Bush into the saddle. Their hand in this boycott is obvious. Bush is not only thick, he is as thick as two short planks.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must respond by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol before the summer of 2002. More than 20 countries have already done just that. The EU can and must ratify Kyoto, together with our Eastern European partners, Russia, Japan and countries such as Brazil. These 55 countries combined account for 55% of emissions. Even without the US, the Kyoto Protocol will be legally valid.</p>
<p class="contents">Worldwide negotiations have taken place for nearly ten years. The time has come for action and deeds. Europe must take the lead with energy savings and renewable energy. The new technologies – wind power, biomass and solar energy – will also yield economic benefits for Europe. Windmills are Denmark’s second export product.</p>
<p class="contents">European actions should persuade the developing countries to accept the climate objectives in time. Those same developing countries already made it clear at the failed climate summit in The Hague that they did not want nuclear energy, even if it were subsidised. European and American citizens can break Bush’s Kyoto boycott by boycotting fuel and diesel from Exxon, Texaco and Chevron.</p>
<p class="contents">The political pleas by Commissioner Wallström and the troika were to no avail. The majority of MEPs refuse, on principle, to sign such a boycott. But MEPs from Sweden and the Netherlands have in the past called for a boycott of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Citizens, show your anger and boycott Bush. Boycott Exxon, Texaco and Chevron. Capital punishment in the US may be ethically unjustified, but in the final analysis it is a matter for the American people. However, the demise of the climate which Bush is bringing about for the whole world is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And one of the objectives of this debate is to comply with the decisions made in Kyoto, which we consider to be an unavoidable objective for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union set an example when, in Kyoto, it asked for a greater reduction. It is true that later, in the discussion and debate, this reduction ended up lower than we all thought, given that the European Environment Agency said that instead of the 8% reduction from 1990, it should be 30%, if we wanted to go along the right path.</p>
<p class="contents">I, therefore, share in the two amendments tabled by my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that is, we have to tell the United States that it is immoral not only for it not to comply with the Kyoto protocol, but also for it to rely on developing countries, saying that only they need to reduce pollution. It is immoral, and we have to say so here loud and clear, because while the annual average CO2 emissions of a European are 10 tonnes, the average for an American is 24 tonnes and developing countries are way below the average.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to use this argument in the transatlantic relations that we have with the United States. We need to act unilaterally, not only on the basis that we need to look after the competitiveness of companies, but also on the basis that, from an economic point of view, the most reasonable thing to do is to support the Kyoto Protocol and take specific and clear measures aimed at implementing and ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that in Europe we can once again set an example if all the European countries ratify the Protocol, if they start to take unilateral measures and if they force the United States, in transatlantic relations, not to continue acting in such an immoral way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, there was palpable shock and disappointment at President Bush's recent announcement that the US will not cooperate with efforts to decrease carbon emissions in the endeavour to stave off the real threat of global warming. The US, with 5% of the world's population, produces 25% of the world's greenhouse gases. For President Bush to tell the EU delegation in Washington this week that he acknowledges both the problem and the need to find a solution is hollow rhetoric, when the US distances itself from the only solution on the table, and that a partial solution at best.</p>
<p class="contents">Kyoto is only the beginning of the way forward. What is President Bush afraid of? Many of the Kyoto signatories, including my own country, are failing to meet our agreed targets; but we must keep trying, we must keep talking – at Bonn next in June or July – and endeavour to reach the targets set for all the difficulties posed in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">The longer-term consequences will be far more difficult to resolve. It is not a question of the environment, or of employment. The promotion and protection of economic competitiveness is inextricably linked to the protection of the environment. Well-managed environments are themselves a source of wealth creation through agriculture, tourism and the maintenance of assimilative capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental protection is therefore a matter of enlightened self-interest for the future economic wellbeing and competitiveness of Europe, the US and the entire world. Viewed this way, environmental protection becomes part of a virtuous circle whereby a high-quality environment is sustained by wealth, which in turn is sustained by competition, which in turn requires a high-quality environment. Yes, environmental orthodoxies must be constantly scrutinised and re-evaluated to ensure that the protection required is proportionate and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">What Kyoto requires of us all is just that: proportionate and effective responses to the global threat of climate change. And developed countries and communities have a particular responsibility. Great sensitivity, tolerance and compassion must be employed when it is proposed to apply the environmental standards of the developed world to the economies and environments of emerging economies. We need to acknowledge the resilience of natural systems and their ability subsequently to recover once a plateau of economic stability has been reached. This has been the pattern over most of the developed world. Productivity and profitability are important prerequisites for environmental protection and enhancement. I acknowledge the need for sustained economic competitiveness to provide the very resources required for a high-quality environment.</p>
<p class="contents">President Bush, there does not need to be any contradiction between these two objectives. It is not jobs or the environment. Please come back on board Kyoto, and be sure you do not mortgage all our children's heritage. Environmental pollution, climate change, is no respecter of borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is with deep regret that the Europeans and all those who are sincere friends of the United States see a great country, which ought to be the leading light not just of economic progress but also of human civilisation in all fields, abandon one of the fundamental principles: the protection of the environment, of health and of the world that, in years to come, we will be leaving to our children and heirs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the current problem is not just deciding upon a position which, it appears, has been adopted by these bodies with a very wide majority, but how to move forwards. We must, in fact, ask ourselves whether a political position such as that we are adopting, a position putting pressure on the public, is enough in this matter, or whether more tangible action might not be required. Now we come to the question we are already, at this stage, putting to the Commission, to the competent bodies. Certainly, an initial recommendation has already been made: ratify Kyoto, in any case, and assume all our responsibilities before the world. But will all this be enough to make it clear that, without the cooperation of the United States, the battle on the world stage is a difficult one? As of today, therefore, I am posing a question. Will the European Union genuinely stand 100% firm on this issue, or, as I regret to say has happened on other occasions, for example, in certain matters such as the death penalty, will it put up a good fight and then fail to achieve the key objectives at the decisive moment? This, Mr President, is the question we wish to put to the representatives of the Commission today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore extremely odd that the country responsible for a good quarter of the earth’s total carbon dioxide emissions should not be contributing to the reduction of such emissions. It is dreadful and a big disappointment, but it is not exactly surprising. It was hardly by chance that President Clinton did not establish the Kyoto Protocol firmly in the American Senate.</p>
<p class="contents">Time after time, and most recently at last year’s Climate Conference in The Hague, the United States has shown its unwillingness to negotiate about the American life-style. Now, President Bush has spoken his mind and said openly that the United States does not intend to participate in the Kyoto process because the Protocol, as he puts it, excludes 80 per cent of the world and would seriously damage the American economy. It is <span class="italic">deeply</span> shocking to see the world’s largest democracy knowingly sacrifice the long-term interests of the majority of the earth’s population on the altar of its own greed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to make four brief points. First of all, I must strongly condemn the unfortunate unilateral decision rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, which warrants our criticism, announced by President Bush. Secondly, although this is a serious development, it comes as no surprise; the Union should have forearmed itself a long time ago with alternative strategies. Thirdly, we must not waver or hesitate over the need to implement the Kyoto Protocol, with or without the United States. My fourth and final point is that the European Union must now redouble its efforts and demonstrate effective leadership, both within the European Union, by fighting against the increase in emissions that we are seeing today in most of our fifteen Member States and beyond the Union, by ensuring that Kyoto is ratified by as many countries as possible so that it can enter into force before 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sea levels will rise; there will be more severe droughts and more brutal floods; islands, coastal regions and deltas will disappear; we will see famines and epidemics and entire species will become extinct. The poorest populations will be most affected. And this is not necessarily the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Parliament must take a stand on this issue and express, in the strongest terms, its deep indignation at the decision taken by President Bush to reject the Kyoto Protocol. At a time when populations are quite rightly apprehensive about the prospect of climate change, the consequences of which would be disastrous, the United States, the major consumer of energy in the world, has taken a decision which is totally irresponsible and dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I think that all honourable Members are aware of the fact that the United States has even gone so far as to authorise an oil company to drill for oil in an Alaskan nature reserve. This attitude of allegiance to the interests of multinational companies shows total contempt for both humans and nature. All nations must assume their responsibilities. I welcome the protests made by the European Union, other major countries and Member States. The United States, which signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, must be called to account.</p>
<p class="contents">We must reject any re-examination of the Kyoto commitments. We must ratify and apply the protocol even without the United States. Commissioner, as we know from past experience that a verbal protest will not be enough, in order to apply effective pressure it would be judicious to include environmental clauses in international commercial negotiations. It is the future of the planet and of our children that is at stake. I do not think it is employment which acts against the environment. Once again, it is the primacy of money that militates against humane and sustainable development, which is the undeniable ambition espoused by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For more than ten years, negotiations have been under way concerning measures to protect the climate. The United States has participated the whole time and privately forced compromises, especially on the part of us Europeans. Now that they are jumping ship, it is like throwing ten years of negotiations out of the window. It jeopardises the whole of the international negotiation system in the environmental sphere. President Bush states that the United States’s economy would be damaged. At the same time, we know that the United States consumes more than twice as much energy per produced unit as is on average the case in the EU. The potential for energy saving in the United States is enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened is deeply tragic. The United States’s action means that we Europeans bear that much heavier a responsibility for taking the lead in climate work, for the work must continue, with or without the United States. We must then hope that the United States’s political leadership will listen to reason, for positive cooperation on the part of the United States is crucial in the long run if we are to be able to stabilise the climate. We must not therefore stop at merely criticising and condemning the United States, because we at the same time need a dialogue if we are to succeed in changing President Bush’s decision in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the verbal clashes on this subject between the United States and the other industrial powers are hypocritical. The behaviour of America’s leaders is only the reflection of the behaviour of an entire social class which monopolises the means of production of the entire planet, in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere. Mr Bush is just doing the dirty work for large US corporations in the oil and coal industry. He is applying the philosophy of an economic order based on the quest for profit.</p>

<p class="contents">As you know, we took the initiative of condemning this rejection. Mr Prodi and Mr Persson wrote to President Bush on 14 March to voice our indignation. Mrs Wallström and our Council colleagues spent some of this week in the United States with Mrs Wittman and Mr Armitage, who are the competent persons in the American administration.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not going to settle for these contacts, and we have also decided that this troika will hold talks with Canada and will initiate talks in the coming weeks with Russia, Iran, China and Japan. We have decided to do everything within our power to keep the Kyoto process on track.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, the American administration has confirmed its unwillingness and hence its refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. It has given no indication of the content of the recently announced re-examination of its policies on climate change or the date on which this information will be made public. The problem is very serious. The only good news, if you can call it that, is that, up to now, nobody has challenged the current state of scientific knowledge on climate change, which is an achievement, and the United States has indicated that it will continue to be involved in future international negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wallström clearly pointed out to our American counterparts that abandoning the Protocol would be a mistake. To start from scratch would not only be a waste of time but would also risk breaking the fragile balance that the Protocol had succeeded in establishing between the industrialised world, which had greatly contributed to the problem, and developing countries whose emissions per inhabitant were far below those of industrialised nations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Union declared its intention to continue negotiations within the Kyoto framework, despite the fact that the United States had dropped out. The Protocol could come into effect if the European Union, the applicant countries, Russia and Japan ratified it. Like Mr de Roo, we believe that the impact of the Protocol will be lessened because of the absence of the biggest polluter on the planet, but we cannot, and we must not, wait for the Americans.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have clearly reaffirmed our commitment to ratify the Kyoto Protocol in 2002 at the latest and, to this end, preparations are under way. This requires us to adopt a consistent approach, which means continuing our efforts to combat climate change. The European programme on climate change that Mrs González mentioned is now in existence. It is under development. We are going to make every effort to move the Protocol forward. We will ratify it and we will ensure that we are consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">You can count on the Commission to continue to fulfil its role as the driving force in matters of climate change, which Mrs Isler-Béguin called for. We will also continue to ensure that the European Union is the driving force at an international level both in terms imparting our values to other countries and also in terms of our own implementation strategy. Like Mrs Myller, I am in no doubt that the two issues will feature on the agenda of the summit between the United States and Europe, which will take place in Gothenburg during the next European Council which, as you know, will be mainly devoted to the environment. This is therefore an important date for us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Government of Cyprus had said this, I would believe it, but others might not. But these are the words of the British police. I think that draws a line under the question of what happened. As to the political significance of what happened, Mr Tsiakourmas was a building contractor who went into the British base, which is close to a Turkish-Cypriot village, and collected Turkish labourers for building work. In other words, this was a man with contacts with both communities, which the Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot leaders wish to keep apart and at loggerheads. It was because he was in the delicate position of dealing with his Turkish counterparts in Cyprus that he became the target of this criminal abduction.</p>

We need only think of the Dreyfus case, we need only think of Flaubert’s trial, we need only think of Zola’s ‘J’accuse’ trial. Tsiakourmas is, of course, no Dreyfus, Zola or Flaubert. But, in his own small way, he represents the very same problem. Which is why I call on you and the Commission to evince an interest in his case. Let me assure you that, in fighting and claiming his freedom, Tsiakourmas is claiming freedom, peace and reconciliation for the two communities in Cyprus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question, of course, is where the illegal occupying regime in northern Cyprus finds the nerve to take such action, especially in an area under British sovereignty. Obviously, if the so-called international community wished to put an end to the occupying regime, it would have the means to do so. This comment applies even more so to the European Union, given that Turkey is a candidate country and Cyprus is already engaged in accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has the means to exert pressure and could use them. At the same time, however, the European Union has huge economic, political and military interests in Turkey and it is obviously these interests that dictate its conduct. Furthermore, it would appear that the very procedure to integrate Cyprus into the European Union is probably complicating the Cyprus question, rather than helping to resolve it. In all events, we call on the European Union and on the Government of the United Kingdom to, at least this once, let Turkey feel the sharp edge of its tongue and ensure that Mr Tsiakourmas is released unconditionally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not the time to confine ourselves to polite recommendations to Turkey, whose forces illegally abducted him from inside the British base at Dhekelia in Cyprus and have been holding him in prison ever since, despite the fact that he is seriously ill and his life is in danger.

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the abduction of Mr Tsiakourmas, the incursion of Turkish occupying forces on to neutral soil in Cyprus, the claim on Greek islands and Turkey’s constant threats that, if the Republic of Cyprus becomes a member of the European Union, Turkey will react violently, as the Minister of the Interior, Mr Cem, stated a few days ago, prove that Turkey saw the decision by the Helsinki Summit as an expression of weakness on the part of Europe. That is why, instead of falling into line with the terms laid down for it to become a member, it has become even more audacious. It is time for the European Union to prove that Turkey cannot pour scorn on our courtesy, tolerance and efforts to help it become a true democracy based on the rule of law before we accept it into the European family with impunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conspiracy of silence has been broken and it has come to light that Catholic priests and bishops are guilty of criminal acts against nuns in at least 23 countries. The report, which was published in the American periodical ‘National Catholic Reporter’, talks of rape, sexual abuse, contamination with AIDS, forced abortions and blackmail and persecution of anyone who has the courage to report these acts of violence to the officials in charge.</p>
<p class="contents">However much the Vatican official, Joachim Navarro Vals, has attempted to play down the issue or restrict it solely to Africa, sexual abuse and violation of the fundamental rights of women are a fact of life and, of course, neither bishops nor priests are above the law. That is precisely why my political group is calling for the perpetrators to be handed over to the authorities and for the judicial authorities in the 23 countries in which these crimes were committed to deal with all the cases of violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Holy See should release the five reports on the matter, strip those responsible of all official titles, work with the judicial authorities, restore the expelled nuns to their positions, give the victims the necessary protection and compensation and, above all, take measures to prevent similar situations from arising in the future and, of course, instruct priests in the fundamental rights of women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Highly placed generals were extremely alarmed about the sexual intimidation to which nuns were subjected in certain regions. One mother superior from a diocese where several nuns became pregnant by priests was unable to find a suitable solution. In another community, 20 nuns had to be dismissed because they had become pregnant, in many cases by priests.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, nuns have been harmed in various countries. When one sister became pregnant by a priest, she had to leave the community, whilst the priest involved could carry on with his calling. Is this social justice? The sister is being abandoned in a situation in which she has to raise the child as a single parent and is for the most part subject to considerable stigma in deplorable social circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Examples have been quoted of certain countries where they were obliged to become second and third wives in a family as a result of losing their social status in the local culture. The alternative, in order to survive, is to walk the streets as prostitutes and to expose themselves to the risks of HIV, if they have not already been infected by the priest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only does contraception give women throughout the world control over their own bodies, but condoms could also save the lives of tens of thousands of people in the African countries hit by AIDS. The Vatican opposes such measures. It is also trying to stop women who have been raped in Bosnia, for example, from having access to abortions. Against this background, it is <span class="italic">extremely</span> shocking to study the report showing how Catholic priests have committed acts of cruelty and actually raped nuns and other women. This is something the Vatican has known about since 1994, but it has tried to play down what has happened and silenced the women when they have tried to speak out or been forced to have abortions. A number of them have also reportedly been infected with AIDS. This is no isolated incident. It has happened in at least 23 countries, and there is only one word to summarise what has happened, and that – emphatically – is ‘disgraceful’. The Vatican must lose no time in punishing those responsible, apologise to the women affected, investigate properly what happened and publish the report in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, sexual abuse of women is too serious to be used for political ends and for placing religious communities, in this case the Catholic Church, in a bad light.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider rape and sexual abuse to be violations of fundamental human rights and of human dignity. We reject any form of aggression against women and are of the opinion that offenders need to be punished, irrespective of their profession. We are united in solidarity with the victims. Our group is expressing grave concern with regard to the sexual abuse committed by priests, medical doctors, politicians and others in positions of trust and moral authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Catholic community of faith and the Holy See have always rejected violence and sexual abuse, both on the basis of Christian values and of international treaties and obligations. Via its official representatives, the Holy See has acknowledged and condemned the actions, and has, in cooperation with the responsible bishops, superiors of religious orders and communities and other competent authorities, taken measures against the priests in question. This was done to support the victims and to prevent these eruptions of violence from being repeated. Sexual abuse by priests must be condemned and penalised without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not generalise. There are more than 404 000 priests and nearly 820 000 nuns worldwide. The fact that irresponsible members of the clergy have committed these acts of abuse, especially in developing countries where women often play a subordinate role culturally compared to men, does not mean that the majority of nuns and priests in the world are not dedicated: they are often the first to be self-effacing in the fight for peace and justice and against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group welcomes the open debate in this matter and we regret that the response to sexual abuse has hitherto been inadequate. We want an effective response to all incidents and expect churches and other responsible organisations to step up their efforts to do everything in their power to prevent this from happening in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows complete disregard for the victims and is nothing but inappropriate chicanery. In these cases of rape, which are reprehensible, the catholic nuns’ suffering was twofold: they suffered both as women and as nuns within a holy order. Their vocation to serve others was offended against, as was the God in whom they believe. The Catholic Church has also been offended by the reprehensible actions of some of its members. When reality is exaggerated, facts are distorted and attempts are made to attack not the rapists but the church to which the nuns belong, many nuns feel violated a second time, now by this grotesque act of political manipulation. In dealing with this matter, understanding and respect for religion are required. Clearly this is not the position of those tabling the motion.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal attacks those who have attacked the problem, betrays a complete ignorance or scorn for the organisation of the Catholic Church itself, which is not the centralised European superstate that many people consider it to be. It is profoundly decentralised, both its Diocesan College and in its numerous institutes and religious congregations, as well as in other areas. This resolution could have attacked those who have violated and betrayed the service of God. But no, in an instant it passes swiftly over these, these few bad examples, and rains blows down on the Church as a whole. It was the Church that discovered these cases, debated them and then dealt with them as soon the facts were known. The Church deserves our appreciation for this as well as for everything else it has done for the communities it helps. It certainly does not deserve this misguided attack. Furthermore, it was the Church that brought these cases to our attention, not the frenzied proponents of a paradoxical text that attacks the solution instead of the problem. I voted against the proposal. It is completely lacking in humanity and is nothing but a monument to cynicism and hypocrisy. I speak on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group and, particularly on behalf of the Irish delegation, who expressly asked me to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My heart goes out to the abused women within the Roman Catholic Church when I read about their plight. I therefore sincerely hope that this debate will help put an end to these wrongs for good. I assume that this is the intention of those submitting the resolution and that they are not being led by anti-religious feelings.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the resolution not only addresses the Vatican, it also appeals to all church authorities to act in line with Christian ethics. The individual’s responsibility should not disappear in the anonymity of large institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no mitigating circumstances for the behaviour of the African priests involved. Neither their young age, nor different cultural notions regarding celibacy could justify these acts of violence. Any Christian denomination based on the Bible knows that abuse of women cannot be covered by the cloak of charity. We dishonour the name of Christ if we deal with these issues in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint resolution calls for a judicial procedure to provide a full account of the events – and rightly so. Based on my Christian faith, I should like to give my unqualified support to this appeal.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the extent of this problem, we can only guess at the moment. The American magazine ‘National Catholic Reporter’ lists 23 countries where sexual abuse occurs. In any event, it is more than a marginal phenomenon. As long ago as 1994, there were reports of cases of abuse, but so far it has been unclear as to what action was taken to prevent violence against women. The Vatican must recognise the relevant issue and must give a clear account of the measures which are being taken to ban such practices in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to express my appreciation for the scrapping of recital H from the original resolution. If this had not been done, I would have had no option but to vote against the resolution. However much I denounce the distressing cases of abuse, these should not simply be associated with the Vatican’s policy on women’s reproductive rights. Bringing a pro-life approach to these issues into discredit in this way is inappropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But this resolution contains inaccuracies, distortions, lies and half-truths and so cannot be accepted. I believe this issue is too serious to be used as a party-political and ideological football. However, that is exactly what is happening. The Vatican has neither a global police force nor a global court to pursue these matters. But above all this is an issue for the state authorities. Of course, we support the Holy See in its efforts to combat these practices.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be clear, however, about one thing. As Mrs Malmström has stated quite openly, this resolution clearly aims to weaken the role of the Holy See in international organisations where it is used on behalf of the family, for the protection of life, and against sexual abuse. This is often not the case with the governments of many Member States. This resolution is hypocritical and unacceptable. I therefore consider it to be dangerous because this issue was all too often abused in the twentieth century by totalitarian powers in order to discredit the Church. We must not go down this path. The people of the Church who lend their support to other people do not deserve such defamation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, like to add the following. This sensitive and appalling issue came to light thanks to the openness of the Catholic press and to Catholic researchers who had drawn up a report. Eventually, the Catholic Church hierarchy reacted to, and condemned, these events. I also remember bishops, from the Netherlands for example, making statements.</p>
<p class="contents">So why are we rubbing salt into the wound of the Roman Catholic Church? As a Protestant, I must say that I am very surprised about this, to say the least. I read an interview in the Dutch press with one of the people who started the ball rolling and in which the background was explained. She says: “We are against the Pope visiting the European Parliament. We must make it more difficult in this way. Secondly, we would really like to give as good as we get with regard to all the Pope’s admonitions in the moral sphere.” If that is the background, there is so much false fire on the altar, to put it in Protestant terms, that it is absolutely impossible for me to back this resolution. I also think that those nuns who suffered in the course of these events are now also being abused politically, something about which I am ashamed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament cannot remain silent when faced with a situation which holds sway in a country with which the European Union has cooperated for so long. We owe it to ourselves to make it clear to General Musharraf that respect for human rights and democracy is what makes a policy of cooperation meaningful.

We also note that the Pakistani military junta is providing active support to the inhumane Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Following Commander Massud’s visit to the European Parliament, the Pakistani Embassy addressed the President of our Parliament with a plea for a negotiated solution in Afghanistan. We too call for a political solution to the Afghan conflict. We too realise that the sanctions against the Taliban regime could end up harming the population and could bring about streams of refugees. We value Pakistan’s condemnation of the destruction of the cultural heritage by the Taliban, but we expect more. The Pakistani Government should put an end to its support for the Taliban regime and the fundamentalist groups. It has to help Pakistan on its way to the rule of law and strive towards a sustainable peace in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The police arrested the very people who fight for solidarity and justice and, instead of arresting activists who have gone underground, they arrest their family members. Among those arrested was Nasrullah Khan, the leader of the democratic renewal movement.</p>
<p class="contents">The behaviour of the military regime in Pakistan is absolutely unacceptable. Credence can no longer be given to the reassurances and declarations of intention given by its ruler. Pakistan must fulfil its obligations as a member of the United Nations. These obligations include securing freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. The position of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is that it is no longer enough for the international community simply to complain. We call on the Commission to exert all its political clout and fight for the early release of the prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">The leader of the military regime, General Musharraf, is responsible for continuing to obstruct a return to democracy and humanity. The stability of the ruler of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan both at home and abroad is just for show. It will only be for real when the ruling of the Supreme Court to allow free national elections is implemented. The deadlines for these elections to take place must be adhered to. Independent parties must be allowed to field candidates. They must stop being exposed to constant pressure. These elections must take place under the supervision of international observers.</p>
<p class="contents">In the sphere of human rights, the European Union must be active in Pakistan and must involve people who often risk life and limb in campaigning on behalf of human rights issues, namely the NGOs. We are obliged to do this. This would be our contribution to a great national day in Pakistan. Commissioner, we hope we will succeed.</p>

There is nothing left of democracy, and the prospects are gloomy. The announcement of elections appears to be no more than a diversion to mislead the international community. Active party members of the opposition are being apprehended. Election campaigns have been rendered impossible, and the independence of the judiciary has been compromised.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the World Bank is agonising over economic reform in Pakistan, the military regime is wrecking democracy. No democracy means no stability, and no stability means no economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Pakistan is becoming increasingly isolated on the world stage. The financial and military support granted by the military regime to the Taliban barbarians in Afghanistan is repugnant. According to the Afghan opposition leader, who is on a visit here today, only political reform in Pakistan can lead to the downfall of the Muslim extremists in the neighbouring country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union was right to halt the negotiations with Pakistan. As long as democracy has not been fully re-established, there cannot be any hope of a cooperation agreement. The political dialogue can only be continued on an ad hoc basis and, in this connection, the regime has to be put under great pressure to hold fair elections soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Pakistani population must not be left in the lurch. European development aid must remain focused on education and other social programmes. Aid for elections can only be granted if it contributes to a fair course of events. The chance of that happening appears extremely remote for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">Pakistan is an important country in the region but, unfortunately, its Government appears to alternate between corrupt regimes and military juntas. The population must be freed from this. It deserves sunnier prospects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to this President, Jews and black people have to be arrested, gaoled and exiled. End of quote.</p>
<p class="contents">You probably wonder which country this report is about, and the timeframe in which it is set. After all, we are only too aware of the historical examples. Replace Jews and blacks by homosexual men and women, and you will realise that I am referring to the very recent statements by the President of Namibia where it appears, not for the first time, that a witch-hunt is being launched. Namibia’s President made his appeal to cleanse his country, as he said, of homosexuals, on 19 March. Despite numerous protests, both from Namibia and elsewhere, he repeated this appeal earlier this week. It is thus not a slip of the tongue but a deliberate campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">On previous occasions, the anti-homosexual rhetoric uttered by the Namibian President could be laughed off. It seemed to be a personal hobbyhorse of a frightened man who was desperate to hold on to traditional village life. The President’s statements conjure up an image of a community which seems to be losing the battle against sexual promiscuity. However, the criminalisation of homosexuals, mixed in with a generous portion of xenophobia, and the call on Namibian women to know their place, do nothing to address the problem. On the contrary, exploiting the fear of AIDS in this manner is playing with fire. Straightforward advice and the distribution of condoms would be a better solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Namibia’s anti-homosexual campaign forms a threat, not only to the physical well-being of the potential victims, but also to democracy, the rule of law and human rights. Amnesty International has declared that it considers people who are gaoled on the grounds of their sexual preference or for exercising their right to freedom of expression and assembly to be prisoners of conscience. Namibia must be reminded of its international obligations, which signify that human rights apply to everyone and are universal and indivisible. It is crucial, therefore, for the European Union to ask Namibia, in no uncertain terms, to halt this witch-hunt. Let Namibia follow the lead of its neighbour, South Africa, where the rights of homosexuals are explicitly guaranteed in the constitution. Surely, a country which has fought for its own freedom and against racial discrimination and apartheid cannot embrace sexual discrimination and apartheid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sexual orientation towards people of the same sex is of all times and all cultures. Discrimination against, and persecution of, people with this orientation who openly acknowledge it are no longer of all times and all cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, there is a steady decrease in discrimination in a large number of countries. Incitement to exclude, and use violence against, people of this orientation is increasingly becoming less acceptable. A good example is South Africa. After the apartheid regime was abolished, a clause was included in the constitution which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument used by the Namibian President that homosexuality is a Western phenomenon, an aberration of the West, is a nonsense argument. He only needs to look at his South African neighbours, something which, in fact, his colleagues Mr Mugabe and Mr Museveni should also do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the year 2001. Mr Lagendijk was right to point out that, unfortunately, Namibia is not the only African country which is taking things to such extremes. President Mugabe of Zimbabwe terms homosexuals and lesbians, in his own words: ‘animals which have to be exterminated’. His henchmen will take care of the rest.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, unacceptable that people should be discriminated against simply on the basis of their sexual preference. However, I appreciate how very delicate and difficult this debate is. In Africa, I found out that many people consider homosexuality as something which goes against their culture. Respect for culture, however, comes up against its own boundaries when fundamental human rights are at risk. Homophobic actions, largely orchestrated by the Government, must be unequivocally condemned. However, this should not be all that is done.</p>
<p class="contents">In the spirit of the new Cotonou Agreement, I believe that the persecution of homosexuals should be taken into consideration in the assessment of our cooperation with developing countries. After all, the persecution of homosexuals is often not the only violation of human rights in the countries concerned. Despite their elevated ideals, certain SADEC countries have recently been repeatedly showing their less attractive sides. It is high time that a fresh wind blew through Windhoek and that the homosexual wall in a number of frontline states was razed to the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has emerged that Mr Tsiakourmas was abducted on the sovereign territory of a British base in Dhekalia. The British Government raised the issue on a number of occasions both with the leader of the Turkish Cypriot community and with the authorities in Ankara. The General Affairs Council is going to look into this case when it meets next Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we in the Commission are still keeping a watchful eye on developments in the situation from our delegation office in Nicosia. According to our information, the proceedings which were opened against Mr Tsiakourmas resumed this week in Famagusta and a verdict is expected shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Katiforis, I think that this case, like many others, must be seen in the context of the political situation in Cyprus. We are taking every opportunity to contact the parties involved in order, as you know, to try to promote a political solution to the partitioning of the island. As regards the Turkish side, which Mr MacCormick and Mr Alyssandrakis mentioned, you can rest assured that this topic is amongst those we will be dealing with within the framework of the political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey, which was strengthened by the European Council in Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to the second item under the heading of human rights, which is your motion for a resolution on violence against nuns, we feel that the case of the Catholic nuns constitutes a serious violation of the fundamental rights of women and is a dreadful example of violence against them. As those who have taken the floor know, the European Union is firmly committed to combating violence against women. In all the institutions we are firmly committed to upholding the principles contained in the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and, in particular, to working to ensure that the commitments entered into in Beijing not very long ago during the fourth women’s conference are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as human rights in Pakistan are concerned, the Commission shares the view of the honourable Members who tabled resolutions on this subject when they state that the recent arrests of so-called political activists belonging to the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy are a major concern. During talks with the Pakistani Government last November, the EU troika called on the administration to lift restrictions on the activities of political parties, in particular, the ban on public demonstrations. Political parties cannot and must not be excluded from political life in Pakistan any more than elsewhere, since it is clear they are called upon to play an important role in the country’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">We are expecting to see tangible progress in the restoration of representative democracy at all levels, beginning with the holding of elections in provincial and national assemblies on the basis of a clear and credible timetable. The Pakistani authorities have given a firm commitment to the EU troika that it will respect the timeframe, which was established by the Supreme Court, of three years following the military coup until the organisation of these elections. Although the Government has confirmed that the political parties will be authorised to take part in provincial and national elections, as a number of you have said, it is clear that only the rapid lifting of the ban on public demonstrations will boost confidence in the process to restore democracy in Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the last item is concerned, which is the situation of homosexuals in Namibia, like the authors of this resolution, we were amazed and concerned to read the recent statement on homosexuality which was given by the Namibian President, Sam Nujoma, calling for the persecution of people identified as homosexuals.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always upheld the position that all individuals are entitled to benefit from human rights and fundamental freedoms. We believe that all nations must protect and promote these rights and actively contribute to abolishing any form of discrimination on grounds of race, gender, political opinion, religious beliefs and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Our position also reflects the position which was publicly adopted by the Government of the Republic of Namibia, evidence of which can be found in its constitution and in all the international conventions on human rights which this country has ratified. As a result, we are in favour of any overtures made to the Namibian authorities to try to clarify this matter and to express the wish that these recent statements do not constitute a repudiation of Namibia’s existing constitutional provisions, which ban such discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament did so because it approves and welcomes the conclusion of a global agreement, and I think it is time that the European Union concluded a decent agreement with Mexico, not only on trade issues but also in the fields of cooperation and, most importantly, political concertation. We have maintained good relations with all the non-governmental organisations in Mexico, which is an ally of ours. Obviously, we are paying close attention, as we have always done, to developments in the situation in Chiapas and last year, as chairman of Parliament’s delegation to Central America and Mexico, I myself led a European Parliament delegation that visited Chiapas. We had also hoped to hold a meeting with representatives of the Zapatista movement, which we were not able to do. I wanted to hold this meeting because I feel that, one of the basic principles of this Parliament is to hold dialogue with everyone and, whilst respecting national sovereignty, making our contribution to a positive solution and to an end to disputes. It is in this context that we welcome first of all the attitude of President Fox of Mexico and the way in which he has made himself available. Secondly, I welcome the correctness, the action and the willingness to enter into dialogue demonstrated by the Zapatista movement in the person of Commander Ester in the Mexican Congress. What I particularly want to say for the moment is that we are encouraging and supporting this dialogue, because dialogue undertaken in accordance with the rules of democracy is the only instrument that can help to find a solution to problems. I will say once again that we respect the sovereignty of the Mexican people and that our message is one of support for this dialogue. I shall conclude by saying, with an appeal that I think is important, that talks must continue to persuade the Mexican Congress to support the law on indigenous peoples reached in the San Andrés Agreements. Lastly, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to say that only yesterday, the delegation which I chair was bound, after deliberation by the Conference of Presidents, to issue an opinion on a possible visit to this Parliament by representatives of the Zapatista movement. Unanimous approval was given, with all the main political groups present, to this Parliament, through its delegation and as a follow-up to what it did last year, restating its willingness to enter into dialogue within the rules of procedure of this Parliament, with all organisations, including the Zapatista movement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The other day I was in the sitting of the Mexican Congress, an historic sitting – and I should point out that it was also brought about by the votes of a sister group of ours, The Green Ecologist party of Mexico – and a vote that gave rise to a calm, respectful and I would say historical dialogue which demonstrated the maturity of the Mexican people and legislators and also the maturity of the Zapatista movement, which offered peace for peace. This agreement opens the way for dialogue and understanding. It was a great day for Mexico, for the indigenous people within and outside Mexico, and for the establishment of a culture of dialogue, understanding and cooperation between all the political and social forces as a means of solving conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group would also like to make it clear, in line with what was expressed yesterday in the delegation, that we have no hesitations about the indigenous Zapatista movement being present in this House. And it is possible that some of our colleagues in Parliament will throw up their hands in horror, and even say that we need to keep up appearances, and that they are against hooded men and women appearing in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us see if we can end the great hypocrisy that prevails in international politics, because the same people who go to see Mr Putin, or who sing songs to the Chinese after they have invaded Tibet, cannot throw up their hands in horror. It is not a case of discussing appearances or whether or not they wear hoods. There is no greater hood than that which has been imposed on a people, on the indigenous people in and outside Mexico. They have had more than a hood imposed on them. Millions of people and human beings have been under a yoke of repression, which we are now going to begin to see lifted. Finally they are going to have their rights and they are being recognised in the constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was the reason why last week three MEPs, Mr Sami Naïr, Mr Gorka Knörr and I were present in Mexico to support this event by our presence.</p>
<p class="contents">This joint resolution that we are putting forward is positive, important, encouraging and also represents support for the actions of President Fox and the ZNLA. We also think that it goes in the direction of the agreement between the European Union and Mexico to promote a series of greater democratic freedoms and support for the political culture in Mexico, which is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore think that this resolution would be improved if two amendments that we propose were accepted: on the one hand, recognising that it is important that the Members from the ZNLA appear in Congress and, on the other hand, inviting representatives of the Zapatista movement to come here, through the delegation for relations with Central America, or also through other committees, such as the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy or the Committee on Development and Cooperation, according to our customs, and to explain their points of view. In that way we can support a great hope for Mexico and Latin America. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that we must congratulate President Fox, his political group and all the Mexican political forces that have been capable of understanding that there needs to be direct understanding with minorities because democracy requires representatives and direct spokespeople and, at the same time, the acceptance of a culture of diversity, something that Europe is defending and which is part of our identity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say in this vein that I think that the climate of dialogue that has been created is one that Europe should generously join in with and, in this respect, I think it is right and proper that whoever necessary should be received, that the Zapatistas should be received, that they should be welcomed in Europe and that we should offer them our hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Now what I would not like at all would be for us to understand that we are creating a parallel relationship. I think that the democratic openness that the Mexican Government and the Assembly have shown by receiving the Zapatistas in their symbolic building, Parliament, is an institutional triumph and we should therefore understand that the Zapatistas should also be included with the invitation that has already been extended to President Fox. This is because we consider that we are in favour of strengthening institutions – because without strong institutions there is no democracy – and, at the same time, of the presence of all minorities, groups and associations who wish to knock on our door to ask for our help, to tell us about their specific characteristics and diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore trust that living together peacefully will now become the norm for social behaviour, and also that there will be standardisation in Mexican political life.</p>
<p class="contents">We must agree that the recent meeting between the indigenous communities and the Mexican politicians is a good example to follow in this political phase which began in July 2000, in which progress is being made, overcoming old contradictions.</p>
<p class="contents">On these shores, on the old continent of Europe, many of us are pleased to see this political change that is taking place in Mexico in terms of recognising this minority, which has been historically marginalised. This attitude means that we should thank President Fox and his Government, as well as the Zapatistas and obviously the indigenous communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The new Mexican Government and the Zapatista National Liberation Army have confirmed that they are committed to finding a political solution and we believe, as you do, that they have opened up the way to finding a peaceful solution to this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we obviously welcome the fact that the new global agreement which was signed by the European Union and Mexico has recently come into force. As Mr Seguro reiterated, this agreement will enable us to continue to support the process that has recently been initiated in Mexico. As you know, this agreement goes well beyond objectives that are related purely to trade and cooperation. This agreement includes a clause entitled ‘human rights’, which now stands at the heart of EU-Mexico relations, and also includes a clause on respect for commitments, which enables us to take into consideration developments in the human rights situation in Mexico and its states. In addition, this agreement puts in place a mechanism to allow the parties to take action if the objectives set out contractually are breached.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to cooperation on human rights, democracy and the proper management of public affairs, this agreement also provides us with a legal framework for cooperation in cultural matters, education and training, and which pays particular attention, as is the case given Mexico’s needs, to the most disadvantaged sections of society.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a framework of regional cooperation and, last of all and most importantly, we have a spotlight on social affairs and poverty, which includes vulnerable groups such as the indigenous population, whilst taking into account the need to respect the fundamental rights of these indigenous Mexican people as distinct groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Out in Mexico, in order to apply all this in practice, and in line with the Country Strategy Paper for Mexico, which has now been adopted, we are working on an important project to develop the Lacandonia forest, in the state of Chiapas, and the practical aim of this project is both to work with the communities involved, and to seek to enlighten them on the concept of sustainable development, that is, by combining both action to sustain the environment and social action. This is an example of the practical measures we are taking at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They had been captured on 27 March last together with a further seven westerners and a Somali by the warlord Musse Sudi Yalahow. Of course, we are reassured by their release, but it does not diminish our concern at the failure to respect human rights and our condemnation of the continued acts of violence and banditry perpetrated by the armed militia in Somalia. It is vital that the temporary Somali Government does everything possible to initiate constructive dialogue working towards peace, stability and national reconciliation with all the parties involved, Somali community leaders and the authorities of Somaliland and Puntland. We all need to renounce the use of arms in order to be able to address the country's serious political, social and economic problems, so that all the parties tackle the issues of the management of aid, education, health and the economy together.</p>
<p class="contents">The donor countries must all step up humanitarian aid and cooperation activities, ensure that the embargo on arms is fully respected and require all the parties concerned to cooperate to re-establish peace. The European Union, in particular, must provide all the financial and technical assistance necessary to guarantee the success of the peace initiative of the Intergovernmental Development Authority and Djibouti, but, in particular, it must, as it did in the case of the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, undertake a coherent political initiative and speak with one voice to promote dialogue and negotiation to resolve the country's most urgent problems. Civil society, the local communities and the non-governmental organisations, which are fighting for national reconciliation and peace, must be supported. We must disband the armed groups which have caused the death of at least 20 civilians in recent weeks and step up mine-clearance operations. We must also show our complete solidarity with and support for the organisation "Médecins sans frontières", which, as I said, was attacked on 27 March last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When banditry or acts of war – I am not sure how to distinguish between them in this case – afflict missionaries, even those working for peace and charity, which these Westerners are, and when these become bargaining chips for the warmongers, civilian populations are using this type of violent action to make the most desperate appeal for help to the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">What sort of situation can this anonymous mass of people be in, if even those who are helping them are harmed in this way? What can be the cause of their complaints?

<p class="contents">The hostages have now all been released, but this appeal must not be allowed to fade away and we must give the most effective and committed reply in response. In other words, we must take immediate action to ensure that humanitarian workers can work in safety in Somalia, this long-suffering country, and provide a long-term policy of support to democracy and human rights against a background of national reconciliation.

I believe that this is above all an act of cowardice, of barbarism, which is unacceptable. The message that should have been given when the hostages were taken must remain exactly the same one now. Therefore, Mr President, we must continue to give our solidarity, with the same conviction, to all those working behind the scenes, to all the NGOs which are easy targets for one simple reason – and that is because they often work in a non-partisan manner. Their members bring relief to all those in need, regardless of their political beliefs, and I think that this is what makes them extremely easy targets –vulnerable targets. We must therefore continue to give them our unwavering support.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, Mr President, I believe that we must appoint a permanent representative for this affair who can monitor the situation in Somalia, as we did during the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Initial progress has been made with the appointment of the interim democratic Government, a Government that is recognised in the international courts and which has managed to quell the unrest throughout the region. I believe that we must now go further by also forcing this Government to take its place around the negotiating table with all the parties, all the political parties, involved in this conflict. Most importantly, we, be it the European Union, the UN or the Organisation for African Unity (OAU), must ensure that there is a total weapons embargo and that this embargo is strictly complied with. We must condemn in the strongest possible terms any supply of illegal weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">Somalia is unfortunately experiencing a period of great instability due to all the fighting between various factions, which has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It is the people who are paying the price. Violence is bringing about famine, famine brings about wars, and wars are bringing about disease, against a background of general indifference. We must send an equally powerful message. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, there was no credit to be gained. Today, Somalia is a fragmented country ruled by a fragmented Government. The warlords are those who now wield power. The Arta peace talks brought renewed hope. A national transitional Government was installed, but it struggled to establish any authority. The European Union – and I believe Mr Sylla is right – has no choice but to give its emphatic support to this Government, without, however, misjudging the reality in Somalia. A constructive dialogue between the Government and the other leading figures is the only realistic solution. The Governments of Somaliland and Puntland must also be involved in this, and third countries, such as Ethiopia, must be warned against disturbing the peace process in any way. To be able to play a leading role, the Union must, in my opinion, appoint a special envoy for Somalia as a matter of urgency, just as it has now already done in the cases of Ethiopia and Eritrea. In fact, as far as I am concerned, this could be one and the same person. Now that there is at long last a prospect of sustainable peace between Eritrea and Ethiopia, we must avoid an unstable Somalia at all costs. We must employ all available means to stop the balkanisation of Somalia, and the Union can play an important role in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having clarified this issue, we are relieved to have learnt, as is Mrs Ghilardotti, that the two remaining hostages have been released. Nevertheless, we believe that these kidnappings highlight the need to bring an end to the violent tensions in central and southern Somalia, as each of the previous speakers have also stressed. You may rely on the Commission to take prompt action in offering aid to help to rebuild the country in every aspect, and God knows that this needs to be done. We are doing this and shall continue to do this in close collaboration with all the other parties involved, whilst making use of aid coordination by the Somalia Aid Coordination Body, which also includes United Nations agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has granted substantial amounts of humanitarian aid for rehabilitation to Somalia. The aid receives the full support of all the political authorities of the European Union, and the troika mission that the European Union recently sent to Somalia enabled us to witness the extent to which Commission aid is both indispensable and appreciated in the regions that were visited. We have decided to continue to support rehabilitation in all the areas of Somalia where peace has more or less been established, and, in particular, Somaliland and Puntland, by applying the approach that was adopted and which is known as ‘dividends of peace’. At the same time, we are supporting the transitional government in its efforts to establish an environment of peace and security in the area of the country that is still affected by the conflict and where there are no administrative structures. There are regions in Somalia where rehabilitation is not possible under the current circumstances, and in these regions, we shall continue to provide humanitarian aid in the form of ECHO, which is working with the NGOs and United Nations agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has adopted a policy, in particular in the statement made on 8 September 2000, and this policy, I would reiterate, urges the transitional Government to enter into immediate dialogue with the current authorities – I mentioned Somaliland and Puntland earlier – in order to avoid losing the momentum created by the Arta process, in line with the resolutions made at the Summit of East African Heads of State. We would also stress the importance of including all those who did not take part in the Arta conference in this process of national reconciliation, with a view to trying to re-establish national unity.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, and I would reiterate this as far as we are concerned, we shall not support any attempt, from any quarter, which seeks to establish the authority of a government in Somalia through the use of force and which would threaten the situation of peace and stability, albeit fragile, but real nonetheless, that has been attained and which is present in various regions of Somalia. We cannot accept a peace process that leads to further conflict in regions where peace has been established with the active support of the international community, and on this issue, we support the speakers who have called for this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although the initiative to deal with this issue in Parliament came from the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, the work that is being presented to you today is the fruit of the work of many, including that of my colleagues, members of the Committee on Fisheries in the European Parliament, who worked very hard with me, and who finally adopted this report unanimously. There was also the hearing with experts in September, the invaluable contributions that I received from officials from the Directorate-General for Employment and Social Affairs and the European Parliament Directorate-General on Research and also the contributions made by the Advisory Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone agreed on describing the job of fisherman (270 000 in the European Union) as a very dangerous profession, and also largely on the analysis of the reasons why fisheries has an accident rate that is up to 25 times higher than other economic sectors, and that one fisherman in seven in the European Union is involved in an occupational accident each year. This very high rate is due to a combination of very different causes: bad weather, long, very intense working days, payment systems, such as the so-called ‘catch-share payment’, which are not very comparable, a lack of collective negotiation, difficult working conditions, bad living conditions on board, isolation, separation from families and from the social environment, the remoteness of fishing grounds, the age of the fleet, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I reject the sceptical position and fatalistic view of those who think that fishing accidents are inevitable and that the victims of them are a price we have to pay to the sea. I think that we need to look for the causes of these accidents and deal with them. We need to make safety a priority. We have unacceptable accident rates and we need to step up controls, raise awareness among ship owners and fishermen and, if necessary, encourage legislative changes in order to reduce them. We need to consider the social and labour conditions of seafarers and improve their working conditions, as they endure irregular rest times and working patterns based on working days of more than 14 hours.</p>
<p class="contents">This sector needs to be given a right to constant weekly and daily rest and, if necessary, the public authorities should intervene in order to impose what is the fundamental right of any worker. These hard working conditions mean, for example, that young people do not want to join the industry, which prevents the new generation from taking over.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to establish social dialogue in the sector, at European level, in order to reach collective agreements incorporating these issues of safety at work, consult more with the sector, provide those working in fisheries with social protection similar to that of other workers and develop a culture of safety among employers and workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union does not even have statistical data; only five countries provide figures and they are not comparable. This issue should be taken into account when launching the third phase of the ‘European statistics on accidents at work’ project so that the Community can have reliable and complete data, harmonised at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has always thought that in this House we should talk not only about issues associated with fishing resources, but also about the human problems that affect seafarers. Therefore, my report asks that the conclusions reached should be included in the regulations on the reform of the CFP, so that the triangle made up of legislation, training and social dialogue can be included. I also urge the Member States who have not yet done so to ratify the international conventions and improve the Community directives which at this moment in time do not cover up to 90% of the fleet. I also point out in my report that flags of convenience do not provide work or safety guarantees to their crews, which entails serious risks for fishermen working on board these vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report about an issue that has not been dealt with so far. It is the first of these reports and will possibly be followed by second and third reports on accidents in fisheries. I hope that, as it is the first one, you will look tolerantly upon its defects and support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">‘Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report. It is a very important initiative, because safety is a subject of great importance to the fisheries sector as a whole. Mrs Miguélez Ramos says that each year worldwide a great number of accidents take place and many are fatal. In the European Union alone more than 2 000 accidents occur every year. It will be impossible to decrease this number to zero due to the special features of the sector, but at least we should try and decrease the number of accidents as much as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This could be accomplished by improving some preconditions: first of all, better control on working conditions and safety on the fishing vessels that operate in the waters of the European Union. Furthermore, it is important to improve harmonisation and coordination between Member States as a whole. Regular controls on safety and working conditions should take place on all EU fishing vessels regardless of whether they are small, large, old or new. Besides this, further awareness regarding safety in the fisheries sector is necessary. Information campaigns and education are important tools to achieve this. Taking into account the increasing difficulties experienced throughout the EU in attracting young people for jobs at sea, the aspects of safety and working conditions should be given full attention. It is highly necessary to create a safety culture in this sector, so that all the interested parties know about the situation, which is very special, and respect their responsibilities. I, Albert Jan Maat, hope that this initiative report will be integrated in the discussion about the Green Paper and in the proposals for the new fisheries policy after 2002.'</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

History, chronicles and the literature of all maritime and fishing nations are full of references to acts of heroism, to suffering, to tragedies and shipwrecks at sea involving both small and large fishing boats.</p>
<p class="contents">Fishing communities keep alive the memories of tragic events, which they pass on from generation to generation. Today, fortunately, modern technology can substantially reduce the danger, the uncomfortable conditions, accidents and shipwrecks. We now have the means to act, as long as there is the desire to act in this field. Mrs Miguélez Ramos’s report is one of the most useful, appropriate, intelligent and well-drafted own-initiative reports that I have had the task of reading and studying amongst the many own-initiative reports that abound in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not an empty rhetorical exercise. It is an exemplary text and the rapporteur deserves our utmost praise and gratitude. I therefore support not only her diagnosis, but also all the proposals, recommendations, encouragement, suggested measures and warnings contained in the report and I fully agree with its motives. If the Commission and the Council give a favourable welcome to the content of the report and put it into practice, in a few years we will have fewer accidents, fewer deaths, fewer shipwrecks and less risk at sea. We will not, of course, be able to eliminate risk entirely, but the accident rate will be greatly reduced, fishing will take on a more human face and its workers will be given more dignity.

<p class="contents">Protection of resources is a priority objective of the CFP, which can under no circumstances be put before any measure that promotes the safety of fishermen, because this is a fundamentally false approach. There are many measures for maintaining and even reducing the fishing effort, while at the same time enabling living and safety conditions for crews to be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that we are debating today, like all those that have been drawn up regarding safety, shows that the fact the fleet is so old is the main cause both of accidents on board and of sinking, and that sinking often has very serious consequences. The Commission’s plan to reserve the structural measures for the fleet almost exclusively for destroying it, while the surviving fleet is condemned to sail under increasingly precarious conditions, is therefore ridiculous. The only thing that is unfortunately achieved through this policy is that the Community fleet features more strongly in terms of accidents than in terms of savings.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, there is no point in having a battery of safety standards if it is not required that they are complied with. This is doubly concerning because the fact that this compliance has to be monitored and required makes us wonder what perception the sector has of its own safety. The last FAO report on the world state of fisheries and aquaculture says that a safe working environment is not something that can be imposed easily and that measures for improving safety can only be effective if there is the will to put them into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to remember the responsibility that we all have as politicians, governments and fishermen, to end the fatalism that seems to surround this sector, a responsibility that cannot of course be escaped by the Commission or its narrow view on the modernisation of the fleet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would reiterate that, according to the International Labour Organisation, 24 000 sea fishermen die every year throughout the world – we do not, admittedly, have a global responsibility – as a result of accidents at sea. As a result of this report and also because of the timetable set out by the new fishing policy, we now have the opportunity to include this point in the Green Paper and we will later be able to include it in the common fisheries policy. This has been mentioned by numerous speakers and I think and hope that the Commission will include it. Since we obviously have no commitment to achieve specific results, we cannot do this, but we do have a commitment to resources in this matter, and we can make use of many of them. For example, I am thinking of direct legislation in the area of fishermen’s safety and safety at work, ship and equipment design or introducing rules for managing resources, which may have, and can have, implications for fishermen’s safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also urge ship-owners to make use of technological developments. We must always be at hand to help Member States and the fisheries sector to include these requirements in both initial and in on-going vocational training.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I shall conclude by repeating the simple terms that Mrs Miguélez Ramos suggested, that is, the safety culture – it should be used to the maximum. In this sector, there is a tradition of fatalism, which is related to the natural elements. We must fight against this tradition, in the name of the safety culture, because there is no reason why, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, we cannot reduce the number of accidents at sea and the number of deaths amongst our fishermen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, fishing is an activity which takes place in a naturally hostile environment, and is clearly associated with risk-taking. Risks are inherent in almost every decision made by a skipper or individual fishermen: on when and where to go fishing, what gear to use, when and where to land the catch, and so on. The level of marine accidents is unacceptably high. In the UK, for example, the fatality rate among fishermen is 20 times higher than that for workers in the manufacturing industry. Fishermen work in an unpredictable environment and are confronted with daily challenges from bad weather, fires on board, loss of power, poor vessel construction, poor communications and sometimes out-of-date navigation equipment. Casualties at sea have, unfortunately, become an integral part of the fishing profession. But the accident toll could undoubtedly be reduced if the fishing industry and individual fishermen, national authorities, the EU and international organisations faced this vital issue with enough thought, consideration, political will and economic means. I welcome this initiative, I congratulate the rapporteur and I hope that the Commission will follow up the recommendations in this report with positive action to improve safety and to reduce the number of accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that safety be one of the key priorities in the forthcoming review of the CFP. It is essential that we do not create a management regime which forces fishermen to go to sea when the weather is bad, for example, in complying with days-at-sea restrictions or attempting to land fish in a designated port cut off by bad weather. High prices in periods of bad weather may also drive fishermen working under quota systems out on risky fishing trips, which may be the only way to obtain the best prices for what they land against their quotas. Such risks are preventable if safety forms an integral part of fisheries management.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the recent developments in Scotland, where changes in fishermen's safety training mean that an age exemption for older catchers will be a thing of the past and that basic sea survival, first aid and survival training will soon be mandatory for all fishermen.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, although a gradual ban on vessels more than 20 years old can be supported, the latter part of paragraph 4 in the report says, and I quote: ". . . except for those proven to be in perfect condition". It would be better if that section read: ". . . except for those that have passed annual safety tests". It is more practical to use that language than to open up a variable definition of perfect conditions. I therefore urge Members to support Amendment No 6. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When you read the frightening statistics at the beginning of her report which indicate that some 24 000 fishermen die each year throughout the world, the huge risks involved in working in this industry become apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">This report calls for some radical proposals such as the call to introduce a gradual ban on vessels of 20 years of age or over, which my colleague Mr Hudghton has just mentioned, except where they have passed stringent annual safety checks. I support this proposition. Indeed such a policy might encourage participation in scrap-and-build programmes amongst those Member States which have traditionally refused to take advantage of cofinancing for such schemes, and the UK is a case in point. The UK fleet is now approaching an average age of 30 years and our fishermen are being forced to put to sea in vessels which are becoming increasingly risky and accident prone.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to raise a couple of additional external factors which are not covered by the report but which the Commission may wish to consider. Too often recently, we have seen lives lost when fishing vessels engaged in a trawl have snagged their gear on undersea cables and other foreign objects on the seabed. There must be much more stringent regulation concerning the laying of undersea power and telecommunication cables or any foreign objects on the seabed where the lives of our fishermen might be endangered. Also there have been many cases of fishing vessels being dragged under or rammed by submarines. Only recently we had the tragic accident involving a US submarine and a Japanese training vessel where seven students lost their lives. There have been similar cases in Scottish waters in recent years. There must be better coordination between fishermen and naval personnel to ensure that such accidents can be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, many fishermen think that learning to swim is a bad omen. Can I suggest that as part of the rigorous training qualifications that are being called for by Mrs Miguélez Ramos in this report, swimming qualifications would be necessary and would save many fishermen's lives every year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission entirely agrees with you. The safety of our fishermen must be given top priority. In the Green Paper on the future of the CFP, which I will shortly be presenting to Parliament, we have not forgotten this matter of concern and have thereby met one of your objectives, which you presented under paragraph 32 of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1989, on the initiative of the Commission, the European Union has made every effort to improve the health and safety of workers in the fisheries sector. Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, together with the associated specific directives, offer a solid legal base. The following specific directives have also been issued: Directive 92/29/EEC on medical treatment on board, Directive 93/102/EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for work on board fishing vessels and Directive 97/70/EEC setting up a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over.</p>
<p class="contents">According to your report, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, there are problems above all in two areas: firstly, the correct maintenance of vessels and, secondly, the working conditions, hygiene and the organisation of work on board. The framework directive and the specific directives cover both these spheres of action. Having said that, we must note that more and more accidents are occurring in the fisheries sector. Just in the last few months, accidents have occurred which have led to a number of deaths. I would at this point like to express my deep condolences to the families affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree with you fully. First of all, the Member States must also implement the provisions of the directives. As far as your conclusions are concerned, Madam Rapporteur, I feel there is a need to act in the following areas. The first area has to do with the legal framework, which is covered in paragraphs 1 to 3 and paragraph 27 of your report. The applicable directives are essentially adequate but they are just minimum requirements, and there is nothing to prevent the Member States from issuing stricter rules or establishing special requirements for specific cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the directives contain a reporting duty for the Member States with different timetables. With the help of these national reports, in 2002 the Commission will compile a summary report and, where necessary, table amendments. In preparation for this, we have started to amend Directive 97/70/EEC to ensure the harmonised interpretation of the Annexe to the Torremolinos International Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area relates to the vocational and continuing training of workers, which is covered by paragraphs 7, 10, 11, 15, 16, 20, 26 and 30. The directives already contain articles on the vocational training of workers. Here too, however, we are dealing with minimum requirements. It therefore once again lies with Member States to see to it that they are implemented and, if needs be, to bring about higher standards. I can assure you, however, that the Commission will make the vocational and continuing training of workers in matters of safety one of the central issues in its forthcoming report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the best rules are useless if they are not complied with correctly or at all. Monitoring and control are the main problems. But these fall exclusively within the remit of the Member States. We must therefore urge them to apply the provisions correctly. Moreover, objective, reliable and comparable data on the causes and circumstances of accidents are a prerequisite for successful prevention. In this regard, there is already an initiative on the harmonisation of data in the competent departments of Eurostat and also in the Commission’s Directorate-General for Employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards fleet renewal, I would like to remind you that one of the objectives of all the structural programmes in the fisheries sector is to modernise fishing vessels. In the context of the financial instrument on structural assistance in the fisheries sector, there are abundant resources available to improve safety on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the international part of the CFP, the Commission has always insisted on compliance with the rules in force. Safety and health on board vessels are part and parcel of our overall strategy both in the bilateral agreements and in the regional fisheries organisations, as well as in the fight against illegal fishing and flying flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, I can agree with you fully. All of us – the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Member States and international organisations – must do our outmost to ensure that the risk for our fishermen is reduced to an absolute minimum. Your initiative is an important step towards achieving this goal.</p>

I have no idea how I am going to fill the seven minutes allotted to me. But this is a very serious matter. Europe is becoming increasingly concerned with the role of the liberal professions. As they are part of the single market it is clear that issues concerning freedom in the single market are also extremely important for the liberal professions. Unfortunately, what one hears in European institutions is not always easy to understand, to interpret properly and to elucidate.</p>
<p class="contents">We do know that, a few months ago, the Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, made a number of statements in this connection. Mr Monti was attending an international conference when he said that, in his view, setting tariffs for liberal professions, which up to a point is done according to the law in some Member States through such mechanisms as fee scales for lawyers, is not without its problems under competition law. He also announced at this conference that the Commission would look into this problem. We also have the situation in which an Italian court submitted a request to the European Court for an advance determination in relation to which a hearing took place last autumn, and now the European Court will have to rule on the admissibility of Italian fee scales for lawyers under European law.</p>
<p class="contents">We have liberalised markets in many areas of the European Union. However, we have not normally liberalised them in such a way that we said from one day to the next, that’s it, we are now releasing you into a world of completely free competition. Usually there are transitional periods, statutory regulations for adjustment and so on, for example in energy policy and many other sectors. Only in the specific area of the liberal professions does it seem that there are no, or not enough, political considerations of this kind at the level of the European Union. I think it is extremely important that, in the future, the Commission takes a closer look at the liberal professions and starts to deal with their specific demands. They must deal not only with the people who work in the liberalised professions but, most decisively, with consumers as well. Fee scales were issued by national legislators in the Member States in order to provide reliable protection for consumers when they made use of the services provided by the liberal professionals. I think this aspect is gaining increasing influence in the policy of the European Union and must be integrated into any strategies that are developed.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the Commission has just presented a paper on the services sector and the problems posed by the single market. This is very much to be welcomed. It just strikes me that this paper follows a completely horizontal approach and does not deal with the specific interests of the individual branches in the services sector, which is very big. In my view, the medical and legal professions, for example, cannot be dealt with according to the same criteria as the supermarket round the corner whose social task is quite different.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that the liberal professions are largely subject to specific special provisions attached to their profession in terms of competition, advertising, standards of behaviour and other obligations. Today at midday, we voted in second reading on the money-laundering directive which dealt with such obligations. That is why I believe that a specific political approach for the liberal professions is appropriate. We want Parliament to deal with this issue and we want to force the Commission, by means of this oral question, to tackle the issue of the liberal professions head on, which it has so far failed to do. That is why we have introduced this oral question with the text you have before you, which you are all familiar with and which I do not intend to go into any further.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to say a few words about the task my political group feels we have to take on, which is the reason why this resolution was introduced. It is not enough just to talk about it; we must take advantage of this part-session to announce our demands in a brief Commission resolution. From our experiences in committee, the Commission normally complies with such requests. On the basis of this resolution, therefore, I expect the Commission to make concrete proposals and statements on the development of policy with regard to the liberal professions. I also expect it to answer the question of how, from a political viewpoint, it intends to deal with the modern developments that society entails. The liberal professions cannot ignore progress; they must of course bear in mind that times change and the world moves on.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final comment. Most liberal professions are also small and medium-sized enterprises. That is why there is special interest in protecting these groups and also a special obligation on the part of the Commission to deal with this issue. I have now spoken for six minutes. I will forego my last minute. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome this opportunity to be able to present our policy to Parliament on his behalf and to comment on it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with you that guaranteeing the quality of services is of the utmost importance because customers, that is, consumers, are often in a weaker position than those who provide these services. A rule which is solely targeted at guaranteeing top quality services without distorting competition is clearly in the interests of consumers. This holds true regardless of whether the rule is introduced by the state or by a professional organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community’s competition rules do not therefore apply to purely professional rules. Whether a rule is a purely professional rule must be determined from one case to the next. In so doing, account must be taken of the impact of the rule on the freedom of action of members of the profession or of professional organisations as well as consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as determining compulsory tariffs or rates of charges is concerned, it depends, firstly, on who determines the fees or rates of charges and, secondly, on what interests are taken into consideration. The determining of uniform fees by members of a profession is a fundamental violation of competition rules. Justification on grounds of professional ethics is not recognised. At the same time, Member States only have the right to determine compulsory tariffs if these fees are objectively justified on grounds of the general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the view that this requirement is met if the mandate and the power of the authority issuing the rule in question is sufficiently clearly and unequivocally expressed in the rule itself and if there is no room for unlawful agreements to be reached between members of the profession.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does, however, have certain reservations concerning the interpretation of the case law referred to in the question, if this interpretation leads one to believe that only fees which are determined by professional bodies or associations of all members of a given profession can be subject to competition law. What is important however is that the existing, clear, objective and justified criteria of general interest, which are determined by the state, are met.</p>
<p class="contents">These criteria must include consideration of the interests of consumers and not only consideration of the interests of the profession. The quality of services should be guaranteed through other, less restrictive, means than the determining of fees. It is therefore not enough that a fee agreement is approved or confirmed by the relevant authorities in order for it to be exempt from the applications of competition rules.</p>
<p class="contents">A price agreement reached between members of a given profession, that is, between competitors, is a fundamental violation of competition rules. Moreover, a Members State can violate its obligations out of the EC Treaty if the rule in question removes the effectiveness of competition rules. This is the case, for example, when a state obliges the profession to determine uniform fees without specifying the criteria of the common good which have to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">A breach of contract takes place if a Member State transfers its power to determine fees to a professional association without reserving the right of supervision. For the sake of completeness, I would like to point out that the Commission does not support the determining of compulsory tariffs but at most tolerates it under certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">In areas in which compulsory uniform tariffs apply, competition must result from quality. It is therefore important for members of the profession to publicise their special fields and to be able to advertise. The Court of Justice just recently pointed out that advertising on every market is an important competitiveness factor since, in this way, the advantages of individual market participants, the quality of their services and tariffs are conveyed more clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court confirmed the Commission’s opinion that a ban on comparative advertising seriously affected the ability of the most competitive members of the profession to expand their services and also had a negative impact when the customer base was confined to the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of the country-of-origin principle, it must be noted that this principle helps to bring about a single market. It is anchored in the Parliament and Council Directive 98/5/EEC facilitating the permanent exercise of the lawyer’s profession and guarantees, among other things, that lawyers can establish themselves using the professional title of the Member State in which they completed their training by simply registering in the host country. The directive aims to enable layers who practice under the title given by their country-of-origin to establish branches and subsidiaries.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the Commission continues to ensure that the advantages of freedom of movement, which can be achieved through the country-of-origin principle, are weighed against the general interest, which is protected in the host country and recognised under Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently looking into how it can make further progress concerning the conditions for the cross-border provision of certain services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a liberal professional myself, in this case a doctor, rather than a lawyer, I have to say that my British experience of fixed professional fees – fixed in this case by government – such as cremation fees and attendances at coroners' courts, is that they are artificially low and have tended to benefit the state rather than the professional concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically I have recently been involved with asking the Commission to examine the restrictions applied by British health insurers in only paying the medical fees for treatments provided within the UK and refusing such benefits to British residents who wish to avail themselves of treatment in, for example, France. Last year I lobbied on behalf of a British lawyer wanting to register in France as a <span class="italic">notaire</span>, as non-French <span class="italic">notaires</span> are currently prohibited by French law, and this is an activity governed in many Member States by fixed fees. Currently I am my group's shadow rapporteur on EMAC on a proposed directive for a single market and free movement for insurance mediators, whose commissions are often fixed. Therefore these concepts apply to a number of different professionals other than lawyers, as I have already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The single market is one of the major achievements of the European Community and for that market to be complete it must include services as well as goods. I entirely agree with Commissioner Bolkestein that the services sector in Europe offers huge potential growth for competition and employment which must be to the benefit of all of Europe's citizens. The Commission's initiative in this area is therefore one that I strongly support and in accordance with the so-called single market principles, it should be possible to introduce in one Member State business models providing services pioneered successfully in another, and of course they should be subject to examination under the Treaty rules on competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I am conscious of the need for proper consumer protection across a single market, but I also suspect that many practices which have grown up over the years, through tradition and usage, may have outlived some of their original usefulness. It is very important, therefore, that a thorough inquiry be conducted which will lead to a comprehensive debate so that special privileges and practices and exemptions which may be attached to the exercise of the liberal professions – and not just the lawyers – are properly scrutinised. It is necessary to ensure that they will provide a real benefit to the citizen, and are not merely privileges supporting the vested interests of all the professions concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that it is only starting to see the outer layer of the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Because I was thinking a moment ago that in the last part-session, Commissioner Reding, sitting where Commissioner Fischler is sitting now, gave us a detailed explanation of the agreement that had been reached between the Commission, FIFA and UEFA. That is a business worth many billions of euros and in that case it seems that competition gives way to quality. At times it seems that quality is very important, and I agree with this interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about a profession, that of a lawyer, which is said to be one of the oldest professions in the world – they say that there is another profession that is older, but I am not going to mention it to avoid being accused of sexism. The law profession is very old and the danger of that is that lawyers deal with quantities. Using the words of Karl Marx, here quality becomes quantity, or the reverse, if you like, because lawyers are defending interests that can be quantified.</p>
<p class="contents">In the different countries of the Community, or at least in some of them, there is a system of protection through professional organisations, which is not perfect and could be improved but which at least establishes some guarantees, as there are too many unscrupulous lawyers who, left to the free interaction of supply and demand, could be tempted to act and abuse their position.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression that the Commission is currently at a very immature time and therefore that we should look at this subject with a degree of calm. I think that we need to start seeing what is happening – I think that Mr Tannock was referring to this – in the different Member States, what makes it difficult for someone to go to a lawyer and, above all, why people are afraid of going to a lawyer.</p>
<p class="contents">That is to say, I think that there are real problems, but that those real problems cannot be solved by mathematically applying the rules of Community competition and much less by focusing solely on the criterion of prices. I think that the ideal would be for us to have a professional lawyers’ organisation covering the whole Community, not so much in order to protect lawyers but to protect consumers. We have to think about moving towards an area in which there is protection for people who go to lawyers, protection for consumers, protection for clients, and I think that the conclusion that we could therefore draw here is to invite the Commission to continue to look at the issue and, perhaps with the cooperation of Parliament, to see what the sectors involved say, including, of course, the clients, the people who would like to go to a lawyer, but who normally do not go out of fear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallis (ELDR).</span></span>   – I suppose I should start by declaring an interest as a member of a liberal profession to whom this question applies, being a lawyer. It seems to me that this week in Parliament we have been lobbied hard by lawyers' organisations supporting their professional position. In contrast, last week in the UK we saw the publication of a report by the Office of Fair Trading looking at competition in the professions, the very issue that we are looking at today. That report was based on two premises: first, that the professions are entrusted with the delivery of services of considerable public importance; but second, that any restriction on the supply of professional services will tend to drive up costs and prices and will limit consumer access and choice. That is why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in this Parliament has tabled certain amendments. Yes, liberal professions have a special position in society, but that position and the services they offer should be enhanced by more competition and independent scrutiny. That is what we want to see the Commission look at.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you two UK-based examples. First, price: should this be regulated? Solicitors, my own profession, used to have a monopoly of conveyancing, the buying and selling of land. Competition was introduced, licensed conveyancers allowed, and it drove down prices, but not standards. I experienced this myself the other week. I had to renew the lease of my office. I was bound to use my landlord's solicitors. To set up the original lease they charged me GBP 300; that seemed quite enough to me. But to vary a couple of words in the self-same document, they proposed to charge me GBP 500. That, to me, is licensed robbery by our profession. They need to be challenged.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a constituent of mine recently came to me with a history of a dispute over the last 15 years. That dispute had taken him through five law firms, ruined his business and his family life, all about a debt that had actually been acknowledged in writing. He had had no help from my profession's complaints body. These are the kinds of examples that do the liberal professions no service; and sadly they are not limited or isolated. Yes, professional standards can be imposed by professional bodies, but they can only be further enhanced by competition and external scrutiny. That is why I ask colleagues to support the amendments tabled by my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I would like to point out that the Commission has been tackling these issues for a long time now. In fact the first rule dates back to 1993. In total, the Commission has issued three resolutions on competition amongst the liberal professions, the fundamental principles of which have been confirmed by the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Two of the resolutions were directed against uniform tariffs which could not be justified on the grounds of the general interest. In one case, which concerned the procedure to determine lawyers’ fees in Italy, the Commission is waiting for the interpretation of Community law by the Court. This ruling will prepare the way for the adoption of further measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the Commission believes that each of the liberal professions needs to be dealt with separately and not all according to the same pattern. The example the speaker from Great Britain presented concerning doctors is evidence of the need for separate treatment. I believe that, in my introductory comment, I said a great deal about consumer protection being our top priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council expressed its sympathy for those Member States that the disease had stuck and its appreciation for the prompt and decisive protective measures introduced by the Commission and national governments.</p>
<p>It is not the Council’s role to seek to manage the current outbreak. Existing legislation provides an appropriate framework within which the Commission and Member States can act, including on compensation. The Council has, however, already begun to discuss the lessons to be learned from the current outbreak, and will take account of these when considering any proposals from the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0298"></a>

<p>I would begin by emphasising to the honourable Member that the Directive in question does not deal solely with aspects relating to genetically modified vine varieties, but that its prime purpose is to adapt to technical progress Community rules on material for the vegetative propagation of the vine which date back more than thirty years, and thus to ensure the freest possible movement of this type of product within the Community.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would point out that the marketing of a transgenic vine variety is already a possibility, subject to compliance with the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the deliberate release to the environment of genetically modified micro-organisms, which was amended just recently on the basis of a joint text agreed between our two institutions.</p>
<p>The future Directive does not, therefore, constitute any fundamental innovation in this area, and merely confirms the new approach that has been adopted at Community level to improve the control of GMOs, whereby they are regulated sector by sector, following a so-called vertical approach. In giving its opinion on this proposal, your institution moreover confirmed its support for such an approach.</p>
<p>Lastly, let me make it clear that the Agriculture Council in January did not reject the proposal, as stated in the oral question, but merely deferred adoption to one of its subsequent meetings in order to have more time to achieve the broadest possible consensus on the future Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The first ever EU-India Summit, held in June 2000 in Portugal, was a milestone on the road towards a broader and deeper relationship, and has created a strong momentum that both the EU and India are building on. The Summit adopted a declaration on the EU-India partnership in the 21st century and agreed on an "Agenda for Action". Both documents set out an ambitious working program and identified key areas, in which both sides wish to enhance their cooperation, namely :</p>
<p>enhanced political dialogue, including further regular Summits ;</p>
<p>protection and promotion of human rights ;</p>
<p>prevention of and fight against terrorism, drug trafficking and drug abuse ;</p>
<p>eradication of chemical and biological weapons ;</p>
<p>closer coordination in international fora and organisations ;</p>
<p>creation of a Civil Society Round Table and of a Think Tank network ;</p>
<p>strengthening of the high level economic and commercial dialogue ;</p>
<p>support for Indian economic reforms ;</p>
<p>enhanced cooperation in the information technology, bio-technology and telecommunications ;</p>
<p>protection of the environment and promotion of sustainable development ;</p>
<p>development of infrastructure and removal of obstacles to trade and investment ;</p>
<p>trade liberalisation and strengthening of the WTO.</p>
<p>Since the Lisbon Summit, significant progress has been made in the implementation of several of the agreed initiatives. Political dialogue meetings have been held at Senior Officials level (Paris 06.11.2000) and at Ministerial level (Stockholm, 04.04.2001). Dates for the second Political and Business Summits, to be held in New Delhi on 23.11.2001, have been agreed upon. First contacts between the Council Working Group on Terrorism and Indian experts will take place in May 2001. The first meeting of the EU-India Round Table took place in New Delhi on 29.01.2001 and will be followed up by a second meeting later this Summer in Brussels (tentative dates 16/17.07.2001). Based on its findings, the Round Table intends to make recommendations to the next Summit. The first meeting between European and Indian think tanks is currently being prepared.</p>
<p>As far as Community activities are concerned, several of the agreed initiatives have been advancing well, too. High level meetings of the working groups on environment and the "information society" were held in Delhi earlier this year. The negotiations on a science and technology cooperation agreement are well advanced. The 11th session of the EC-India Joint Commission took place in New Delhi on 06.02.2001 and discussed a broad range of trade and development cooperation issues. Both sides welcomed the increased trade in the year 2000 and took stock of the progress made in their economic and development cooperation. India welcomed the EC's announcement of &#x80; 200 million Euro to be available for India's elementary education system. India and the Community underlined their determination to intensify cooperation in the social sector development and the fight against poverty, notably developing basic health services and the education system. In the context of the high level economic dialogue, and following up a first round of talks held in Brussels in October 2000, the Joint Commission launched a second round of high level consultations on WTO. Both sides further agreed to enter into discussions on a maritime transport agreement, to start negotiations on a customs cooperation agreement and to explore opportunities to further enhance market access for textiles. Finally, the Joint Commission discussed extensively the preparation of the next EU-India Summit, and in particular the European suggestion for a joint initiative to enhance trade and investment flows. Both sides agreed to invite the Indian and European business community to examine a limited number of strategic sectors and to draw up a pro-trade and pro-investment action plan in time for the Summit.</p>
<p>In the light of this positive evolution, the Council is content with the overall development of EU-India relations, even if some trade irritants and areas of disagreement on foreign policy issues like nuclear issues and the CTBT persist. The Council will maintain its efforts to further develop the relationship with the world's biggest democracy, while at the same time continue to stress certain foreign policy matters such as these mentioned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0304"></a>

<p>Furthermore, the EU has regular dialogue at various levels with a large number of countries.

The EU would like to see the ABM Treaty preserved and echoed the views expressed by a number of Member States on the importance of maintaining global stability through an agreed security framework and on the need for full and transparent consultations between the US and its European friends and allies and also with the Russian Federation and China on this issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0310"></a>

<p>The Council recalls to the honourable Member that human rights issues, including torture and prison conditions, figure prominently among the short-term priorities and intermediate objectives of the recently adopted Accession Partnership for Turkey (adopted on 8 March 2001; OJ L 85, 24.3.2001, p. 13). The Turkish National Programme for the Adoption of the Acquis (NPAA) is an important landmark in Turkey's preparation for EU membership and the first stage in a far-reaching programme of political reform. It is a starting point for the fundamental transformation of Turkey into a modern democracy.</p>
<p>With regard to the political criteria for EU membership, a preliminary analysis by the Commission suggests that further efforts will be required in a number of areas. The implementation of the Accession Partnership, in the light of the Turkish NPAA, will be closely monitored by the Council and the Commission. Human rights issues are also part of the enhanced political dialogue between the EU and Turkey.</p>

In fact, the Community does not subsidise the transport of live cattle but it grants export refunds for export of cattle and beef.</p>
<p>The Council completed this set of provisions by adopting on 18 December 1997 the Regulation (EC) 2634/97 of 18 December 1997 amending Regulation (EEC) 805/68 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (OJ C 356, 31.12.1997) stipulating that, in the case of export of live animals, the payment of the export refund shall be subject to compliance with the provisions of Community legislation concerning animal welfare and, in particular, the protection of animals during transport. Council Regulation (EC) 1254/99 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal currently in force also stipulates the above-mentioned criteria.</p>

<p>What view does the Council take of this provocative step of criminalising social demands? Is this the only response European workers can expect?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council is well aware of the challenges and difficulties related to the Kaliningrad region of the Russian Federation. The Common Strategy of the European Union, adopted in 1999, already called for closer cooperation with Russia on this issue. Subsequently, an Action Plan for the Northern Dimension in the external and cross-border policies of the European Union was prepared by the Council and endorsed by the European Council in Feira. It invited the Commission to follow-up on Kaliningrad, among other issues.</p>
<p>As a response, the Commission adopted on 17 January 2001 a Communication to the Council on the ‘EU and Kaliningrad’. After a preliminary examination, the Council at its meeting on 26 February 2001 welcomed the Commission communication as providing a good basis for developing further EU cooperation with Russia and neighbouring countries. It should, in fact, ease the addressing of specific problems related to the Kaliningrad region, regarding the movement of goods and people, energy supplies, fisheries, economic development, governance, democracy and the rule of law, environment and health. Currently the communication is subject to a more detailed examination in the relevant Council bodies.</p>
<p>On the Russian side, both federal authorities in Moscow and local authorities in Kaliningrad have welcomed the communication as providing a good basis for future discussion. The same applies to Lithuania and Poland.</p>
<p>The EU and Russia have agreed that the question of Kaliningrad will be examined jointly in the relevant bodies of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Such discussions have already started, and will continue on a regular basis. Furthermore, to gather first-hand information, Anna Lindh, the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Presidency and Chris Patten on behalf of the Commission visited the region in February this year.</p>
<p>Discussions on Kaliningrad with the neighbouring countries, Lithuania and Poland, will continue in the context of the relevant bodies under the Association Agreements. Finally, the issue of Kaliningrad can also usefully be addressed in the context of the Northern Dimension initiative.</p>
<p>While it is premature to indicate what type of solutions can be identified to various problems related to the Kaliningrad region and what instruments could be used to address these problems, the issue remains a key priority in EU/Russia relations. The Council will therefore keep it under close scrutiny.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0295"></a>

<p>Two EU member States are among a number of countries world-wide considering the export of nuclear waste to Russia.

<p>With the entry into force of the International Atomic Energy Agency Joint Convention on the safety of spent fuel management and radioactive waste, Member States will be prohibited from exporting shipments of radioactive material for reprocessing or disposal to third countries that do not have the “technical, legal or administrative resources” to manage it safely. It would therefore be for the relevant authorities in Member States to assess whether this condition is met before any nuclear waste could be shipped to the Russian Federation. The convention builds on principles that already apply under Euratom Directive 92/3 of 1992 to shipments of waste.</p>
<p>Although outside the direct competence of the Commission, there are very considerable doubts in the international community over whether the facility at Mayak is at present able to accept and safely process spent fuel or radioactive waste from outside Russia.</p>
<p>The Commission has not received any official notification from Community nuclear facilities of exports of fissile materials to Russia.

<p>The recent events in the Middle East are well known to us all. The need for a renewed peace process, not only involves putting an end to the suffering of the peoples concerned or stabilising regional security, it also involves future European security, even international security. Every additional person killed or injured means one step further away from a peace agreement and mutual understanding between the belligerents. The excessive use of violence has to be stopped immediately.</p>
<p>The continued peace process cannot rely on the decreasing attempts made by the US Administration. The EU must take the responsibility and play an active role in creating the conditions for a just and comprehensive peace. That constitutes not only a request from its partners in the region, but a responsibility that we can no longer avoid.</p>
<p>What will the Commission do in order to facilitate the conditions for a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East? What will it do in order to stop the excessive use of violence that results in the daily killings in the West Bank and Gaza?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the Commission has indicated on previous occasions, it is seriously concerned about the loss of life on both sides. Too many people have fallen victim to an excessive use of force. The Commission has condemned the extra-judicial killings perpetrated by Israeli security forces as unacceptable behaviour and as a threat to the peace process. But it is also deeply concerned by the killing of innocent Israeli civilians by Palestinians and deeply deplores the acts of cruel, cold hearted and destructive terrorism which have been perpetrated over the past week.</p>
<p>The Commission has little reason to hope that the parties will resume discussions soon. There is a wide consensus however on the need to launch simultaneous discussions on economic security and political issues: it is far from clear how this complex process can be started. The Commission is ready to assist in any way to facilitate talks. It supports the principles and mutual understandings which have been reached thus far in negotiations and it has urged the parties to abide by their obligations under agreements reached so far.</p>
<p>The Commission is distressed by the deteriorating humanitarian and economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza, about the destabilising impact the Israeli closure is having on the economic and social fabric of the Palestinian community and on the institutional framework of the Palestinian Authority. The collapse of the Palestinian Authority will set the cause of peace back even further, threaten Israeli security, and jeopardise efforts to promote cooperation and stability in the Middle East. The Commission has urged the Israelis to resume the transfer of tax revenues owed to the Palestinian Authority and lift the economic blockade. This is clearly stated in the Stockholm European Council conclusions.</p>
<p>As discussed at the European Council in Stockholm, it is needed to assess now how the Union can contribute to a resumption of the peace process. It will continue the dialogue with both sides and will repeat its pleas for an end to violence and to the economic blockade.</p>
<p>The Commission is providing aid to the Palestinian Authority to help it meet its minimum obligations. To this end the Commission will provide &#x80;60 million in budgetary aid in order to sustain the Palestinian Authority over the next six months. It is working with other donors to ensure that they also contribute to this support.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0315"></a>

<p>The Colombian peace-process is, indeed, a major concern for the Commission. The member of the Commission in charge of External relations has just come from Colombia, where he met President Pastrana on 27 March. The best has to be done to make the peace process irreversible so that it becomes a state policy. The Union's political and financial commitment to the peace process is crucial to this end.</p>
<p>The Community support package for the peace process in Colombia will be oriented towards actions that underpin the peace process itself. 105 M&#x80; of programmable aid will be made available by the Commission over the period 2000-2006: it will be dedicated to modernising administration, strengthening democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights, protecting the environment and developing alternative crops. In addition, it is hoped that Member States’ bilateral aid focuses in these areas so that a coherent and properly coordinated package of aid can be presented. The exact geographical location of these new, planned projects in support of the peace-process is not yet clearly defined. We have a technical mission in Colombia right now: the delegation for cooperation will naturally depend on the results of this mission. A proposal for a "peace-laboratory" in the Magdalena Medio area - where ELN acts - is currently being studied and we are also looking for possible projects in non ELN areas.</p>
<p>So much for the projects planned for the future. As to the ongoing Community projects, they are financed under different budget lines: financial and technical cooperation, ECHO (to assist displaced persons), NGO-cooperation, tropical forests and environment, human rights and others. These projects are carried out almost all over the country.</p>
<p>The intervention areas for the ECHO projects are selected by taking into account the number of displaced people and their vulnerability. Financial and technical cooperation projects are elaborated together with the beneficiary country, (which also provides significant counter-part funding). Projects carried out by NGOs follow a "demand-driven" logic. They are submitted by NGOs who work in the field. In all these cases, the local population is involved in the design of the project.</p>
<p>The Human rights violations committed by the paramilitaries. As it can be seen on one of the enclosed maps, the paramilitaries are present in many areas of Colombia (and are expanding even further). Human rights violations committed by the paramilitaries are increasing fast. The situation is a matter of extreme concern, both in terms of the human rights violations committed by the paramilitaries, but also with regard to the guerrilla groups.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to stress that in all projects the promotion of human rights and international humanitarian law is essential. Personnel are well trained and they of course monitor the human rights situation. But the honourable Member needs to be aware of the fact that the security conditions in the field are extremely difficult, which may complicate the implementation of the package.</p>
<p>A final word on "Plan Colombia". As repeatedly stated, the Commission does not intend, within the framework of its aid package, to take part in any initiative with a military dimension. Plan Colombia remains a Colombian domestic issue. The package aims to support the Colombian peace process and the efforts of the Colombian Government to this end.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Union has officially proclaimed 2001 the European Year of Languages. For twelve months the spotlight will be on all European languages, including so-called 'minority languages' such as Euskari (Basque). They are an important component of Europe's cultural heritage and they are of great importance for the future of Europe. Law 372/2000 of the regional government of Navarre aimed at drastically cutting back on the use of Basque in the civil service is at odds with the objectives of the European Year of Languages.</p>
<p>Does the Commission regard law 372/2000 as being in line with the ambitious and broad objectives of the European Year of Languages and the Kuijpers resolution of 30 October 1987? If so, on what grounds does the Commission seek to reconcile restriction of the use of the Basque language with the objectives of the European Year of Languages and the Kuijpers resolution?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 8 January 2001 and 4 February 2001 respectively, the government of the Autonomous Community of Navarre (Comunidad Foral de Navarra – Spain), adopted the Decreto Foral 372/2000 and three Agreements regulating and laying down action plans for the use of 'Basque or Euskara' (Linguae Navarrorum).</p>
<p>Thousands of Navarrese citizens believe these government provisions to be discriminatory on grounds of language, over and above being unjust and contrary to the 'Ley Foral del Vascuence' (Autonomous Community Law on Basque). Various local authorities and the Euskara Cultural Foundation have lodged an 'administrative dispute' appeal (recurso contencioso-administrativo) against these provisions.</p>
<p>The preamble to the Charter on Fundamental Rights proclaims that the Union respects 'the diversity of the cultures and peoples of the European Union' and 'reaffirms' the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, while Article 21(1) states that 'any discrimination based on any ground such as …. language … shall be prohibited'.</p>
<p>What is the Commission's opinion of the Navarrese legal provisions in question, in the light of the Charter on Fundamental Rights solemnly proclaimed at Nice? What urgent measures does it intend to take to ensure that human rights are respected in Navarre, if - as the local authorities and the Euskara Cultural Foundation point out in their appeals - the nullity of these provisions overt, obvious and evident, and that they constitute, furthermore, discrimination on grounds of language?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Threats to the safety of commercial flights have been a constant concern in aviation circles for several decades now. A number of international agreements have been concluded with a view to preventing illegal acts or punishing those responsible for such acts. At the same time, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and, at European level, the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) have drawn up standards and recommended practices intended to help States in taking appropriate measures. These have had a relatively satisfactory impact in that, for example, while, in 1970, one hundred or so illegal acts were recorded around the world, no more than six were recorded in 1999.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there does not appear to be any justification for the Community intervening, on safety grounds, in an area which comes within the sphere of responsibility of the Member States. Nonetheless, the cost of the relevant measures and the barriers to freedom of movement within the internal market to which they give rise could justify action being taken to reduce them as far as is possible without undermining their effectiveness. Thought is currently being given to the appropriateness of such action and to what it might involve.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0258"></a>

<p>The Commission considers that the Community rules applying to the supply of certificate of conformity are clear. Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers10 (as amended, notably, by Council Directive 92/53/EC of 18 June 199211) makes clear that it is incumbent on a vehicle manufacturer to ensure that a certificate of conformity accompanies a vehicle manufactured in conformity with the approved vehicle type (Article 6.1). The same Directive also makes clear that possession of a valid certificate of conformity is a fundamental condition for vehicle registration purposes (Article 7.1). It should be pointed out that, by definition, the type-approval rules apply only to new, and not used, motor vehicles.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that failure to supply certificates of conformity can also give rise to internal market difficulties, particularly in cases where a new vehicle, purchased in one Member State, is presented for registration in another Member State.</p>
<p>Following receipt of a number of complaints from vehicle purchasers resident in Germany, the Commission has launched the necessary inquiries with the Member State concerned - Denmark. Following an exchange of correspondence with the Danish authorities, it appears that they have introduced some procedures which appear to remove the compulsory requirement, contained in Directive 92/53/EC, that the certificate of conformity must accompany the vehicle.</p>

<p>It has been estimated that two hundred million fish are macerated each day on the small-mesh intake screens of Sizewell B Power Station which is situated at the edge of the North Sea. The number of fish which pass through the mesh and die afterwards is estimated to be far greater still. Billions of growing marine organisms perish daily at this one power station, including many which are protected species. Yet some power stations in other places operate perfectly well using air cooling systems instead of seawater.</p>

<p>The estimate referred to by the honourable Member appeared in a recent edition of the UK Financial Times.</p>
<p>While it appears probable that fish are killed by the causes stated in the newspaper article it is difficult to have complete faith in some of the numerical extrapolations made therein. For example, if 200 million fish are “macerated” at the Sizewell B power station per day and if, to account for other causes of death (pressure, heat, chemicals), this number could be multiplied by 10-100, this would mean that 2-20 billion fish per day and hence at 730-7300 billion fish per year are killed at this power station alone. If, on average and as a very conservative estimate, each fish killed weighs 10 grams, this implies that Sizewell B alone disposes of between 73000 and 730000 tonnes of fish per year. This seems highly improbable.</p>
<p>Much more convincing, however, is that it is excessive fishing which has led to the decline of many of the most commercially important fish stocks in Community waters and, indeed, elsewhere. This decline, which has been of the order of 50% since the mid 1970’s appears to be much more closely related to the build-up in the size of fishing fleets than to the development of power stations. It is for this reason that legislation intended to reduce fishing pressure on these stocks by controlling the activities of fishermen is put forward.</p>
<p>At present, the Commission has no plans in relation to fish deaths caused by power stations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0270"></a>

<p>On the one hand, it is advisable to make the distinction between the Treaty of Nice and the Protocol on the enlargement of the European Union, which will be applied when the Treaty of Nice has been ratified, whatever the pace at which countries join, and on the other hand, Declaration Nos 20 and 21 (the Declaration on the enlargement of the European Union and the Declaration on the qualified majority threshold and the number of votes for a blocking minority in an enlarged Union) which constitute the basic components to which the common position to be adopted by the current Member States on this issue during accession negotiations shall conform.

<p>The answers to the honourable Member’s questions, in the event that enlargement of the European Union does not take place between now and 2005, can be found in the Protocol on Enlargement:</p>
<p>1)	with regard to the European Parliament: in the event that no accession treaty has been signed by 1 January 2004, the number of MEPs to be elected in 2004 in the fifteen Member States will remain the same as it is today (a total of 626). This is a result of the combined effect of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 2 of the Protocol on Enlargement.</p>
<p>2)	with regard to decision-making within the Council: pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Protocol on Enlargement, the new process for determining the qualified majority will enter into force on 1 January 2005, whether or not enlargement of the European Union has taken place, and will include the option that a Member State may request verification that the Member States constituting the qualified majority represent at least 62% of the total population of the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0282"></a>

<p>Does the Commission agree with Sir John Krebs, Chairman of the UK Food Standards Agency, that, in order to be effective and credible, the 'Precautionary Principle' must incorporate the 'Proportionate Principle', whereby any proposed action in response to a perceived or assessed risk must be proportionate to the likely scale and scope of the risk?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission’s Communication on the precautionary principle has initiated a lively debate both within the Community and internationally. The Commission has taken concrete action to ensure that this principle becomes better understood and correctly used. The proposal from the Commission for a Regulation on General Food Law and the establishment of the European Food Authority clarifies the role of the precautionary principle in the management of risks in the food and feed supply. In addition, the Commission is actively pursuing an international consensus in several fora including in Codex Alimentarius.</p>
<p>In the majority of risk management situations, a full set of scientific information is available on which to base a decision. However, this is not always the case. Essentially the precautionary principle is a risk management tool which comes into its own in those specific circumstances where, following an evaluation of all the available scientific information, a risk to health is identified but it is clear that further scientific information is needed.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding some lacunae in the scientific data, if adverse health or environmental effects have been identified, decision-makers have to act and cannot wait for every morsel of scientific data to be sought and evaluated. However, measures based on the precautionary principle must be kept under review while further scientific data is collected.</p>
<p>This principle should not be misunderstood. Risk management decisions based on the precautionary principle are not based on an uninformed perception of a problem but are based on an evaluation of all the available pertinent data, scientific and otherwise.</p>
<p>The principle of proportionality is a legal principle common to all decision making whether the precautionary principle has been invoked or not.</p>
<p>In the guidelines to the use of the precautionary principle, as incorporated in its Communication, the Commission explicitly states that the principle of proportionality must be respected.</p>
<p>The Nice European Council supported the Commission’s Communication and also referred to the need to ensure that the principle of proportionality is respected. Indeed the resolution calls upon the Commission to apply systematically its guidelines on the conditions for use of the precautionary principle which includes respect of the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p>In concrete terms, how this principle is expressed, the nature of the action that must be taken to protect health or the environment, will depend very much on the nature of the risk, and the level of protection needed.</p>
<p>This may fall anywhere in-between the removal of a product from the market to much milder action, which nevertheless, protects against adverse health or environmental effects. Any measure should not only be proportionate, but its application must be practical and feasible, and where relevant, the implementation of controls must be possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0283"></a>

Will such possible action be taken at European level or will it be left to the Member States?

<p>The current crisis is leading to further calls for a review of the current animal transport practices, as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus has spread due to contacts between groups of animals of different origin and destination in markets, collection centres and staging points. This must be taken into full consideration when the current rules on animal transport are reviewed. In the meantime, as an emergency measure, the Commission has adopted provisions to restrict the movements of FMD susceptible animals throughout the Community. In particular, the use of the staging points as provided by the Community legislation on the protection of animals during transport has been suspended.</p>
<p>The use of vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease is hampered by several limitations. These include:</p>
<p>-	Over 300 million susceptible livestock (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats) in the Community would need to be vaccinated on average at least once per year to give total coverage. Therefore vaccination would imply very high costs.</p>
<p>-	There are seven strains of FMD, each with several sub-strains. Vaccination is only effective against the targeted strain and for a limited period only.</p>
<p>-	No test exists to easily distinguish vaccinated animals from infected animals which allows the disease to continue to persist in the animal population.</p>
<p>However, Community legislation provides for emergency vaccination against FMD under certain circumstances. Indeed, a few days ago, the Commission has adopted two Decisions laying down the conditions under which vaccination may be applied in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom. The two Decisions are quite different as the situation in the two countries is also different.</p>
<p>4)	Despite vaccination, vaccinated animals and their meat may carry and spread foot-and-mouth disease virus if they are infected with this virus. This is the reason why, in accordance with Community legislation and international standards, the vaccinated animals and their meat cannot be traded freely. However, if certain precautionary measures are taken, including de-boning and maturation of meat, Community legislation does not exclude the meat from vaccinated animals being placed on the market.</p>
<p>5)	The costs of the current outbreaks cannot be precisely calculated, at this stage. However, it will largely exceed EUR 41 million, which is the current amount of the Veterinary Emergency Fund. The Commission is in contact with the authorities of the Member States in order to have more precise figures in this regard and then it will take the necessary actions in relation to the preparation of a draft budget for next year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0308"></a>

<p>The Honourable Member asks for the establishment of a task force to address the foot-and-mouth crisis. In fact, in accordance with the Regulatory Committee Procedure, the technical body in charge for providing advice to the Commission in such a crisis is the Standing Veterinary Committee, which is made up of veterinary experts from all Member States and is chaired by Commission veterinary specialists.</p>
<p>This Committee has met seven times in the last four weeks. From 20 February 2001, when the first outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease were confirmed in the United Kingdom, up to 29 March, the Commission has adopted fifteen Decisions that are currently applied in the Community to control and eliminate the disease.</p>
<p>Some of these Decisions were formally adopted by the Commission less than 24 hours after the event which prompted its adoption, such as the confirmation of a disease outbreak in a Member State.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the initiative referred to by the honourable Member. However, the Commission does not know the results of this project so far.</p>
<p>Regarding Community action in the field of marine pollution, the Commission wishes to draw the attention of the honourable Member on the Decision of the Parliament and of the Council setting up a Community framework for cooperation in this domain. Such a framework will allow closer cooperation between national maritime authorities in order to improve the level of preparedness and response to pollution.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission will in particular give priority to the development of actions aiming at improving the identification and prosecution of ships making unlawful discharges.</p>
<p>Reference should also be made to the recent Directive 2000/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2000 on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues under which ships are subject to leave their waste in ports rather than discharge it at sea.</p>
<p>The Commission has also presented a number of proposals aimed at improving the safety of the sea-borne oil trade and prevent accidental oil spills. Notably to strengthen Port State Control and the control of Maritime administrations and classification societies and to accelerate the phasing-out of single-hull oil-tankers as proposed in the first “Erika” package of proposals. The second “Erika” package includes in particular a proposal to improve the monitoring and control of maritime traffic. This proposal among other things addresses reporting obligations regarding incidents and accidents at sea.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0285"></a>

<p>The Commission fully acknowledges the importance of the question raised by the honourable Member. Treatment that can lead to lasting positive changes of the situation for drug addicts is a cornerstone in achieving a reduction of the demand for drugs in Europe. That said, the Commission has no immediate plan to draw up a report on the result of treatment in the Member States, taking into account that the mission of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is to provide the Community and its Member States with such information at European level on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The Agency already collects information through the national focal points about different forms of treatment available in the Member States. A summary is published in the annual report from the Agency.</p>
<p>More specifically, the Agency published in November 2000 a review on current practice in drug-substitution treatment in the European Union, presenting the national country profiles and strategies. Currently the Agency is working on an overview of treatment facilities in Europe to be available by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Information on the results of treatment is also available elsewhere. Studies are numerous, but the access to those could be made easier. The Commission will consider supporting initiatives to streamline different databases in this field.</p>
<p>In the European Union Drugs Strategy endorsed by the Helsinki European Council in December 1999 one of the six targets set is “to increase substantially the number of successfully treated addicts”.</p>
<p>This target has been followed-up in the Union - Action Plan on Drugs endorsed by the Feira European Council in June 2000. The Member States are invited “to define clear guidelines for the standards and goals of treatment services, and to ensure the evidence based evaluation of the treatment according to those guidelines”. Furthermore, “emphasis should be given to a scientific evaluation of different treatment strategies”.</p>
<p>Defining success in the field of treatment is, however, a very complex issue. The methods for estimating success rates vary, not only from country to country, but even inside countries. Comparability of results is often lacking at national level and between the institutions and services.</p>
<p>The Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addictions is currently working with a selection of national focal points in order to examine how the complex target of success could be approached at Union level through manageable and measurable indicators.</p>
<p>The candidate countries should progressively be taken on board, even if this has to be in the longer term. The Commission has received a mandate to start negotiations on the direct participation of candidate countries in the Drugs Agency and this should accelerate progress towards their integration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0293"></a>

<p>The Commission shares the honourable Member's concerns. Statistics show that children and young teenagers are the fastest-growing group of Internet users. They are also the group most at risk from contacts with paedophiles.</p>
<p>It is important to inform parents, teachers and children about the dangers and to provide practical advice. Technical means can also be used to block access to chat rooms. Service providers can offer "walled gardens" or chat rooms which are monitored, offering safe access to children. Where children are approached by paedophiles, they and their parents should be able to report this to an appropriate body.</p>
<p>Under the Safer Internet Action Plan managed by the Commission, Community funding has been made available since 1999 for projects which cover these areas. 9 awareness projects covering 16 countries are under way. A call for proposals has been published which covers walled gardens and filtering of Internet services including chat (closes 31 May 2001). The Commission will give a further opportunity to submit proposals in the next call to be published at the end of 2001. Hotlines for reporting illegal content operate in 10 countries and others are being set up.</p>
<p>The Commission will encourage the European Internet industry to exchange information in order to ensure that it is doing its best to contribute to finding solutions and will request the existing hotlines to make proposals for reporting incidents in chat rooms. The recently adopted Report on the Recommendation on protection of minors and human dignity shows that Member States, industry and the Commission are successfully undertaking particular efforts in order to protect minors from illegal and harmful content on the Internet.</p>
<p>The Commission has also long been concerned about the diffusion of paedophile images on the Internet, in particular child pornography. With a view to ensuring that Members States have common definitions and incriminations and effective sanctions in place to combat this phenomenon, the Commission has recently introduced a proposal for a Council Framework Decision which will include provisions for the approximation of national laws and sanctions in the field of sexual exploitation of children, with particular reference to child pornography on the Internet.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0297"></a>

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the relevant provisions regarding the principle of non-discrimination, i.e. article 13 (ex Article 6A) of the EC Treaty and Council Directive 2000/78/CE of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation1, adopted by the Council on the basis of article 13 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Directive only concerns the Member States and, according to article 18, they have until 2 December 2003 to implement it. However, the Commission had already adopted a policy which is consistent with the provisions of the Directive and assures equality of treatment for candidates with disabilities in recruitment competitions.</p>
<p>When organising the 1998 competitions, special arrangements were made for visually impaired candidates in close cooperation with the European Disability Forum, a non-governmental organisation with expertise in the area. Inter alia, the Forum agreed to the use of Braille texts. In order to ensure equality of treatment, visually-impaired candidates were allotted 3 hours for the first and third test (compared to 1 hour for the other candidates), 1 hour and 40 minutes for the contested second test (instead of 35 minutes for the other candidates) and 1 hour and 20 minutes for the fourth test (instead of 30 minutes for the other candidates).</p>
<p>In addition, these candidates were provided with a personal invigilator in a separate examination room for the whole duration of the tests.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that it has respected the principle of equality of treatment and taken suitable measures in accordance with article 5 of the above-mentioned Directive. It will continue to seek to follow best practice, and its proposals for equitable conditions for persons with disabilities – published in Autumn 2000 and now the subject of staff consultations – give evidence of that.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The first progress to be stated is a much better information about the state of the situation, obtained thanks to the work of the High Level Group ESDIS (Employment and Social Dimension of the Information Society) together with Member States, and which was at the base of the progress report on eEurope drawn by the French Presidency for the Nice European Council, and it has been consolidated in the «Benchmarking report» following-up the «Strategies for Jobs in the Information Society».</p>
<p>Existing public access centres are based in a wide diversity of public centres, going from public libraries to municipalities, and the level of service is also very diverse, ranging from 0,46 to 0,03 PIAP (Publics point of Access) per thousand inhabitants.</p>
<p>This information is an essential starting point for Member States and for the Commission. While the Commission cannot speak for Member States, it knows that all of them are working in the development of these services, essential for ensuring digital literacy for all, and it is sure that the next series of data will show considerable progress.</p>
<p>On the Commission’s side, education actions are coordinated by the Directorate General for Education and Culture. More precisely, the eLearning Action Plan sets the development of public access centres as a priority. A pilot project concerning this development, and aiming at providing an European dimension to this common effort, will be the subject of a special joint call of the Education and Training Programmes, Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, and Youth, which will be published shortly.</p>
<p>The Structural Funds, the main Community instruments for social cohesion, support Member States projects in this field. The Social Fund has currently several regional projects with this objective, which is also requested by the Employment Guidelines for 2001. Finally, the Information Society Directorate General has done a lot supporting research aiming at better technological solutions for these centres for general access to Internet; and is answering to these targets of the eEurope Action Plan earmarking funds of the Information Society Technologies – IST programme for 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0303"></a>

<p>Currently, all parties are intensively working to implement the agreement under Article V of the Melk Protocol for the Czech Republic to conduct a voluntary environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedure with regard to the Temelín nuclear power plant, to be guided by the EIA Directive. The Czech EIA Commission has met in Prague with international participants on 13 February and 1 March 2001. The next meeting will be held on 4/5 April. As part of its good offices of mediation, the Commission assists and monitors the implementation of Chapter V of the Melk Protocol. Consequently, it has actively and constructively participated in the consultations of the Czech EIA Commission. In this process, designated observers from Austria and Germany represent the interests of their respective countries.</p>
<p>With regard to the modalities of the work of the EIA Commission, Austria and the Czech Republic concluded a bilateral agreement documented in the Joint Statement of Ministers Kavan (Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Czech Republic) and Molterer (Minister of Agriculture and Environment, Austria) of 13 February 2001. Accordingly, the decisions of the steering body shall take the positions of the Austrian representatives into consideration.</p>
<p>The Czech EIA Commission heard the arguments presented by Austria and Germany in its sessions of 13 February and 1 March 2001 in order to take them into consideration in its autonomous decisions. As mentioned by the honourable Member, the Czech authorities consequently published, in a transparent manner, the “scoping list” finally established by the EIA Commission after intensive consultations. Effectively, this list, although comprehensive, does not comprise all suggestions made by Austria. The joint statement between Ministers Kavan and Molterer does not foresee a requirement for full agreement between the Czech authorities and the Austrian positions. The EIA Directive that is to guide the procedure under Chapter V of the Melk Protocol does not even foresee the inclusion of neighbouring countries into the steering body of the EIA procedure. This is a unilateral confidence building measure offered by the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Austria and the Czech Republic have agreed that so-called severe accidents should be dealt with in a separate forum. Modalities are still being discussed. This forum has been convened for 4 April 2001 in Prague.</p>
<p>The texts of the “scoping list” and the decision on the separate forum to deal with severe accidents are publicly available on the web site of the Czech Foreign Ministry.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0305"></a>

<p>Article 24 (1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agriculture products lays down that on application by the exporter Member States shall advance all or part of the amount of the refund, once the export declaration has been accepted, subject to the lodging of a sufficient security to guarantee an eventual repayment of the amount advanced. The entitlement to the advance implies that at least the following elements are in the hands of the paying agency, namely when the application for the advance, the export declaration duly accepted and a sufficient security are available to the competent authority. Once these elements have been processed by the paying agency and if everything is in order, the claim should be settle at once.</p>
<p>There is no time-limit for the release of securities lodged for the export refunds claims. The rules governing securities and their release are given by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 19852 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products which in Article 21 states that : “Once the evidence laid down by the specific Regulation has been furnished … the security shall be released”.</p>
<p>The Commission has already expressed his opinion on these questions to the Danish authorities by his letter of 19 March 2001.</p>
<p>The question of a reasonable practice for the release of securities lies on the Member States which are responsible for the application of the Community legislation and for the day to day management of agricultural expenditure.</p>
<p>Some level of delay in the release of securities has been identified in several Member States. If there are problems of delay in the release of securities in Denmark then this is primarily a question for the Danish authorities. The Commission will, in 2001, carry out an audit where this question will also be followed up. The Commission can propose financial corrections in the event of inadequate management and control systems but, by doing so, it has to take into account whether the existence of a poor control system leads to a risk of loss of Community monies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>It emerged during a hearing at the European Parliament that a large amount of aid is paid out to subsidise the transport of animals for slaughter, without proper checks being carried out to verify compliance with the rules on the transport of animals, that only a fraction of EU-subsidised animal transport operations are checked and that infringements of EU rules are a regular occurrence. What does the Commission propose to do to put a stop to this situation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With regards to payments in export refunds for the cattle trade (slaughtering and breeding animals), the total amount paid in 2000 (10 months) was &#x80; 110.8 million. During the last year subsidies paid for cattle traded for slaughtering were reduced significantly from &#x80; 60.50 /100 kg to &#x80; 41.00 /100 kg, following the development of export refunds for meat.</p>
<p>Concerning the control of animal transport rules, Commission Regulation (EC) No 615/98 of 18 March 1998 laying down specific detailed rules of application for the export refund arrangements as regards the welfare of live bovine animals during transport stipulates that the payment of export refunds for live bovine animals is subject to compliance, during the transport of the animal up to the first place of unloading in the country of final destination, with the welfare provisions of Council Directive 91/628/EEC of 19 November 1991 on the protection of animals during transport amending Directives 90/425/EEC and 91/496/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 615/98. A recent report from the Commission has pointed out important deficiencies in implementing the Directive 91/628/EEC, which is a responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p>Regulation (EC) n° 615/98 provides measures to ensure that an official veterinarian at the point of exit of the Community effects systematic checks on all consignments with regards to all aspects of the journey which can be possibly verified at this stage (in particular, fitness of the animals, means of transport complying with the provisions of the Directive 91/628/EEC and that provisions have been taken to feed and water the animals).</p>
<p>Moreover, specific checks are carried out in third countries under the provisions laid down in Articles 3 and 4 of this Regulation. As a result of the checks, the payment of export refunds was refused for 3150 animals during the period 01/09/1998 – 30/06/2000.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is currently undertaking an inquiry in several Member States with regards to the implementation of the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 615/98. It results may lead to correction following the clearance of accounts procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
