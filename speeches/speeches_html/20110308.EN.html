Allow me to start by thanking all those who took part in this report and, in particular, the shadow rapporteurs from the various political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The work has resulted in a broad consensus, as shown by the vote last week in the Committee on Budgets, where this report was passed by 34 votes to 1, with 1 abstention. This report aims to be in harmony and in line with the current moment: with the economic, financial and social situation through which we are struggling, with the crisis that we are experiencing, and, at the same time, with what the European public wants from the European Union and its institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have a budget of restrictions, a budget of austerity and, at the same time, a budget which will have to provide the institutions and Parliament with the means to keep up with the European project and to keep up with the European public’s expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is excellence in lawmaking and it would be very bad if we lacked sufficient means to achieve this: it would be a terrible sign for our times and it would have a cost, which the European public would still have to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve this, we will need the necessary resources. We have new powers resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon. However, given the current situation, we advocate a neutral increase, which means that we advocate an increase equal to inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in line with the Commissioner’s letter, with the recommendation that he sent to Parliament and the other institutions. Therefore, when it becomes necessary, if it becomes necessary, we will draw up a letter or an amending budget for the purpose of commitments such as that which the European Union has to Croatia, or that resulting from the eight new members of the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for us to achieve a savings budget, it is clear that we have, more than ever, to follow the principles of good management and economy, the principles of efficiency and effectiveness. These principles will have to translate to budgetary rigour, simplicity and transparency. With these principles, we will already be able to successfully identify cuts, not only in the estimates that we will now prepare, but we also want savings in the implementation of the 2012 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, we will manage to keep up with our responsibilities. We would also like – and introduced this concept – a budget that is a zero-based budget, in which each expense is justified and in which variable expenses are well known; wherever justified, there can be a cost-benefit analysis for these expenses.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, we will not endanger projects under way because that would not simply be a backward step, but would rather be a loss. I am referring to projects such as the extension of the Konrad Adenauer Building, projects such as the House of European History; these projects will go ahead under this budget of restrictions. We also argue, on this basis, that forthcoming budgets should be multiannual budgets, so that there can be overall planning right from the outset; overall planning that is in accordance and in line with the multiannual financial framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the principles set by the rapporteur, Mr Fernandes, on budgetary vigour, especially as regards the administrative budgets of the European Union. For me, this is sure that this is the line to be taken under the present economic conditions in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, with this in mind, I asked my colleagues in the Commission to be particularly sensitive to increases in administration and we can promise that our increase should be less than 1%. This means, given that there are some contractual obligations, that there are cuts for 2012 in the areas of information technology, meetings, conferences and mission costs, as well as in the area of studies and publication.</p>
<p class="contents">I have written a letter to the heads of the other institutions and here is their response. I think this is really the line to be taken for 2011 as regards administrative expenditure. We have indications from the Council that they are also to be very restrictive.</p>
<p class="contents">The same principle should be applied as regards future enlargement. I think the estimates should be included in the budget when the formal decision on the date of accession is taken, in the form of an amending letter or amending budget. However, I have to remind you on this very occasion that administration only accounts for less than 6% of the European Union budget, so this is quite a decent proportion.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the operational expenditure, the European budget has its own internal logic. The programmes are gaining maturity with time, so we now have maturity of major programmes that started in 2007. The European budget is mainly about investment and not consumption and social transfers. On the one hand, we should be very restrictive as regards administrative expenditure, but on the other hand, we should understand the logic of the internal dynamics of European budgets, otherwise we will produce a lot of so-called ‘RAL’ (<span class="italic">reste à liquider</span>), which constitute a mountain of unspent money, unspent commitments, and this is not in line with a decent budgetary procedure</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome once more the principles we can see in the report by Mr Fernandes. We are to hold discussions on the basis of guidelines on 30 March and I am looking forward to our meeting towards trialogue on 30 March. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We normally expect from the Commission that its responsible members should be present; we should also expect the same from our most senior representative.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to address the subject of the management of the House’s buildings. I welcome the fact that the KAD project in Luxembourg is making progress, that it would seem that the costs are under control, and that things are going according to plan. When the KAD extension project is complete, bringing staff together under one roof should lead to greater efficiency and synergy, as well as reducing annual costs, because eight offices will be closed. It is essential that this target should be met as we need some of these funds for other purposes, as Mr Fernandes has pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the House of European History is an important project because it will attract many visitors, who will be offered an insight into the significance, aims and purpose of the European Union in the context of European history in a very effective way.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I would ask that the staff appointed in Luxembourg should be relocated to Brussels. Because they frequently need to work in Brussels, they are constantly travelling back and forth, also causing problems for the Members. This only applies to a small number of sub-areas and relocation really should be considered on efficiency grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I think it a very good thing that the European Parliament is only making provision for moderate expansion. The fact that other areas are only expanding on a modest scale should not be taken by the EEAS as a reason for massive expansion. I would call on all institutions to cut their cloth to their measure in these times of economic and financial difficulty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his report, but also for his approach to putting together the other sections’ budget. He is right to balance the need to ensure that the European Parliament and other sections are able to function properly against ensuring that budget increases are kept to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome his proposal to keep increases within the rate of inflation. I believe the initial proposal of 5.2% is far too high. Of course, to achieve the moderate savings pursued by the rapporteur and others within the Parliament, we need to ensure we also identify savings within the budget. I have therefore offered to work with the rapporteur to ensure those savings are found. I believe there are potential savings to be found in things like the buildings policy and in terms of enlargement – which the Commissioner has mentioned himself – but also in things like the proposed cost of a non-European office, which I believe at this time is an unaffordable luxury.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, can I say we also need to work very closely with other institutions, particularly the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee, which I know were very concerned about their budget for 2012 as well. We need to ensure that they, like us, are able to function properly but also, at the same time, limit their spending increases for the future. So I can say that the Socialists and Democrats Group is very keen to work with the rapporteur; we do support the proposals for these guidelines, and we look forward next week to discussing the estimates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The key principles of good budgetary management are efficiency, thrift and the responsible deployment of the financial resources entrusted to us. However, something that arises again and again in all budget negotiations, and which we need to avoid here once again, is greed and the desire to hold on to our old ways. We need to distinguish between greed and need.</p>
<p class="contents">There is little doubt that the job increases outlined in the Treaty of Lisbon and required as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon are something necessary. Care should be taken to ensure a balance between the jobs in political groups and committees and administrative posts. As my fellow Member has already observed, it would have been good to have the Secretary-General attend this session to hear what we have to say. The new departments referred to by Mr Vaughan are not needed in this form if we make sensible use of the synergy effects within this House. We have plenty of competent people in the various Directorates General and I am sure that we will be able to bring them together in an effective way.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the House of History, I would agree with Mrs Hohlmeier that it is important that such a project should have a business plan from the start. We should not regard this as something of a request show in which everyone gets what they want; we need to manage our resources wisely on the basis of a reasonable budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would add that we should not make the mistake of failing to invest in the future because of a misguided wish to save money. The investments we make today, for example in IT resources, can save us a lot of money in the coming years, which is why thrift should not be allowed to become an end in itself. It must make sense and must be reasonable in terms of the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To the outside world, the Parliamentary budget is still something like the European Parliament’s calling card and continues to have a symbolic significance: How do we deal with the austerity policy – the necessity for this policy – as it impacts directly on us?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fernandes uses words like consolidation, containment and self-restraint. However, we have heard few real proposals so far about where he intends to make the cuts and where resources are to be pared back. Of course, it is right to call for greater efficiency in the administration of Parliament and, from my own point of view, I can see some scope for improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to address the issue of the House of European History: I am all for this idea in principle. However, I believe that the project must have clear business plans. If there is a desire to prioritise such a project – I am directing these words specifically to Mr Fernandes once again – if terms like self-discipline and consolidation are really meant seriously, then we must also be prepared to propose cuts in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">If priorities exist as a result of political will, then, by definition, other areas must be given secondary priority in order to produce a consolidated budget. To talk about consolidation without making the relevant recommendations is to fudge the issue. The matter will only work if people are prepared to say where the cuts are to fall – particularly in the case of new priorities. This is what I meant when I referred to the European Parliament’s calling card: limited increases, as well as clear self-restraint. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The principles that he sets out – legislative excellence, good management principles, being able to have accuracy and simplicity, and submitting cost-cutting plans – should apply not just to all institutions other than the Commission, but also to the Commission budget itself.</p>
<p class="contents">However, looking at the technological points that the rapporteur makes, it is not just in the longer term that we should be looking for savings, but also in the short term, when we should be able to come up with cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p class="contents">One particular point of concern to my group is security. We seem to place too much emphasis on stopping people coming into the institutions. We do not allow them enough freedom of access or the possibility to circulate. Could I suggest that, when the Vice-Presidents come to this particular point, they should be looking at the US Congress, which does ensure the security of people going into the building, but then allows them to flow freely through it. Having a professional security service enables that to happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is not easy to speak about institutions’ budgets and resource management, especially if you try to discuss the improvement in their performance in parallel with the need for economic consolidation which Member States and the European Union must face up to in a context as sensitive as it is today. It is precisely for this reason that I fully support his appeal to the values of legislative excellence and sound financial management, which are guiding principles on which all the institutions’ activities should be based.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, at a time of crisis in which our primary objective must be to relaunch the European economy, the prime example of virtue must come from the institutions themselves. Virtue does not just mean austerity, but rather increased administrative efficiency to ensure a fair and improved use of resources, which will enable all the institutions to work both effectively and efficiently, rendering them capable of reaching the main objectives that Europe has set itself in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning more specifically to Parliament’s budget, I believe, as does Mr Fernandes, that the 2012 budget should be one of consolidation, taking into account that it could become a point of reference, rather than the current debate on the future multiannual financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that part of the resources should be used to bring in some necessary improvements to enable Members to carry out their duties with the help of quality services.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think savings should be made in common services, but that further efforts should also be made on the property policy, by rationalising the space already available to us and by adopting a medium- and long-term plan that allows advance planning of expenditure on buildings as well as making our decisions in this area more transparent and rational. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would call on you all to be a little more objective in your knee-jerk responses to the discussion in relation to the agencies. Why is this? Firstly, because the Committee on Budgetary Control is permanently engaged in this debate and also draws attention to ways in which cooperation between the agencies and the performance of their duties can be improved, and also because we are expecting a special report on the agencies this year from the European Court of Auditors and will then have a more objective basis for what is, at present, a somewhat ill-considered discussion, particularly with regard to the question of how the agencies are managed and how we may be able to achieve these savings.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking of savings, I would like to come to my next topic, our building policy. The fact is that when it comes to the buildings of the European Union, we can certainly save resources. Speaking personally, I would question whether it is really a good idea to build new buildings for the European Parliament in Brussels because this strategy really only makes sense if real estate prices in Brussels continuously rise. At present, the market would not seem to support this. If real estate prices on the market do not rise, then the option of renting rather than buying really does make sense, particularly when you walk around the European quarter with your eyes open and see how much office space is actually available to rent in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings me to the issue of the House of European History. I believe that greater legitimacy is required here because it is not enough that to date, all the initiatives for the establishment of the House of European History are simply based on resolutions by the Bureau of this House and have no democratic legitimacy. This needs to change. Above all, we need to know how the operating costs and follow-up costs of this institution are to be covered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this letter was very apt, and it will help to establish the approach that we believe will make it easier for us to insist on savings being made, and I think that has to apply to all institutions. It has to apply to the Committee of the Regions, to the Economic and Social Committee, and to the Court of Justice, whose expenditure has, of course, been rising sharply. It must also apply to the Court of Auditors. It is a little more difficult for small institutions like the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, and that, of course, is something that we need to take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that we in Parliament have a particular responsibility to demonstrate that we can show restraint. We have had new tasks conferred on us by the Treaty of Lisbon which involve additional expenditure, but the forthcoming year, 2012, must be a year of consolidation. We have talked about enlargement. We will include Croatia’s accession in an amending budget. Many people have also mentioned the question of the House of European History. I think it is an excellent idea to have this House of European History as part of our visitor services. Many young people do not know the history leading up to the establishment of the EU very well, and it is said that if we do not know our history, we are doomed to repeat it. I think it is very, very important for Europe’s recent history to be told, and therefore we will support this House of European History.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to say that our expenditure is, of course, very much linked to the fact that we have several seats, and that costs money. We need to look closely at this. Unfortunately, our biggest cost is something that we cannot do anything about. That has to do with the fact that we have to move between Strasbourg and Brussels. If the European Council really believes that savings have to be made, Europe’s Heads of State ought to address this matter. Thank you, Madam President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament must therefore adapt its budget strategy to this fact. We must strive for maximum budgetary discipline and austerity. I am pleased to find this fact in the report, and to see that the report emphasises this fact. Austerity, however, cannot mean that expenditure rises in line with inflation. Our aim must be to keep Parliament’s expenditure at the same level as this year. All possible effort must be directed towards savings and the better use of existing parliamentary resources. This must apply to all areas of European Parliament activity, starting with a rationalisation of the administration of buildings through to the better use of information technology and the human resources policy. There are potential savings here and we must have the courage to implement them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are doing at present is actually spending even more.</p>
<p class="contents">The voters’ questions and comments are absolutely spot-on. We, as the European Union, should be setting an example. We should be cutting our coat according to our cloth and, at precisely this point, we have no choice but to come to the unfortunate conclusion that this report by Mr Fernandes is something of a missed opportunity. Calls are being made – and rightly so, I think – for us to exercise responsibility and restraint with regard to the budget. Recital A even mentions, quote, ‘employing strict management procedures so that savings may be achieved,’ unquote.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, it is unfortunate that this report fails to specify where exactly we could make those cuts. There are, of course, quite a few areas where they could be made – I am thinking of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, and the trips between Brussels and Strasbourg which cost EUR 200 million per year. I challenge the Commission and the Council, but Parliament too, to carry out an exercise and put all these things in order, to look at where we can make savings and then translate this into an actual plan, so that we can put a number of things to debate and bring about savings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Everyone here is talking now about thrift, and that is an excellent thing. We need budgetary discipline and efficiency, and we should adhere strictly to what our main task is and not expand beyond that task, which is legislative work.</p>
<p class="contents">Most are saying that we must be frugal, but nonetheless talk about what we should not save. We should be talking about concrete measures that would enable us to make savings. We can make savings if we stop travelling between three places of work. We, of course, know how politically difficult it would be to carry this through.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise one matter, and that is the notion of security, which Mr Elles mentioned here. In a year, we have had a bank robbery, the canteen has been held up, and so has the post office. No one has even been caught. The security is little more than a joke.</p>
<p class="contents">We fail in one obvious area: Members of Parliament enter the building where there is no proper controlled entrance. We should acquire an electronic signature. At present, we have lists and an office where a lot of people work and which takes down names and enters them in a computer. This is a waste of money: we should be making savings and introduce a better, credible system of security. We only have to do it, but Members say no all the time and that they do not agree with electronic signatures, even though that way, we would make obvious savings and have a better system of security.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not understand how this works in the US Congress; there, everyone agrees with this system, but here, somehow, these things do not get done. I hope that we will now focus on areas where savings can truly be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At a time when Member States are forced to make savings, and our citizens are bearing the consequences of the financial and political crisis, we cannot expect a big increase in the budget compared to the previous year.

<p class="contents">I believe we have some direct spare capacity in the way we organise our work. The three headquarters of the European Parliament and the regular shuttling of thousands of workers and MEPs from Brussels to Strasbourg 12 times a year are well known to the public. Ladies and gentlemen, such a squandering of public resources shows nothing more than contempt for the realities of the situation.</p>

I, too, believe that the 2012 budget should be realistic and adapted to the current economic situation. As a result of my many years of experience of managing a regional budget and my membership of the Committee on Budgets, I attach particular important to discipline when it comes to planning expenditure. I believe, however, that we should avoid false economies, which may result in an economic slowdown and a reduction in economic competitiveness. Increased employment levels and the creation of high quality, sustainable jobs are a prerequisite for economic growth and overcoming the effects of the crisis. The European Union budget must promote increased employment. The key to growth lies not in reducing expenditure, but in increasing efficiency and linking European funds to the achievement of strategic and measurable results.

Does the European Parliament have a full role in making this codecision and is this also to be an issue this week in the context of the widening of the safety net?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have a comment to make on the EUR 1 500 increase in the secretarial allowance. I would ask all the Members who do not make full use of the secretarial allowance to state publicly how much money they save themselves – after all, this is an area open to abuse. It may be that there are some Members who do not need to use the secretarial allowance at all because they very rarely attend Parliament. In such cases, these funds should not be used up in full. Only those who work particularly hard could use up the entire allowance. Everyone else should return this money to the taxpayer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would agree with those members who have said that savings are necessary, especially making budget savings.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that the European budget has been shrinking for decades. Looking at the GDP we have generated in the EU, its volume has constantly decreased. Recently, the Commissioner has said that, at the very beginning of the financial perspective, EU gross domestic product was approximately 1.3%. That figure today is barely 1.12%. At the same time, though, national European budgets have increased significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, over the past ten years, the proverbially modest UK budget has increased by 100%, hence two and half times more than the EU budget. I would like to hear the Commissioner comment, in particular, on whether he is likely to encounter any difficulties in implementing the next budget in 2012 because of this actual decrease in the European budget as compared to the national budgets of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mariya Nedelcheva, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mrs Reding, ladies and gentlemen, I was born in 1979 at a time when European citizens were directly electing their representatives for the first time. I am proud of the fact that in this same year, for the first time ever, a woman – Simone Veil – a valiant supporter of women’s rights, assumed the Presidency of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I am one of the 35% of women represented here in this Chamber. Never before has this figure been so high in the European Parliament. So whom do we owe it to? We owe it to all those women who had the intelligence, the strength and the courage to join together and demand their right to vote, their right to work and to education. We owe it to those women who, quite simply, wanted to champion respect for their dignity and for their rights. We have been fighting for 100 years now to combat unfair and groundless discrimination. Significant progress has certainly been made, but combating gender inequalities is a day to day task and we have still a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has always led the way when it comes to gender equality. I believe that this House of ours must ensure that it stays at the forefront of this momentum even when it comes to the most sensitive of subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">The present economic crisis has made us face our own contradictions. As highlighted in my report, the effects of the crisis have been felt more severely by women and its effects longer lasting for them than is the case for men. As I also pointed out, however, we need to stop feeling sorry for ourselves, get a move on and come up with the answers! We should take this opportunity to alter our frames of mind and move forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now vital to emphasise the role that schools play in combating gender stereotypes. By providing wider opportunities in education, vocational training and employment, we can improve women’s access to higher levels of responsibility. It is also time to put a stop to the persistent pay gap between men and women and I also believe we need to step up a gear when we look at the composition of boards of publicly listed companies. Only 3% of board members of publicly listed companies are women. That is not acceptable. Time to step on the gas. What if, despite all our efforts, the big companies keep applying the brakes? Well then, unfortunately, we will have to raise the spectre of quotas and binding targets. It is with reluctance that I speak of quotas because, in principle, I am not in favour of them. But if the carrot does not work, well then, the only alternative would be the stick. There is no denying it: the presence of women on the labour market can only benefit economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The European recovery plan will have a greater chance of success today if gender equality policies are an integral part of it. Concrete proposals to achieve a better work-life balance must be put forward to demonstrate that our ambitions can be more than mere dreams, because that is what is expected of us. It is all very well being driven by values and ideals, but we must also be pragmatic and effective in our work.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, I should like to raise one last point. I was pleased to hear that the European Commission was going to make a proposal in the spring to combat violence against women. The scourge of violence against women in all its forms needs to be fought with all our might. I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for being so proactive on this matter</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I am not a pessimist so I would like to end on a positive note, if I may. I think that on this day, the one hundredth anniversary of International Women’s Day, we should pay tribute to the courage, strength and determination shown by women in Tunisia, Libya, Iran, Egypt and by countless others in their struggle to defend human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The wind of freedom sweeping across North Africa should wipe out the last vestiges of authoritarianism, poverty and social exclusion, so that women in these countries become socially, politically and economically emancipated whilst respecting their culture and their traditions. It is also our role in the European Parliament to pay tribute to these women, encourage them and support them in their desperate struggle for democracy and human rights. Please note that I mean human rights in the fullest sense of the term! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to thank all my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs and the members of the secretariat for their contributions to this report.</p>
<p class="contents">My report deals with an issue which is both general and eminently concrete in terms of its consequences: female poverty. 85 million Europeans live below the poverty line and 17% of all women in the EU are classed as living in poverty. These are the facts. The economic, financial and social crisis affects all of us, but it particularly harms women in the labour market and in their personal lives, since they are more likely to be in insecure jobs, more likely to be made redundant and less likely to have social security.</p>
<p class="contents">This is how things stand at present. What can we do? Women are expecting us to provide concrete proposals, concrete measures. It is 8 March, and I shall try to summarise my report in eight points.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, we call on the Member States to take into account the gender dimension in their plans for recovery from the recession by promoting and boosting the employment of women, and adopting specific measures as well as adjusting budgets to ensure equality of access to public sector expenditure, with a view to both enhancing productive capacity and meeting women’s social and environmental needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we call on the Commission and the Member States to take the appropriate measures to eliminate gender inequalities in employment as part of Europe 2020. I strongly encourage establishing as an objective the reduction of the gender pay gap by 1% each year, in order to achieve the target of 10% reduction by 2020. I stress also the need for positive action to increase women’s representation in political, economic and corporate decision-making bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is related to reconciliation between private and professional life. I call on the Council and the Member States to renew and fulfil their commitments related to the Barcelona targets for the provision of accessible, affordable and high quality childcare, and to develop new targets for the care of dependent persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, we call on the Commission and Member States to frame health policies which aim to combat and prevent practices that harm women’s health and cause social exclusion and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, we call on the Member States to adopt the necessary measures in order to offer better opportunities for women in education while fighting stereotypes and eliminating traditional role models in school curricula.</p>
<p class="contents">Our sixth point is that there is a direct link between families’ social circumstances and children’s growth. Therefore, we call on the Commission and the Council to develop and implement a strategy to halve child poverty by 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Seventh, we should not ignore violence against women. It has an increasing impact on the risk of marginalisation, poverty and social exclusion. I call on the Commission to establish a European Year for combating violence against women.</p>

I think that is very symbolic and it is also very symbolic that we can, during this day, debate these very important issues on the agenda – thanks to the rapporteur, Mariya Nedelcheva – which shows a great support for the Commission’s work towards gender equality and focuses on important issues that the Commission has emphasised and will continue to emphasise.</p>
<p class="contents">One hundred years of struggle and we still do not see the end of it. I regret that because I always hope that we can eliminate, if you like, the yearly celebration of the struggle of women, but as long as we have not arrived there, we cannot do so, and we have not arrived there yet. Parliament’s report shows very clearly what the gaps are. The gaps are in poverty: we have heard the second report on this too. On poverty, women are leading so there is not a gap in this sense, but what are we doing – and my colleague, Lászlo Andor will answer this – to get women out of the poverty trap?</p>
<p class="contents">The second element is women in the world of employment. There are still some problems concerning the balance between family life and professional life. There is the problem of the pay gap where women still earn 17% less on average than men – and you might have seen that on 5 March, we had the European Gender Pay Gap Day, with measurements to see how much more women have to work than men in order to reach the same level of pay. The fact is that we were, in effect, not paid until 5 March; we had to work until then without being paid. Only from 5 March on did we start to be paid. I hope that one day, the gender pay gap day will be on 1 January, which would mean that there would be equal pay at that moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The political commitment of the European Commission is contained in our new strategy. The themes which are mentioned in our strategy for gender equality are the same as the ones the rapporteur has mentioned: economic independence for women, gender pay gap, violence against women and promoting gender equality in external actions.</p>
<p class="contents">To start with external actions, you might have seen Cathy Ashton and myself on 8 March speaking to women outside of Europe and saluting the courage of all those women who are fighting to survive and who are fighting for the establishment of a democracy; we need to make it clear that we are standing by their side. Speaking about all these upheavals, speaking about the wars and speaking about the genocides, which unfortunately continue to go on, you all know that women are in the front row. Women and children are the most vulnerable in our societies but also in the societies outside, and that is why the Commission is working to streamline its various policy initiatives on violence against women and to create synergies between areas with similar objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is where we are in developing a coherent policy response to tackle this huge problem: my link is concrete actions in areas where there are clear legal bases in order to have efficiency, and in this regard, I am going to present a victims’ rights package in May this year in which legislation to help women and children will, of course, be very high on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe I should finish with a theme which has been high on the agenda in these last few days. You know that on 1 March, I brought the CEOs of large European listed companies around a table to tell them that we do not agree anymore with the 90% quota for men on boards of directors – because that is what is happening. There is only one woman for ten men on boards, which means a 90% de facto quota for men. So we think that this should be tackled, mainly because all the economic evidence and the scientific evidence on economic functioning shows very clearly that companies with an balanced decision-making structure have a higher return on investment and make more profits than companies with solely male decision-making structures.</p>
<p class="contents">So women mean business; it is in the interests of economic development that women take more responsibility. Here, I have challenged publicly listed companies in Europe to sign a ‘Women on the Board Pledge for Europe’ by March 2012: to pledge to replace outgoing gentlemen on the board by qualified women – and there are so many that it should not be difficult to find these women. We are going to see, to observe, to analyse and to count what is happening between today and 8 March next year, and if nothing changes, then I am prepared to take action at EU level to redress the gender balance in corporate board rooms.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Andor, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, this is indeed a remarkable anniversary and it is a great responsibility to participate in this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I wish to thank the rapporteurs from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the associated Committee on Employment and Social Affairs respectively for their report. This report is very timely because the issue it highlights has been on the agenda for a while, but it has become more pressing as a result of the impact of the financial and economic crisis on vulnerable groups in society.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me highlight some of the key elements in my employment and social policies that I believe will improve working opportunities and conditions for women. There are indeed urgent measures that the Member States need to take in these areas. For instance, they need to reduce labour market segmentation by readjusting the balance in employment protection legislation between those workers on permanent contracts and those on time-limited, precarious contracts – which is so often the case for women.</p>
<p class="contents">They also need to strike a better balance between work and private or family life and to remove other disincentives to participation in the workforce by second earners, who again are mostly women.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to increase the employment rate in the EU and the key challenge in this area is the participation in the labour market by all workers, both male and female. I believe that the European Social Fund will have to be better and more robustly used in the future to support the demand-side policies to open new opportunities for women, especially those returning to the labour market after childbirth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a source of great concern to the Commission that over 80 million people are at risk of poverty in today’s European Union. The Member States have the main responsibility for fighting against poverty, but the Union has a role to play. That is what some three-quarters – 74% – of our fellow Europeans believe, according to the Eurobarometer surveys.</p>
<p class="contents">The flagship initiative, the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion, includes proposals for practical measures to achieve the numerical poverty reduction target. The Platform focuses on the continuing importance of active inclusion for people furthest from the labour market. As I have already pointed out, women make up an important component of that category. In 2012, the Commission will present a communication assessing in depth the implementation of active inclusion strategies at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned that more than 80 million people are at risk of poverty in today’s European Union. What is even more worrying is that over 20 million children are among them and the figure has not improved over time. Helping to lift those children out of poverty means helping to lift their parents out of poverty too, in particular, the single parents, who are mostly women. This calls for a multidimensional approach, covering employment policies to help parents find work, the design of tax benefit systems, and the provision of key services, such as housing, quality childcare and education, and protection of children’s rights. As foreseen in the Platform, the Commission intends to put forward a recommendation in 2012 on child poverty. It will outline common principles and effective monitoring tools to combat and prevent poverty in early life.</p>
<p class="contents">Providing the funding to meet those challenges is also crucial. Almost a third of the European Social Fund’s allocation of EUR 21.7 billion for the present programming period goes to measures to improve access to employment. In addition, almost EUR 3 billion – 2.77 to be precise – from that allocation goes to supporting self-employment and business start-ups, and the beneficiaries are very often women.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the European Progress Microfinance Facility has recently been established to support job creation and self-employment. The Facility provides loans to people who have lost their jobs and want to start up or develop their own small businesses. It pays special attention to women and young people. A budget of EUR 100 million has been made available over four years but can be increased to more than EUR 500 million in the joint initiative with the international financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last ten years, EU cooperation under the open method of coordination on social inclusion and social protection has helped to raise awareness and promote the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion set the frame to reduce poverty across the whole range of policy areas. Let us do our utmost to make sure it achieves its aim. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, on the other side, any report on equality should not forget that men are also disadvantaged in some respects. In particular, boys are not always given the opportunity to develop in school. Deficits exist in the area of housework and childcare and men can become more active here, too. This is one task we should all adopt for ourselves. Each of us, whatever our gender, should be given an opportunity to find our niche and live our lives as we see fit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is revealed not only by the earnings gap between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite their increasing involvement in the labour market, statistics in all 27 Member States of the European Union show that women are at greater risk of poverty than men. There are many reasons why poverty is a female issue. I can only go into some of them because of a lack of time. The increase in the number of precarious jobs discriminates against women on several counts. Over 30% of women are employed in part-time work, compared with only 7.4% of men. Studies show that even in these part-time jobs, women are still paid significantly less than men for the same working hours and the same work. This reduces the opportunities to integrate in the labour market and pursue a career. Pension entitlements are reduced, so that poverty is pre-programmed, particularly for those who choose an independent, single life. However, we believe that a life free from poverty can be achieved by political means by developing social security systems in which pensions and minimum wage levels above the poverty threshold are guaranteed and working hours are generally reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to wait another hundred years to find out that it is self-evidently the right of women to organise their lives independently of male decisions, despite having child dependents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Women are traditionally at a higher risk of poverty, especially single mothers and women over the age of 65. Among the five objectives proposed by the European Commission in the EU 2020 strategy is the fight against poverty, which makes the report by Mrs Plumb extremely relevant, especially in terms of gender policies in the light of the economic and financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The vulnerability of individual women leaves them exposed to the risk of poverty, social exclusion and therefore isolation. This makes it incumbent on the institution we represent to put in place concrete strategies and programmes. I also congratulate Mrs Nedelcheva on a good report that promotes equality between men and women in the European Union. The representation of women in the public sector, as in the private sector, is very low compared with men. In the finance sector, the numbers are even less positive: women represent only 10% of board members of the major European listed companies and 3% of the chairpersons of those boards.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the introduction of quotas to increase the participation of women in the public and private sectors and especially in education; this must be supported because it plays a key role in preventing teachers from directing their students towards professional sectors according to gender stereotypes.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by recalling the words of one of the first American female mayors who said: ‘Whatever women do, they must do twice as well as men to be thought of as half as good’. In conclusion, let me say that luckily for us women, this is not difficult. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than a hundred years ago, women fought for the right to work, and now they have to fight to obtain equal pay for equal work. We are moving forward, but progress in the area of gender equality is slow. Discrimination still thrives in the workplace, there is deep segregation of the labour market according to gender, the pay gap continues, there is still a shortage of women in decision-making positions and politics and insufficient support for motherhood and single mothers. In the European Parliament’s report on equality between men and women, we established that it is crucial to strengthen the principle of gender equality in the family and society, to stop violence against women and trafficking in women, guarantee maternity leave, create suitable conditions to take advantage of the services of nurseries and childcare centres, reduce female poverty and assess the contribution made by women to the development of family, society and the economy. In order to achieve these objectives, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Member States must work together, and on this historic day, I would like to convey my greetings to all women and to call on them to continue to fight for their rights and equal opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us start with the employment sector and the gender pay gap. How long will we sit contemplating statistics showing unequal positions, with women paid up to 34% less than men in some EU Member States? We must push for measures – legislative if necessary – to achieve concrete results in practice and not just on paper.</p>
<p class="contents">The place of women in the European labour market, and the numerous obstacles they have to face in the form of discrimination, contribute to the rising phenomenon of women’s poverty. Too many women remain in a position of relative economic insecurity and dependence. They tend to be concentrated in part-time and temporary jobs that are less-well paid, or in inferior positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty gives rise to trafficking in women, to violence and, more generally, to exploitation of all kinds. We also know that as a result of poverty, women victims of domestic violence prefer not to take steps for their own protection because of a lack of financial security.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Reding, on this symbolic day, we look forward to the EU strategy on combating violence against women, as you have already promised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That calls for a celebration of everything we have achieved, such as the franchise for women, the right to equality and reproductive rights, at least in the more civilised countries. However, this is also a day for feeling sad about all the things that are still not as they should be. In the EU, women are still severely under-represented in decision making, caring responsibilities fall almost entirely on women’s shoulders and there is still a persistent income gap between men and women, including outside the EU, where some countries have not even begun working on giving women the franchise.</p>
<p class="contents">The hundredth anniversary of International Women’s Day also calls for an historical comparison. The first really major step for women in the labour market was taken during the two world wars, especially the Second World War. There were simply too few men to do the work in factories and offices. Employers no longer had a choice and women entered the labour market in large numbers. Such a period is upon us again. This time, not because of a war, fortunately, but because of an ageing population. In five to ten years, there will again simply be too few men to fill the vacancies at various levels. Employers need to attract and retain women. The ageing population could provide an ideal opportunity for gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to us, as European politicians, and it is up to our colleagues in national parliaments, to encourage this development by providing quality maternity leave for mothers <span class="italic">and</span> quality paternity leave for fathers, by providing a sufficient level of affordable childcare, by providing the right to flexible hours and part-time work with good social rights, by establishing quotas for women’s inclusion in corporate executive bodies and politics, or making credible threats to that effect. Together, we can ensure that it does not take <span class="italic">another</span> hundred years before men and women have equal rights and equal opportunities in every sphere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report brings together a whole range of issues which provide a very good description of the position of women in the EU. I am pleased that the report sets out many points indicating the need to make use of flexible forms of employment, and by that I mean both fixed-term employment and part-time employment, because in my opinion, single mothers in particular, and families in general with young children to raise, need to make use of the broad range on offer on the labour market, so that they can combine work life and family life. At the same time, of course, I welcome and fully support the fact that attention is drawn here again to the persistently large pay gap between women and men. I would briefly just like to say that the report also includes some issues we would find it difficult to support. This includes, for example, the call to create a European charter of women’s rights and the reference to the report on maternity leave, which, as we know, the Member States have not accepted. In this spirit, we have supported some of the amendment proposals. I should like to thank the rapporteur, as this is a genuinely good and comprehensive report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank all my fellow Members, all the NGOs – all those who are continuing the fight for equality. We are to debate the situation of women in the EU, but I think it is important for us today to also show our solidarity with those women who, right now, out on the streets and in the squares, are showing enormous courage by taking part in the fight for democracy and justice in other countries. I think we should also remember these women today.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports we are debating here illustrate the inequality on the labour market, where women have precarious jobs and suffer pay discrimination of an average of 17%. Only 6 out of 10 women in Europe participate in the labour market, and when they have a job, it is often a precarious part-time job that does not provide a decent living. There is nothing strange about this, because there are powerful forces opposing the expansion of childcare and other prerequisites for women to be able to work.</p>
<p class="contents">Equal opportunities on the labour market mean that we must have the Maternity Leave Directive – which I hope will also include paternity leave. I hope that we will soon be able to discuss parental insurance, where men and women take equal responsibility for providing for the family, but also for looking after the children. If women in the EU were to work to the same extent as men, prosperity would increase by more than a quarter. We cannot afford to do without women on the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Quotas are called for. I believe that quotas are a necessary instrument in a society in which only 3% of large companies are headed by women. I can compare the use of quotas with antibiotics. I do not like the excessive use of antibiotics, but when someone is ill, I am very pleased that they exist. It is certainly indicative of an ailing society if only 3% of women are in the leading roles of large companies. Quotas are therefore a necessary instrument for putting right what is wrong in our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is my opinion that you have made a complete dog’s breakfast of it. You talk about maternity leave. All that is happening with draconian maternity leave, let me tell you, Madam, is that fewer and fewer young women in my country are getting jobs because you would have to be stark staring mad to employ a young woman if you have a small business. So you have done them no favours.</p>
<p class="contents">We have equal opportunities for car insurance now due to another lunatic judgment by the European Court, which means that even if young women could get a job, they could not afford to drive to it because they have just had their car insurance doubled. And now you are talking about quotas. What kind of madness is this? Women who have worked all their lives to get to a position of responsibility in business – professional women – are being patronised on quotas. Now those women who have been successful will sit in a boardroom and people will look across that boardroom and say, are you a token woman or did you get there because you know your business? The whole thing is completely crazy and it is a tragedy that none of you have done a real job in your lives or you would understand this.</p>

This proves that good parental insurance means that we will also have higher employment figures for women, and men, too, of course. Parental insurance is good for equality on the labour market.

Women suffer disadvantage not just in the world of work, but also in society at large. The list seems endless, which is why I will confine myself to a few keywords: wage levels, working and appointment conditions, precarious employment contracts, pension entitlements, childcare, social security and various forms of violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">There are plenty of women who are better qualified than men and yet we find ourselves discussing equal pay for equal work – incredible. Something equally incredible is the fact that women are at greater risk of poverty than men; older women and single parents are particularly at risk. Let me remind you that 2010 was the Year for Combating Poverty. Poverty is a female issue. This has serious consequences for society because poverty leads to illness and can consequently result in unemployment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the debate on the wages of men and women, for example, we have been saying year after year that there is still a sizeable difference, even though the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’ was laid down in the Treaty of Rome already back in 1957. What is more, since 1975, we also have secondary legislation in this respect, although it is true that if we had to make a list of laws that are in effect but are not working, this one would obviously have a good chance of coming out on top. Indeed, as has already been mentioned here, the latest statistical data indicate that the current difference is 17.5%, but some of us still remember that a couple of years ago, this percentage was as low as 15%, while the variability is extremely high. And this is not the issue of small and large enterprises, and not only an issue for women; it is also an issue of social justice. We cannot state often enough that the wage difference, as has been pointed out by my fellow Member more or less in the same sense, is the punishment of women for motherhood, and is created when young women return to the labour market. And therein lies the true major problem: that small enterprises will never solve the problems of society. What Parliament requested in this regard, that is, to ensure a transparent distribution of salaries between genders, and to make sure that those who continuously violate this principle at least do not receive support from European funds, is, in my opinion, not much. True, there is some progress: the introduction of the ‘equal pay day’ represents some measure of progress, but the truly great achievement would have been if that day were held on 1 or 2 January instead of 5 March. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Why is it that when we are talking about quotas, someone always brings up merit? Is it just the merit of women that is being questioned? Is it the case that men do not have merit?

When it comes to gender equality, it is not just differences and social justice that are the issue. Gender equality is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion. Investing in gender equality measures will pay off in terms of a higher level of women’s employment, women’s contribution to GDP, a higher tax yield and sustainable fertility rates. Our understanding of gender equality is, for many, still at a medieval level today; or, at least, this is what we have heard in some speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a bogeyman in this subject, and this bogeyman is quotas. People are forgetting, or perhaps do not want to see, that a quota is not being imposed on decision-making positions, and that a quota will not put incompetent women in positions of power. In Europe, women are better educated, they are able to take responsibility, and they are able to work well and to get paid fairly for their work. Those countries where quotas are applied, where they were already being used 20 years ago – I am thinking here of Northern European countries – have indeed shown that our objectives can be achieved through this measure and these days, people have reconsidered their behaviour – quotas are not necessary to the same extent as they were in the past. It is considered the norm for women to participate in all areas of society. I would, of course, like to say many things about poverty as well as single mothers, but unfortunately time does not allow me to do so. Thank you to everyone who gave speeches – one day, we will be winning nonetheless! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are dealing with a report into women and poverty; one of the key reasons for this problem is wage inequality between women and men. As we have already heard, wage equality has been enshrined in the Treaties of Rome since 1957. However, the pay differential is still 17.5% throughout Europe and as high as 23% in Germany. In 2008, this House adopted a report on wage inequality thanks to the excellent work of Mrs Bauer. This report called on the Commission to instigate legislative initiatives to combat wage inequality. There has been no action since then. Furthermore, Commissioner Reding, all you have done is to designate 5 March as European Equal Pay Day, an announcement you made on Friday, 4 March. Lucky that you remembered to do this before the day had actually passed.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no more time for meaningless press releases. We do not want to hear nice words from you. We want you finally to take action so that the 100th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome will not be another day on which the pay differential between women and men is more than 0%. We want equal pay now.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to turn now to the issue of women’s quotas and to my fellow Member from England: I would like to know whether he believes that only 3% of women in England and throughout Europe ‘know how to do their business’. Perhaps that explains why there are so few women on supervisory boards? I do not think that this is the case. We need a quota.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Reding, you have said that businesses must commit to appoint women by next year. Is it your wish that we should have these commitments by next year, or that women should have been appointed by next year? I hear that you want the second objective I mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is worth reminding ourselves that it is women who are bearing the heaviest burden as a result of the financial crisis. It is primarily women who have felt the consequences of this crisis in terms of reduced employment levels, lower pay and restructuring measures. Furthermore, it is women who shoulder parental and child-rearing responsibilities while, at the same time, participating in the very difficult and ever-changing labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of women in the EU Member States is very diverse, and it is therefore extremely important to show solidarity and understanding for women in regions where the problem of poverty is particularly acute. The issue of unequal pay should force us to stop and think, since there are also pay differences in companies which are managed and owned by women. This is a worrying fact, and it requires that we give thought to whether the causes lie deeper, and whether administrative rules and regulations – hard law – are sufficient in this instance, or whether it is necessary to alter people’s awareness and culture in general. Nothing can replace respect and social culture, and legislation will not be enough either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In some countries, society is even taking backward steps.</p>
<p class="contents">When we highlight an historic date linked to women’s struggle for recognition and the exercising of their rights, we are highlighting the worsening of unemployment and unstable jobs, along with low wages, and discrimination in terms of wages and on the basis of maternity that assail women workers; these are taking on expressions that are particularly shocking and unacceptable in the younger generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Situations of loss of income are on the increase and women are getting poorer. The situations of disabled, immigrant and retired women with small pensions, and of low paid women workers, are particularly critical.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems faced by women in the rural world and in family agriculture are increasing, as are those of women running micro- and small enterprises. The impact of austerity measures in some countries, such as Portugal, Greece and Ireland, is having repercussions for the lives of women as workers, citizens and mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the case with the deliberate reduction of wages, the freezing of admissions to university courses, and the blocking of collective bargaining; and with the cuts to healthcare, education, social security and a variety of forms of social support.</p>
<p class="contents">Preventing the taking of measures, under the pretext of the crisis, which threaten women’s right to equality and to the necessary economic and social cohesion, is therefore a crucial issue. Fine words and declarations of good intentions are not enough. It is time to break with the neoliberal policies of the Stability and Growth Pact, with liberalisations and privatisations, and with free competition, which are always in the service of economic and financial interest groups. It is time to prioritise women and their rights, equality, and economic and social cohesion, so that we can have a better society; so that we can truly respect human rights and consolidate the progress that women have helped to build for our civilisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women cannot be worth half what men are in Arab counties or anywhere in the world. We are worth the same and deserve the same. I will continue fighting to achieve that equality and International Women’s Day will continue to exist until it is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if there are many who do not want to see it, the reality is that there are women who earn half of what men do and that domestic violence mainly affects women and children. I must repeat that these facts must continue to be reported in Parliament, and I promise to continue working toward that, of course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On this symbolic day marking 100 years of International Women’s Day, I could almost repeat word for word what was said last year as the fight is still ongoing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that women are more resilient to the current crisis in terms of job losses. As for combating violence against women, we look to the Commission to indicate what its intentions are, to agree to our call for the creation of a European Year highlighting this issue, and to put forward a strategy. I am told that this will happen soon, which I am delighted about.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, equal pay is not yet a reality despite the many efforts made by some Member States and by the European Commission, in particular. Paternity leave has also regrettably been rejected by Member States despite the all-out efforts of this Parliament and the right to abortion is still not recognised in four Member States of the Union and challenged in others.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the new Belgian law on quotas for female representation in companies and on company boards, as well as the tremendously proactive approach displayed on this matter by Mrs Reding and President Buzek even in the press on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we should, however, celebrate the fact that after 100 years, we are half way down the path to gender equality thanks to European and national laws. Let us stay on track so that it does not take another 100 years to achieve true gender equality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the 30 years between the first elections to the European Parliament and 2009, when I was elected, the representation of women has more than doubled. We now see women in major roles in politics, business, industry and the media. Perhaps most importantly, as a society, we have come to appreciate the necessity of the role of women and to recognise their contribution, winning equality along the way.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we need to be mindful of how far we push calls for more equality and in what areas. Our concern should be to focus on what is still wrong today. In the UK, women still account for under 20% of the Members of Parliament, nearly half of the companies in the FTSE 250 have no females in the boardroom at all, and only a fifth of all engineering, science and IT graduates are women. Given the diverse nature of our societies, this is clearly something that Member States need to address – without quotas and targets arbitrarily set at an EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, over and above representation, there are thousands of women across the EU, and indeed the world, who endure violence, exploitation and exclusion. They are the ones without a voice. It is those women – who suffer from discrimination, are deliberately discouraged from achievement, or are victims of repression – who surely deserve our absolute attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, I am in favour of equal treatment and equal opportunities for women and men. I have been successfully campaigning for this at national and European level for over 50 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the report on the equality of women and men in the EU 2010 once again contains exaggerated demands that are counterproductive for women in the final analysis. I do not have the time to explain them all here. It is through no fault of the rapporteur that the large number of amendments have made the report quite hard to digest.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the controversial question of whether the EU should impose a women’s quota in listed companies, I must warn against praising Norway as a shining example of such a measure. You may ask why. Since the introduction of the women’s quota between 2003 and 2009 the number of companies quoted on the stock market has decreased from 554 to 362. One in three companies gave the introduction of the women’s quota as the reason it withdrew from the stock market. In Norway, 70 women, known as ‘golden skirts’, occupy about 300 seats on management boards. This is warped, but very interesting. Speaking for myself, I might be attracted to the career of a ‘golden skirt’ as I have not been a member of a single management board so far. The Commission needs to think carefully and weigh up the consequences before reacting too hastily to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret that this report recommends in the same breath that women should be allowed easy access to contraception and abortion. In other words, abortion is equated with contraception as a simple means of birth control. This is an insult to women. I cannot agree to this, quite apart from the fact that the EU has no powers in this area – subsidiarité oblige! I regret the fact that some female Members consistently mix these two issues together. That is not necessary.</p>

All European societies are facing ageing populations, and pension systems all over Europe are being reformed. This is why the EU must send a signal that the lives of ordinary women are central to our concern.</p>
<p class="contents">On the fundamental issue of pensions, the European Commission should be leading the charge in closing the structural gaps between women and men. Women should not be disadvantaged for reasons beyond their power: the pay gap, as my colleague mentioned, taking care of relatives and non-decent work. Our first task is to raise awareness among women. We need to underline that during the ongoing discussions on pensions, the female factor has come up very rarely. We want policy makers to be aware of the effects of that and to make sure that precise data on women and pensions become available.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to conduct research on the gender effect in pension reforms in Europe and I am sure that Viviane Reding will do that. We need to look at best practices at national level and look into a European approach. It really is time to think about what we have achieved during the last 100 years. We need a clear future for our children.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to remind ourselves of what Clara Zetkin did one hundred years ago, because bridging the gender pay gap was her idea. It will be really important too that we make changes in the style of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire – remembering that Ginger Rogers had to do everything ‘backwards in high heels’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express my sincere thanks to Commissioner Reding for the measures she is taking at European level to reduce differences between women and men. However, the majority of these measures should be taken at national or Member State level. This is where fierce opposition is frequently met from politicians, institutions and public opinion. Women’s organisations therefore frequently call on the Commission for help. Yet grass-roots actions are of key importance, as in the case of Poland, where it was possible to overcome opposition thanks to a women’s social movement known as the Congress of Women. We collected over 100 000 signatures for a social and legal initiative and, as a result of a broad debate which mobilised public opinion, the Polish Parliament voted through 35% parity for women on all electoral lists, including those for European elections. I am very proud that Poland has joined the countries where parity is a legal requirement, and that it is the first of the new Member States to introduce this significant change. We will now carefully monitor what influence this has on women’s political participation. I would like to state clearly that we should set ourselves new goals straight away, and these goals should be equal pay for various groups of women and parity in other decision-making bodies. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, I hope that firm measures will be taken, including in the external actions of the European Commission, to establish links with these women.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in Europe, there is a great reawakening of women’s participation, starting with demands to respect the dignity of women in the media and in the behaviour of men in institutions, as was said in town squares on 13 February by 1 million Italian women and many concerned men.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the reports under discussion, I would note that there is a strong link between growing insecurity at work and in the lives of young women, even though they are better educated and more skilled, the inadequate protection of atypical female workers – which most young women are – during maternity and parenthood, the shortcomings of current policies for achieving balance and the lower rates of female employment, the more frequent instances of poverty among women and children, and the lower level of their pensions and, hence, their exclusion from decision-making powers.</p>
<p class="contents">While I agree with Mrs Reding’s initiative concerning boards of directors, I am less supportive of the initiative on insurance which risks penalising women in particular. Without this, there will be no Europe 2020. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What kind of contemporary society would invest in training young girls, as we do, only to then deny itself of 50% of the available intelligence in the workplace? That must not be the kind of society in which we live.

But after 10 years, I have realised that without quotas, we will not achieve anything. Without quotas, there will never be as many women as there are men</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">in positions of responsibility. I heard the President of Parliament support this view last week.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we really do need to go down this road now. You know that I was against quotas as I find it somewhat degrading having to protect women who should be able to progress on the basis of their skills. I feel we now need to resort to that approach, however.</p>

Half of all European women have experienced violence, and over one million suffer it on a daily basis. Work continues on the directive on violence against women, yet at the same time, there are countries in the European Union, including Poland, unfortunately, which allow themselves to use legally-sanctioned violence against women in the field of sexual and reproductive health.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of proper sex education and easy access to contraceptives mean that women who become pregnant, including those who are underage, are forced by law to give birth to the child. A pregnant woman is treated like an incubator, deprived of the right to decide for herself and of the right to health and privacy to which every man is entitled. The ban on abortion does not reduce the number of such procedures carried out. Anti-abortion legislation must be condemned, since it is a form of state violence against women and institutional discrimination against women. If men were the ones who became pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of many measures undertaken to ensure equal rights, the issue of the pay difference between women and men is still unresolved. Women are still in a more difficult situation; employers frequently assess their suitability for a job not on the basis of their qualifications, but on the basis of whether they will have children or not, or, if they already have them, who will look after them when they are ill. Nobody asks men or fathers such questions when they are being recruited. I would therefore stress the need for changes to the system, and for measures to be taken which change the way in which society perceives this problem, and which ensure that women themselves are liberated from the internal belief that only they are responsible for raising children, thus allowing these inequalities to be eradicated. Knowing the charisma and determination of Commissioner Reding, I believe that this will most certainly be achieved. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We share a new concern, and that is the feminisation of poverty. Although women do more work than men, men earn higher levels of pay and still receive bigger pensions. It is wrong that men are becoming richer and women poorer. That is very true of older women in particular, and that is why they should be helped in every possible way.</p>
<p class="contents">Ageing and growing old, especially with regard to women, should not be a burden. It should not be regarded as a liability, but something that enriches society and Europe and is a resource. The future of the world and Europe will mainly depend on women, and mothers in particular.

At the same time, it is a pity that, in seeking a solution, we remain beholden to a one-sided way of thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">Solving female poverty involves more than just forcible intervention in the family environment. The most recent OECD research shows that such intervention has only limited success. Women devote more time than men to household work and childcare. This applies even when the man is on parental leave. They do not do this because they have to, but because they want to. They prefer to opt for part-time employment.</p>
<p class="contents">According to OECD figures, 30 to 50% of all economic activity of women does not appear in current measures of affluence, such as per capita GDP, for example. Solving female poverty therefore also involves recognising the work that women perform within the framework of intergenerational solidarity. In recognising this work, we will take a fundamental step towards solving poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Morin-Chartier has already said that she would not have put much faith in quotas ten years ago, but that she has changed her mind: quotas are essential. Thank you for that. Quotas are indeed something that women need if they are to get anywhere. We have men’s quotas in all supervisory boards, in all statutory authorities, in politics and in business. Male networks operate without any difficulty. Men are not necessarily in influential positions because of their performance – some are, though it is by no means true of all – but simply because they belong to these boys’ networks. That is why we need quotas and wage equality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The groups might be defined by ethnicity, religion, sex, sexuality, age or disability. They were all to be urged to engage in collective action against their oppressors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Trotskyists grew older, if not up. In some cases, they moved into positions of power and influence. Their ideas spread much faster and further than they did. The word ‘discrimination’, when followed by the word ‘against’, became the ultimate evil. In many cases, there is no identifiable perpetrator. The discriminator is the rest of society.

I can sum it up in one sentence: the majority of you no longer accept the 90% quota of men running our companies and think that this should change.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let us work together to bring about that change. </p>
<p class="contents">When, after having heard your rapporteur and all the interventions, I analyse what has been said, I think we agree that women do reasonably well in politics. There is still a long way to go, but we are on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we do not do reasonably well in the economy. We are absent in decision making and I got your message that we must change that. We are present in low income jobs, when 60% of university graduates are female. They get lost on the way to where we need them in times of crisis, in order to improve things economically.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no choice. How are we to reach the 75% employability, if not by using the untapped potential of these well-trained women? We really need to change the way in which we tackle employment, by giving women a chance and bringing in the talent which we have trained and educated, and which is available for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken note of the interventions about the victims. It is true that not all victims are female or children. They can also be men – but victims are mainly female, including small girls. That is why, in the victims’ package, which I will present in May, this fact will be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortly after this, we will be celebrating one hundred years of International Women’s Day. We should not forget that we are also celebrating one hundred years since Marie Curie won the Nobel Prize. I would like to say to all the women in this room that we should be proud to be women.</p>

Many of these inequalities are reproduced through the imbalances in the labour markets and the bias against women in many segments and in many institutions within the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that European policies and European financial instruments will have to be used to improve the situation in this area, and to improve employment opportunities and employment conditions of women, in order to make progress. Many concrete actions are possible. For example, as regards European funds, wherever it is possible and reasonable, equal opportunities conditionality would be very important, and we want to pursue this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, direct job creation is also important. One of the key directions in job creation in the coming decade will be towards so-called ‘white jobs’ – jobs in healthcare and long-term care. Here, we have to focus on creating opportunities, because much of this work is, in any case, being done by women, but without proper remuneration and without the opportunity to accumulate rights, including pension rights for their old age.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of pensions, in the White Paper on Pensions to be published in the third quarter of this year, we will pay more attention to the gender dimension. There is a group of Commissioners working on this Pensions White Paper, and with Vice-President Reding participating and contributing, we will manage to address the gender dimension of pensions more forcefully than in the previous Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs Zimmer. This is also a question of regulating working time. That is absolutely fundamental. We need an EU working time regulation which allows for better accommodation of working needs and family responsibilities. A better work-life balance is absolutely essential. This is part of our decent work agenda. I agree with those who highlighted that this is not only an issue that applies inside the EU: this is an international responsibility which we have to pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">To highlight one more connection – that between the labour market and education – we have to go deep in order to improve the quality of education, to raise awareness, to teach about rights, including women’s rights especially and – this is very important – rights for European minorities, whether they are immigrants or other ethnic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of quotas on corporate boards, I had an opportunity last week to discuss this matter with the new head of the Confederation of British industry – I am sure Mr Bloom will be interested to hear that. There are many aspects to this question. Apart from tackling stereotypes and the organisational and cultural aspects, our discussion also highlighted the need to organise family life differently, because of the time demands of top-level jobs. That is why we have to act on many fronts. We must not extend this discussion solely to working life and public life. I believe that if we continue the discussion, and the Commission’s efforts, with due responsibility, we can make progress in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Once again, today’s debate proves how much the issue of gender equality matters to us. We all share common values and principles: those of respecting human dignity, those of fighting inequality and discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a great deal of respect for the personal and often national connotations that each of us brings to these values and principles. Therein lies the wealth of the European vision on these matters. However, these different connotations must not make us lose sight of our common goals. We need to continue working towards improving the conditions of women both in the workplace and on a personal and family level. Their access to the job market should be further encouraged, especially to positions of responsibility, and national authorities, institutions, political bodies and companies should be held to account on this. It falls to us all to show that these objectives are achievable. It has indeed been said many times today that combating gender inequalities is a daily battle. Strong political will needs to be backed up by concrete actions. I welcome all the actions outlined by the Commission and my thanks also go out in advance to all my fellow Members for the support that we will give them.</p>
<p class="contents">One more point: during the debates, I was criticised for the length of the text which, it seems, gets longer every year. This is obviously because the previous recommendations have not been fully implemented. We need to make sure that they are implemented by everyone. I also believe that it is because of the complex nature of the matter and its dynamic developments. I stress that it is up to us to keep up with these developments, to avoid being locked into outdated ideas so that we are in a position to guide the former.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe that gender equality remains an issue for us all. Above all, I believe that each of us has the free will to recognise this and to work towards it becoming a reality. 2011 is the European Year of Volunteering, and our greatest joint initiative this year should be achieving genuine progress in gender equality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the main problems lies in limited access to work, in working conditions, or even in accessing roles compatible with their qualifications. Moreover, the present economic crisis being experienced by the European Member States has been exacerbating the employment situation of women because of their susceptibility to finding unstable jobs. The promotion of equality also involves the struggle against violence against women, whether physical, psychological or sexual, which must be combated and condemned. As such, specific programmes have to be adopted to promote the active inclusion or reintegration of women in the labour market, whilst creating specific opportunities for lifelong learning with a view to providing them with skills and qualifications, as well as to reinforcing their confidence and developing the skills necessary in the light of the Europe 2020 strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I believe that in the period ahead, we must move from fair principles to adopting concrete measures to reduce the current gender inequalities. Romania, the country which I come from, is in the middle of the Global Gender Gap Index 2010 rankings, in 64th place to be precise, in terms of discrimination between women and men. In general, Romanian women are better educated than Romanian men, with a steady rise being seen in the proportion of women among the total number of graduates. The current situation is that 60% of graduates are women and only 40% are men. However, the incomes received by women continue to be lower than those received by men. The gender risks which affect women’s opportunities on the labour market are still very powerful, ranging from the higher risk of poverty to blocking access to key positions. In the hope that the labour market will treat women more fairly, I would like us, too, to help change this situation. This report is an important step towards this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I personally consider many of the issues from the submitted report to be exceptionally important. One of the issues I would like to underline is the pension gap between men and women. The gap is caused by the fact that working women interrupt their professional lives more often than men, in order to look after children and sick or older family members, and, because of their family commitments, are more willing than men to accept part-time work or non-permanent work arrangements. It is this factor which leads to the pension gap. I consider no less important the call for special attention to be paid to vulnerable groups of women, such as disabled or older women, immigrants, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual women, or members of minorities and women with low qualifications or no qualifications, who are caring for dependents. Last but not least, I consider it important to secure access to support services aimed at preventing gender-based violence and protecting women against such violence, regardless of their legal status, race, age, sexual orientation, ethnic origin or religion, which the report also calls on the Commission and the Member States to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The percentage of women amongst scientists and engineers has increased significantly. In the EU, women constitute 59% of graduates and 41% of those with doctorates. However, there are paradoxical figures worthy of consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are under-represented in science when we are talking about leadership roles. Only 19% of university professors in the EU are women. These figures lead one to believe that there are problems with women’s access to the upper reaches of academia. It is essential to find solutions that make a successful career in science compatible with a stable family life. I am referring, for example, to the use of new technologies that will enable women scientists to carry out their work from home. Only in this way will we manage to resolve the imbalance between men and women in science and research, which continues to be an obstacle to the European objective of increasing competitiveness and maximising potential for innovation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seriously threatens the female part of the population, particularly in the areas of gender equality, employment conditions and access to employment. In the area of employment conditions or income levels, women have been seriously affected, and unless appropriate measures are taken immediately, there is a risk that the situation will deteriorate even further.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to take account of the position of women within the framework of the fight against poverty. At the global level – in comparison with the male population – up to 17% more women live in poverty, according to statistics. The contribution that women make to developing the family and society is also underrated. The inequalities between men and women, especially regarding access to education or the sharing out of family responsibilities, are factors which exacerbate female poverty. Serious consequences also result from the pay gap between men and women, or the so-called glass ceiling, which prevents women from securing managerial or leading roles.</p>
<p class="contents">The promotion of gender equality is a way of combating violence against women. It is absolutely imperative to combat the various forms of violence, regardless of the level of seriousness of physical, mental or sexual violence. In respect of this factor, too, it is desirable for EU Member State governments and European institutions to support mechanisms aimed at achieving gender equality in the various aspects of social, economic and political life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The only problem is that equality is interpreted in a great many different ways, some of which are extreme interpretations which do not take into account the real differences that exist between people. The various interpretations which are possible have resulted in the emergence of ideologies associated with equality and directly linked to this term. There have been instances in the past when crimes were carried out, including even genocide, in the name of equality understood in a specific and doctrinal sense. There is less risk of dogmatism when it comes to equality between women and men, but overly radical positions are still held. The equality of women and men cannot be limited to political declarations and legal regulations. The implementation of standards based on the principle of equality is very important, and changes in mentality are necessary in order for this to be possible. We must encourage and support education and information measures and promote good practices. We must ensure that awareness of equality is the rule, rather than the exception to the rule. True equality must be something which is found within people, in their attitudes, and in their everyday, spontaneous behaviour. Equality is not an isolated value, either. We should not accept any affirmation of equality which is worded in such a way that it excludes other key values, such as freedom, dignity and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As one of the reports reveals, over 20 million Europeans, mostly women, have limited access to the labour market because they care for dependent adults. We also know how difficult the challenges are facing parents who wish to combine raising children with professional work. I believe that taking concrete steps to reconcile professional and family life is a matter of the utmost importance for both social and economic development in Europe. We need to take measures promoting the creation of local support systems for families caring for children and dependent adults, and to review legislation and make wider use of new technologies in order to remove barriers to flexible forms of employment.

I welcome, in particular, the need to develop entrepreneurship at local and regional level as a main source of job creation and economic development. The potential women offer in terms of running businesses is used to a very small extent. This is why I think that both the European Social Fund and the European Fund for Regional Development must support actions which will allow entrepreneurship to develop among women. There may certainly be cultural, material or economic differences preventing us from doing this.

On the contrary, the current crisis pushes the wheel of history back a few metres, in terms of establishing equality between women and men. Women the world over are again coming out onto the streets, just like 100 years ago. They are standing at the head of demonstrations in Greece, Spain, the Czech Republic and Belgium, and also in North African countries. The EU has, until recently, been boasting of the improving situation of women on the labour market, and in securing education, decent living standards, access to women’s healthcare or greater representation in constitutional bodies, but the deepening crisis seems to have consigned this to the margins of Community interest. The counter-crisis measures are directed mainly towards the male population. The needs of women are perceived as second-level issues. The past 100 years have shown what women have given to the world and to progress, and how many of them gave their lives in the struggle for peace, and also how many new lives they have brought into the world. This is no small matter. However, the world still owes a debt to women. It is not a matter of doing them a favour, but of declaring clearly their equal status in society.

The fight for gender equality is a daily battle across all our States. My generation was one of the first to see women gain access to senior positions of responsibility, in particular, to elected office. I am therefore delighted to see that women are now present in many fields that were still closed to them not so long ago. Nevertheless, inequalities still prevail and there are many battles yet to be fought, not least of which is a persistent wage gap and the place of women on the boards of large companies. Lastly, I would like to emphasise the importance of ensuring all women have access to quality reproductive healthcare. Ever since I started my political career, I have campaigned for women’s access to abortion in a safe medical setting. Contraceptives must also be made readily available to them.

What women really need is a genuine freedom of choice in life: They must have the certainty that none of their decisions will be given a lesser value. An important step in this direction would be to introduce family tax splitting in all Member States so that the establishment of a family does not become a poverty trap. Support for women’s quotas in supervisory boards only comes from women who are already top earners, if at all. Since Norway introduced the women’s quota requirement for the management boards of listed companies, these posts are simply accumulated by a small number of women, who occupy several seats on different management boards. These women are often disparagingly referred to within business as ‘golden skirts’, something that is not exactly favourable to the working atmosphere. We need to begin in the areas where women suffer genuine disadvantage: we need to look at the position of unpaid carers, at part-time employment and at the plight of the many women who work hard to cope with the demands of family and career. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a question mark over the extent to which these values are sustainable in the context of the call for global competitiveness based on reduced labour costs, the loosening of labour law, reductions in social protection for workers and the weakening role of the state. We will probably not fundamentally enhance global competitiveness in this way, and it is much more likely that we will irreversibly undermine social cohesion and open up divisions in society. Make no mistake. Women are fundamentally at risk through these measures. Pay differences have a significant impact, just like the budget cuts in the public sector. From this perspective, pension and health reforms at the national level must be fair to both sexes. It is no accident that the issue of European poverty applies more often to older women. The fight against inequality is not virtual reality. It concerns real people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The disadvantage suffered by women in Europe can only be combated effectively if we introduce binding rules instead of voluntary commitments. These include mandatory women’s quotas on corporate boards, as well as all other levels, the consistent combating of precarious employment conditions, which affect women far more than men, the improvement of career prospects for women during education by systematically expanding the range of careers open to them, a ban on financial disadvantage to women in taxation and income, statutory equality plans in business and industry in order to promote women, and regular checks and reports on the progress achieved in Europe, if any.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying this: After 100 years of International Women’s Day, we women will no longer be satisfied with simple lip-service. We want binding statutory regulations and we want final recognition that the work of women makes a decisive contribution to our prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">President. </span></span>  – I am extremely pleased to be able to preside over our Parliament together with my female fellow Members. Six of them are Vice-Presidents of Parliament, two are Quaestors, and the Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality is sitting next to me. This is a particular honour and privilege for me.</p>
<p class="contents">I am resuming the sitting. The next item is the debate on the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day. We shall begin with a short film summarising the history of this notable day. Please start the projection.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Projection of a film)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, a film lasting two minutes cannot show everything that has happened over the past 100 years. We have, in fact, changed Europe in this time, and we Europeans can be proud when we compare Europe to many places in the world, but at the same time, we know that our journey is not over. There are still too few women in politics, and here in the European Parliament, our female Members account for only 35% of all Members. This figure is admittedly somewhat higher than in the national parliaments, but it is still not enough. Fortunately, the figure in our Parliament’s main decision-making bodies is well over 40%, and we are very pleased about this. This is also the case for the chairs of the committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the European Parliament’s formation in three years’ time, after the next elections, essentially depends on the national parliaments and the way in which representatives are appointed to the European Parliament. It is our national parliaments that must ensure that the number of women in the European Parliament increases. We are calling on them today to do so, and we are calling on our counterparts in the national parliaments to ensure that appropriate legal solutions are found and the appropriate decisions are taken to facilitate an increase in the number of women in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also set an example when it comes to the employment of women. Of those employed in the European Parliament, 59% are women and, at the same time, over 50% of these women deal with matters of substance. I have extensive experience in this area and can pride myself on the fact that while I was responsible for the government in my country, around 50 women occupied the highest ministerial positions and served as directors of the most important state offices. This record has never been broken, neither before nor in the dozen or so years since.</p>
<p class="contents">As President of the European Parliament, I have also called for there to be more women in the European Commission and in high-level positions in the European Union. We can be pleased that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is a woman.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in European businesses has also changed, which is very beneficial not only for women, but, above all, for the way in which these businesses operate. We should also ensure that women and men employed in the same jobs with the same skills receive the same pay. We still have a lot to do in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very well aware that women are also capable of fighting for democracy and human rights. I would like to pay tribute to all of our female fellow Members in the European Parliament, and to think at this point about the women in North Africa and in the Middle East who are showing true courage in their fight for democracy. Let us also remember that the past winners of the Sakharov Prize include magnificent women such as Aung San Suu Kyi, Leyla Zana and the Ladies in White. I should therefore like once again to repeat that we will not agree to depriving women of their dignity in the name of any legal system, religion or culture. We will not agree to women having fewer rights than men, in Europe or elsewhere in the world. We will protest if women are unfairly treated.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, on 3 November 1793, 218 years ago, Olympia de Gouges was beheaded in Europe because she drafted a declaration of the rights of women and female citizens. That was the only reason. One hundred years later, in 1906, women were given the right to vote. The first country where this happened was Finland. Let us remember this. Over the following century, we made enormous progress in achieving equality between women and men. I would like to stress something which is very important for me personally, namely, that 8 March is a holiday for women. This is true. Yet this holiday primarily serves to remind us that we should remember the most important issue in Europe today, namely, equality of rights for women and men, during the remaining 364 days of the year. The principles we wish to reinforce on 8 March should also apply on the other 364 days in the year. This is the main challenge facing us. It is not enough merely to commemorate 8 March; we need to think about this matter on all the other days in the year as well. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Enikő Győri, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(HU)</span> Mr President, when the International Women’s Day was launched, the equality of women was a brand new and revolutionary idea. Since then, gender equality has become one of the basic principles of modern society. Its source lies in inalienable human dignity shared by men and women in equal measure. However, as with all achievements, it is not enough to simply declare this. Human dignity, including the characteristic dignity of women, has been subject to different violations in different ages and places. Our focus and our responses must be in line with this.</p>
<p class="contents">It speaks volumes that this commemoration is taking place after the debate on the report entitled ‘The face of female poverty in the European Union’. Poverty and the European Union. Some time ago, this would have seemed an unlikely association. The economic crisis hit the less protected groups particularly hard. The over-representation of women in this category in itself sets out certain tasks, to say nothing of the typical fates afflicting masses of women, which give poverty a female face outside of Europe, at a global scale. Borrowing the words of Saint Francis of Assisi: Lady Poverty. Women with small children fleeing war or famine, broken families without fathers living in slums, women and young girls forced into prostitution, even within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of matters among the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency, the successful promotion of which could have an impact on increased employment among women. Foremost among these is the Europe 2020 strategy with its own employment policy targets for recovery from the economic crisis and for the reduction of poverty. The employment of women strengthens women’s dignity. It helps enable them to take their decisions and shape their lives freely.</p>
<p class="contents">The flagship initiative ‘Platform against Poverty’ stresses that steps taken with a view to reducing poverty must also take into account the differences between the situation of women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hungarian Presidency considers the decision adopted yesterday by the EPSCO Council on the renewal of the Pact for equality between women and men by 2020 an important achievement. Besides economic policy measures, we must not forget about the special role of women in society either. We must give women the possibility to harmonise their careers and family lives, and the possibility to choose. To this end, we are working on the review of the directive on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding; the relevant progress report will be prepared for the June EPSCO.</p>
<p class="contents">The priorities of the Hungarian Presidency include raising awareness of the role of families in the context of responding to social, economic and demographic problems. For this purpose, we will be organising a demographics week with the involvement of NGOs and with an informal meeting of ministers for family affairs. The aim will be to discuss the means to be used to increase birth rates. In all this, women, and women’s choices of course, have an exceptional role.</p>
<p class="contents">Special focus must be given to the situation of women belonging to disadvantaged groups in the European framework for the Member States’ Roma strategies, which we expect to be approved by the June European Council, and to which Mrs Járóka and others, the rapporteurs and helpers, have provided very valuable input in the European Parliament. We expect that in the Council, too, we will declare that we intend to emphasise the role of Roma women in holding their families together, which would be a good basis to build upon when seeking answers to the issues of the Roma population.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me a brief digression. Historic experience has shown that there cannot be a strong civil society without the active social involvement of women. As Mr Buzek also mentioned, there were female protesters among those who demanded freedom in Tahrir Square, Cairo. They, too, wish to become shapers of the changes that are taking place. The European Union must encourage their efforts: generously, free of ideological stereotypes, openly and with sympathy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, we pay homage to a century of struggle and of success that has benefited us all. Where would our democracies be and, in particular, the European democracy represented here in the European Parliament, without the full participation of women in public life? Where would our societies and our economies be without the talent of women?</p>
<p class="contents">In many ways, European women serve as role models for the rest of the world. The place held by European women in our societies is a source of inspiration for women worldwide. In this respect, I would like to mention the courageous struggle of women in North Africa who, shoulder to shoulder with men, are doing everything they can to resist dictatorships and establish democracies. The active role that European women now have in the economic and political life of the European Union is the result of their determined commitment. We welcome European integration, one of the founding principles of which is equality between men and women, a principle that is fully recognised in the Treaty of Lisbon. Over the years, important legislation on equal treatment and gender mainstreaming in European policies has allowed us to move towards a more egalitarian society and labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">But we should also be outraged at what remains disappointing, unacceptable, or even intolerable. I refer to an average rate of female employment at 62.5% as opposed to 80% for men, increasing academic success amongst women which contrasts with their career prospects: this is still disappointing and has to change. Women are over-represented in lower paid and less secure jobs, and under-represented in positions of responsibility. Disparity between the pay received by women and men stands at 18%, which results in the risk of 22% of women over the age of 65 falling below the poverty threshold as they have no adequate pension: this is unacceptable and has to change. According to estimates, 20 to 25% of women in the European Union have been subjected to physical violence at least once in their life. This is intolerable and has to change.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we must renew our commitment to continue working together so that gender equality really does become a reality. We all stand to gain, whether in terms of social and economic cohesion, sustainable growth or competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">In September 2010, the Commission adopted a strategy which set out five priority areas for action for the period 2010-2015: equality in the labour market, equal economic independence for men and women, equal pay, equality in senior positions and promoting equality beyond the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to stand side by side with women from all corners of the earth who fight the daily battle for access to education and to the right to work, with those fighting for democratisation and for the exercise of freedoms and political and civil rights. The Commission will do everything within its power to ensure that these goals become a reality. However, we must not forget that legislation – however well implemented – is not the answer to everything. Behaviour and attitudes must also change.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, today, we commemorate women’s fight for equality. In Europe today, we can say that the EU would not be possible without European women, all European women! They provide key inputs to our project based on values, including the values of gender equality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This quotation shows that our concepts of what women and men are form the basis for all of our choices in life – choices dependent on our gender, not our interests, skills, commitment, etc. Gender stereotypes place men and women in different pigeonholes, and a hundred years of fighting for equality has not succeeded in shattering these gender stereotypes.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we refuse to wait another hundred years, because it is these gender stereotypes, these norms that result, among other things, in 97% of large companies being managed by men, in women suffering pay discrimination and having precarious jobs – when they have a job at all – and in the fact that it is women who are responsible for the unpaid work in the home. It is women who shoulder the main responsibility for the children. Women are subjected to violence, including within close relationships and in the form of sexual violence, and women are sold as commodities in the sex trade. We are seeing the feminisation of poverty. This has its origin in the various norms that society is composed of.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal of progress has been made during the hundred years of fighting. If I compare the opportunities that I have in terms of different life choices with those of my mother and my grandmother, I can see how much progress has been made, but there still remains a great deal to do. Therefore, the fight will continue every day of the year, not just on 8 March.</p>

The goal they set more than 150 years ago in 1857, to ensure equal pay for equal work, is still relevant today. In the European Union, women earn 15% less than men; this number is 16.5% in my home country, Hungary, and even though more than half of the world’s total population comprises women, they only receive a 10% share of global income.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides eliminating the gender gap in wages, the appropriate reinforcement of the role of women in the family and the assertion of the principle of equal treatment still remain to be solved. We must not allow having children to represent a poverty risk in Europe, and being a woman or a mother to represent a disadvantage. Whether we are looking at the initiatives launched within the UN or those within the European Union, true equality between men and women has still not been implemented in most places. We lay little emphasis on the situation of women living close to the poverty line, on the phenomenon of multiple discrimination, and on combating domestic violence and violence committed against women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One hundred years ago, the fight was about women’s right to vote, among other things – something that we take for granted today. However, there is still a long way to go to achieve full equality, and I would like to emphasise the importance of women being represented in the decision-making processes at all levels. Women must be involved in politics, but they must also be involved in the world of business. We must also have women in the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not exclude half of the population from being involved in making the important economic decisions. That is not democracy. We need to use the whole of our talent base. Quite simply, our competitiveness is also at stake. I therefore welcome Commissioner Reding’s ‘Women on the Board Pledge for Europe’ initiative. It is very good that the EU will once again be leading the way when it comes to equality, but we need to have binding legislation if quotas for board members are to be anything other than symbolic politics, and I hope that you have the courage to do that. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This states: ‘All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood’. What a wonderful sentence. However, even one hundred years after the first International Women’s Day, we still have not achieved this: there is still no sign of true equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Granted, we have achieved at great deal in Europe. Today, our primary concern is no longer the legal freedom of women. We have largely achieved this freedom. I would like to express my gratitude to the feminists, both male and female, for their work in the past. Today, our main concern is freedom in action, that men should take ownership of the issue of the compatibility of work and family life, and that seeing women at the top in business or politics is something that should become commonplace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is fantastic to see how the liberation movements in North Africa look to us, the women of Europe. They look to us to play a pioneering role. It is vitally important that we do not lose sight of our goal: the freedom to live our lives according to our own conceptions. That is when equality will become something we take for granted and when International Women’s Day will be transformed from a day of remembrance to a day to celebrate freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This 100th anniversary should be an occasion for us, as women, to look back and take stock.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the results are as follows: equality must be enshrined in constitutions and declarations of human rights as a grand principle. However, we need laws and regulations to make these principles a reality. I believe that this also requires the use of quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the European institutions, we can see that things are no better than at the top in the business world. There are hardly any women right at the top in management positions. If we are to achieve this, Mrs Reding, Mr Barroso, then we need genuine tough quota regulations. I would have welcomed an honest appraisal from you of the lack of equality for women in the European institutions, because then you would have realised the importance of these quotas.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is a shame that there is still no place at the table for women, however well qualified they may be, when managerial decisions are made and when strategic policies are planned. The quota is the instrument whereby we can achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Reding, on this, the occasion of the 100th International Women’s Day, we call on you: make a genuine commitment to do all you can to promote a real quota for women in management positions – as is already the position in Norway, Spain and France.

His report consisted of voluntary targets for businesses. No one can disagree that we need more women in the boardroom. What I cannot accept is that we need quotas to get there. How patronising is that? Almost as patronising as giving the women in this room a rose when they came in. Well, I gave my rose to a man.</p>
<p class="contents">On a positive note, the UK is making real headway in the elimination of the gender pay gap. The latest figures show that the pay gap between men and women in full-time employment is down to 10%, the lowest since records began.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on International Women’s Day, I must pay tribute to motherhood. True equality is having the right to choose and not be judged for these choices. Whether a director in the boardroom, surgeon in the hospital, part-time care assistant, car mechanic or housewife and mother, a woman has the right to make her own choice.</p>

Women have struggled and achieved a great deal during those 100 years, but that has still not been enough to eliminate the existing inequalities, the discrimination that persists in accessing jobs with rights, the wage inequality which is reflected in pensions, the difficulty of career progression and professional achievement, and the obstacles to accessing management and decision-making positions in economic, social and political activity; the tendency is for this situation to get worse at times of economic and social crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Although motherhood is a social function indispensable to society’s development, discrimination against women for being mothers and workers continues, which, well into the 21st century, is scandalous. We would reaffirm our group’s solidarity with the struggles of women here. We continue to demand an end to inequality and discrimination, an end to all violence against women, and an end to gender stereotypes. This requires not just a break with neoliberal policies, but also a serious commitment to alternative policies that put the issue of human rights and gender equality at the centre of decision making and EU policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was in 1893 that New Zealand gave women the vote. If I may pay tribute to my own country, it was in 1970 that a certain Labour politician, Barbara Castle, pushed forward the first equal pay act in the Western world. Of course, it was the United Kingdom that had the first woman Prime Minister in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that the European Parliament has lost touch with reality. I am against discrimination of any kind, even positive, as it inevitably leads to the creation of victims. Women do not need to be patronised by quotas, and instead need barriers to their progress to be removed. Member States would do better to focus on issues such as the need for improved childcare.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had a recent Court of Justice decision on car insurance that boycotts traditional, tried and tested, sensible methods of risk assessment. Despite the EU’s stance on positively discriminating in favour of women, this case exemplifies politically correct Euro-babble, with a potty decision which actually makes life more difficult and expensive for women.

I recommended this to my group for a very simple reason: The following amendment, which has been signed by 120 Members from all groups, shows that proposals regarding a financial transaction tax are not the preserve of any one group, whether the socialists, conservatives, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) or the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The point is that we are making an institutional proposal and issuing an institutional signal that this House is capable of saying on a cross-party basis: ‘We want the private sector to pay its share in dealing with the burden of the crisis’. This is not a socialist demand, or a PPE Group demand; it is our common wish. If we manage to express this today on an institutional basis, then this will be a major success for the European Parliament. This is why we are withdrawing this motion.</p>

In the Danish translation, the word ‘equitable’ has been translated as ‘ligelig’. This is not a good translation because people will then think that it means ‘uniform’. Thus, in the final report, the word ‘retfærdig’, meaning ‘equitable’, will be used. It has a different meaning, and I will, of course, recommend that all of our colleagues in the Danish delegation – and perhaps the Swedes have the same problem – vote in favour of the word being corrected in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title17"></a><a name="creitem17"></a>

<p class="contents">It is an own-initiative report but it has the merit of going in the right direction to complete the single market and the protection of European consumers. Ensuring safety means providing traceability systems that are reliable throughout the products’ life cycle. In this respect, the report puts forward effective proposals: the creation of an information database on product safety; the strengthening of the Community Rapid Information System (RAPEX) regarding unsafe products from third countries; and greater resources to allow the surveillance authorities to withdraw products with serious risks from the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by emphasising that it is our job to ensure that the products circulating on the European market are safe for the most vulnerable consumers, especially children, the elderly and the disabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This results in ill-advised public health decisions. It is alarming that, in the opinion of the former ECDC director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, never before had a vaccine been granted a marketing authorisation with so few data available on its effects. She said this in response to a question on the safety of adjuvants in the vaccine against the H1N1 pandemic. Greater transparency is needed for decisions which affect human health. In Poland, the health minister decided not to purchase vaccines or implement a vaccination programme, in spite of pressure from the media and many other groups. One could be forgiven for wondering how stressful it was for the citizens bombarded with information on a daily basis telling them that they should be vaccinated. One could also be forgiven for wondering whether it is ethical to be focused exclusively on profit, and to neglect the health of citizens and, as a result, also undermine trust in official recommendations on vaccinations, which are intended to protect us against epidemics.

They sink – the scales and the bones are clogging the sea beds, suffering – as the UK’s national poet puts it – a sea change into something rich and strange. For once, the metaphor is entirely apposite. Now, the European Commission has belatedly woken up, years after this problem of discards first arose, and has attempted to do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, every solution proposed by the Commission would bring perverse incentives of its own – one can limit the days a boat spends at sea, one can restrict the size of the mesh of the net, one can force skippers to land every last sprat they catch. All of these things are based on the existential problem of the common fisheries policy, which is precisely that it is a common policy: it defines fisheries as a common resource to which all nations have equal access. No one has ownership and therefore, no one has an incentive to treat fisheries as a renewable resource.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to copy what Iceland, New Zealand and the Falklands and other places have done, in giving skippers an incentive in conservation and giving them property rights.

Of all the taxes that we could possibly adopt, the so-called Tobin tax is the most stupid of all. The only positive thing that can be said about this tax is that it has never come to anything, because if it was the Beast of the Apocalypse, why was it not implemented many years ago?</p>
<p class="contents">The first time it came up for consideration was right back at the beginning of the 1970s. However, every time there is a crisis, this old chestnut is reeled out, and after a little while, we come to the conclusion that it is not a good idea. It is simply not a good idea to introduce a tax in Europe alone because we have safe havens, and so the capital can move to somewhere else in Europe. It is a tax on trade rather than on profits. The Tobin tax does not provide a solution to anything at all, and Mr Tobin himself acknowledged that a few years ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, we have to learn the lesson that inappropriate regulation can sometimes cause a problem, as the Community Investment Act in the United States did. It encouraged banks to lend to customers who were not creditworthy. When one in ten of those customers defaulted, that started a subprime crisis and we have been seeing the consequences ever since.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to understand the consequences of printing money too cheaply and of holding interest rates down so that people make investments based on bad decisions, and of not recognising that money itself has a value. As the Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises said, if you make those bad decisions and create malinvestment, when the market corrects itself, everyone loses out and the credit cycle bursts. This is exactly what we saw. We also have to learn the lesson that banks should never again be allowed to be too big to fail.</p>
<p class="contents">If we put in place this tax to raise money, what message will it give to banks? Banks will say to themselves that they can continue to operate as they did before, without due care, and that they can collapse and the taxpayer will bail them out.</p>

I am completely opposed to paragraphs 25, 26 and 29. The important ethical and moral decisions of the Member States, such as reproduction techniques and abortion, have no place here.

For many years, we have been telling the islands of the Caribbean and other developing countries that they should diversify away from sugar and bananas, start to go up the value chain, and start to get expertise when it comes to services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cayman Islands have done that, and now about 40 to 50% of their economy is in financial services, thanks to their system of tax neutrality. Not tax evasion, but tax neutrality. They do not double- and treble-tax the funds that decide to locate there. But what do the hypocritical imperialists of the European Union do when the Cayman Islands decide to compete with them on taxation? They decide to act like the imperialists of old, and try to attack the Cayman Islands for wanting to compete with the EU. Shame on this EU imperialism! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These regulatory settings are not static, however; they create hierarchies and evolve through negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulative diversity, divergent commercial interests, trade tensions and disputes reflect the complexity of domestic agricultural policies and international trade. Since agriculture is not simply an economic activity, but agricultural and food policies are to serve fundamental objectives, such as food and consumer safety, the principal challenge now consists of effectively accommodating trade and non-trade concerns.</p>

<p class="contents">Let me be very clear, the European Union’s agricultural sector should not be sacrificed in any way in order to secure trade arrangements such as with Mercosur. Unfortunately, however, I feel that that is precisely the direction in which things are going. There seems to be a perception that European agriculture can be used as an easy bargaining chip. If this is indeed the case, I foresee major problems in many sectors of agriculture, and especially in the livestock sector. With regard to equivalent standards, no one should be threatened by what we demand, which is that imports into the EU should meet the same standards as required of our own producers. Surely we have a responsibility to our consumers to ensure that this is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very unhappy with the Commission’s attitude to Parliament in this regard. It is unacceptable that it should try and keep us in the dark.

Trade in agricultural products plays a key role in this area, particularly with regard to access to the European Union’s markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is a net importer of agricultural products. In the four years following the reform of the sugar market, we went from being a net exporter to being a net importer. We import 70% of agricultural products; products which are exported by developing countries. We have a trade deficit with the Mercosur countries. As Mr Kalinowski said, agricultural products which are produced in line with other standards are imported to EU markets, while European farmers incur huge costs associated with animal welfare or environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot destroy the achievements of the common agricultural policy, which is funded from the EU budget, by means of decisions which reduce the effectiveness of this policy.

Many regions and countries in Europe are dependent on agriculture, especially the newest Member States, in which agriculture receives significantly smaller direct payments than representatives of the older Member States. What is more, these regions also have to compete with Latin American producers, who do not have to comply with equally strict quality standards, and who enjoy reduced customs tariffs. This type of situation markedly reduces our farmers’ competitiveness and profits. That is why I supported this report, because it calls for a review of European Union trade policy, a regular evaluation, the application of uniform standards to agricultural products from third countries, and the opening of the market to third-country agricultural produce only if our farmers receive compensation for the losses that they would suffer from the increased volume of imports of third-country agricultural products. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What would help them would be for us to help the entrepreneurs in their country to create wealth locally, and for them to be able to trade with us in the European Union. We can help by opening up our markets.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the big problems with that statement is the fact that we have the common agricultural policy. The United States has all sorts of subsidies as well. While we preach open trade, we are being hypocritical when we close our markets to the very good produce from developing countries. On top of that, we use something called sanitary and phytosanitary standards. Of course we all want safer food, but quite often, these standards are used as a non-tariff barrier against imports from developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to trust the consumers. As long as food is safe, let the consumers decide whether they want food grown in Europe or grown elsewhere. Let us stop subsidising unprofitable and unfeasible industries in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the end of the 1950s, the Argentinean Ambassador to the EU was the appointed spokesman of the developing countries. He said that if Europe had to subsidise its farmers, then they understood that and that they did not like our keeping out their products but they understood it, but he asked us not to land them the double blow of then dumping our surpluses on their markets. The EU did not listen then and it has not listened since.</p>
<p class="contents">The last World Trade talks were given the optimistic title ‘Everything but Arms’. Of course, these quickly descended into everything but farms, because the EU is determined to retain this protected and subsidised position for this one niche sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Infer from what has happened. The common agricultural policy has existed since 1960. This is what the EU has been doing for longest. If this is what we have come up with – the ecological calamity, the poverty, the inflationary consequences of higher food prices – what are we thinking of if we want to give these same institutions additional powers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must pursue all avenues here, from support for research and cultivation to information and training for farmers in relation to the advantages of established practices and crop rotation. Let us not lose sight of the proven principle of a circular economy. The Commission must review the ban on the feeding of animal protein to non-ruminants, while still respecting the ban on cannibalism. Specifically, it needs to consider the possible use of animal protein for bone meal for pigs and poultry. These materials must be prepared according to the current stringent regulations for protecting human health and the environment. Valuable sources of protein are currently being destroyed here simply because we are not able to organise ourselves to deal with these products correctly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Talking about equality between men and women in the world of work today is not, and must not be, merely an exercise in rhetoric.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, female employment is a strategic issue for Europe, in both cultural and economic terms. As is evident from the available data, if the employment rates for women were similar to those of men, gross domestic product would increase by 30%. The current crisis must not, therefore, force us to take backward steps but, on the contrary, must make us move forward towards active policies on female employment. We therefore need targeted employment policies that allow the impact of the crisis on women to be assessed and counter-cyclical solutions to be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">The report has the merit, moreover, of focusing on positive policies to promote the employment of women, the issue of vocational training and female entrepreneurship. I will conclude by saying that there is another phenomenon to face: the serious problem of violence against women.

I will not make a secret of the fact that I am very much opposed to statutory quotas, partly because I think that it is bad for the companies, but also because it is bad for those qualified women who will automatically be marginalised on the boards. I therefore say ‘no’ to quotas. However, we could take the pragmatic approach and discuss whether we could not require listed companies to draw up an equality policy and some objectives of their own, where they decide themselves what these objectives are to be. That would be good for the women who manage to get onto the board with this approach, but also for the companies, because they will have ownership of the objectives that they are to implement.

It is truly important to remember that we were created as men and women. That is a source of wealth, but it does not mean that if you are a man or a woman, you are somehow worse or weaker: we were also created equal. That is why it is very important to ensure that now at last in the 2010s, we can be equal in Europe, which would mean that men and women would also be treated in the same way in the labour market. Of course, the situation now is that women have continually been worse off with regard to pay and so on, and that cannot be the case in a civilised society. Instead, we need to ensure that equality can be implemented in the true meaning of the word.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as quotas are concerned, they will be needed as long as we adopt a way of thinking where everyone is equal, and then it is ultimately competence in the labour market that will be the decisive factor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is sufficient to look at what gender the President of the Commission is or to examine the members of the Council, the rotating presidencies, the President of the Council, the President of Parliament and the President of the Court of Auditors; at the members of the European Central Bank, among whom, for the first time, there will be no women; at the chairs of this institution’s parliamentary groups; or at the lack of women in the delegations of some countries.</p>

First, differences in rates of pay are still significant, and during the crisis, these differences have increased, because we have opted to support the banks, and not schools and nurseries, which predominantly employ women. Second, support for women, mothers-to-be and new mothers is insufficient, especially in the new Member States. There is also discrimination in the labour market. Third, in politics, where the ideal male-female ratio would be 50:50, women’s participation is still considerably smaller. The same phenomenon can be seen in management roles.

The recent ruling that insurers may not discriminate on the basis of sex in order to factor in differences in driving ability or differences in longevity is flawed on so many levels that it is difficult to know where to begin. Take, first, the expense. This will cost an extra billion pounds. Premiums will rise and fewer people will take up insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, take the poor jurisprudence, the way in which the European Court of Justice is ruling on the basis of European Court of Human Rights precedent. Thirdly, take the bad faith. When the equality and non-discrimination directives were passed, it was clearly understood that actuarially justified distinctions would still be justifiable.</p>
<p class="contents">Take, fourth, the judicial activism, the way in which our judges have disregarded what the law says in favour of what they think the law ought to say. Take, fifth, the attack on free contract. If you want to insure me and I am happy to accept the terms you offer, it is not for the State to come between us and declare our transaction illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">Then take, sixth, the knock-down argument: what has any of this to do with the European Union? Surely each country could work out its own rules on sex equality in accordance with its own proper democratic mechanisms and procedures. Mr President, a court with a mission is a menace. A supreme court with a mission is a tyranny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is roughly when the General Product Safety Directive came into force, which regulates the general requirements ensuring that products do not endanger a person’s safety. This is why the motion for revising this directive is more than timely. We currently have a directive which only partially overlaps with the new legislative framework adopted in the middle of 2008. Correlating the regulations would provide us with more chances of achieving the aim of a coherent internal market for both harmonised and non-harmonised products, as well as offer comprehensive protection for consumer interests. At the same time, these regulations need to be totally transparent so that they are accessible to manufacturers. Consequently, it is important for us to get rid of the two overlapping layers of diverging market surveillance rules applying to harmonised goods, depending on whether they are consumer products or not.</p>

In fact, I am strongly convinced that the single market can only function well if it strengthens consumer confidence and provides them with safe products.

<p class="contents">I agree with the need to implement certain measures. I am referring, for example, to the need to strengthen market surveillance, to take concrete steps on product traceability, including the use of modern technological tools to create a Consumer Product Safety Information Database, and to pay more attention to products for children.

However, in my opinion, these rules must necessarily be subject to two conditions, which are no more than two sides of the same coin: (i) on the one hand, they cannot be more restrictive for European producers than for their international competitors, which place their products on the same market without complying with the same rules; and (ii) they cannot be so exacting that they jeopardise economic competitiveness. While bearing these two constraints in mind, the Commission therefore needs to revise the directive on general product safety and market surveillance, paying particular attention to the most vulnerable consumers, and most especially to children. We know that, of the many accidents that occur because products placed on the market are unsafe, the majority involve children, which requires concrete measures relating not only to the safety of the end product, but also to its suitability for the public for which it is intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It goes without saying that product safety depends mainly on the manufacturers and importers who place products on the market. Market surveillance also plays a huge role in ensuring that only products which meet the required standards reach the market. The European Parliament is sending out a strong message with the report that has been voted through, calling for directives on product safety to be consistent with other legislative acts, which will guarantee a better-functioning market surveillance system and clear and transparent regulations for entrepreneurs, and will provide consumers with a guarantee that the product they have in their hands meets legal requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">There have, however, been an alarming number of notifications made via the RAPEX system, with the overwhelming majority of them relating to products originating from China. In the opinion I drafted on this report for the Committee on International Trade, one of my demands was for cooperation on product safety to be stepped up with our main trading partners, and for further work to be carried out to improve the operation of the RAPEX-CHINA system. I hope that stepping up cooperation with China will result in an improvement in the quality of products imported to EU markets from China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The product safety and market surveillance legislative framework consists of three layers of legal acts (GPSD, NLF and sector-specific harmonisation directives), which leads to uncertainties and confusion in the internal market. The level of market surveillance differs considerably among Member States and a number of them fail to designate necessary resources for efficient market surveillance and interpret products posing serious risk differently, which can create barriers to the free movement of goods, disturb competition and jeopardise consumers’ safety within the internal market. The current legislative framework for market surveillance does not provide enough coherence and should therefore be reviewed and further coordinated. I resisted voting in favour of this document because I believe that by only considering consumer safety, we would reduce the free circulation and broad variety of products. The measures adopted must be adequate but, at the same time, we must also consider consumer safety, as well as the free circulation and variety of products. It is also clear that market surveillance is a challenging activity for a number of Members States, as they are unable to designate necessary resources for efficient market surveillance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely for this reason that I would like to call for the greater involvement of market supervision bodies in the process of creating safety standards, as this is an opportunity to ensure in an adequate way that their expertise is brought to bear in the standardisation process.

In this area, I believe the strengthening of the market surveillance system through a measure to improve the effectiveness of border controls is crucial, together with the complete traceability of products through the entire supply chain.

Indeed, it would be important to review the current European legislation on this subject. It is clear that the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD), which was approved more than 10 years ago, now needs to be reviewed. This would also allow the prerogatives of the new legislative framework (NLF) on products, which was approved in 2008, to be respected. Closer monitoring of the market then needs to be put into practice, which goes hand in hand with product safety. However, the real problem to solve – and the true priority of the report – is to pay attention to products intended for children and to products that appeal to them. It would also be advisable for the Commission to propose a proper regulation on general product safety and market surveillance. This should include essential elements such as the adoption of concrete measures in the field of traceability, the obligation for manufacturers to provide a detailed risk analysis during the design phase or, again, strict regulations for the sale of products online. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is a need to continue improving, especially in connection with products aimed at children, who are more susceptible to being affected when safety rules are not observed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, I am in favour of a clarification of the current product safety legislative framework, which consists of three layers of legal acts. In order to ensure that market surveillance authorities do not face any uncertainty, we should establish a common European framework applicable to all products present in the internal market or entering it. Moreover, let us not forget that, in order to dissuade economic operators from acting illegally, it is important to take action both in terms of penalties against those who deliberately put dangerous or non-compliant products on the market, and in terms of transparency: any ban on products should be published. Another crucial element is dealt with in this report: that of product safety from a global perspective. In this context, the European Union must set itself the goal of improving exchanges of information on dangerous products originating from third countries, such as China and India, in order to tackle the issue of product safety and traceability before products enter the European market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A general look at the area of product safety shows that, during the last decade, we have seen progress when it comes to product safety in the EU. Governments as well as enterprises take responsibility to ensure safer products and, due to legislation at EU level, there has been a common approach to product requirements, which has improved the general safety of products within the internal market.

This text also calls on the WHO to include the criterion of severity in its definition of a pandemic. More independence, in the sense that the text stipulates that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control should exercise its powers as an independent agency so as to have scientific studies that are not influenced by pharmaceutical companies.

According to the figures provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) at the end of April 2010, influenza A(H1N1) caused 2 900 deaths in Europe in 2009. These figures are low in comparison to the official mortality estimates for seasonal influenza, which the Commission put at 40 000 deaths in a moderate year and 220 000 in a particularly severe season. They are also significantly less than the most optimistic forecasts suggested by the health services of the EU Member States. A maximum-level alert was issued over this virus, triggering in some Member States a raft of measures that were very costly (e.g. the costs are put at EUR 1.3 billion in Great Britain and EUR 990 million in France – compared to EUR 90 million against seasonal influenza), and in those cases, disproportionate to the actual level of danger of the virus. I agree that the World Heath Organisation should revise the definition of a pandemic, not basing this solely on the spread of the virus, but also including the possible severity of a disease to allow for more adequate responses and protect EU citizens from real dangers. I believe that in this area, there is a need for better cooperation between the Member States and the responsible institutions and organisations, as well as a more transparent distribution of responsibility among the key actors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In May 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) attributed moderate severity to influenza A (H1N1), and in June of the same year, the WHO declared a level 6 alert, corresponding to a pandemic phase. This maximum-level alert declared by the WHO set in train a series of measures in Europe. In some cases, these were very costly measures (for example, the costs were estimated at EUR 1.3 billion in Great Britain and EUR 990 million in France, compared to EUR 87 million against seasonal influenza). The response was disproportionate. Each Member State reacted in its own right, without much coherence or solidarity. This report, which I supported, reaches the correct conclusions in recommending greater coordination between Member States and European health institutions, as well as clarification and a review of the roles and responsibilities of the key players and management structures, and threats to health at a European level. Finally, it recognises the need for studies on vaccines and anti-viral medications that are independent of the pharmaceutical industry, including with regard to the monitoring of vaccination coverage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Preparation and reaction with regard to health risks within the EU is the responsibility of the Member States, and so it is essential that cooperation and coordination between them, the institutions and international and regional organisations are improved, particularly during the initial phases of a viral outbreak, in order to gauge its severity and to be able to make relevant management decisions and adopt a coherent approach. The differing recommendations made within the EU and Member States with regard to priority target groups for vaccination indicate the enormous uncertainty and divergent points of view that persist with regard to an appropriate response. The costs, which were quite significant, could also have been reduced through greater cooperation between the Member States, and between these and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Fortunately, the worst fears with regard to the morbidity and mortality associated with the H1N1 virus were not confirmed. In Europe, this virus was responsible for 2 900 deaths, well below the number of deaths caused by seasonal influenza. However, as a result of World Health Organisation alerts and fear, exceptional measures were taken by Member States, such as mass vaccination, which represented a substantial cost to health systems. It is important to draw conclusions from the management of influenza A that took place, rather than point out errors. The most salient of these, in my opinion, is that, even so, it is better to err through excess than through omission. Secondly, we should learn lessons for the management of future pandemics, which could be more aggressive, and understand how and when to act and what measures to take. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This relates both to what happened – with the complete clarification of procedures adopted and responsibilities – and to the approach to future situations. The following issues are mentioned in particular: the question of the procurement of vaccines and anti-viral treatments; information on recorded cases and their severity; the granting of access to documents relating to clinical trials, research protocols and adverse effects of medicines (by the European Medicines Agency); and conflicts of interest among specialists who advise European public health authorities. The report ‘calls for the prevention plans established in the EU and its Member States for future influenza pandemics to be revised in order to gain in effectiveness and coherence, independence and flexibility’. It also recommends a strengthening of cooperation between Member States in this area, with regard to both the definition of the severity of viral outbreaks, and decision making. Overall, we consider it to be positive, and we voted in favour for this reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There were 10 times fewer H1N1 influenza victims than victims of ordinary seasonal influenza. Yet it is true that those 2 000 annual victims, most of whom were elderly or already ill, are of no interest to anyone. They are much less exotic.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, it taught us how to completely disguise a lack of judgment with alarmist speeches and arm waving. Tens of millions of doses were ordered unnecessarily. We had what was meant to be a mass vaccination programme organised without any regard for common sense. The communication was so exaggerated and contradictory that the people of France turned their backs with suspicion, and rightly so, on the orders that were given to them.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a suspicion of common interest between those who took the political decisions and those who benefited from them financially. Finally, the H1NI influenza taught us that, in France, however error-prone, negligent or incompetent a minister, nothing would force him or her to resign.

Better cooperation is needed in the response to pandemics. There must be a review of prevention plans, a clarification and, if necessary, review of the roles and responsibilities of key actors, and reinforced cooperation between Member States in order to ensure coherent risk management in response to a pandemic in compliance with the International Health Regulation, as well as more serious coordination on the part of Member States with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. A procedure must be introduced enabling the Member States to make group purchases on a voluntary basis. Manufacturers have to bear full liability for the authorised indications of their products, and this should be fully applied by Member States in all contracts for the procurement of vaccines. The prevention plans established in the EU and its Member States for future influenza pandemics must be revised in order to be more effective, coherent and sufficiently autonomous and flexible to be adapted as swiftly as possible, and on a case-by-case basis, to the actual risk, based on up-to date relevant information. I agree with the opinion that vaccination strategies should rely on three conditions to be successful: efficacy of the vaccine, a positive benefit-risk balance for the vaccine, and targeting of risk groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider the demand for research and development funding to be of fundamental importance, as well as the rule that pharmaceutical companies will have a consultative role, and not a deciding role. The same applies to studies and tests on vaccination materials and other medicines, which must be drawn up independently of pharmaceutical firms. I also support the demand for more stringent rules for professionals and advisers working for European institutions. The public must be clearly and transparently informed, although in a way which will not cause panic, but will provide qualified and comprehensible information. As the Quaestor jointly responsible for protecting the health of MEPs and European Parliament (EP) employees, I would like to say that our measures in the EP have been effective, but not cheap. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur therefore considered it appropriate to raise extremely important issues, first of all, concerning the overwhelming influence of pharmaceutical companies. She urged that studies on antiviral medications should be independent of pharmaceutical companies. The accelerated authorisation procedures have demonstrated their limitations, because no scientific evidence is available and data released by the industry are therefore still used. There is also need for better cooperation, to request a review of prevention plans and the roles of key actors, and also to enable Member States to make group purchases on a voluntary basis. The World Health Organisation (WHO) should revise its definition of a pandemic as soon as possible so as to include the virulence of the virus in its classification. In this regard, it is necessary that the vaccine should be effective, have a positive relationship between risks and benefits, and be genuinely targeted at risk groups. Finally, we must avoid any conflicts of interest because they may immediately generate suspicion of undue pressure in public opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though the WHO classified the H1N1 influenza as a minor illness, at the same time, it issued a pandemic warning of level 6, the highest possible level. In order to meet their obligations to the population, the EU Member States consequently spent billions to combat an influenza outbreak whose potential threat is much less than that of normal influenza. The media also contributed to the panic. When a pandemic is announced as dangerous but turns out to be a storm in a teacup, then worryingly, future warnings will no longer be taken seriously. This clearly demonstrates that the WHO needs to revise its pandemic criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, good cooperation and joint procurement are advantageous in the event of a pandemic, helping to achieve price reductions.

Therefore, it is necessary to pay significant attention to ensuring cooperation, independence and transparency. Above all, the prevention plans established both in the EU and its Member States for future influenza pandemics must be revised consistently, so that they are flexible and adapted effectively every time there is a risk of a flu pandemic. Furthermore, we must encourage cooperation and coordination of action at international and regional levels in order to properly ensure risk management and react promptly to the risk of a pandemic. I believe that more financial resources need to be allocated to research and development, and to that end we need to increase investment to evaluate and anticipate the impact of an influenza virus. It is important to ensure that the prior purchase agreement and delivery process takes place transparently, reducing corruption in this area. We must limit the influence of pharmaceutical companies, not just as regards distribution, but also the carrying out of studies into vaccines and antiviral medications. Scientific experts should declare publicly that they have no financial or other interests in the pharmaceutical industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported 2 900 deaths in Europe resulting from infection with H1N1 during 2009. This number is lower than the European Commission’s official estimates for the number of deaths due exclusively to seasonal influenza. The number of deaths is also markedly lower than the most optimistic forecasts of health services within EU Member States. The fact that the Member States and the European institutions accepted the maximum-level alert declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) resulted in a set of costly and disproportionate measures in the light of the severity of H1N1 influenza. However, given the WHO’s recommendation, I do not believe that any other course of action could have been taken. However, this case still needs to be reflected upon, and I agree with the rapporteur’s view that the EU requires greater cooperation between its Member States, greater independence and greater transparency, specifically with regard to the cost-benefit assessment of these measures with a major financial impact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is therefore essential that the Commission should report to Parliament with a detailed cost-benefit analysis within six months, stating how it intends to react to similar situations in the future. The WHO should revise its definition of a pandemic in order to take into account both the geographic extent and the virulence of the infection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are several disputable facts within the report and explanatory statement which may lead to a false understanding of H1N1, its impact on European societies and government response plans. We believe the recommended steps which a Member State should take when faced with future epidemics (from the buying of vaccinations through to the reporting of facts to EU bodies) are unwise and would not solve any major issues associated with H1N1 or future pandemics.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also places liability for vaccines with manufacturers, which may hinder the supply of vaccines and blurs lines of accountability. Furthermore, the dossier tries to broaden ECDC’s mandate and their working relationship with Member States, which is undesirable as it may lead to an increase in their budgetary allowance.

I believe that any intervention by the EU should always start from an analysis of the needs that emerge from local businesses depending on this activity, often characterised by the presence of the small and medium-sized enterprises so fundamental to the economy and society.</p>
<p class="contents">Very many areas in the Mediterranean regions have such characteristics, so it is very important that legislative proposals that set out to deal with the fishing in this area are clearly inspired by the principle of subsidiarity, so as not to risk compromising the entire system. I am also firmly convinced that it is, above all, essential to offer special protection to small and medium-sized enterprises working in the field, involving them in decision making and giving them as much support as possible, because they are actually very difficult to redevelop. Regulations that take no account of these features may cause irreparable damage to smaller markets, forcing a conversion into another area that would be very complex to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of this proposal for a regulation is simply to transpose some of the recommendations adopted into a single EU legislative instrument, to which future recommendations may also be added. The content of the recommendations adopted by the GFCM and the obligations pertaining thereto are frequently entirely or partially covered by EU legislation adopted previously, with only the aspects that differ needing to be transposed. The regulation voted on will apply to all commercial fishing and aquaculture activities carried out by EU fishing boats and by nationals of Member States within the GFCM area. It does not apply to fishing operations carried out exclusively for the purposes of scientific research that take place with the authorisation and under the authority of a Member State. In this case, just the European Commission and the Member States in whose waters the activity is being carried out need to be informed beforehand. I believe that the Commission’s proposal could run counter to Parliament’s powers with regard to the matter in question, in particular, Article 28, which needs to be replaced so that both the effective participation of this Chamber in future amendments to the regulation and respect for its prerogatives are ensured. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, in fact, proving to be extremely interesting in providing for the implementation of certain recommendations adopted by the GFCM in a single piece of EU legislation. Such an act constitutes a legal instrument that is certainly more stable than the present one and allows future recommendations to be added only by an amendment of the law itself. It represents a major step towards improving legal certainty and also contributes to the simplification of regulations. Over and above the relevance of provisions in respect of a minimum mesh size for fishing nets, Article 28 of this proposed regulation also questions the powers of Parliament. In fact, it states that the provisions contained in the regulation can be changed under the ‘comitology procedure’ whereby the Commission is assisted by management committees, chaired by a representative of the Commission and composed of representatives of Member States. This would effectively deprive Parliament of its powers, and it therefore appears desirable that the Commission should operate through delegated acts, with the possibility of Parliament or the Council withdrawing the delegated powers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These recommendations deal with technical measures. One of them is a matter of concern for the Committee on Fisheries, which considers Article 28 (procedure for amendment) of the proposal to be a very dubious provision, insofar as it could threaten Parliament’s prerogatives and the current institutional balance by inflating the Commission’s implementing powers to the point that all future amendments to the regulation would be covered by the Commission’s powers. The Committee on Fisheries therefore proposes that Article 28 be deleted. It seems that the Commission has not completely familiarised itself with the Lisbon Treaty, and it looks as though some officials have decided to take decisions that should, in fact, be made by Parliament.

Entire regions are based around fishing. It is therefore necessary to pay particular attention to fishing in this region, because fishing in the Mediterranean has more specificities than elsewhere and it should be subject to specific measures. In my opinion, it is advisable to transpose various recommendations adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean in a single Community legislative act, given the fact that the recommendations mentioned are already in effect. Furthermore, it would be advisable to set out technical measures, strengthening restrictions on fishing in the Gulf of Lions, tightening requirements regarding nets, and the issuing of authorisation to engage in fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that vessels authorised to fish for common dolphinfish should be subject to more stringent regulation and should be prohibited from using towed dredgers and trawl nets at depths below 1 000 metres. Furthermore, it would be advisable to regulate control measures, providing for opportunities to inspect the landings and trans-shipment operations of third-country fishing vessels and occasions when Member States may not allow a third-country vessel to use their ports.

The area covered by the agreement comprises the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and connecting waters. The main tasks of the GFCM are to promote the development, conservation and rational management of living aquatic resources, to formulate and recommend conservation measures, and to promote cooperative projects in the area of training. The present proposal for a regulation is simply intended to transpose various recommendations adopted by the GFCM, and already in effect in the GFCM’s contracting States, into a single Community legislative act into which future recommendations can be incorporated by way of amendments to that act. The provisions of the regulation are the usual types of things that such organisations regulate. Title II deals with restrictions on fishing gear and activities (‘technical measures’). Title III consists of ‘control measures’ such as reporting requirements, inspections, etc. Title IV deals with cooperation, information and reporting requirements for the Commission and the Member States to cooperate and exchange information with the Executive Secretary of the GFCM. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect, I would stress that ‘the introduction of a tax on financial transactions ought to be as broadly based as possible’, as the document suggests, in a way that includes all types of transactions. Among other benefits, a financial transaction tax makes the market fairer and more transparent, reduces speculation and levels of fiscal fraud, and distributes the burden of the crisis among the financial operators. The additional resources resulting from this measure should help with combating poverty, encouraging job creation, funding the welfare state, achieving climate and environmental targets and financing other elements arising from the Europe 2020 strategy. I support the need, in turn, for the Commission to study a future system of Eurobonds and the projected issuing of common European project bonds as measures for stimulating investment. I also support the ‘polluter pays’ principle. Finally, we cannot overlook support for development, as it is important to maintain the commitment to set aside 0.7% of the gross national income of each Member State for developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report does not do justice to that situation. What it aims to do is to prescribe a number of taxes at EU level, including a tax on financial transactions and an energy tax. If a tax on the financial sector is necessary, the revenues it generates should go to Member States’ treasuries. After all, they are the ones who have had to bail out the banks. Member States would do well to use these revenues to reduce the public debt, which has increased during the crisis. However, the report assumes without question that such revenues could benefit global and EU policy objectives. That would then include climate change and development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the report includes an argument for a solidarity levy on air tickets, so that we can combat public health problems and reduce charges in the transport sector. I accept that we could pursue these useful policy objectives and that it would be advisable to consider allocating more resources for that purpose. However, as this would affect our tax measures, it is Member States who should be taking such initiatives, not Europe dictating them top-down.

Although the idea of introducing a tax on financial transactions seems to support the general public, even if the G20 leaders failed to agree on setting such a contribution at global level, I feel obliged to mention that this could have an adverse impact in the medium and long term. The impact of such a tax, imposed only on capital established in the EU, will certainly be to make this capital migrate to developed or emerging countries outside the EU. The other scenario, at least in an initial phase, will be that this tax will be passed on in the form of costs to the credit consumer or other financial services. Whatever the situation, the perverse effect of this is that the EU will move even closer to the dangerous situation where it will lose its competitiveness against other states such as the US, Japan or the BRIC countries. This will slow down economic growth and create problems, including for the real economy, which is dependent on the cheapest possible sources of financing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In contrast to the approved report, however, I do not see market pressures in this, but rather the irresponsible budgetary policy of many national governments that are unwilling to reform their pension, health and employment systems. In my opinion, putting the blame on market failure is misguided and shows a lack of courage to face up to the necessary reforms. We have now approved rules on more stringent financial regulation and financial market supervision, and we should go further and take measures to kick-start European economies, for example, in the form of funding for common infrastructure projects and tax incentives for firms to invest in science and research. I would like to warn against the introduction of a tax on financial transactions and various forms of bank taxes, because it would tie up the financial market and distort competition. Eurobonds are not the solution, as they only transfer fiscal irresponsibility to the European level, to places further away from public control, where attempts at excessive spending would have even more serious repercussions than at the national level. I am also not in favour of a Europe-wide carbon tax, as this would impose a disproportionate burden on the energy sector in particular, and ultimately reduce the energy security of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The paradigm of the new welfare economy, whereby the pursuit of individual wellbeing is the key to collective welfare, which is the sum of its parts, is apparent in all its inadequacy. According to this approach, individual interest does not set any limitation on the collective interest, let alone the general interest. Yet because public government must set general interest as a framework within which to operate, and provide free space for freedom and individual rights within it, it must support this with a fair and progressive tax system. Consistent with this approach, which must be supported at global level by the EU and all G8 and G20 countries, the revenue from financial transactions must be made comparable to other revenues through a specific tax system that favours greater responsibility by operators together with other rules and new paradigms. The introduction of Eurobonds designed for the crisis fund and infrastructure projects could strengthen the EU’s ability to take action if they were additional to the EU budget.

Unfortunately, it contains a proposal for Europe to introduce a financial transaction tax on a unilateral basis. I believe that the Swedish example of the unilateral introduction of a kind of financial transaction tax in the 1980s, which resulted in the majority of trade in shares, bonds and options moving to London, should be taken into consideration so that we do not make the same mistake at European level. I consider there to be a big risk that the stabilising effects on the financial market will not be realised if the EU introduces such a tax independently. The risk of trade in shares, bonds and options transferring to less transparent and less open markets outside Europe is great. That will not create better conditions for control of the financial market. I therefore voted against the amendment that proposed a European Tobin tax but, in spite of the fact that this proposal was voted through, I chose to vote in favour of the report in the final vote.</p>
<p class="contents">This choice was made on the basis of the fact that, as Europe 2020 negotiator for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would otherwise have risked undermining the group’s negotiating position on what are, for us, important issues, such as the importance of creating a real internal market, enabling the financing of infrastructure projects by means of European project bonds, and a possible solution with regard to a European carbon tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission, however, obstinately refuses to proceed with these proposals.

I agree with the provision and the call for innovative financing measures to raise more from this sector and contribute to shifting the burden of taxation away from working people.

I support the idea of issuing common European project bonds to finance Europe’s significant infrastructure needs and structural projects within the framework of the Europe 2020 agenda and anticipated new EU strategies, such as the new strategy on energy infrastructure development, and other large-scale projects. EU project bonds would thus secure the investment required, would attract the support they need, and would become an important mechanism for maximum leverage of public support. These projects must also contribute to the ecological transformation of our economies, paving the way for the zero carbon economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The dramatic increase in financial transactions has revealed the growing gap between finance and the real economy.

This idea was accepted by the European Parliament in general terms today. The Podimata own-initiative report adopted by Parliament does not entail a definitive yes or no to the issue of a financial transaction tax. It is not clear whether we can expect a corresponding proposal from the Commission or, if so, then when? We still have a long way to go before a legislative process is put in train. At present, the Commission is simply preparing a feasibility study. One of the framework conditions for this feasibility study is that competitiveness should not be impaired by the financial transaction tax. It is quite unrealistic to expect a worldwide introduction of a financial transaction tax at present. The own-initiative report did not just deal with the issue of a financial transaction tax, but also with the smooth functioning of competition policy in the EU and the introduction of a carbon tax following the VAT model, to be charged on every product in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept this carbon tax. This is an environmental policy demand of the Conservatives, who are seeking an energy mix that combines nuclear energy and renewable energies. Nuclear energy would remain unscathed by this tax. We are calling for the taxing of energy inputs, also covering nuclear energy, through a combined primary energy/carbon tax. I abstained from the final vote because I could not vote in favour of a report that links one good idea, a transaction tax, with measures that would place an even greater burden on the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Financial transactions are typified by a hefty increase in volume and by a noticeable disparity between the volume of financial transactions and the needs of the real economy. Short-term investments, which predominate, have led to excessive volatility and risk-taking. Short-term speculative transactions were at the heart of the crisis and have underlined the clear connection between inefficient financial regulation and supervision and the sustainability of public finances. I voted for this report because the problems caused by this market behaviour have had a major impact on public finances, European citizens and beyond. The report intends to create tools designed to reduce speculation, guarantee a fair distribution of the burden between the key financial players and create new additional resources to meet the major challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Tax evasion and fraud are currently estimated to cost EU Member States approximately EUR 250 billion a year.

It is doubtless right for Europe to take the lead here – after all, we would have to wait indefinitely if we were to try to bring the Americans on board too. However, a financial transaction tax should not be used as an opportunity to introduce an EU tax by the back door. Unfortunately, however, Mrs Podimata’s report takes us in precisely that direction. Fiscal sovereignty must remain with the Member States. If Brussels cannot manage on the money it gets, then it needs to tighten its belt. There are enough powers already that could be better regulated at a national level than at EU level. The other calls contained in the report, namely for the introduction of Eurobonds and a carbon tax, should be rejected. On the one hand, Eurobonds are a product that goes against all economic sense, while on the other, fiscally prudent euro area countries are once again unfairly required to pay the price.

Europe, with the world’s largest financial market, is gradually trying to get back on its feet following the crisis, the effects of which will be felt for many years to come. Consequently, it is crucial to establish innovative financing measures which would ensure financial stability and transparency. Currently, the majority of financial services are exempt from VAT. Therefore, significant revenue is being lost through the financial sector and the tax burden is increasing for working people. I believe that the tax on financial transactions is an effective financing measure that would help reduce speculation and public deficits. Having properly assessed its possible negative impact on the EU’s global competitiveness, we must make every effort to ensure that it is also applied at global level. Furthermore, in order to increase the GDP of all countries, it would be advisable to establish a tax on bank assets which would be proportionate to the systemic significance of the credit institution concerned and to the level of risk involved in an activity. I agree with the proposal on issuing European project bonds which, as a common debt management instrument, will help to attract increased investment in European infrastructure projects. Furthermore, in order to obtain maximum benefit from the application of the carbon tax, it is necessary to set the minimum mandatory requirements for all Member States, preventing overwhelming burdens from being shifted to low income consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that the report points out that the EU Member States must meet the aid targets that have been set is also important.</p>
<p class="contents">We nevertheless chose to abstain in the final vote because we do not believe that it is a good idea for Europe to introduce a financial transaction tax independently if other countries do not also do the same. We believe that the Swedish example of the unilateral introduction of a kind of financial transaction tax in the 1980s, which resulted in the majority of trade in shares, bonds and options moving to London, should be taken into consideration so that we do not make the same mistake at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider there to be a big risk that the stabilising effects that we hope a financial transaction tax will have on the financial market will not be realised if the EU introduces such a tax independently.

At the same time, banks are accumulating profits through the differential between loans obtained from central banks at an interest rate of almost nil and the price at which they grant credit to customers and to states. Thus, it is a moral imperative for financial businesses to shoulder their responsibilities in the face of the crisis that they caused. A financial transaction tax is the least that can be demanded.</p>
<p class="contents">To those seeking to delay this accountability, on the pretext that such a tax can only be introduced at a global level, I would say: (1) that the EU’s position would be greatly strengthened by the unilateral launching of this tax; (2) if a proportion of the capital applied in speculative transactions were to leave the EU, this would result in a reduction in the volatility of the financial markets, which would be beneficial; (3) if global financial regulation is not viable or advisable, sensible rules on the circulation of capital will be needed.

The Greens have long championed the introduction of a financial transaction tax both as a means of curbing harmful speculation and as a new source for generating public revenue. As well as being a potentially significant source of revenue at a time when national exchequers are under strain, a financial transaction tax is socially just. A FTT would also clearly address the systemic risk emanating from high-frequency trading, acting as a disincentive for risky speculation.

We have to take advantage of this momentum and restrain the greed of the financial and banking sectors. After all, a global crisis requires global solutions and Europe, as the largest financial market, can play a pioneering role in this regard. A financial transaction tax could provide Member States with sufficient revenue to balance their budgets and keep their economies going.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the revenue potential of an FTT of 0.05% amounts to nearly EUR 200 billion in the EU and USD 650 billion globally, this tax could also form an important part of the solution in the search for new and sustainable sources of income. An FTT could limit speculation and stabilise markets, create incentives for long-term investments and, because each transaction is traceable, it could increase transparency and ensure that financial players accept their share of the cost of the crisis.

Responses need to be provided to the crisis through new instruments that can put a brake on speculation, restore the role of the financial sector, ensure an equitable distribution of the burdens, and create new, additional resources for facing global challenges, such as climate change, development goals and intelligent, sustainable, inclusive growth within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy. This own-initiative report is the result of a desire to find new, innovative sources of financing. Taxation instruments based on the receipt of income are not considered to be sufficient. The document examines the following possibilities for innovative financing: taxation of the financial sector, Eurobonds and taxation of the energy sector. In my view, it is essential to innovate in terms of alternative means of financing that are equal to today’s challenges and in line with the modern world, but it is inadvisable to do this without first studying its real impact. Just as important as increasing income is bolstering the regulatory role of the market, creating mechanisms to strengthen its transparency, efficiency and stability. For these reasons, I voted in favour of the document during the plenary session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It clarifies from the outset that there can be no question of taxing capital: ‘emphasises that an increase in the rates and the scope of existing taxation … can be neither a sufficient nor a sustainable solution’. However, in order to deceive the workers, it calls on the EU to adopt a ‘financial transaction tax’ of 0.01%, which is presented as an allegedly ‘fair distribution of the burden’ of the crisis between capital and the workers and an effort to limit speculation by capital. At the same time, direct taxation on poor grassroots classes is being increased and indirect taxation, which literally eats into working class and grassroots incomes, is being pushed through the roof. The financial transaction tax is not a tax on the financial sector; it is another indirect tax. Alongside this new indirect tax, a whole series of so-called ‘innovative financing’ measures, or rather new taxes on grassroots incomes, is also proposed, such as a ‘carbon tax’, a ‘solidarity contribution on air tickets’, even a ‘global lottery’ to combat hunger. The Greek Communist Party voted against this particular report, underlining that the only popular way out of the capitalist crisis is to target the profits of the monopolies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Due to the economic and financial crisis, some Member States have taken austerity measures leading to a reduction in the level of funding for public health, disease prevention and long-term care services. Not all EU citizens have access to quality health services. This is particularly true in the EU’s poorer regions, where patients do not have access to quality healthcare and treatment services. Major disparities exist both in reimbursement for medication and the treatment of individual complex diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, which prevents the patients of some Member States from obtaining reimbursable medication and the treatment they need in their country. I believe that the European Commission must take measures to reduce disparities and inequality of access to quality healthcare services faced by people in the EU and establish mechanisms to monitor inequalities in health. The Commission should also present an initiative, aimed at encouraging and supporting the development by Member States of integrated national or regional strategies to reduce health inequalities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The challenges facing the European Union, the result of demographic changes, require a concrete plan for combating health inequalities in rural areas.</p>

Citizens are not equal, whether in terms of life expectancy, poverty or social exclusion, and they are not all exposed to health risks. The report also mentions undocumented migrants, who often face tremendous difficulty in accessing health services in host countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, we invite the Member States to improve access to healthcare for all, whether citizens or not, and call on them to further coordinate their national health policies.

I think it is essential that reducing these inequalities should be considered a priority at all levels of decision making.

On the supply side, the economic and financial crisis has resulted in a fall in the level of funds allocated to public health and healthcare services, and in the long term too, as a result of budget cuts and lower revenues obtained from the collection of taxes. On the other hand, the demand for healthcare services has risen in the long term as well, as a result of a combination of factors contributing to the deterioration in the population’s state of health in general. Several Member States have included as part of their recovery packages measures to alleviate the effects of the economic crisis on healthcare services, by investing in the health service’s infrastructure, making optimum use of the funds allocated to healthcare services, as well as by restructuring and reorganising the healthcare system.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are large discrepancies in Member States in terms of measures adopted to combat inequalities. Access is a key issue in the case of all public services.

These inequalities tend to begin at birth and persist into old age, influenced throughout life by access to education, employment and healthcare, and may be exacerbated by differences based on gender and race. It is essential to reduce the size of the existing disparities, which jeopardise the commitments made by the EU with regard to solidarity, social and economic cohesion, human rights and equality of opportunity, as a result of which this is one of the priority actions within the 2008-2013 EU strategy for health. However, it is important to recognise that health policy is the responsibility of the Member States, together with the establishment of respective systems for people to access healthcare. The report describes several interesting measures, but does not examine their financial impact.

<p class="contents">Words are therefore not enough! Neoliberal policies need to be dispensed with, and top priority given to prevention and public health, in order to guarantee effective equality of opportunity in access to healthcare.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stability Pact needs to be dispensed with in order to prevent the cost of accessing public health services increasing, medicine prices increasing, even for chronic illnesses, and support for patient transport to treatment and healthcare appointments being removed, even in areas where there is no public transport, all in the name of the need to reduce the budget deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the result of these policies is an increase in health-related inequalities, as is currently happening in Portugal. People on lower incomes are having increasing difficulty in accessing healthcare.

Inequalities experienced in earlier life in access to education, employment and healthcare, as well as those based on gender and cultural background, can have a critical bearing on the health status of people throughout their lives. The combination of poverty with other vulnerabilities such as childhood, old age or disability further increases health risks and vice-versa, ill health can lead to poverty and/or social exclusion. Increasingly, the link between social determinants and health inequalities is being recognised. This means that social problems are becoming widely viewed as being linked to health problems requiring an integrated response. The social consequences of the current economic and financial crisis have now unfolded. There are nearly 5 million more unemployed than at the beginning of the crisis. Many households have seen their income drop, a considerable number is more exposed to poverty and over indebtedness, and some have lost their homes. Workers on short-term contracts were among the first to be hit by the downturn. Migrants and young and older workers, who are more likely to be in precarious positions, were especially affected, but categories of workers who were so far relatively well protected also became unemployed. An innovative view of policy is needed to tackle health inequalities, especially for people in lower socio-economic groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a problem that needs to be resolved. There are various reasons for the health inequalities between population groups.

It is good that people have started more and more to understand the link between special problems and health problems. These problems have to be resolved comprehensively.</p>
<p class="contents">It is possible to address the factors that result in health inequalities through socio­political action.

The issue of equal access to health is one of the pillars of our common policy, both now and especially in the future. The unequal performance of economies and the current crisis should not impose limits on securing equal opportunities for the provision of healthcare to EU citizens regardless of differences between health systems. In my opinion, it is very significant that the text emphasises greater patient awareness and high quality legal advice for immigrants, as well as for others, including illegal immigrants. The fundamental principle must be that the health of individual citizens is secured through territorial and financial accessibility, and not only to medicines. Ensuring the coordination of education and professional training for health workers will be an important factor for progress, along with setting minimum standards for the quality and safety of care. The rapporteur correctly emphasises the prevention of both smoking and obesity and other conditions influencing the length of active life. I support the emphatic request to the Commission to encourage Member States to provide and fund treatment for patients with conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. The treatment of these conditions is not funded in some Member States. These conditions affect both elderly and particularly young people, and lead to social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It emphasises the importance of maintaining and improving universality and access for all to high quality healthcare, including for undocumented immigrants, among other vulnerable groups. It draws attention to the fact that the economic and financial crisis, together with the austerity measures imposed by Member States, have had a severe impact on the health sector, and this will make inequalities even more marked. This report encourages the Commission and Member States to develop a set of common indicators for monitoring inequalities in the area of health, and to continue with the ‘health in all policies’ strategy. It also stresses the importance of preventative action and a ‘local care approach’. In the light of the above, and to encourage the suggestions contained in the report, I voted in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The effects are particularly clear when one considers the different levels of life expectancy, which can vary by 5.6 years in the case of men, and as much as 6.6 years in the case of women, within the 27 Member States of the EU. The reasons for this are partly to be found in poor levels of education, and high levels of poverty and unemployment. It is therefore hardly surprising that the wave of redundancies that followed the economic crisis has not had a positive effect on public health. After all, loss of income significantly reduces access to medical services in many countries.

Within this context, I believe that the EU should, on the one hand, concentrate on taking action against tax havens and tax evasion (which undermine political and economic systems in developing countries by encouraging financial crime and inequality in the redistribution of tax revenues) and, on the other, establish a process of cooperation and dialogue with the tax authorities of these countries.</p>

The report also suggests ways in which the Union might improve the use of existing funds and instruments. It underlines the importance of supporting effective and sustainable tax systems, in particular, by combating fraud and tax evasion, in order to contribute to a transparent and equitable international tax environment, in particular, through assistance with taking action against tax havens. It is through good economic governance that these countries will be able to move away from their dependence on external aid, contributing to the development of the public and private sectors and to economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to achieve the goals set by the UN in 2000 in the Millennium Declaration, these countries need to know how to promote good governance in tax matters, by maximising all external support. In 2009, the European Commission, which has an interest in cooperation with these countries, published the document ‘Tax and development – Cooperating with developing countries on promoting good governance in tax matters’, with the objective of promoting synergies between development policy and tax policy, in order to make them fairer, more transparent and more effective. The same resolution was approved by Parliament in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU believes that fairer and more consistent tax systems will contribute to reducing poverty and making up for the loss of some revenue. I therefore support this report, which calls for the end of tax havens – veritable ‘weapons of mass destruction’ for developing countries – the combating of economic crime, action against tax evasion and unfair competition, and development through good governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Another aspect is the fact that the EU is committed to the principle of ownership of development strategies, and acknowledges the prime responsibility of developing countries themselves to improve their revenue systems, according to their own economic and political circumstances and choices. The Commission aims to engage the EU instruments in providing enhanced support in designing developing countries’ tax systems and implementing the principles of good governance in the tax area, i.e. by paying more attention to effectively integrating the principles of good governance in tax matters into the programming, implementation and monitoring of country and regional strategy papers. The Commission supports country-by-country financial reporting standards for multinationals as a tool to detect international tax avoidance and evasion practice. It is also important to underline the fact that a Communication on Corporate Social Responsibility will consider how to develop a system for mandatory disclosure of governance information in annual accounting. The Commission aims to step up the process of international dialogue and cooperation in tax matters, notably by enhancing the participation of developing countries in relevant international fora. The Commission also insists on the need to conclude and implement Tax Information Exchange Agreements, including through a multilateral mechanism, by referring to the model of the EU Savings Taxation Directive, based on the automatic exchange of information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Criteria of transparency, information exchange and fair tax competition are fundamental. The Commission seeks to implement this process by strengthening synergies between fiscal and development policies in order to identify the difficulties encountered by such countries in the mobilisation of revenue through taxation. On the other hand, the Commission still overlooks several issues that require a prompt response. We consider it necessary, in fact, to conduct a determined fight against tax havens in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, but in no way limit the further measures taken, in particular, by paying attention to tax treaties. To this end, it is desirable that most international organisations should hold a specific mandate in order to combat tax havens. Lastly, it is essential to extend the tax base, passing through the adjustment of tax reform to the development of direct taxation, in order to resolve collection difficulties arising from the regressive VAT system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for every country to establish an efficient and effective tax system and policies to implement it, because this is the backbone of their public finances and a way of attracting investment. We must therefore leave developing countries some discretionary powers in this area. Cooperation must be based on mutual assistance, without creating additional obstacles or burdens for either party. I agree with the proposal that we must help ensure the quantitative and qualitative improvement in developing countries’ revenue mobilisation. Aid allocated to developing countries should be targeted, effective and only provided if it is essential, and countries themselves should not have the right to decide whether it is required.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that it is advisable to give the EU an additional burden and compensate developing countries for the decline in customs revenue. In my opinion, we should establish a tax on financial transactions, which would limit speculation and would make the market function more effectively. Furthermore, we must make every effort to ensure that this tax is applied not just at EU, but also at global level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, the tax system needs to become the backbone of public finances in developing countries. The EU’s new policy for investment in developing countries needs to contribute to the establishment of an environment that is more favourable to domestic and external private investment, and to the creation of conditions for more effective international assistance. In order to promote growth, the EU’s investment policy needs to focus on the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, including the provision of micro-credit, the effectiveness of public services, public/private partnerships and knowledge transfer. The European Commission working document published in April 2009 entitled ‘Tax and development – Cooperating with developing countries on promoting good governance in tax matters’ provides pointers and methodologies for the promotion of synergies between tax policy and development policy, with the aim of making them both more efficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to be credible to this end, the EU must clearly clamp down on its own tax havens first and go beyond the OECD framework. The report also calls for the adoption of an international convention on tax matters that would include sanctions both for non-cooperative jurisdictions and for financial institutions that operate with tax havens. MEPs have also underlined the need to ensure greater transparency by multinational companies on their tax compliance in developing countries, notably the extractive industries, by ensuring country-by-country reporting. EU tax assistance should encourage the development of progressive taxation regimes in developing countries, notably by securing an equitable share of a corporation’s profits. Good tax governance is crucial to development and the EU should support developing countries to this end, particularly against a background of the decline in trade taxes resulting from trade liberalisation globally.

If developing countries wish to operate in the global economy, they must integrate and reform their taxation systems. Taxes play an economic, political and social role in democratic countries. They not only constitute the main source of state revenue, but also allow social objectives of the utmost importance to be achieved. They fund basic services such as healthcare, education, social care and pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Tax revenue in developing countries may sustainably fund the development of these countries and improve their citizens’ quality of life. Nevertheless, at present, such revenue is frequently insufficient to cover the costs of basic public services or to fight poverty. In an era of globalisation, capital subject to taxation is more mobile and barriers to trade are being abolished, which reduces tax revenue and poses a challenge, not only to the poorer countries. Regardless of its obvious benefits, the progressive liberalisation of trade reduces customs revenue. It is very important that foreign taxes should be replaced by those levied internally. While income tax is one of the main forms of taxation in rich countries, its contribution is minimal in developing countries. The majority of people are employed informally in agriculture and have irregular incomes, which makes it difficult to enforce income tax effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, I firmly believe that making trade flows as smooth as possible contributes to greater producer flexibility and to a reduction in the costs for exchanging goods, and that this has a favourable impact on both producer revenues and consumer spending. I cannot therefore agree with the statement contained in the approved resolution that trade liberalisation will not make it possible for the threat of hunger to be eradicated from the world. This is not the role of commerce, nor can it be. I applaud the Commission for the fact that, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation negotiations and bilateral or bioregional negotiations, it has used measures arising from the ongoing long-term reforms as proposals in the field of agriculture, while always recognising the parameters of the common agricultural policy as a line in the sand. In this regard, the approved text of the resolution unfortunately strikes me as having a rather one-sided focus, undermining the Commission’s steps in the political negotiations to date on trade. I regard any further flexibility in the forthcoming negotiations as an unequivocal opportunity and a benefit. In relation to the criticism of some steps, such as the reduction in import duties levied on bananas or the reform of the sugar regime, I would then like to add that they were primarily based on the conclusions of the dispute resolution in the WTO, which also influenced the parameters of the EU’s subsequent measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious that trade agreements have to be made, particularly in the trade rounds of the World Trade Organisation.

It gives examples of the disastrous consequences of this policy – the case of sugar is a prime example. It acknowledges that greater liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, increased by World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements, has not, to date, enabled the threat of hunger in the world to be held at bay.

This problem affects not only the health of products, but also their quality. Hence, there must be consistency between the common agricultural policy and EU external trade policy. Such consistency must ensure the preservation of the European agricultural model, as well as a level playing field for EU producers in the world market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, I wanted to stress the fact that, in the many negotiations on trade agreements currently under way with several of the EU’s partners, it is essential to reach balanced agreements which are based on the principle of reciprocity. In this regard, imported products originating from third countries should respect health and social rules, as well as rules to protect consumers, the environment and animals, which are similar to those that we have in the EU. Furthermore, too often, concessions are made on agriculture in order to obtain enhanced market access in third countries for industrial products and services. This approach is no longer acceptable, and I wanted to use my vote to state once again that European agriculture must not be viewed as a tool to serve EU trade policy. Finally, the defence of the EU regime for authorising and marketing GMOs is a point to which I attach particular importance. At a time when this regime is increasingly coming under attack at the WTO, it is essential that the European Commission defends it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This ongoing trend will continue to have a negative effect if support programmes are not put in place for agriculture.

Coherence between the CAP and EU external trade policy shall ensure the preservation of the European agricultural model, as well as a level playing field for EU producers in the world market. The most important thing for us should be food security, safety and quality at an affordable price for EU citizens. There is a global increase in food demand against a background of higher production costs, severe volatility in agricultural markets, less land, less water and reduced energy inputs. A strong CAP is also crucial for the preservation, environmental sustainability and economic development of the EU rural areas against the threat of land abandonment and rural depopulation. The European agricultural sector has a clear added value and a major role to play in the Europe 2020 strategy towards tackling the socio-economic and environmental challenges that the EU is facing, both internally and as a leading global player. EU trade policy will play a decisive role, determining whether agriculture will continue to make a full positive contribution to these objectives. Trade policy should not undermine the dynamic of the EU agricultural sector. On the contrary, trade policy and agricultural policy can and must be mutually supportive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, the attitude towards farmers has not always been fair. I fully support free trade agreements with other countries or groups of countries, but, in concluding such agreements, we must not put our farmers at a competitive disadvantage. The real losers from this unfair competition will be the people of the European Union, for whom we must ensure daily access to high-value and high quality food at reasonable prices. Often enough, this is taken to be self-evident, without thinking that it is our farmers who provide this security; farmers, whose incomes are often considerably below the average income in their countries. Nor do we have to do anything supernatural – we must simply stipulate that agricultural products imported into the European Union should be subject to the same environmental, social, animal welfare and safety standards that European farmers are obliged to observe. That would be fair and would put those farmers who wish to sell their products in the European Union on the same competitive footing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Border checks carried out by Member States must ensure that European legislation is correctly implemented in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our efforts will have to be aimed at greater harmony between market liberalisation and protection for the domestic economic sector. Food security at Member State level is achieved by maintaining a stable agricultural sector, which is not jeopardised by external trade policy, against the background of increased market volatility. Small farmers make a significant contribution to food security in the regions where they operate. I think that trade agreements with third countries on importing agricultural products need to be concluded based on compensation for farmers in the event of possible losses. At the same time, I support an agricultural policy which is orientated as much as possible to ensuring access for EU agricultural products to third country markets. The purpose of promoting products with an EU regional label is to make them well known outside the EU, which, by extension, would boost their consumption. According to recent studies, the world’s population is growing at a much faster rate than global cereal production. The EU has many regions which have the capacity required to utilise more efficiently their cereal production potential and are capable of making an effective contribution to narrowing these differences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is the largest importer of agricultural produce from developing countries, and imports more than the US, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand taken together. If we allow these countries to gain increased market access, it could have detrimental effects not only on European farmers, but also on those developing countries most in need. For this reason, the EU should take a more balanced approach between the various sectors during trade negotiations, and should promote both its defensive and offensive agricultural interests. The agricultural sector of the EU plays a special part in the Europe 2020 strategy with regard to the various socio-economic challenges. The EU’s commercial policy has an important and decisive role in ensuring that agriculture continues to deliver a positive contribution to the fulfilment of our objectives.

Moreover, EU producers can scarcely compete on price in the world market because our social, quality, animal protection and environmental standards are so high – the very standards that we are unable or unwilling to check when importing foods. If we do not want our rural areas to continue to decline and the numbers of farmers to continue to reduce, posing a serious threat to the self-sufficiency of the EU Member States, then it is high time we stopped paying agricultural subsidies to the big agricultural concerns and instead gave the money to those who really need it in order to survive – in other words, to small farmers.</p>

The EU is the largest importer of agricultural goods in the world, but its share of global agricultural exports is declining as a result of the growth of other key agricultural trading partners and world market prices, which are low while the Union has high production costs. The EU is the world’s biggest importer of agricultural goods from developing countries and it is therefore necessary to protect the interests of EU farmers and provide for a mechanism to compensate them for their losses. EU farmers must be protected from unfair competition and therefore, the same standards that apply in the EU’s agricultural sector must also apply to products exported from third countries. These conditions must be included in bilateral trade agreements. Furthermore, there must be comprehensive support to obtain market access in third countries for EU products. I believe that the Commission’s proposal to grant Pakistan a zero-duty tariff rate quota for exporting to the EU 100 000 tonnes of ethanol per year for a period of three years will not provide direct and immediate assistance and will have a negative impact on the EU renewable energy industry. In view of the fact that Ukrainian cereal production is highly competitive and enjoys reduced tariffs, the Commission must be more careful about applying concessions in negotiations with Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to the above, it is also important to bear in mind that the European agricultural sector is obliged to meet the highest standards in terms of quality, product hygiene, sustainable production methods, animal and plant health and welfare, traceability, pesticide residue control, veterinary medicine and additives; these aspects increase production costs and should be taken into consideration during multilateral and bilateral negotiations.

The internal EU pressures towards making the CAP market-orientated and greater emphasis on other European policies are equally reflected in the EU’s external trade policy aimed at opening up the agricultural market in exchange for improved access for European industrial products and services in third-country markets. This also involves preserving the European agricultural model, as well as a level playing field for EU producers in the world market. The multifunctional role of the European agricultural sector can serve as a catalyst for new paradigms: food security, safety and quality at an affordable price for EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a rise in global food demand against a background of higher production costs, worsening volatility in agricultural markets, less land, less water and reduced energy inputs. A strong common agricultural policy is also fundamental to the preservation, environmental sustainability and economic development of EU rural areas against the threat of land abandonment and rural depopulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased that there was also support for the point calling on the Commission to resolutely protect EU regulations concerning the approval and marketing of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) against the demands being made in the WTO. Essentially, this means that the use of GMOs will remain strictly regulated, and this will improve food safety as well as the situation of our farmers. There was also support for a number of points concerning taxes on imports of various groups of agricultural products, as well as quality requirements on these products.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to GMO-related issues, general issues of food safety were also discussed. For example, Brazil has thus far not managed to consistently meet EU producer and consumer standards on food safety, animal identification and traceability, animal health and disease monitoring.

The European agricultural sector merits particular attention. The common agricultural policy is the oldest common policy and must be kept robust. I would remind you that this sector fulfils many roles and it needs to be related with other social and political objectives, such as the Europe 2020 strategy. Nevertheless, European agriculture does not exist in isolation from European external relations, specifically as regards international trade and development aid. The importance of international relations, not least through agreements such as that between the EU and Mercosur, is reflected at the economic, political and strategic partnership levels. That is why it is essential to promote consistency of standards, in particular, as regards agricultural issues. I therefore voted against paragraphs 53 and 54 of this report. In addition, free trade agreements expose the sector to new challenges and different realities. I would cite the situation of the outermost regions, which have fragile economies based essentially on farming products similar to those of our Latin American partners. As a Member from one of the outermost regions, I would stress the importance of taking into account the specific characteristics of these regions, and of attempting to avoid compromising their development during future negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EU agriculture has an essential role to play in providing employment and maintaining vitality in rural areas, while the European agri-food model is a strategic component of the European economy. Global food demand has grown due to the impact of climate change, higher production costs and a reduction in the area of farmland available and in drinking water resources. I wish to stress the importance of the trade in agricultural products for economic development and eradicating poverty. I call on the EU to adopt measures to support the countries hit hardest by the food crisis. The EU’s share of global agricultural exports is declining. In this context, I think that the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement is of paramount importance. This is why the European Parliament should be closely involved in all the negotiations.

In the same way, I reject the idea that we should lower our guard when it comes to defending the interests of European farmers. If Europe has managed to establish a close link between its agriculture and its territory and to achieve a level of excellence in its agricultural production, it is thanks to the work of farmers.

The shortages of imports impose an additional cost burden on the livestock and feedstuffs sectors, putting the economic viability of domestic meat production at risk. Rebalancing the supply and consumption of cereals, proteins and oilseeds in the European Union would have major economic benefits for farmers and the food and feed industry, as well as for improving the variety of healthy, high quality food for consumers. Furthermore, in the context of climate change, protein crops can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the assimilation and fixation of nitrogen in the soil, with the consequent reduction in the use of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser. These crops also help reduce soil acidification, improve its structure, reduce the use of herbicides and encourage greater biodiversity, assisting pollination.

There has been a decrease in protein crop production in the European Union in the past ten years, while our market has, to a large extent, become dependent on imports. This situation was caused by previously established international trade agreements, which allowed the EU to protect its cereal production and, in return, allowed duty-free imports of oilseed and protein crops into the EU. This created the conditions to import the production required cheaply and to ensure the competitiveness of agriculture, in particular, the livestock sector. However, within the EU itself, farmers and processing businesses lost interest in this sector. The number of plant protein research programmes dropped, the development of disease resistant and highly performing varieties stopped and throughout Europe, practical experience in protein crop production is being lost. Today’s situation with constantly fluctuating prices on the markets and the high price of protein feed may have a negative impact on the EU livestock sector, which is largely dependent on imports. The Commission should immediately consider measures to promote the production and storage of protein crops in the EU, and provide support to farmers growing such crops, which should be reflected in the reform of the common agricultural policy. This would facilitate the recovery of this sector, safeguard incomes for farmers, and contribute to sustainable farming in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These figures should be enough to draw the attention of the political leadership and justify a change in policy. At a time when food prices are hitting historic highs, putting food security at risk, the European Union, which is reviewing its common agricultural policy, cannot fail to look at the problem of protein crop production and try to find a solution.

Other solutions include the introduction of protein crops in crop rotation, or a strengthening of research and consultation, and the expansion of seed development and infrastructures for protein production. Unfortunately, a majority of members from three groups, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), the European Conservatives and Reformists and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, tabled amendments that go against this clear position adopted by Parliament. They are calling for imports of protein crops, particularly soya, to be made easier, including genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which are prohibited in the EU. Unfortunately, these amendments were passed with a narrow majority in a plenary vote in Parliament. However, I am convinced that calling for increased imports of GM soya is counterproductive to our actual objectives of strengthening the EU’s self-sufficiency.

The protein deficit in the EU is gradually increasing, and the EU only grows 30% of protein crops used for animal feed. Protein crops currently occupy only 3% of the EU’s arable land and therefore, the EU is forced to import 70% of these crops for animal feed. The extended use of protein crops in crop rotation offers major agro-environmental and climate mitigation advantages. Regarding climate change, leguminous varieties can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions through assimilation and fixation of nitrogen in the soil and thus reduce the use of nitrogen fertiliser. With a higher percentage of protein crops in crop rotation, soil fertility and structure, nutrient storage and the health of the crops which follow is improved. Permanent grass-clover mixtures for animal feed and mixtures of cereals and proteins cover soils better and so reduce nutrient run-off into groundwater and rivers, as well as offering better conditions for bees and other pollinating insects. Extended crop rotation reduces the need for crop protection intervention and can contribute to the conservation of diversity in wild and cultivated species and varieties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also works to the disadvantage of consumers, who buy meat and milk from animals fed with high protein feed. Area-related and climate conditions have made it possible for the production of high protein plants in the EU to undergo structural changes, and such changes can even be considered advisable in connection with biodiversity and measures to counteract climate change. Feed imported from third countries is not subject to such rigorous checks as European feed, and so we cannot be 100% sure of its quality, or know the exact origin of the raw materials from which it is made. We should therefore take prompt measures to change this situation, since the guarantees we have given that European food will be safe, healthy and of high quality will otherwise be proved empty words. The next step we take to resolve the EU’s protein deficit should be to relax the regulations banning the feeding of animals with meat and bone meal. In the case of poultry and pork, there has not been found to be any risk of diseases spreading as a result of this method of feeding, and after all, the ban on meat and bone meal was originally introduced in connection with BSE. Making it possible to use meal in animal husbandry will reduce production costs, which is extremely important in view of the drop in profitability of meat production. It would also allow us to reduce imports of high protein feed from America. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, the European Union’s dependence on imported protein has increased. Many sectors run the potential risk that, as a result of price volatility on the international market, they will be unable to obtain supplies of protein crops at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, when trade agreements with other countries were concluded several years ago, unfavourable competitive conditions were created for the cultivation of protein crops in the EU. We are experiencing the consequences of these ill-considered decisions today, which is why it is important to understand what happened, so that we can mark out the direction we need to take to overcome the protein deficit. We are currently actively engaged on a reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). The focus here is on support for active farmers, protection of the environment and the development of rural life. However, where CAP reform is concerned, we ought not to forget other matters too. It is emphasised in this resolution that greater use of protein crops in crop rotation significantly improves the agricultural environment and helps to mitigate climate change. I consider that these arguments are sufficiently persuasive for us also to resolve protein deficit issues within the framework of CAP reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Seventy percent of the protein rich crops required for animal feeds are imported from Brazil, Argentina and the US. This problem is clearly outlined in the report on this protein deficit and stringent standards are called for in relation to feedstuffs. Imported goods must also comply with quality, environmental and social standards. In addition, the raw materials suitable for the production of feed must be used more efficiently. It is important that our enormous dependence on third countries should be reduced as this is responsible for price volatility and a lack of transparency in terms of production conditions. This will only succeed if we in the EU take the production of protein crops into our own hands again, as this report proposes.

I also consider it important to retain sufficient variety in terms of the selection or range on offer of these products. As is the case with many reports or proposals negotiated by Parliament, the need for high quality products is also mentioned here. In relation to the products previously mentioned, it is also necessary to inspect actual samples, and to integrate this with verification of locally used agricultural processes and resources. Quality verification should be carried out very carefully and thoroughly when importing, through the use of modern laboratory methods and unambiguous identification of the origin of goods.

The protein deficit causes imbalances not only in agricultural production but also in the research and development of agricultural techniques. Farmers, in fact, have gradually lost interest in protein crops, resulting in the loss, at a European level, of practical experience related to these crops. There is therefore a need to follow up on the urgent situation described in the report and to formulate a truly integrated European strategy. It is only possible to respond to new challenges such as climate change or the loss of agricultural biodiversity if there is a more balanced supply and consumption of protein crop products within the EU. We therefore hope that the European Commission will examine possibilities for overcoming the current protein deficit emergency via a radical reform of the common agricultural policy, which will make it capable of meeting the new challenges. It would also be appropriate to introduce a supplementary payment if farmers use a mandatory rotation of at least four different crops, including at least one protein crop. Lastly, it would be necessary to establish a unit for agricultural research at the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development at the Commission, to motivate consumers and catering services to make more environmentally-friendly food choices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the last 10 years, there has been a decline of up to 30% in such crops, the only exception being soya, where the decline has only been 12%. Only 3% of arable land in the EU is used in the production of protein crops. As studies show, this not only leads to significant economic disadvantage because it results in an 80% import quota, but also brings disadvantages in the area of agriculture. This is because the cultivation of protein crops enriches the soil with nitrogen, subsequently promoting fertility. The research sector is also suffering under the low level of demand for seed for protein producing crops. The downward spiral has already begun.

This view ignores the fact that, due to natural constraints, Europe is simply not able to produce the quantities of soya and maize necessary to meet the demand of our farmers at a viable price. Affordable imports of protein from third countries such as the US are crucial if we wish to ensure food security and create conditions in which farmers can earn a decent living from agriculture. Furthermore, the report refers to the fact that we should explore the possibility of using animal protein as a source of animal feed. After our experience with BSE, I do not believe that we should go down this route, nor do I believe that this is necessary if an adequate supply of soya and maize is available to farmers.

Given the fact that this problem is deeply rooted in the EU and protein shortages are constantly increasing, we must make every effort to ensure that this problem is addressed as soon as possible and the production of local protein crops is increased. I believe that this resolution is an important step towards solving this problem. The growth of protein crops not only mitigates the impact of climate change, but also has a positive effect on farmers’ incomes. Furthermore, it is an important factor strengthening the EU’s livestock sector, given the fact that it would reduce the sector’s dependence on protein crop imports and would increase competitiveness. I believe that the Commission must take immediate action to stop crops with even a low presence of GMOs from accessing the EU market. We cannot allow even a low level presence of GMOs in protein crops for food and feed imported into the EU. I agree with the proposals to support research into the breeding and supply of protein crop seeds and for a framework for rural development measures which introduce improved, decentralised facilities for the production of animal feed. I believe that crop rotation must be actively promoted in the EU by giving financial support to farmers and this would reduce the current protein deficit and price volatility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There has been a worrying deficit in the production of protein crops in the European Union over the last 10 years and the situation now is one of considerable decline. The main dried pulses decreased by an average of 30%, and soybean production by 12%. This trend increases the already existing alarming dependence of the Union on imports of protein crops, which are mainly used for animal feed, and carries major risks, especially for the EU livestock sector. The problem is made worse by the fact that price volatility on international markets has substantially increased. It is a priority for the Commission to quickly ensure an unhindered supply of soya to the EU market by providing a technical solution regarding the low level presence of genetically modified organisms in protein crops for food and feed imported into the EU.

That is why I voted against the final text. Asking the Commission at this time to ensure an unimpeded supply of soya to the EU market by finding a technical solution for the presence of small amounts of GMOs in protein crops intended for use as feed is, to all intents and purposes, handing a major victory to the intensive agriculture lobby. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance advocates maximum development of the EU’s own protein crop production. Such a policy would be good for farmers’ incomes and make a substantial contribution to combating climate change, to the preservation of biodiversity, and to soil fertility.</p>
<p class="contents">What is crucial is to put in place a mechanism whereby we can monitor the origin of imported protein crops and thereby inspect the sustainability of the agricultural practices applied in the country of origin. Regular spot checks are absolutely necessary. The debate on reauthorising processed animal proteins from slaughterhouse waste to be used in the production of feed for pigs and poultry may only be conducted in terms of (food) safety and public health. Bans on intra-species recycling and forced cannibalism are crucial, as are reliable inspections in the animal feed sector and the correct application of existing EU legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, I regret the fact that the report was spoiled by the inclusion of the zero tolerance issue. The call to relax conditions on unauthorised imports of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) does not resolve the problem of the protein deficit in the European Union and should therefore not have been discussed. On the other hand, we absolutely must mitigate the considerable decline in protein crop farming in the Union and thus reduce our dependence, which is already alarming, on imports of plant proteins.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a clear denunciation of the Blair House agreements, the market-oriented objectives of which have contributed to extreme price volatility. Furthermore, those agreements completely contradict the Kyoto Protocol and its objectives concerning global warming.

<p class="contents">Protein is one of the most important components of our daily diet, and a lack of protein can lead to serious health problems. What is more, as is apparent from the research presented in the report, the cultivation of high protein crops and widespread application of the principle of crop rotation would reduce production costs and cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the poor eating habits of the citizens of the European Union’s Member States, as well as European farmers’ lack of experience of cultivating high protein crops, I believe that we should concentrate, first and foremost, on education. I am thinking here, above all, of making people more aware of the positive impact of protein on human health (the School Fruit Programme is an example of a programme with a similar aim currently being implemented within the European Union), and also of developing an incentive system for farmers cultivating high protein crops. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In every single country in the world, there is a different perception of the female; there is much talk about Islamic countries and the way in which women are judged and treated, which is further influenced by religion. Fortunately, even though we in the West have a vision of man and woman being equal, the facts describe a disturbing situation. In Europe, many inequalities still persist to the detriment of girls and women, in terms of employment, their private lives, health and their right of access to education and vocational training, and to fill positions in non-traditional sectors and positions that have a high level of responsibility. However that is not all: women not only face multiple forms of discrimination, but they are also victims of violence of all kinds, both psychological and physical.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary to protect women and put them in a position where they can lead lives which are qualitatively equal to those of men.

It is clear from life itself that the plutocracy’s claim that equality between men and women is allegedly being promoted within the framework of capitalist barbarity and EU policy is deceitful and insulting. The anti-grassroots policy of the EU, of the bourgeois governments, of the IMF and of other imperialist bodies, is striking a blow at the rights won by women. Mass unemployment, drastic pay cuts and cuts to social benefits, flexible forms of employment, an increase in the retirement age, flexible contracts of employment and the commercialisation of the social services of health, welfare and education are together exacerbating the living conditions of women and of the working and grassroots family as a whole. The EU 2020 strategy, economic governance and the budgetary discipline of the IMF and the ECB hold new anti-grassroots, anti-labour measures in store for women. This policy must be overturned.

This report, which has been adopted on International Women’s Day, should be seen together with Mrs Plumb’s report on female poverty in the European Union. Indeed, women are among the categories of people said to be vulnerable and who suffered the full impact of the crisis. Since they more often work part-time than men, because they carry out what can be casual work in the tertiary sector, because they have fragmented careers, because, even today, they are less well paid than men for the same kinds of jobs, and because their pensions are lower as a result, we need to make sure that women are constantly the focus of our attention.</p>

One important consequence that this crisis has had for women concerns employment: women were affected later than men because more of them worked in sectors that have withstood the effects of the crisis for longer (health, education, etc.). Now, however, even these sectors are at risk of being affected, bringing with it long-term insecurity for working women compared to men.</p>
<p class="contents">Partly for this reason, I believe that equality between men and women in employment should no longer be merely a goal to pursue, but must become a reality. The commitment of Member States and of the Commission is therefore necessary not only so that the policy of equality between men and women can be maintained but, above all, so that the budget expenditure allocated to them is not revised downwards. Finally, because I believe that the promotion of equality comes through the education and training of citizens and, in particular, of young people, I would draw the Commission’s attention to the opportunity for timely renewal of the campaigns to raise awareness on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must recognise that we still have a lot of work to do to improve women’s position in the field of gender equality, in the labour market and in politics. Women’s rights issues must be included in all areas of European Union policy and fine ideas and initiatives should not simply remain on paper, but must be implemented in all European Union Member States. In the European Parliament’s report on equality between men and women in the European Union, we therefore established that it is crucial to eliminate the gender pay gap, to stop violence against women and trafficking in women, guarantee maternity leave and create suitable conditions to take advantage of the services of nurseries and childcare centres and reduce female poverty. As for gender equality in business, attention should be drawn to the fact that only 3% of companies are chaired by women, because they face discrimination and obstacles preventing them from climbing the career ladder and pursuing leadership. An increasing number of MEPs agree with the introduction of a quota system, because if companies themselves fail to introduce changes to improve gender equality in business, there are plans to anchor quotas in legislation. I hope that, in future, we will find solutions and measures which will strengthen gender equality and equal opportunities for women in the family and society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Violence against women must continue to be combated and prevented through public information campaigns and teaching in schools. Nevertheless, I do not agree with quotas in the private sector, lists of vulnerable women, or the guaranteed minimum wage, which I consider impossible to implement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As such, it is important to create new opportunities and strengthen equality synergies between the genders, which will contribute to stimulating recovery and to economic growth itself. As 2010 was European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, I welcome the reference to combating poverty, paying particular attention to the most vulnerable women.

The economic crisis has serious consequences for women, who are at greater risk of poverty than men. Indeed, on average, they are paid 18% less than men for equal work in the EU, a figure that rises above 25% in some Member States, and are more likely to be precariously employed and/or employed part-time. Moreover, women are less likely to be re-employed when they lose their jobs. As a result, they enjoy lower pensions later in life. Tackling gender stereotypes is necessary but not enough. Countering such disadvantages obviously requires serious public investment in care facilities. However, the Barcelona Council targets for childcare are yet to be attained, affecting lower income families the most. We have to empower more women at all levels of political representation in Europe. Gender equality is not only a matter of justice but also an imperative for social and economic development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the principle of gender equality is enshrined in the Treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, we cannot help but notice that this remains an unrealised objective. Whether in terms of jobs, where far more women than men carry out casual work, in terms of pay, where women earn, on average, 18% less than men for positions of the same responsibility, or in terms of career prospects, the female gender is still held back by the famous glass ceiling. Women are also penalised when they have children.</p>
<p class="contents">The list of grievances is still a long one. The report voted on today includes specific responses such as the establishment of binding objectives for the Member States, and sanctions for non-compliance, and the introduction of quotas (a necessary evil) to increase our aspirations to equality a little.

Quotas belittle women, who will end up attaining certain positions simply because of their gender and not on the basis of their skill, ability or aptitude. It is therefore unacceptable to want to apply them in private companies.

It is disappointing that, despite numerous efforts and studies on the subject, some national law makers are still neglecting the destructive effects of discrimination, further aggravating gender inequalities and endangering fulfilment of the Lisbon strategy goals. In light of the persisting gap between men and women in terms of employment rates, working hours, wages and access to management positions, I call on Member States to better implement anti-discrimination and anti-harassment practices. It is necessary to engage stakeholders at grass-roots level, through information campaigns, use of NGOs, and also by more formal instruments such as including special provisions in collective agreements and national legislation relating to gender equality.</p>

Indeed, although the principle of equal pay for men and women is enshrined in the EU Treaties, we can see today that women earn 17.8% less than men. This inequality permeates all areas of society: for example, only 3% of major companies are chaired by a woman, and women are most affected by unemployment and casual employment. Hence, the alarming observation that in 2008, 17% of women in the 27 countries of the Union were considered to be living in poverty. Other measures are still necessary, such as a better distribution of family responsibilities and better protection of women from domestic violence. All these figures prove that it is now necessary to introduce binding measures. For this reason, therefore, I decided to vote in favour of establishing quotas, even though I was, in principle, opposed to the idea, and establishing policies of positive discrimination in the economic and political spheres. We must recognise today that we will not achieve real equality without policies based on a real will to change the situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that another fundamental point in this report can be found in paragraph 66, which affirms the right of women to easy access to contraception and abortion. Let us remember that in 11 countries of the Union, abortion is still not fully authorised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women have been severely affected by the crisis, particularly in terms of their working conditions, their access to employment, their place in society as a whole and gender equality. Whether on the boards of publicly listed companies or in the world of politics, women must be able to attain posts in line with their skills. Women are sometimes denied access to positions of responsibility, leading to a mismatch between their levels of training and their status. As 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty, particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable groups of women. Specific measures should be taken to stop women who are vulnerable on account of a disability or their status as immigrants from falling into precarious situations, and to facilitate their integration into society. The promotion of equality also involves combating violence against women. All forms of physical, sexual or psychological violence, however serious, must be combated and condemned. As we mark the 100th anniversary of International Women’s Day, I would like to convey my greetings to all women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whereas I recognise the individual’s right to decide on his/her own body, I underline that any decision to undergo abortion also means deciding to end the life of another human being. Furthermore, if this decision is made, it should always include the consent of both parents (except in cases of serious illness, rape). Calling for easy access to abortion is therefore misleading and gives society the message that abortion could be used as contraception and need not take any moral and ethical values into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s European society where people are better informed and have easier access to healthcare than ever before, we must support responsible behaviour, which includes taking responsibility for one’s actions. Calling for easy access to abortion is contrary to taking such responsibility. Abortion is too often used as an easy way out of a difficult situation. The EU should not support such behaviour, but should give subsidiarity to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The damage caused by the anti-social policy of most EU Member State governments will sooner or later become apparent in the health of many socially weaker groups of citizens, and particularly women. I was led to support the previously mentioned report by concerns for the healthy development of Europe’s current and future population, which is directly proportionate to the quality of health and full social equality of women. If we care about Europe’s future, in other words, the viability and development of the EU, we cannot try to solve its problems without securing equality for women. To underrate this issue is to ignore the rights of 50% of EU citizens. Ultimately, this may mean alienating many citizens from the EU, despite the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy includes a solution to these problems. The EU is made up of men and women. They embody its potential and its creative development. As long as poverty and social exclusion apply to almost one in six citizens, as statistical investigations in the EU show, it is up to us, as MEPs, not only to challenge the Commission and the Member States, but also to mount effective pressure for the implementation of the specific measures adopted in the fight against poverty and against anti-social cost-cutting measures, and to limit further decline in the social area, particularly with respect to women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Nedelcheva has chosen to follow the path of the proposal and not merely that of claims and of victimisation. The starting point for targeted action is an analysis of economic data from the female labour market, all of it negative. The evidence from previous surveys shows that the greater socio-economic weakness of women has an impact on the overall economy and produces quantifiable losses for the system. From this there follows a course of action to put in place which, although designed to reduce disparities, is directed at the general public because it contains systemic measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with the part of the report about the promotion of sexual rights of women, particularly where it reaffirms the intention to make abortion ‘easy’ –especially in light of the House’s vote against the oral amendment from Mr Silvestris – which aimed to introduce a reference to the protection of the unborn child. This is a sensitive issue that cannot be proposed with slogans of doubtful interpretation.

Unemployment and recession risk widening the gap between men and women in the workplace. Therefore, the report from Mrs Nedelcheva focuses on the points where work can be done to prevent discrimination: ensuring financial and economic justice for all citizens, hence, with reference to remuneration, incomes and pensions; working for an increase in women’s quotas for better representation and to secure personal rights. However, I believe that in so doing, one must respect the principle of subsidiarity and some of the typical national characteristics which I believe should be defended and protected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, it is to be feared that the great, but slow and painful, victories that women have won in the EU could go significantly backward which, apart from obviously affecting them directly and unfairly, would also affect our societies, which are always healthier and have more robust prospects for development when they ensure gender equality. It is therefore important to continue to invest in equality policies, not least by implementing equality between men and women in terms of working conditions, of levels of income, of access to work, and their place in society in general. As regards equality policies, action needs to come from two different perspectives, which must be made and kept complementary: one in which, from the outside in, conditions are created for gender equality to exist and another, from inside out, in which conditions are created for the emancipation of women from what is making them inferior. That said, and despite agreeing with many of this report’s statements, I abstained from the final vote because I do not accept generalised free access to abortion, or the assumption that abortion is a method of contraception, which it clearly is not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Apart from the fact that this is an infringement of the Member States’ self-determination by the EU, I am also opposed to the very idea of quotas. As if women are not capable of being judged on their own merit, just like men.

Although 59% of graduates in the EU are women, this proportion is not reflected in political or economic life.

The representation rates for women are important because this helps encourage women to plan for a career in politics and to apply for a position with political, administrative or financial responsibilities. There is a 17% gender pay gap in the EU and there are not sufficient childcare facilities available for children under the age of 3. This means that young mothers are exposed more to temporary work contracts or the risk of unemployment.

That being said, we were unable to vote in favour of this report for several specific reasons. Firstly, we fundamentally oppose the introduction of targets and quotas for women in certain professions being set at EU level; we believe this is something that Member States should do. Secondly, we are reluctant to accept issues of conscience in political reports and believe that Member States should legislate on issues concerning abortion and contraception. Thirdly, issues regarding employment, such as pensions, retirement age and pay should be determined at national level, and although we are fully in favour of eradicating the gender pay gap, it is not for the EU to set out prescriptive targets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, European women are four times more likely than men to work part-time, to have fixed-term contracts, and are often part of the black economy, which is characterised by the absence of employment contracts.

They must look after the home, their children and husband, while working at the same time. Women are very often victims of discrimination in the workplace or of violence, major problems which are still widespread across the EU. The reality is really awful, especially in rural areas and for Roma women. In these circumstances, the Structural Funds must be used to set up programmes which will improve women’s chances of entering the labour market.

Although the economic and financial crisis has had a significant impact on the level of unemployment of both sexes, this crisis has affected women worst. During the recession, salaries fell dramatically in sectors dominated by women, or women lost their jobs altogether. Furthermore, due to lower salaries, women reaching old age receive lower pensions and consequently, often face poverty. Female poverty that has become particularly widespread during the recession, especially poverty among single mothers, has a direct impact on child poverty, because now, around 20 million children in Europe live in poverty. Unless specific measures are adopted to help reduce female poverty, it will be impossible to reduce child poverty. I would like to stress that we must take the gender dimension into account in both European and national legislation. The European Union Member States should develop special programmes for the inclusion of women and to aid their return to the labour market. Furthermore, maternity leave must be guaranteed for all women. Unfortunately, at present, both motherhood and work in the home, caring for children and elderly or disabled people, are completely denigrated. I hope that, in future, the Member States will take appropriate measures to overcome female poverty and value women’s contribution to the development of the family, society and the economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report highlights the causes and consequences of poverty amongst women and stresses the importance that achieving gender equality has for sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion. At the moment, 17% of women in the Union live in poverty, and this figure has increased dramatically in comparison with poverty among men in recent times. Therefore, in line with the report, poverty has become feminised. The Union and the Member States urgently need, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, to find ways of combating poverty in general, and that of women in particular. Efforts need to be made with a view to labour and social protection policies based on gender equality, and with a view to efforts to reconciling family life with work.

Almost 17% of European women are classed as living in poverty; considering the indicators relating to the labour market and social protection, the structural causes of poverty have a disproportionate effect on women. During the recession, salaries fell dramatically in sectors dominated by women or women lost their jobs altogether. Furthermore, due to lower salaries, women reaching old age receive lower pensions and consequently often face poverty. Female poverty that has become particularly widespread during the recession, especially poverty among single mothers, has a direct impact on child poverty, because now, around 20 million children live in poverty in Europe. As the contribution made by women to the development of family, society and economy is regularly underestimated and underpaid, it is crucial to adopt measures to reduce female poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such situations occur even in our democratic European Union, which upholds human rights. Women earn less than men doing the same jobs and, in addition, they are more likely to be molested. They are more likely to be the ones who look after children and, as a result, do not have their own separate source of income or money which they could use for their own development or for a treat in reward for a hard day. The people who are bringing up future generations and educating the young people who, in the future, will govern us, provide us with medical treatment, build our bridges and look after us in hospital are not fairly paid. First and foremost, legislation should be amended to ensure free access to crèches and nursery schools and opportunities for young mothers to better themselves, and to make it impossible to dismiss women immediately after giving birth or returning from maternity leave. Women in rural areas are in the worst situation. They live in areas where incomes are much lower than the average for the EU, or even for the country they live in. They have no access to cultural services and goods. Their work is hard, and they do not always have the opportunity to take a holiday, for example.

The pensions of a considerable proportion of European women aged over 65 are a pittance.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty among women is not just the result of the recent economic crisis, but is also the consequence of other factors resulting from discriminatory gender stereotypes, from the pay gap between men and women, and from barriers to proper reconciliation between family and work life, which is particularly serious in the case of single-parent families. These result in the ‘feminisation of poverty’, which urgently needs to be combated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The unprecedented economic crisis that has just hit the European Union has only served to make this sad situation worse. Time has come, therefore, to underline the importance of this problem and to adopt a package of measures to combat this scourge. The European Union and its Member States must put a stop to the poverty and social exclusion of women in Europe, in particular, by ensuring they have access to quality education and jobs, by helping them find a balance between their family life and work life, and by helping to combat the violence to which they, sadly, all too often, fall victim.

The economic and financial crisis has affected – and may further affect – these data, which are already striking. The fight against poverty is not always considered part of gender politics and this weakens its importance.

However, we need a deeper and more specific understanding of this reality in the various Member States of the European Union so as to act in a better adapted and more effective way, with a view to the common goal of preventing and reducing poverty amongst women. It is worth stressing poverty amongst women in that we also have specific general indicators that point to its high impact on a community’s social fabric: because of women’s fundamental and permanent role in the family, it has been proven that the more that is invested in their education and social promotion, the more the community develops socio-economically.

But it particularly harms women in the labour market and in their personal lives, since they are more likely to be in insecure jobs, more likely to be made redundant and less likely to have social security. The austerity measures implemented across the EU have a particularly damaging impact on women, who dominate the public sector both as employees and as beneficiaries of services. Preventing and reducing women’s poverty is an important component of the fundamental principle of social solidarity to which the EU is committed by Article 3 of the Treaty on EU. This implies equality between women and men, social justice and protection and combating social exclusion and discrimination. The Commission and the Member States should take the necessary measures to eliminate gender inequalities in employment as part of the EU 2020 strategy. I strongly encourage establishing as an objective the reduction of the gender pay gap by 1% each year in order to achieve a target of a 10% reduction by 2020. I would also stress the need for positive action to increase women’s representation in political, economic and corporate decision-making bodies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All indicators show that, at global level, women are poorer than men on average. In times of economic recession, people who are at risk of falling into poverty become even more vulnerable, and the majority of these are women. The report acknowledges that the austerity measures being applied throughout the EU will have particularly devastating effects on women, particularly those already facing numerous disadvantages. The pensions of a considerable proportion of European women aged over 65 are a pittance. Poverty among women is not just the result of the recent economic crisis, but is also the consequence of other factors resulting from discriminatory gender stereotypes, from the pay gap between men and women, and from barriers to proper reconciliation between family and work life, which is particularly serious in the case of single-parent families. These result in the ‘feminisation of poverty’, which urgently needs to be combated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the past 10 years, the number of women living in poverty has increased disproportionately in relation to men. Over 84 million EU citizens live in poverty, and women account for over half of this figure. This is a result both of the economic crisis and of the differences which exist between women’s and men’s pay, difficulties in reconciling family life with a career, a longer average lifespan and various types of gender-based discrimination, the victims of which are mainly women. I would call for decisive measures to be taken at the level of both the EU and all the Member States to combat pay-related discrimination and to ensure access to attractive job offers. I would stress the need to strengthen legal instruments aimed at eliminating pay differences between women and men. Marked discrepancies continue to exist in this regard, with men earning 20% to 25% more than women on average, and this results in high levels of poverty among single women, retired women and widows. It is essential that EU programmes be adopted within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy in the field of lifelong learning and professional training for women, with the aim of increasing employment levels among women. These programmes should concentrate, to a large extent, on occupations which will be important in the future and eliminate the stereotypes which exist in terms of areas of education dominated by women or men, as well as eliminating traditional models in teaching programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The high percentage of women employed in low paying or part-time jobs means that more women than men live on the verge of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Research should be stepped up at European level into this phenomenon, since research will make it possible to establish precise and effective methods for combating poverty and social exclusion among women.

Equal pay for equal work must be properly implemented in Member States in order to get a fair deal for women. It is vital we look at the effect the gender pay gap has on pensions for women; in many cases, a woman’s right to a pension results from her marital status. Equal pensions for women should be guaranteed, and it is for this reason I supported the proposal to ensure the same rights for women in the case of pensions and social security. Around 17% of all women in the EU are living below the poverty line, and it is essential that social and labour market policies are adapted to guarantee a minimum income and social justice for women. I agree with calls for the EU to provide more funding through the ESF in order to help combat poverty and social exclusion – it is vital that women are fully integrated into the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s Annual Report for 2010 on equality for women and men shows that poverty is one of the areas where gender-specific differences are obvious. The economic, financial and social crisis has led to the ‘feminisation of poverty’. The successive budgetary cuts and the restructuring of the state sector have particularly threatened jobs in which women are primarily employed. At the same time, the measures supported by governments to combat the crisis are primarily focused on areas of the economy dominated by men. The analysis of the phenomenon of the ‘feminisation of poverty’ called for by the rapporteur is therefore urgently needed, so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The President of the legislative assembly actually commented that there are too few women in national parliaments, even if the situation is changing when it comes to the European Parliament. I can confirm that this is also the case in Romania, which sent a higher proportion of women to the European legislative, compared to the representation they have in their national parliament. However, apart from dealing with this situation, which can be treated only as the tip of the iceberg, it is necessary to eliminate the gender pay gap, have more women appointed to decision-making posts, and increase the level of employment among women, as they are affected more by unemployment, using dynamic and realistic policies. Analyses show that we are not just talking about the need for equal treatment for men and women, but that these policies would have a major impact on economies, with a 30% rise in GDP. The average gender pay gap is still 18% in the EU.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, honourable Members, we are currently experiencing one of those incredible moments when the historical process seems to speed up. On our doorstep, on the other side of the Mediterranean, a wind of freedom has started to blow.</p>
<p class="contents">This is such an important and urgent matter that I should first of all like to tell you that the College has just approved the Commission’s contribution to assist the countries south of the Mediterranean in their transition process and to breathe new life into our relations with our Mediterranean neighbours. I shall present this contribution with Baroness Ashton during the Extraordinary European Council next Friday.</p>
<p class="contents">The men and women on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, especially the young people, are currently demonstrating their rejection of authoritarian regimes and their aspiration to political freedom and social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we are aware of the extreme complexity of the situation and the challenges and difficulties that it presents, the European Union cannot afford any ambiguity. We must stand shoulder to shoulder with those who are demanding political freedom and respect for human dignity. We cannot countenance any ambiguity on the part of the European Union. A regime which fires on its own people has no place within the concert of nations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are offering these peoples a ‘partnership for democracy and shared prosperity’ founded on three pillars: democratic transformation, involvement with civil society and mutually supportive development.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the challenges that await us. Saying no to dictatorship does not automatically guarantee the rule of law and democracy. The road to democratic transition is never an easy one. It can sometimes be winding and it is always demanding. However, Europe must stand shoulder to shoulder with those who aspire to political freedom and social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, I would now like to turn to the other meeting to be held on Friday 11 March, the informal summit of Member States in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis has shown just how interdependent our economies are. It has shown up certain structural weaknesses. That is one reason why we must strengthen our economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has long fought for more coordinated national economic policies and stronger governance in Europe. Our proposal is to further develop the economic pillar of our Economic and Monetary Union. We highlighted this point in our report on the 10 years of the euro, EMU@10. However, the truth of the matter is that some governments were extremely reluctant to espouse a development of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, everyone admits that there is a need for genuine European economic governance and, moreover, the markets are continually reminding us how essential this is. This is the reason why the Member States, in the conclusions of the work of the task force, presided over by the President of the European Council, arrived at a very broad consensus on the proposals presented by the Commission on strengthening economic governance – proposals that are currently under discussion here in Parliament and in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we came to an agreement on the implementation of the European semester, which will help to extend economic governance, by including in the early stages not only budgetary policies but also economic policies and structural reforms for each of the Member States. It was within this context of strengthened economic governance that recently, the idea of a ‘competitiveness pact’ emerged, inviting Member States in the euro area to make additional efforts, largely on the basis of their national competences, to become even more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that whilst the economies within the European Union are indeed extremely interdependent, those of the euro area are particularly so.</p>
<p class="contents">Gaps in competitiveness are a genuine problem for those countries which share the same currency. Their competitiveness and the convergence of their economies are essential in ensuring the viability of a strong and stable euro area, which will be to the benefit of the entire European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we must recognise that this idea has raised a number of concerns: fear of a two-speed Europe (the euro area and the others), the danger of losing sight of certain aspects of the economic recovery that are just as important as competitiveness, and also possibly the calling into question of the Community approach. These are all legitimate questions and we must respond to them unequivocally. This is a question of mutual confidence and credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, I was also a little surprised to have to point out, at the last European Council on 4 February, that any specific initiative for competitiveness and for the euro area had, quite obviously, to be in accordance with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions, the European Council decided that ‘in taking their inspiration from the new framework for economic governance, the Heads of State or Government will take additional measures with the aim of enhancing the quality of the coordination of economic policies within the euro area in order to improve competitiveness, and this would lead to a greater degree of convergence without harming the single market’.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I was very happy to see that, in the end, these conclusions contained explicit reference to the need for these additional advances to be made ‘in accordance with the Treaty’. You might think that this goes without saying, but it is better that it is said.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council therefore gave the President of the European Council a mandate to lead, in close collaboration with the President of the European Commission, consultations with the Member States of the euro area in order to determine the concrete means needed to press ahead with this.</p>
<p class="contents">These consultations clearly showed that, in general, Member States are in favour of adopting the Community approach. </p>
<p class="contents">Now I would like to be very clear on the principles that, in the Commission’s view, must necessarily be abided by for such a competitiveness pact, which it might be better to call a ‘convergence and competitiveness pact’, since it involves measures aimed at reducing differences within the euro area, and indeed within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The first principle is that this pact must be carried out under the conditions laid down in the Treaty and within the existing system of economic governance. We can, in this way, be sure of a truly Community approach. Because history, and notably the experiences with the Stability and Growth Pact, has shown that it is only through the Community method that we can produce results which are democratically legitimised at European level, and which are binding and can be controlled.</p>
<p class="contents">The pact must, of course, also respect the role of the Commission. This is essential in order to guarantee objectivity and independence in monitoring the efforts of Member States, the integrity of the single market and of all the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, and the clearance between the initiatives taken in the euro area and those pursued in the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also insist on the role of the European Parliament in monitoring the convergence and competitiveness pact because the Commission, of course, will fully inform the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The pact must also remain open to other Member States which might wish to take part in it and that are not members of the euro area. I think it is important to avoid any kind of stratification in our Union; that stratification will go against the very principles of solidarity that are at the core of our common project.</p>
<p class="contents">To justify such a pact – which involves national measures – it must contribute added value to what has already been laid down in the context of economic governance proposals put forward. I would remind you that under Article 121 of the Treaty, Member States must coordinate their national economic policies. Such a pact must also take care not to affect adversely the integrity of the single market and should even help to enhance it. In addition, it must respect social dialogue and link measures on competitiveness to our central goals, which are growth and jobs, exactly as we have stated in the Europe 2020 agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Competitiveness is indeed an essential element for our economies. It is a necessary condition for entrenching job-creating growth. It is therefore important to ensure that this pact delivers real added value and does not take us away from the essential goals of growth and employment. My bottom line is growth and employment. That is why I emphasise growth, the sort of inclusive sustainable growth which lies at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I insist so much on the social dimension, since the efforts required must be shared fairly. On this point, the Commission continues to work on a proposal for the taxation of financial activities. Similarly, if budgetary consolidation and structural reforms are essential for competitiveness, investment in sectors of importance for the future like research and innovation is just as necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also bear in mind that this pact is but one part of our overall response to ensure the stability of the euro area. Progress must be made in all the other areas of our response, that is to say, in enhancing the effective financing capacity of the existing European Financial Stability Fund and broadening its scope, in preparing the establishment of a permanent mechanism as from 2013 and in implementing over the coming months tighter stress tests for banks. All of this will contribute to greater transparency, greater confidence and greater credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The convergence and competitiveness pact could thus make a significant contribution if we interpret it as one measure among others within the framework of all the efforts which have been undertaken to ensure the stability of the euro area and which we hope will start to take effect as of March.</p>
<p class="contents">It could constitute a major additional effort towards fair and sustainable growth in Europe if it is coherent with the Community system of governance. If that is the case, if this measure is effectively carried out following a Community approach, as is the wish of the Commission and this Parliament, then I believe that the convergence and competitiveness pact will deliver added value and could help to strengthen the economic pillar of economic and monetary union. That is what this Parliament and the Commission want. The Commission will spare no effort to that end. I thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The lesson we learnt from the Second World War was that our nations should work together and stop tearing each other apart.</p>
<p class="contents">From the fall of the Berlin Wall, we learnt lessons about authoritarian and communist regimes and we were able to reunite our continent around the values of freedom, democracy and the social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">From the terrorist attack of 11 September, we learnt that we had to strike a new balance between security and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">From this financial crisis, the lesson we must learn is for our Member States to stop treating as a taboo subject any cooperation in the budgetary, fiscal and social fields. I know exactly how far we have come. The establishment, this year, of cooperation between the 27 on their budgetary priorities constitutes, in itself, a major shift in attitude. The regulations that we have provided ourselves with to make the financial markets more ethical are, also, exemplary, but they do not suffice.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would like to call for an agreement to be reached between Parliament and the Council, before the summer, on strengthened economic governance. My group would also like to call for efforts to be pursued on the coordination of social and fiscal matters. That is the thrust of the competitiveness pact, the initial version of which has already been revised to be in greater accordance with Community values. However, we must go even further still and ensure that both Parliament and the Commission exercise all the prerogatives that they enjoy in this respect, and in this, we are counting on the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) welcomes and supports these proposals as did the national leaders of the party in Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, how can we explain to our fellow citizens that, at the same time as we are in a delicate financial situation in mid-July each year, most of our Member States should continue to spend as if nothing were amiss? How can it be that the over-indebtedness of our States is more acceptable, more tolerable and more bearable than that of households or businesses? I have witnessed this at company level. The crisis has led to job losses and family trauma; the least we can do is to learn lessons from this and tell things as they are.</p>
<p class="contents">The first lesson is that we should no longer treat lightly the obligations placed on States – whatever their size – to respect budget limits.</p>
<p class="contents">The second lesson is this: European solidarity can only operate if, and only if, our social and fiscal regulations are at least comparable. They do not necessarily need to be identical – just comparable. At the moment, this is far from being the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The third lesson is that Europe must provide itself with a European stability mechanism to protect our social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth and final lesson is that even in a storm, Europe is standing firm and European integration is becoming stronger.</p>
<p class="contents">Our American and Japanese partners have debt ratios far in excess of ours, without, it must be said, being excessively worried by it. However, that will probably not always be the case. For our part, now is the time to consolidate our economy and our competitiveness. Now is the time to work on creating jobs for the future. Now is the time to tell things as they are. Let us not miss this opportunity! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the fact that the paper was non-existent, a press conference was held on the subject during the European Council summit. We now know for sure that the paper did exist and made for some interesting reading. In the meantime, however, the content of the paper has somehow got lost. The key elements of this paper will never see the light of day. Nonetheless, in the end, we shall have a result, namely, an expansion of the safety net. So, a non-existent paper with elusive content, presented at an artificial press conference, has led to an expansion of the safety net. This is great. However, the situation is Kafkaesque to put it mildly. This is no way to rescue the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell the President of the Commission that I found his statement to be good. It was good because you have revealed the lack of social balance in these proposals. I am sometimes a little surprised: Germany with its Chancellor, like President Sarkozy, France’s prince of the opinion polls, is demanding measures that Germany itself has never taken in this form. The Greek budget, and in fact all budgets, wherever they may be, are to be cut. Are you in agreement with this, Mr Rehn?</p>
<p class="contents">What did Germany do in its hour of deepest crisis? It came up with a so-called scrapping premium, in other words, it used the national budget to finance a scheme to stabilise the automobile industry. The subvention for reduced working hours, which helped keep unemployment in Germany under control, was an interventionist measure by the state. Why should other states be prevented from implementing similar measures to deal with their specific situation?</p>
<p class="contents">Rating agency Moody’s recently downgraded Greece to a ranking below Belarus and Egypt. One really does begin to wonder whether there are any signs of green shoots in the economy. I do not know. The country is ranked even lower than Vietnam. This particular drama is always played out three days in advance of a European Council summit. Something like this always happens three days before a European Council meeting. However, people listen to what Moody’s has to say. Do you know what Moody’s says? It says it is going to downgrade the country because it is no longer able to invest as a result of the cuts and therefore cannot generate economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">So what we are talking about here is a ‘hair cut’. If you look at me, you will realise that I am well qualified to tell you that a hair cut will not solve every problem. Quite the opposite in fact, because what actually happens as a result of the hair cut? The aim seems to be to improve a country’s credit rating by telling those who are to provide the credit that they will lose all write-downs. Where will this eventually end? In the safety net, of course. That is why it makes sense to increase the safety net and to do everything that we can to stabilise the euro. That is why the pact itself makes perfect sense. However, an imbalance exists there. Commissioner, if your ideas are incorporated in this pact, and the economic and social balance is restored as you suggest, then the pact will be on the right path again. That is why I welcome the excellent proposal you have brought forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to spend any more time talking about the issue of the institutions. In institutional terms, the entire concept was wrong from the start. If it is now restructured in such a way that all operational decisions will be made by the appropriate responsible authority, in other words, the Commission, ensuring democratic legitimacy through the involvement of the European Parliament, then all is well and good. So, although we got off to a bad start and there have been a few alarms and excursions along the way, the safety net is to be extended, which is wonderful. The German Free Democratic Party has also come onboard, which is welcome news. Madam President, I am sure that your party in Germany will also support this pact, so that we have also gained ground here. If we can now succeed in giving the pact an appropriate name, namely the ‘Pact for the Euro’, then we may perhaps finally have achieved something worthwhile. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, this is not the case for Mr Farage, but for everyone else, it does represent a step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Madam President, I do not think that the term that has been used is the right one. What does the word ‘pact’ mean? A pact is an agreement between States. An agreement between States is not what we need. What we need is a Community act, an initiative at the level of the European Union, and not a pact between Member States, which is, by its very nature, an intergovernmental pact. Therefore, this is not the right term to use as it is misleading.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the approach. There is no need for anything at intergovernmental level. Intergovernmentalism has never worked within the European Union. The Lisbon strategy was intergovernmental and it failed. When Germany and France failed to respect the rules governing the stability pact in 2003-4, this proved that the intergovernmental approach was not the right one. We must use the Community approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I believe, Mr Barroso, that what is on the table is not enough or it focuses rather on very specific measures. Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy’s competitiveness pact comprises six specific measures. For example, in the case of pensions, it focuses on pension age. However, the pensions system is much more complex than that. It is not only a question of pension age, there is also the number of years of pension contributions, pre-pension schemes, and the existence or not of a second pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what we need are not six specific measures in an intergovernmental pact, which will never come into being or work. What we need is broad economic governance (pension schemes, labour market, wage policy, fiscal policy) within the European Union which is decided upon by the Commission and which, through a convergence code – that is the term you used – is provided to Member States so that they can apply the rules from the convergence code. That is what we must do as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">My request is a very simple one. I saw the paper of 25 February that you prepared with the President of the Council. I think that it is now for the Commission to prepare its own initiative. This must be done now. There is still time in the weeks to come for you to prepare these Community acts for economic governance and convergence and to table them at the Council and the European Parliament. It will then be up to us to decide and to support you in this respect. However, what I think we are doing at the moment is being reactive. In this document of the 25th – I have it here – I can read that</p>
<p class="contents">‘monitoring by the Heads of State and Heads of Government’, ‘the concrete commitments undertaken by the Heads of State and Heads of Government’. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>That is not how it is going to work. The States and the Prime Ministers are not going to regulate themselves! It has never worked in the past, and it will not work in the future!</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and this is my last point, I also think that it is time, Mr Barroso, to present, at the earliest possible opportunity, an initiative on a crisis mechanism for banks, not at national level, as stated, but at European level. You have the right to do so as you are, in effect, the guarantor of competition rules within the European Union and you are in a position to suggest such an initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was quite bizarre to hear that the paper does not exist, even though this paper was distributed in the corridors of Council Headquarters in Brussels. As I have already stated in Brussels, the way in which the facts have been disputed in the Council’s buildings bears all the hallmarks of a socialist or communist regime in its dying days.</p>
<p class="contents">From my point of view, the fact is that for months now, we Europeans have been experiencing more than a currency crisis, but also a crisis in the capabilities of our national governments to accept shared responsibility for the problem and to follow a joint strategy that could lead us out of these difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">If we now make the crisis mechanism permanent, however we may have achieved it, then we will have taken one step forward. However, if one looks at Greece, then I would say that we may be deluding ourselves if we believe we have the crisis under control. It is equally clear in Greece that the one-sided nature of the measures, exclusive concentration on austerity measures and cuts, is not working. The country must also be in a position to make investments. When a country like Greece cuts expenditure so radically, then it needs to know where its income is to come from.</p>
<p class="contents">I am annoyed by the fact that, in advance of this week’s meeting of the European Council and in statements relating to the Council meeting in 14 days’ time, we are hearing from Germany that it will not be prepared to discuss conditions for Greece or for necessary changes. The same old mistakes are being made again: this unilateralism and insistence on a single method. If we are to follow the model described by Mr Verhofstadt, as well as decisions in relation to specific consolidation measures, economic union also requires a readiness for genuine solidarity. Hence, Greece should expect more from us than we have given so far.</p>
<p class="contents">I completely agree with Mr Schulz and the previous speakers and I would like to state clearly on behalf of all those in my group who have been working on this issue for many months: the Community method is something special. We need genuine, understandable decision-making processes in Brussels, so that citizens from Greece to Denmark, in Germany and in Spain, trust in us. If we really were to establish this ‘closed shop’ proposed in the competitiveness pact as contrived by a small number of Heads of Government, we will lose the debate about trust in the European Union. This is really what the crisis is increasingly about. I can only hope that we will be delivered from this stupidity and that this Council meeting will show more sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Since you mentioned sustainable growth, Mr Barroso, let me add one more thing. I cannot understand why a Commissioner for Energy in Brussels would say that ambitious climate protection targets would mean deindustrialisation in Europe. The German Minister for the Environment was in Brussels 14 days ago and presented a study that predicted six million jobs for the European Union if we set a 30% climate target. This would mean sustainable growth. Mr Barroso, you must stop Mr Oettinger. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UK restored market confidence by reforms to control spending and reduce national debt. These are now core suggestions under the competitiveness pact.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s procedures do not allow it to make rapid decisions, but there are suggestions tabled by MEPs that perhaps the European Council could find helpful. On the Irish interest rate, those of us who have lent another country money deserve an interest rate which reflects the risk, but we also want our money back. I have suggested a pre-payment incentive, a bonus to reward early repayment. Under the economic governance package, Member States will have to be more transparent with their own budgets. I would suggest the same thing should happen for taxpayers contributing to the EU’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that despite this crisis, our national governments will be able to listen to suggestions from this House and work together in a constructive manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will certainly be necessary. There is no need to repeat much of what my fellow Members have said as I am in complete agreement with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely sceptical of the pact that has been presented by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy. Why is this? Because their reasons for presenting it are not very clear. The fact that it has no validity is quite a different issue. They are both clever strategists. I cannot accept their claim that things simply happened this way. I believe that they mean things precisely as stated there. This is the point I would like to return to once again. I believe that this is a very serious issue. Although they believe that this clause on the indexation of wages and salaries is the right answer, I am not so sure. In black and white terms, increasing the pensionable age can also be described as a reduction in pensions. It will be extremely hard to reduce debt. After all, even countries like Germany find this very difficult. I can imagine that Ireland or Greece will find themselves in huge difficulty here.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a little sceptical about what the proposed solution is supposed to achieve. I expect transparency in this matter. You will receive support from Parliament if you play your part in promoting greater transparency and ensuring that games like this are not played out behind Parliament’s back. If these people want to make social security cuts, they need say so clearly, rather than taking countless detours to reach an objective that you, Mr Barroso, do not share and that we certainly do not share.</p>
<p class="contents">We are prepared to discuss the concept of coordinated European economic governance with you provided that this economic governance is worthy of the name, in other words, that it is democratic in structure and that it will help establish a sustainable, socially responsible European community. We are also willing to discuss amendments to the Treaty, for example, in relation to a social progress clause. However, we expect more detailed and earlier information and consultation. This is the only way that Parliament can monitor this process. It cannot be done without information! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">He talked about the events in Egypt and elsewhere, saying that it is wonderful that people are rising up seeking democracy. I would remind him that democracy is a method whereby you vote for people who govern you and then, if you do not like what they do, you can get rid of them, turf them out and put somebody else in. It was ironic because his next sentence was ‘and that is why in Europe, facing the euro crisis, we must reinforce the Community method’.</p>
<p class="contents">For the public watching in on this – which increasingly they do – the Community method means that laws are proposed in secret by unelected bureaucrats – people like you, Mr Barroso. I know the European Parliament voted for you, but you were the only candidate that was offered to us. That is not democracy!</p>
<p class="contents">So Mr Barroso is saying, on the one hand, that democracy is good, but on the other hand, that we cannot have it in Europe. That was reinforced by Mr Verhofstadt, who comes from Belgium and who thinks all nation states should be abolished – well, perhaps his own will be very shortly. He is saying that we want an economic union. Nobody has voted for that. Nobody has been asked whether they want it. He may vote for it but the peoples of Europe have not voted for it.</p>
<p class="contents">What should be discussed at the summit on Friday is Portugal. After the bailouts in Greece and Ireland, it is pretty obvious that the markets are sending a message – ‘Come in number 3, your time is up’. Portuguese bond yields hit 7.6% on Monday. Mr Barroso knows that himself. It was when yields reached 7% that Ireland had to be bailed out. In April, we also have a massive rollover of Portuguese debt – another EUR 20 billion that has to rolled over. Let us remind ourselves that, in the last six months, 80% of Portugal’s debt has been purchased by the European Central Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot go on as a European Union buying our own debt. If we do, the next debt crisis will not be in a country, but will be a debt crisis of the European Central Bank itself.</p>

That is only to be applauded, of course. I would like to join in the tributes paid to President Barroso for the way in which he has picked up the gauntlet and come here to give us an explanation about the competitiveness pact, something which has even managed to keep Mr Martin Schulz sweet today. That should not go unmentioned. You have picked up that gauntlet, together with President Van Rompuy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the pact seems to be having some difficulties getting off the ground, because Parliament, in particular, is having to deal with a sizeable legislative package. This is the first time Parliament has found itself in the role of colegislator when it comes to economic governance. That is why it is so important to link things together, because there is some overlap. In this House, ladies and gentlemen, we have tabled 2 000 amendments and, if we look at this, we will find almost all the matters covered by the competitiveness pact reflected in those amendments. This Parliament also wants to see more ambition and that is the very thing that worries me. How are we going to link the competitiveness pact with the EU 2020 strategy? Moreover, President Barroso, are you going to use our right of initiative actively, to establish a link between the competitiveness pact and the legislative package? If you fail to do that, then this House will pick up that gauntlet itself, in its role as colegislator. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crisis that we are living through is not a crisis in the euro area: it is, as someone was saying, a crisis of the euro area. This is because a single currency can only function when there is reliable and persistent work on convergence between the various areas comprising it, in terms of growth rates, of yields and of employment; when there is real convergence. Until now, we have been working on indicators of nominal convergence, which is in no way the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, Europe urgently needs to finish what it started. To finish what it started – the single currency in particular – it in fact needs to create a robust Stability Fund: a fund that enables countries in difficulty to undertake this convergence with interest rates that are acceptable and not prohibitive, and does not force them to cut the strategic investment enabling this convergence, so that they can use their growth to pay back what they borrow in times of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we need a Commission that is active; a Commission that participates in building this Stability Fund, but also in the Eurobonds, and that listens to the message that Parliament has given it again today via the new source of own resources, which will have to be an effective reinforcement of a budget that is clearly insufficient. We have just adopted the Podimata report, which clearly advocates a financial transaction tax. In order to survive, Europe has to change course now. It needs a strong Parliament, but it also needs a Commission capable of acting rather than simply reacting: of taking the initiatives that we are awaiting anxiously, so that this experiment is not lost and so that this experiment bears fruit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should just like to use three words.</p>
<p class="contents">The first word is ‘respect’: it was not this Parliament that made the European Parliament colegislator with regard to economic governance. It was governments that decided this in the Treaty of Lisbon. As rapporteurs, we do not think it is right to be informed of important discussions relating to the governance package through <span class="italic">Google</span> or the English-language press. The first thing that I would ask of you, Mr Barroso, and I also ask it of Mr Van Rompuy’s colleagues present in this House, is to respect us and to let this Parliament get on with its work.</p>
<p class="contents">The second word is ‘democracy’. Never, since the eighteenth century, have we seen a democratic system deny the separation of powers in the way that the European Council is doing now. In the separation of powers, there are those who decide and those who control. The Council, with your collusion, Mr Barroso, is currently taking upon itself the right to both decide and control, in other words, basically to do nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">The third word is ‘effectiveness’. If we continue to water down the content of our proposals, we will arrive at the lowest common denominator and we know what that is. That is the Lisbon strategy! That is the 10 years that have led us nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">We will get on with our work. This Parliament demands to be respected and will defend democracy and effectiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the only way in which our fellow citizens, of whom we are the elected representatives, can understand what is happening and explain it to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise one very specific point. We are buffeted, on a daily basis, by the financial markets, these financial markets, which stand for everything and for nothing, are most often inhabited by young people who have moved from <span class="italic">Game Boy</span> to computer without thinking too much about it, and yet who strike fear into the hearts of our countries. The way to bring the markets under control is not to eliminate them. I do not belong to a group that seeks to abolish the markets. However, what do the markets seek? They seek to avoid risk and the rule of the game in the markets is to pass risk on to someone else. This means that an operator will never feel happy as long as there is risk.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that if we are to have an impact on these financial markets, Europe must be able to draw some very clear lines, not change direction every other day, and not bubble with hosts of ideas which are never, subsequently, put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to bring this financial aspect under control, and this is vital for the economic stability of our countries, we need to be able – and it is your role, Mr Barroso, to provide this impetus – to set clear goals, clear measures and to show a clear determination in regard to good economic coordination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we must convince the people of Europe that it is necessary, and the way we will do that is by ensuring that it is legitimate. We ensure it is legitimate by refusing to accept any proposals which are not based on the Treaties and not based on the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">It will not be acceptable if it is perceived to be in the interests of one, two, three, four or five economically powerful States. That is the reality. And so it is extremely important for the future of this Union that what is agreed at the informal Council on 11 March, and what is agreed at the end of March, can be supported by the public at large in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Government that has just been elected in Ireland has a strong mandate. I quote from the programme which it has just agreed: ‘We must step back from the edge of national insolvency (...) the EU-IMF Programme of Support has – to date – failed to restore confidence in the Irish economy (...) this reflects uncertainty over the affordability of the rescue package’.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude on this point if I might. It is an important point. The failure of the programme contributes to the wider eurozone financial instability.</p>

I commend the President of the ECB because he has paid heed to the discussions and reports in the Parliament and recognises our direction and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">The competitiveness pact and its evolution is a case in point. We already have a richer tapestry of ideas in our amendments to the economic governance package, so we will have little difficulty in moving into codecision to merge the outcomes of the positions that we take in Parliament and Council.</p>
<p class="contents">But we should not cherry-pick from the single market, nor continue to get it wrong. The single market is not about a fortress with a level playing field inside. It is about the external competitiveness that a large single market can generate, so it is intimately mixed with the recovery side of economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need a permanent financial stability mechanism capable of evolving over time, subject to governance and priorities. To the German people, convulsed with the ‘transfer union’ issue, I say ‘look at what accompanies the demands of your own government – recapitalisation of banks and purchase of sovereign debt in a secondary market’. Germany’s banks will take ten years to recognise their impaired assets from the crisis, and that includes sovereign debt. Germany’s banks will not meet new international rules for bank capital, so transfer to German banks should also be the issue on your lips. That is why you need the mechanism, like all the eurozone.</p>

<p class="contents">Emerging from the crisis requires, for example, that the workings of the permanent fund take into account the specific situations of Member States that are currently paying increasing interest rates on their public debt.

However, it is also for this reason that we need more European institutions. The European Parliament’s positions have been set out clearly and not via the media.

<p class="contents">The text proposes a change to the amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon, setting out a procedure which, while safeguarding the intergovernmental nature of the fund, justifies the inclusion of the rule in the Treaty. It also contains some clear proposals regarding the operation of the mechanism, designed to make it compatible with the duties that the Treaty assigns to the European institutions and with the need to have real economic governance, which simply would not work if it were intergovernmental.</p>
<p class="contents">To use a metaphor which you, Mr Barroso, used in the last debate, Parliament proposes putting this intergovernmental wagon on the rails in a Union train and giving the Commission its due role in running this train.</p>

If the European countries therefore decide that they want to create a common economic administration within the framework of EU regulations, it must be their free and voluntary decision, and not a directive from Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are talking about a pact, and therefore an agreement between sovereign states concerning further cooperation under the aegis of the EU, then everything is in order.

Alongside a uniform retirement age, the proposals for fiscal union require sales tax rates and wage policies to be harmonised. This is a further step towards economic governance and represents a major intrusion into the tax sovereignty of the Member States. It is made all the worse by the fact that the European Parliament will have nothing to say on these matters and that it was possible to fall back on Article 136 of the Treaty of Lisbon. Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy are likely to be able to force their proposals through, despite opposition from other countries in the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of reinforcing the rescue package, it is clear that speculators will continue to be able to exert pressure on the failing countries in the euro area without bearing any of the resulting risk. If there is a crisis, the rescue package will be made available. Profits will be privatised and losses will be borne by the public and circulated throughout the entire euro area. Mr Barroso, you said that growth must be distributed more fairly. I would like to ask you: What is the situation with financial liabilities? The rescue package will result in the burdens being distributed even more unjustly. In addition, it will cause social problems and wantonly put the prosperity of the net contributors at risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission. </span>– <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, there were some specific questions about Portugal, which I will answer. Whether or not Portugal should resort to the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) is a decision for the Portuguese authorities. It is a sovereign decision for Portugal precisely because it has to do with sovereign debt. What I can tell you, obviously, is that recourse to the EFSF and to International Monetary Fund aid was seen to be a last resort: <span class="italic">ultima ratio</span>. It is obvious that if a country can avoid recourse to this mechanism, it should do so, as recourse to these rescue funds has costs, and not only in terms of reputation. Therefore, if a country is able, it should be avoided. However, I would repeat that it is a decision for the national authorities whether or not to resort to this rescue fund, or at least to request its activation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as regards what I would like to see in the EFSF, it is not a question of liking, it is a question of policy: we in the Commission are actively working with the Member States, specifically those in the euro area, to reinforce the EFSF’s capacity for lending in order to expand the scope of its activities, including greater flexibility. Some of these issues are extremely sensitive from the point of view of the markets, so it does not seem prudent to me to be announcing intentions that have not become definite, but it is a work in progress in terms of the euro area. Furthermore, as you know, the Commission has clearly set out its proposal for reinforcing the EFSF and expanding its activities, specifically in its annual growth survey.</p>
<p class="contents">As to whether this policy should or can be changed, I am telling you now that it cannot be changed with regard to the most vulnerable countries. It would be absolutely irresponsible for countries with such a level of public or private debt to water down their efforts at budgetary consolidation and structural reforms at the moment. When a country has such a high level of debt, the markets’ confidence has to recover, because if not, its economic situation becomes untenable. Therefore, if we want to help the countries that are currently most vulnerable, we must not offer them mirages or something unrealistic: on the contrary, we must support any sensible efforts that they might make toward budgetary consolidation and structural reforms. That is the only way to have the markets’ trust. Naturally, this is not just the effort of the country in isolation, which needs a joint effort from the euro area. That is what is being developed with, obviously, different levels of contribution from the various parties involved.</p>
<p class="contents">What I can tell you is that the Commission has been doing everything in its power to suggest greater ambition. However, as the honourable Members know, the Commission makes suggestions, but in the end, the decision belongs to the Member States, specifically those of the euro area, particularly as regards matters that are strictly national competences, such as those not provided for in the Treaty, such as the EFSF. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>In any case, I would like to say to the entire Parliament that many of the criticisms that I have heard here today – even though most supported the Commission’s general approach – have been addressed, if I have understood correctly, to specific governments or specific Member States. Consequently, it is not up to me to speak on their behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have to say is that the Commission has presented a package of proposals for economic governance. We have pushed to the limit our governments’ ambitions. Even in the case of the governance package that my colleague, Mr Rehn, and I presented, the Member States were not willing to accept the initial level of ambition. That is the truth of the matter, for we submitted legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Now what has emerged is a new idea, namely, the competitiveness pact which we are trying – and here I wish to be very transparent and show my respect for Parliament – to fit as well as we can within the Community approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I have reported to you, in complete transparency, the Commission’s efforts to make this idea regarding the impact of competitiveness useful and create added value, either in respect of growth and employment – which, as I have already said, remain a priority for the Commission – or even to strengthen the system of governance. Of course, I do not need the Commission to be reminded of its role as guarantor of the Treaty. We have unfailingly demonstrated this, be it in relation to issues of the internal market, competition or non-discrimination. I can guarantee to you once again that the Commission would not hesitate to resort to all the means at its disposal if we were to believe that any principles or rules of the Treaty were being compromised by decisions taken either by the European Council, or by any other institution.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the work we do is long-term in nature and, of course, it is serious work that we carry out with a sense of responsibility. Obviously, this is an extremely delicate time for us, as you know, a time when the first thing that governments look at in the morning is the spread in their public debts.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what we are saying does matter. The hopes that we are creating do matter. The Commission therefore owes it to itself to be ambitious and, at the same time, to be responsible in making its proposals, while knowing that they have, at least, a chance of coming to fruition, that it is not merely the case of a publicity stunt followed by a feeling of disappointment. That is what I want to avoid and that is what the Commission must avoid. We must avoid disappointment, or purely division, whether within the euro area, or even throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I can assure you that the Commission will keep its ambitions high. The Commission is currently telling all governments that Parliament must be involved in this competitiveness pact. The Commission is currently telling governments that it must retain a central role in this competitiveness pact, not out of institutional loyalty, not out of institutional egotism, but because I believe, needless to say, that the Commission, along with the Community approach, are a guarantee if we want to avoid divisions between the euro area and the rest of Europe. They are the guarantee if we want to avoid attacks on the integrity of the single market, or if we want to avoid calling into question other mechanisms such as the Stability and Growth Pact. They are the guarantee, indeed, that we remain European within the framework of the European Union with European solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I was extremely frank and extremely open. The Commission carries out its work in utter transparency, constructively of course, trying to save an idea that, if it is well presented and carried out within a Community approach, could contribute added value to our efforts at governance, unlike what some of you have said. Indeed, the efforts that our governments have intensified, efforts to bring about economic political coordination, have always been part of the Commission’s general approach and that of most members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This therefore gives us an opportunity. If Heads of State or Government are now willing to become involved in the coordination of economic policies, and even in certain domains that were hitherto considered to be of national competence alone, I think that this should be welcomed insofar as it contributes added value to growth and employment, and insofar as it respects systems of Community governance. That is what is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, from this point of view, the debate has been very useful. Furthermore, I believe that the message from this Parliament has reached the European Council. President Buzek passed it on the last time he was at the European Council. I think that on essential matters, both the Commission and Parliament will be firm in the defence of the Community approach, convinced that this is the only way for Europe to achieve the objectives we have set for ourselves in the euro area, for stability and also for growth and employment throughout the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this drama, as usual, there is no shortage of main characters, secondary characters and mere extras. The so-called ‘competitiveness pact’, which was drawn up by Germany and France as a despicable imposition on all the other countries of the euro area, and which was initially denied by its creators, is now being presented and advocated in the European Parliament by President Barroso of the European Commission. This after President Barroso had weeks previously criticised Chancellor Merkel for failing to acknowledge the role of the Commission. It is now clear what, in the end, the role of the Commission and its President is. The aforementioned pact, which President Barroso is now telling us not to separate from the goal of employment and growth, is a veritable revanchist crusade against labour and social rights through attacks on wages, through an increased retirement age, through attempts to destroy collective bargaining and through the levelling down of social rights. It is also an attempt to impose a veritable sentence of economic dependence in the colonial style on countries like Portugal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title26"></a><a name="creitem26"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Enikő Győri, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(HU)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to say that it is a great pleasure for me that you have shown such an interest in the matter of enlargement. Even though both the Member States and the candidate countries are facing noticeable challenges, I believe that the enlargement process must go on continuously and consistently on the basis of the performance delivered. In order to achieve this, both parties must remain committed. Knowing the activities of the European Parliament, it is clear that this is the forum where all participants are aware of the significance of our relations with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">These are long-standing relations, which are made even closer by the country’s candidate status. At the same time, Turkey is also an important regional actor, and plays a crucial role in a number of significant areas, such as energy security and regional security, as well as the promotion of dialogue between civilisations. Meanwhile, the dramatic international events taking place in our immediate neighbourhood highlight even further the extent of Turkey’s significance in the aforementioned areas. Accession negotiations with the country are proceeding in line with the relevant conclusions of the European Council and the Council, as well as the negotiation framework. Despite the negotiations, which are at an advanced stage and are also becoming increasingly complex, the Hungarian Presidency is committed to making progress with regard to all chapters where progress is possible. The work is proceeding even now, and its main focus is currently on chapter eight, that is, competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that our Turkish partners will continue with their efforts and that we will soon be able to see results. In its conclusions adopted in December last year, the Council welcomed Turkey’s continuous commitment to the negotiation process, as well as its political reform programme. The constitutional reform package adopted by Turkey in 2010 represents another important step in the right direction, as this package covers several priorities of the accession partnership in the fields of justice, fundamental rights and public administration. The most important task at the moment is to ensure that the reforms are implemented in accordance with European norms and through consultations that involve the widest possible scope of participants, that is, all political parties and civil society organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that continuing the work on the political criteria remains extremely important. Serious efforts will be required in many areas, as has been underlined in the Council conclusions of 14 December 2010, the draft resolution of the European Parliament and the Commission’s 2010 progress report.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me highlight some of these areas. Turkey must further improve the respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly the freedom of expression and the freedom of religion, in both legislation and practice. Additional efforts will also have to be made in order to ensure full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, in respect of property rights, trade union rights, the rights of persons belonging to minorities, the rights of women and children, the fight against discrimination, gender equality and the fight against torture and inhuman treatment, among other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the freedom of expression, the areas giving cause for concern include restriction of the freedom of the press, insufficient protection of journalists’ rights, as well as the frequent and large-scale banning of websites, which is also highlighted in Parliament’s draft resolution. Allow me to refer at this point to the events of the last few days. On 3 March, the Turkish police arrested a number of journalists. We must monitor this case very closely and we must continuously remind the Turkish authorities of the importance of the continuous assertion of freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the freedom of religion, Turkey must provide both the legislative and the practical conditions for it to be exercised. To guarantee religious pluralism in line with European norms, a comprehensive legal solution is required. Similarly, the Presidency is concerned about the large number of news reports about torture and inhumane treatment and specifically, abuse committed outside official detention facilities. In order to prevent the violation of human rights, the strict implementation of the act on the scope of activities and powers of the police, as amended in 2007, must be monitored. As highlighted by the draft resolution of the European Parliament, the affirmation of the optional protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and the fight against impunity represent essential steps in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Turkish-Kurdish relations and the issue of the south-eastern territories, we hope that the implementation and continuation of the process of democratic opening will soon deliver the expected results, and can ultimately lead to the economic, social and cultural development of the region. Let me also recall that the Council strongly condemns the acts of terrorism committed in the territory of Turkey. It must also be highlighted that the Kurdistan Workers’ Party is still on the EU list of terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to relations between the EU and Turkey, I note with deep regret that despite being repeatedly asked to do so, Turkey still refuses to fulfil its obligations on the full and non-discriminatory implementation of the additional protocol to its Association Agreement. This is a core issue and therefore, the Council maintains its 2006 measures, which, on the other hand, clearly have an impact on the pace of the accession negotiations, as we all know.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council continues to closely monitor and review any achievements made. Similarly, there has been no progress in relations between Cyprus and Turkey returning to normal. The Council expects Turkey to actively support the negotiations under way under the auspices of the UN for the just, comprehensive and feasible settlement of the issue of Cyprus, pursuant to the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and with respect for the basic principles that represent the foundations of the EU. Turkey’s commitment and contribution is indeed essential for such a comprehensive settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I would like to emphasise that Turkey must make a clear commitment to good neighbourly relations and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Turkey is a key country of origin and a transit country in illegal immigration to the EU, and we therefore welcome the fact that the negotiations for a readmission agreement between the EU and Turkey have been concluded. The Council is looking forward to the agreement being signed as soon as possible and then implemented successfully. We are well aware that this took place at the latest Justice and Home Affairs Council, and we are now expecting Turkey to sign the treaty. Until that happens, the Council stresses once again the obligation to fully and properly implement the existing bilateral readmission agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the customs union between the EU and Turkey, I would like to note that it is time for Turkey to finally fulfil the large number of commitments it has failed to address so far. These include the technical and administrative barriers to trade, the registration requirements, the import licences, state aids, the assertion of intellectual property rights and other discriminative practices and provisions. These are all issues that need to be resolved urgently. Furthermore, Turkey must lift all the restrictions that affect trade and transport between EU Member States and Turkey. Thank you for your patience and I will be pleased to entertain any questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, I would like to thank the Parliament, and, in particular, Ms Oomen-Ruijten, for her report on Turkey. This debate and your resolution come at an important time for EU-Turkey relations, and the draft resolution underlines a number of issues of great importance for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains committed to the accession process with Turkey. The enlargement process encourages political and economic reform in the country. The EU-Turkey relationship is strong. Turkey needs the European Union and the European Union needs Turkey – this balance has not changed. The European Union is, and will remain, a key player for Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The relationship is based on deep economic integration: 40% of Turkey’s foreign trade goes to the EU and 80% of foreign direct investments in Turkey come from the EU. The European Union efficiently contributes to Turkey’s modernisation through technology transfers, Turkey’s participation in EU education and research programmes and our pre-accession financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, accession negotiations have slowed down. Moreover, the negotiating chapters that Turkey can aim to open under the present circumstances require significant reforms and adjustments. Against this background, I welcome all the more the progress made recently, in particular, as regards the competition chapter. I am confident that we can soon open this chapter, provided Turkey fulfils the last remaining conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the Cyprus issue weighs on the negotiations. Positive steps on the implementation of the additional protocol to the Ankara agreement or in the settlement talks would have a positive impact on the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to the reforms in Turkey. I welcome last year’s constitutional reform and the subsequent legislative amendments as a step in the right direction. Getting the laws right is important. However, only objective and impartial implementation of the new laws will ensure the success of the constitutional reforms. Turkey should continue with the constitutional reform. The process should be as inclusive and transparent as possible with the active participation of different political parties, civil society, non-governmental organisations and the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is following with concern the recent actions against journalists. Independence and freedom of the press is of utmost importance for democracy. In its 2010 progress report, the Commission has already highlighted the high number of court cases against journalists and undue pressure on the media which undermine this fundamental right in practice. Freedom of the press entails that dissent and opposing points of view need to be heard and – more importantly – tolerated. Freedom of the press means guaranteeing a public space for free debate, including on the Internet. The European Parliament’s draft resolution rightly underlines these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the right to freedom of religion, we welcome the initiatives taken in favour of non-Muslim religious communities in Turkey. However, further and systematic efforts are needed to address the problems of non-Muslims and the Alevis.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the issue of migration. Two weeks ago, the Council endorsed the EU-Turkey readmission agreement. This agreement is beneficial for the EU Member States, as Turkey is an important transit country for migration flows to the EU. The development on the readmission agreement also opens up for the first time new and concrete perspectives for further cooperation with Turkey in the area of visa and migration policies, with a view to improving mobility and contacts amongst our citizens and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey and the European Union have a shared interest in working closely together in this area. There are many good reasons to increase the ability of Turkish citizens, businessmen and students to travel to Europe: to familiarise themselves further with European standards; to enhance EU-Turkey trade to the benefit of both European Union and Turkish businesses, and to give a much-needed boost to our cooperation with Turkey. Madam President, I assure you that the European Parliament will be duly involved both on the issue of the readmission agreement and the visa dialogue, in line with the Treaty requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with Turkey have also to be seen in a wider context. Turkey’s active foreign policy is a strong potential asset for the European Union, provided it is developed within the framework of Turkey’s EU accession process. The European Union stands ready to intensify its existing dialogue with Turkey on foreign policy issues of mutual interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking about Turkey today, we cannot ignore the major developments in its wider region. The events in Tunisia and Egypt have highlighted Turkey’s stability, prosperity, and democracy. Citizens in these countries look at Turkey, as they look at the European Union, as examples to follow. They watch Turkey advocating standards and values that they are now fighting for themselves and that are associated with Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear: while an example to others, Turkey has still a lot to do. Many of these challenges ahead are outlined in your report. This is the occasion for Turkey to move even closer towards implementing fully the European Union political criteria. The government has a very important responsibility to uphold such a privileged position and to lead by example for the benefit of its own citizens, but also for the region as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More so than in previous years, I have therefore done my best to ensure that the tone of the report is very objective and constructive. The 22 compromise amendments for the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs are evidence of that. On the basis of the developments over the past year, we, as the European Parliament, want to set our priorities, priorities for the new Turkish parliament and for the next government. There are six priorities, it seems to me.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, a heavy responsibility lies on the government and opposition to seek a compromise and consensus for further reforms. The opposition, and the government too, have indicated that they want a complete reform of the constitution and I expect this to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, checks and balances are the basis of any democratic system. Further steps need to be taken to strengthen an independent and impartial judiciary, parliament’s supervisory role and, in particular, freedom of the press and freedom of expression. I am particularly concerned about freedom of the press, but I will come back to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, minority rights. I congratulate Turkey on the symbolic steps it has taken and on the dialogue which the government has explicitly sought. However, dialogue alone is not enough. The people in the southeast of the country, the Alevis, the Christian minorities, they expect something concrete. The statement on Mor Gabriel, in particular, proves that plenty of work still needs to be done and I suspect that it would be damaging for the Turkish Government if this case had to be settled by the Court of Justice once again. That is why something must be done about providing a democratic opening.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, women’s rights. Much has been done in the past year, but laws alone are not enough. I have visited women’s shelters. I have spoken to Turkish women’s organisations. It is clear that efforts have been made ​​by both the Turkish Government and parliament, at national and local level, but things seem to grind to a halt when they reach the police and the courts. That has to change. Laws are all very fine, but enforcement is also important. Today, on the hundredth anniversary of International Women’s Day, I would like once again to make a stand for better representation of women in the Turkish parliament. Things have to change in that respect in the coming elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the Ankara Protocol is vital, in my opinion. Here, the responsibility lies with Turkey. That, in particular, is the source of deadlock in the negotiating chapters: let me reiterate that.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, foreign policy. We Europeans are in favour of Turkey playing an active role in the region. Having said that, I would point out that Turkey will only be able to play a bridging role in that respect as long as the pillar of that bridge remains firmly anchored on the European side of the Bosporus, too. Madam Ashton will, on that point too, have to seek very active coordination with Turkey, more active than has hitherto been the case. By the way, these are not just my priorities. Everything I have mentioned has been under discussion in Turkish society as well. It is now up to the politicians to translate this debate into a consensus and a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, just two more areas of concern. We are alarmed by PKK’s announcement that it wants to end the ceasefire. The Commissioner has spoken about this. Freedom of the press: last Friday, I received an open letter. Let me say once again that anyone who restricts the freedom of expression in a particular country attacks that country’s culture. A free and tolerant debate is of crucial importance to any country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should welcome the fact that momentum has returned to the reform process in Turkey and, recognising the controversies of last September’s referendum, call for it to be a platform for fundamental constitutional reform with all-party support in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly endorse Commissioner Füle’s work in this respect and his uncompromising words this afternoon on freedom of expression, particularly as I, with fellow European representatives, were prevented from acting as legal observers to the KCK cases in the Diyarbakir court only last month. But I also ask the Commissioner to make progress on the visa issue, particularly for businesspeople, and on holding Turkey to its promises for the draft trade union law.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Socialist and Democrat Group believes that the accession talks are threatened, not by a train crash, but by death through strangulation. No new chapter has been opened for eight months, the longest period since the talks were first launched. We will vote tomorrow for the opening of the chapters on fundamental rights and judiciary and on the common foreign and security policy, not because we want to be weak on these issues, but because we want to be strong. We do not do so because we want to alter the pressure on all sides to achieve reconciliation on the island of Cyprus.</p>

We are important neighbours, we are allies in NATO, and many people of Turkish origin live in Member States of the European Union. We must show respect for one another. I very much support visa facilitation for businesspeople and students, just as you have said. I am also in favour of integrating Turkey much more closely into the structures of the common security and defence policy. I would like to see Cyprus bringing an end to its blockade in this area. When we look at North Africa, it is clear that Turkey is a role model for many countries in the region. All of this is very good.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we come to the accession process and we find that many chapters are blocked. It is extremely difficult to open new chapters. There are only three chapters left and the competition chapter is almost at the stage of opening. What will happen when the last chapters are opened? Will Turkey and the European Union no longer have anything to say to one another? That surely cannot be the case! Therefore, we must consider very carefully how to progress with the accession process and whether or not we can retain the current procedure, which involves Parliament commenting on the Commission’s progress report by means of a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Our 2010 report is highly critical, but also constructive. It deals with fundamental rights which are self-evident, particularly for Liberals: freedom of the press, freedom of speech, expression and assembly, student demonstrations, trade union rights and freedom of religion. For years, we have been calling for improvements in freedom of religion, but far too little progress has been made. The arrest of Ahmet Şık and Nedim Şener and the interference in the work of political foundations in Turkey are giving us great cause for concern. This is covered by the first Copenhagen criterion. It is a central issue, because it is the political criterion. If Turkey cannot move forward with its internal democratic constitution, I believe that we will still have serious problems in some areas, quite apart from the deadlock in the Council.</p>

<p class="contents">This report – unlike you, Minister, but that is understandable – stresses freedom of expression and freedom of the media. Unfortunately, this is obviously very necessary and current events serve to remind us of this with the recent arrests of the journalists Nedim Şener and Ahmet Şik in the context of the enquiries into Ergenekon and Sledgehammer. I tabled an amendment on this subject and I would invite you to support this work to put our Parliament in a position to exercise the greatest vigilance it can over this crucial issue of the freedom of the press, which also affects the question of the independence of the judiciary and the drawing up of the new constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would ask you the following political question: when we observe the stranglehold on the process of accession and the standstill on those chapters that are crucial if we want to make progress on issues of fundamental freedoms, the independence of the judiciary and the new constitution, is it not the case that our decision and that of the Council to punish by closing chapters, and the impossibility of opening and closing chapters, are today totally counterproductive factors?</p>
<p class="contents">There is no sense in the European Union depriving itself of one of the main levers for action in Turkey, that is to say, negotiations – in particular, on chapters 22, 23 and 24 – and I would wish to ask the Council to examine this situation once again because, obviously, it looks today as if the accession process has been taken hostage with these sanctions which, at the end of the day, can only have an effect if the accession process remains on the burner. Now, everyone can see that it is not. We therefore find ourselves in an extremely worrying political situation at a time when Turkey is seen by all the countries to the south of the Mediterranean as a source of inspiration for their own democratic transition.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not asking for there to be a decision on Turkey’s accession. I am asking for the decisions that we take at all levels to be absolutely consistent with the reliability, credibility, seriousness and loyalty of our process of negotiation. Today, this is very clearly in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My personal view has always been very supportive of Turkish aspirations towards Europe. Of course there are concerns, but I would say that, given the turbulence we are now seeing in North Africa and the Middle East and against the background of a continuing threat from Islamist terrorism, never has it been more important for us to send a positive signal to Turkey that she is welcome in the club of the European democracies.</p>

<p class="contents">In order for this to happen, Turkey needs to find a real political solution to the Kurdish question and to release the hundreds of Kurdish mayors and town councillors being held in its gaols, and it needs to work to establish the rule of law, recognise the Armenian genocide and resolve its problems with Greece, especially in the Aegean.</p>
<p class="contents">On Cyprus, it must stop hiding behind what happened in 2004. It is already 2011. It must immediately hand the town of Famagusta over to its inhabitants – we are talking about a European town with a European history dating back several thousand years, a town which has been left to the ravages of time for nearly four decades – and it must start withdrawing its occupying troops from Cyprus immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I would remind you of the protests by Turkish Cypriots calling, Mr Van Orden, for Turkey to give them a say in their own affairs. Instead, Eroglu has called for the protesters to be brought to trial. Turkey needs to respect the wishes of the Turkish Cypriots, by allowing a census to be taken in the occupied area and by putting an end to colonisation and allowing the names of the towns and villages to be shown on the map as they were for thousands of years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly appreciate the position taken by Mr Füle. The message to come out of Mrs Oomen’s report is that Turkey must discharge its obligations towards the European Union in full if it wishes to accede to the Union. If it does not wish to accede to the European Union, it should say so because, for a large country such as Turkey, I am against batting the issue back and forth and only talking in diplomatic terms. However, despite Europe’s clear message to Turkey, it is acting in a contradictory manner. It is as if there were a problem between the political leadership and the military regime. At the same time, it demonstrates good intentions towards its neighbours one minute and makes a ‘sieve’ out of the Aegean the next, with Turkish aeroplanes and ships passing through and violating Greek land and air borders on a daily basis.</p>

His visit to Ankara was inflammatory, and it is a pity that German Christian Democrats do not take Max Fischer’s advice and look in the mirror, because the AKP today is the mirror image of the German CDU in 1950 – not Christian Democrat, but Islamic Democrat – and that is no doubt why the Commissioner says that he understands and shares Turkey’s frustrations.</p>

At the same time, NATO and the European Union are stepping up their interventions in the area. Turkey, on the other hand, is trying to improve its strategic position in an area in which conflict is rife and resistance is escalating. This purpose was served by the recent reform of the Constitution, which was welcomed with such gusto by the European Union and the United States. At the same time, however, Turkey continues with its occupation of northern Cyprus, its violations in the Aegean and its blatant disregard for basic human rights and democratic freedoms. The workers in Turkey know that there is nothing positive to be gained from the European Union, because basic rights of the workers and the people are being taken away in the European Union and because the European Union continues, as in the past, to support a series of reactionary regimes in the area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular, we would like to highlight the issue of religious tolerance, which unfortunately does not exist in Turkey, not only because we could mention the murders of some priests, including Italian ones such as Monsignor Luigi Padovese and Don Andrea Santoro, but also because the Turkish delegates at a recent Council of Europe meeting sadly voted against a motion condemning attacks on Christians around the world.</p>

We also wonder how Mr Erdoğan’s deputy, Mr Babacan, could possibly have said that the European Union is a ‘Christian club’. What was he expecting to find? Apart from that, does he not think that the problem perhaps is not the ‘European Christian club’ but the lack of religious rights inside Turkey? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Words do not mean much’. However, the supporters of Turkey have allowed themselves to be deceived by positive-sounding, empty words. The 2010 progress report is, in reality, a fault report. It shows that Turkey is many things, but it is certainly not ready to join Europe. Fundamental rights often exist only on paper and there are significant restrictions on freedom of speech. This has been confirmed by the recent arrest of two journalists. There have been no changes in the discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities, such as the Kurds and the Christians. Prime Minister Erdoğan hypocritically accuses European countries of Islamophobia, despite the fact that Muslims are free to practice their religion here, in contrast to the Christians in Turkey. The land dispute over the monastery of Mor Gabriel is one more demonstration of this. Despite claiming the opposite, the Erdoğan government is pushing forward with the process of Islamification. We know that this is what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent survey shows how the Turks really see the EU. They are in favour of joining the EU, but, at the same time, they regard Europeans with a great deal of mistrust. We should break off the accession negotiations as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You should not compare the Justice and Development Party (AKP) with the party which returned Germany to democratic government and the rule of law at the end of the Nazi era. This is really alarming, particularly as the German party in question was in cooperation and in coalition with the Liberals during the 1950s.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of strong links between Turkey and the European Union. Turkey is strategically important to us, but not at any price. Firstly, we cannot abolish the conditions for accession, including freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, rights for minorities and freedom of religion. This has been made clear in the Commission’s reports and in the report by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten. Secondly, we must not put the integration capacity of the European Union at risk. We need to find other methods. Thirdly, it is Turkey’s responsibility to ensure that this process is not obstructed and, at last, to keep the promises that it has made in the context of the Ankara Protocol, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is in a position to make it clear that integration within the European Union is possible. However, when Mr Erdoğan says in a speech in Germany that Turks who have German nationality owe their primary loyalty to Turkey, we have a serious problem as far as integration is concerned. This is the expression of a particular mindset and also a means of establishing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I am of the opinion that Turkey is not yet ready. However, we have invited Turkey to work constructively with us in the context of the Berlin Plus agreement and in other areas in order to forge closer links. The example of Mor Gabriel forms part of this issue.</p>

This process is a measure of Europe’s credibility and of Turkey’s intentions to carry out the necessary democratic reforms. However, the government’s stated intention of making democratic changes is belied by the facts. We have been following the successive arrests of journalists over the past few days with concern. On 20 February, the journalist Nedim Şener, known for his criticism of the police’s approach to the murder of the Armenian journalist, Hrant Dink, was arrested along with six of his colleagues. They were all gaoled on charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation, thus bringing the number of journalists in prison to well over a hundred. What ultimately appears to be the real offence in these cases is their criticism of the Erdoğan government, rather than any criminal activities.</p>

Despite all the complexity, however, we should not allow ourselves to be influenced by historically-based prejudices. Recent events in Turkey indisputably constitute factors that are unacceptable from the perspective of European democratic principles. We must intensify negotiations with Turkey all the more. Turkey is of fundamental geopolitical importance to Europe with regard to the complex region of the Middle East. This position must not, of course, be abused. If we have an open and principled dialogue with Turkey, however, this can lead to an improved understanding of democratic rules. The economic development of Turkey over recent years has been truly remarkable, and its industry is becoming a significant partner of European firms in many areas. It is therefore important for these economic relations to be matched by corresponding political relations with the European Union, with a clear perspective on the future. If Turkey is genuinely interested in joining the EU, it cannot take steps such as those we have seen recently. I strongly support, for many reasons, the continuing process of Turkey’s approximation to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as I am concerned, this is essential. Turkey must undertake to bring about a complete separation between state and religion and to accept non-Islamic religions. The case of the monastery of Mor Gabriel is one example of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind the Member States of the European Union of their obligation to call forcefully on Turkey to uphold universal human rights and, in particular, freedom of religion in all their negotiations with the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the reforms that the Turkish Government has initiated over the last year. However, Turkey must also finally fulfil its obligations and implement the Ankara Protocol, so that progress can be made in the negotiations. It must not constantly hold the EU or Cyprus responsible for the deadlock, as you, Mr Erdoğan, are so happy to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey must finally put an end to the practice of arresting journalists who are critical of the regime. Ahmet Şık, Nedim Şener and others need protection from the arbitrary nature of the justice system. These are just some of the requirements for opening chapter 23. Mr Erdoğan, you need to make a clear statement on this and not speak out against the integration of your fellow countrymen and spread your pan-Turkish world view, as you did in Düsseldorf. That is what we expect from you. Of course, the EU must also make a contribution to the success of the negotiations and show that it is ready to accept new members. Both sides have their homework to do. However, one thing is clear. The ball is now in your court and it is your turn to take action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, let us remember that the Ankara Agreement provided for the four freedoms of movement and for the customs union between Turkey and the EU. Also, several ECJ rulings, as well as existing visa regimes for other candidate states, have proved the point that visa liberalisation for Turkish citizens, especially businesspeople and students, should be clearly endorsed in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should call for new momentum on the stalled situation in Cyprus. Implementation of the Council decision of 26 April 2004 would greatly encourage Turkey to implement the EC-Turkey Association Agreement. This would not only lead to economic and political gains for both sides, but would also allow all the inhabitants of the island to trade freely, and it would eliminate the current double standards in the EU. It is time to show that the European Parliament can make a difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We would have a country of 80 million joining us and making claims on the European budget, European decision making and foreign policy. What this would lead to can be seen from Turkey’s relations with Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s accession would have a detrimental effect on integration, too. We are already witnessing that. Prime Minister Erdoğan has recently called on Turkish migrants in Germany to learn Turkish, first and foremost. To me, however, it makes sense that, if you are living in Germany, you should prioritise learning German.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Erdoğan’s agenda is that of an Islamic party and, on that point too, the balance would shift if Turkey joined the EU. We would have to deal with millions of people who, unfortunately, are not familiar with the Judeo-Christian fundaments of Europe and who would want to change them. Let us therefore make sure that the 2010 progress report is the last one. Let us stop these senseless negotiations!

<p class="contents">Press freedom is a major concern. Protection of this freedom, which has seen some difficult times, is a valuable asset. In a democracy, the press has an important role in putting checks on those wielding power.

<p class="contents">Finally, on this hundredth anniversary of International Women’s Day, I would give some thought to women’s rights in Turkey.

The new and unusually active Turkish policy towards the region obviously poses the question of whether it will be a Turkish policy under a European flag or whether it will, in fact, be a European policy with help from Turkey. Either way, it is a valuable perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my impression that this cooperation should be placed on a much more pragmatic basis as soon as possible, and that very protracted discussions on membership are – entirely unnecessarily – frustrating for both parties. There are various reasons why they have lasted so long, and the prospects for their completion are not particularly good at present. Today, I would like to express my thanks for the report tabled by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, which is a well-balanced document, as usual. In particular, I am grateful that issues relating to the religious freedom of Christians in Turkey have been dealt with so well. This issue continues to be a problem, involving the legal personality of the Christian community, the return of property and opportunities for the training of clergy. We should remember this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every year, the European Commission adopts an ‘enlargement package’, and we draft a report assessing the progress towards accession to the European Union made by each of the candidate countries over the past 12 months on the basis of this package. In the Commission’s assessment, Turkey fulfils the political criteria sufficiently. Recent constitutional reforms have provided opportunities for improvements in many areas, such as the judiciary and fundamental rights. The package of amendments to the constitution approved in last year’s referendum is a step in the right direction, but the drafting and adoption of these reforms were not preceded by a consultation process involving the political parties and civil society. It is very much to be welcomed that the reform creates a basis for appointing an Ombudsman and creating a national human rights institution.</p>
<p class="contents">It will now be of key importance to ensure that these new proposals are implemented transparently and on the basis of democratic procedures in accordance with European standards. Unfortunately, Turkey’s relations with its neighbours cast an ever-present shadow over the negotiation process. I believe that if Turkey shows good will, creates a favourable climate for the ongoing negotiations on Cyprus and supports these negotiations, and if the country makes a tangible contribution to a comprehensive resolution of the problem, Turkey will have a warmer reception on the European and international stage. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No, not yet. Is Europe ready for Turkey? No, not yet. Has Turkey abandoned its aspirations to accession? No, no yet. Three questions and three answers, Commissioner, which realistically set out the critical turning point which Turkey has reached on its path towards accession. They also summarise the complicated relationship between Turkey and Europe. For historical, political and cultural reasons, this relationship has always oscillated between trust and suspicion, between attraction and repulsion. The political expression of this reality is Turkey’s long and painful journey towards accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the noteworthy progress that Turkey is making, it is still giving cause for concern on human rights issues. It is still haggling over every tiny obligation towards the European Union. It refuses to normalise its relations with a Member State, the Republic of Cyprus; it maintains the threat of war against another Member State, Greece, and it refuses to recognise and apply the Convention on the Law of the Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, the arrogance of the Turkish leadership has even angered the Turkish Cypriots. For its part, Europe is still sending ambiguous messages about accession, which are doing nothing to help. We therefore need a clearer position. Only Turkey’s full compliance with the undertakings it has made can and – it is only fair – must guide it towards accession. However, if we are to be fair, we must also be strict with Turkey.</p>

This should be guaranteed by law. Therefore, I ask the Turkish authorities to reinsert the reference to sexual identity into the draft law on combating discrimination and inequality.</p>
<p class="contents">Time is running away. I could speak about this issue for a long time. It is worthwhile recalling that Turkey is a modern, secular country and that in Turkey, women got the vote long before women got the vote in some parts of the EU – something we should remember as we look back over one hundred years of feminism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Turkey has not made any significant progress compared to last year in implementing reforms and fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, full compliance with which is an essential precondition for EU membership. Shortcomings persist, above all, in the judiciary, where the right to a fair and rapid trial is still not secured, in the area of minority rights and women’s rights, and also in the issues of freedom of religion, expression, a free press and the fight against corruption. The lack of religious freedom is particularly evident.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey must improve the coordination of its foreign policy with EU foreign policy, and thus show that it shares common values and interests with the EU. A specific instance could be support for EU efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, for example, and signing the statute of the International Criminal Court, which Turkey evidently continues to postpone. I also expect Turkey to be much more active in resolving the Cyprus issue – as we say in Slovak - by pulling its military forces out of this occupied territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why, Commissioner, anyone wishing to help Turkey should ultimately listen to what is being said by the Turkish Cypriots, who are currently protesting, not for direct trade or for its translation, as we heard today in the decision dated 26 April, but for Cyprus to be released from the occupation and for them personally to be released and rescued. I do not think, Commissioner, that Turkey can accede via a process to destroy Cyprus and anyone who wants to help Turkey needs to stop taking it out on Cyprus.

<p class="contents">We are not managing to overcome this hypocrisy, but perhaps we could deal with it better if we considered a few general background factors. The first is that we must recognise the fact that we have utterly failed, or perhaps we have never even tried, to initiate a real strategy in relation to the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean. The Turkey issue is closely linked to that.</p>
<p class="contents">When we went on our mission to Tunisia a few days ago, the only Islamist party, al-Nahda, told us quite sincerely that it found inspiration in Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s AKP, and so in some way, people look to Turkey to be able to have a frontage towards Europe, but they do not know whether the opposite frontage, Europe, is willing to take it into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ask ourselves what it is worth doing with regard to Turkey: is it worth being thoroughly sincere and moving quickly towards forms of privileged partnership that involve the whole Mediterranean area, or is it worth continuing to play for time and putting off our decision indefinitely, so that the Turks themselves, with their great pride, end up saying ‘no’ to us once and for all, thus further complicating the situation in the Mediterranean?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we are the ones who should decide and not wait for the others to make a decision. We have specific responsibilities and we must assume them in their entirety. We must have the courage to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’, and then we will see that this situation will have a positive outcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We regard Turkey as an important Euro-Atlantic partner. This is why I am sure that, in spite of our contradictions, we all agree that we need a reformed, democratic, secular and European Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally feel deeply uneasy about the risk of Turkey’s domestic and foreign policy taking an Islamic slant. We can see that part of Turkey’s political establishment clearly has no desire to adhere to the principle of strict separation between religion and politics, as handed down by Atatürk.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to help Turkey overcome the internal division in Turkish society, which includes improving the situation of minorities and relations with its neighbours. We cannot, of course, point an accusing finger only at Turkey. Its neighbours also need to make their move in this direction.</p>

Despite the differences compared to European culture, tradition and values, however, Turkey is not a fundamentalist country and religion is the free expression of every individual.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible to deny Turkey an attempt to fulfil the criteria for joining the EU, even though it is desirable, of course, to take more intensive measures to help settle the disputes between Turkish Cypriots and Greeks. A solution to the Cyprus question might then also bring greater stability, prosperity and security to the Eastern Mediterranean, and might help to speed up Turkey’s EU accession process to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to say one thing in conclusion. We are here, ladies and gentlemen, just like our colleagues in the Commission and the Council, in order to be honest, and if we affirm that Turkey is gradually fulfilling the criteria, then we must not talk in advance about a privileged partnership. It would be better to tell Turkey directly that, despite fulfilling all the criteria, it will not achieve full EU membership. In my opinion, that would be honest on our part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The refusal by the Turkish Government to open its ports and airports to trade from the Republic of Cyprus is unacceptable, but I would also like to mention the fact that they could also have a more constructive approach towards their neighbour Armenia, including the reopening of the shared border with Armenia and an acknowledgement of the deliberate mass killing of Armenians in 1915. Furthermore, Turkey’s thinly disguised political support for Iran risks impeding the EU’s efforts to stop the Islamist theocracy in Tehran from building a nuclear bomb, and that is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned by its increasing hostility to Israel, our ally, as witnessed by the Gaza flotilla episode and Turkey’s officially published findings. Turkey continues to maintain the Greek Orthodox Monastery at Halki closed for no apparent reason, and to deny its ancient Syriac Christians full community rights.

<p class="contents">I therefore think that the dialogue between Brussels and Istanbul requires more openness, so that our Turkish friends can understand that the path to the EU leads only through criteria which cannot be circumvented. If it seems to our Turkish friends that they are not prepared to fulfil the demanding criteria of the EU, it would be proper to acknowledge this honestly and put forward a sensible alternative for our common coexistence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The law is still in place. Could the EU possibly tolerate the suppression of heretical academic opinion in a Member State?</p>
<p class="contents">Later, the report says that there is no progress towards normalisation of relations with Cyprus. In plain language, this means that Turkey still occupies, with force of arms, the northern part of that country, expropriating the property of Greek Cypriots and desecrating and plundering their places of worship and burial. Until Turkey withdraws its troops unconditionally, returns property and repairs damage, there should be no relations with Turkey at all, let alone negotiation for its EU membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But, as many of you underlined, if Turkey indeed fulfils all relevant accession obligations and we remain committed and serious, then we will be able to avoid most of the frustration some of you referred to and move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with those who are saying quite clearly that moving on the Additional Protocol, the Ankara Agreement, and achieving progress on the comprehensive settlement talks on Cyprus, would create a momentum for the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with those who indicated that the rules of the game should not be changed in the middle of the game. But let me make it absolutely clear. For me, this is not a game; for me, this is a serious process. I strongly believe that, at the end of this process, most European Union and Turkish citizens will see clearly the benefits of a new and modern Turkey being a Member of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark would be that this year’s report is indeed very balanced. What I very much appreciate, and what the rapporteur has managed, to a large extent, to take into account, as has the debate today, is the need to look at the bigger picture and not just present this House with a list of incidents and problems.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that I also agree with those who are making it absolutely clear that the key to a number of the chapters is in the hands of our Turkish partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I am one of those who would like to see chapters such as Chapter 15 on Energy and, especially, Chapter 23 on the Judiciary and Fundamental Rights, opened. This is very important, particularly Chapter 23. I think it would be in the interests of both Turkey and the European Union to work on establishing a track record on these important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been said that 14 chapters are frozen because of the Ankara Protocol. Let me make a personal comment. I think there is a distinction between those chapters which are frozen unilaterally and those which are frozen based on the recommendation of the Commission, because of the non-commitment of Turkey towards customs union, and then agreed by the Member States by consensus. Chapters 23 and 15 are among those being frozen unilaterally.</p>
<p class="contents">As a last point, let me also address an issue which is very much on our minds these days, and that is the situation of media freedom in Turkey. Last Thursday, I issued a clear statement to make absolutely sure that a message is sent to our Turkish colleagues that Turkish law does not sufficiently guarantee freedom of expression in line with the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights, and to make it absolutely clear that Turkey urgently needs to amend its legal framework to improve the exercise of freedom of the press both in practice, and in a significant manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I raised this issue in very much the same terms with Mr Davutoğlu, the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, last Friday. But let me also make the following comment. I think it is important not to shy away from commenting critically where we see problems. But it is also important to help Turkey put the legislation into such a form, such order, that it corresponds to the abovementioned Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking about how to involve both the Council of Europe and the OECD in this process, and I will be informing the House about the results of these consultations and the way I recommend we proceed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Enikő Győri, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(HU)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for this excellent debate. A multitude of arguments, both for and against, have been put forward with regard to both Turkey’s preparedness and the whole accession process. This, too, indicates the complexity of the situation and of how difficult the task of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten was. I believe that she did an excellent job in creating a report which reflects very well how difficult it is to evaluate the situation and Turkey’s preparedness.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, points on which we are in agreement, and in my opinion, this was also reflected in this debate. I believe that there is not only an agreement here between the parties but also on the part of both the Commission and the Council. The first of these points is that we need a European Turkey and it is in our interest to assist with this process. We are talking about a strategic partner here. I cannot stress enough how important it is to have a country with a small area in Europe as our friend. There is also no doubt that this is a process based on conditions, and that Turkey must comply with its obligations, all those it has undertaken, and in order to ensure that we can make progress in the negotiations, it must meet the benchmarks and expectations we have formulated. There is also no doubt that Turkey must strive for good neighbourhood relations. This is a matter which is not to be questioned in any accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We could see that there is a debate on how much progress there has been, and how many tasks Turkey has completed. I believe that we cannot call into question the achievements of the constitutional reform and that there has also been progress in minority affairs, for example, albeit partial. No one questioned the fact that there is still a very long way to go. It is enough to refer again to the issue of the freedom of the press, the situation of women or the operation of the justice system. If we are looking at how new life can be breathed into the accession negotiations, we should examine our scope of action. As mentioned by Commissioner Füle, there are indeed 13 chapters that remain open and we only managed to close one, while 16 have been frozen, where we cannot make any progress at the moment. <span class="italic">De facto</span> we can work on three chapters, namely, those on competition, public procurement, and social policy and employment. The best prepared of these is the chapter on competition, and much has been done during the Belgian Presidency as well in order to enable us to open the chapter, and the Commission is working very hard, with our maximum support, to open this chapter at least during the term of the Hungarian Presidency. Again, Turkey must meet a very large number of conditions to that end. I trust that there will be progress in this respect, and I truly do not wish to see for months on end that we are still unable to open another chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">Many have asked or indicated that progress in the matter of visas would be welcome. Let me be frank with you. The Hungarian Presidency would encourage the Commission to commence the dialogue, but we all know that in the Council meeting, the situation was not entirely clear in this regard, and a number of Member States have expressed their doubts. I believe, as does the Hungarian Presidency, that it would be in our interest to launch the dialogue. There have been several references to the freedom of religion and the persecution of Christians. The Council has received its share of criticism for not addressing this issue. Although this falls under the competence of Lady Ashton as the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Council, let me tell you that the issue was added to the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council in January. At that time, there was no agreement, but the February Foreign Affairs Council did adopt a resolution in which the persecution of all religious minorities, and specifically Christians, was condemned, so the Council did actually address this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, please allow me to also ask us all a question, because we have been talking about what Turkey has done, whether it has done enough and whether it is working properly towards accession. However, let us also think about all that depends on us. And if we want to be honest, we will see that Europe is not living a period of inclusion. We look at what is happening in North Africa, but if you look at what is going on within the European Union or in our even more immediate neighbourhood, you will see that Turkey is one of the five candidate countries, but there are also four others. To what extent can we support these processes? How prepared are we to conclude the accession negotiations with Croatia? How prepared are we to admit Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen Area? How prepared are we to uplift Europe’s hard-fated community, the Roma? Inclusion is on the agenda in a great variety of contexts.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has now turned somewhat inward. Let me state this with a great deal of openness. There is an enlargement weariness. We must deal with our own public opinions, with how open we are with regard to these issues. I believe that maybe we should be thinking in a somewhat longer term. If we consider the long-term interests of the European Union, that is, to retain its attractiveness to both EU citizens and our immediate neighbours, whether it be Turkey or all the North African countries, I believe that we should bring back a more inclusive Europe within ourselves, naturally, with the proviso that this can by no means be unconditional, and that we must not save on the work that is expected from all candidate countries. It would, in my opinion, be a very grave moment for the European Union if Turkey lost interest in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year, it is 48 years since Turkey became a candidate country for joining the EU. It is beyond dispute that much has happened since then. The economic development of the country, along with the opening up of EU markets, have certainly played their role. However, the country still has a problem over a number of factors which hark back to the creation of the modern Turkish state. The treaty of 1924 clearly declares that citizens professing the Islamic faith are Turks, while citizens professing another faith are regarded as Greek Catholics. The treaty does not recognise other ethnic groups. That which was progressive in 1924, namely, recognition of the fact that someone could be of a religion other than Islam, has quite different connotations today. It is by no means a simple matter in Turkey to declare an ethnicity other than Turkish, whether it be Kurdish, Circassian or any other of the nationalities that have clearly existed in Turkey for a great many years, but whose recognition in real life, including the promotion of ethnic rights, will take a long time yet. The key issues in the problematic situation over the negotiations at the moment are the failure to resolve the occupation of Cyprus, inactivity over the UN resolution on Famagusta and a failure to fulfil the ‘tasks’ arising from previous reports. The reduced role of the army is positive, but only if secular forces remain in power. If this is not the case, it could threaten the stability of the entire region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a general rule, the problems raised are the same – Turkey makes a certain amount of progress in bringing itself into line with EU requirements, but the progress is never satisfactory enough to give a clear indication of an approximate date for accession, or to state whether the country will, in fact, ever join the EU. The changes which have already been made are beneficial, but the EU’s failure to adopt a clear position on Turkey’s accession is a source of frustration for the Turkish authorities and the country’s citizens. We cannot, of course, demand that the Member States take an identical view of the matter, but our indecisiveness means that the EU appears to lack credibility. Support for EU membership is falling among Turkish citizens. The country may start to look for new allies and turn away from the West, which would be disadvantageous to Europe. Turkey is our strategic partner in economic, regional and energy matters, and it is also a significant military force and a key player in the Middle East. The problematic areas are always the same – human rights and civil liberties, the rights of women and national minorities, the rule of law, reform of the judiciary, corruption, freedom of the press and freedom of speech – and they still fall a long way short of European standards, despite the efforts that have been made. Whether the negotiation process can be accelerated depends on how quickly and how effectively Turkey can fulfil the conditions imposed on it, and on the form of membership that the EU proposes to the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There can, however, also be no doubt about the fact that numerous democratic reforms have been carried out as part of the process of Europeanisation in Turkey, as a result of which the negotiating framework for Turkey’s accession was agreed on 3 October 2005. The opening of negotiations can be regarded as a success not only for Turkey, but also for Europe, since the main motive for Turkey to carry out reforms was its European ambitions. While recognising the significant progress made by Turkey to date, it should, however, be remembered that there are many problems which are hampering its integration into the EU. Above all, these include constitutional reform, freedom of the press, women’s rights and the protection of national minorities. A modern democratic state must be based on the principle of division of power and a balance between the executive, legislative and judicial authorities, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and, in particular, freedom of expression and a legal framework which guarantees women’s rights and gender equality. I welcomed the announcement by the Turkish Government and opposition that they are willing to carry out reforms to transform Turkey into a fully-fledged pluralistic democracy, and I hope that all political parties and society will be involved in the entire constitutional process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider the commitment of the European Parliament to preserve the openness of the European Union very commendable. At the same time, you will also have an important role in winning over the general public of the Member States to the cause of enlargement, of enlargement based on conditionality. The resolution you will be adopting tomorrow also confirms the realisation of this responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you that there is utmost commitment on the part of the Council as well. In line with the renewed enlargement consensus approved by the European Council, the Council confirmed in its conclusions of 14 December 2010 that the EU firmly supports the continuation of the enlargement process in the Western Balkans countries on the basis of the principles and conclusions adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hungarian Presidency of the European Council is also deeply committed to this objective. I would like to thank you for the excellent work you have done, and for contributing through this resolution to the consolidation of Montenegro’s achievements, for which there is a great need throughout the accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">We have confirmed Montenegro’s European perspective on several occasions. The stability of the country and its orientation towards Europe, which is supported by all political parties as well as the majority of the citizens, and the high degree of consensus between the various ethnic groups, are all features which make Montenegro a stabilising factor in the Western Balkans region.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that Montenegro achieved visa liberalisation, the conclusion of the stabilisation and association agreement, and obtained candidate country status within 12 months. These are significant results, and prove that a European perspective acts as a driving force for the preparations of a country. The EU must therefore acknowledge the commitment and achievements of the countries intending to join. Thanks to the progress made, further steps can be taken in the country’s European programme; new commitments can be made and new requirements can be formulated. To this end, delegations of the EU institutions and the Member States, at different levels and in different fields, are meeting on a daily basis these days.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore welcome the current steps taken by Montenegro, particularly the action plan just adopted by its government, drawn up in response to the recommendations formulated in the Commission’s opinion, and we also welcome the method employed, namely, that the government held extensive consultations with civil society before the drafting of the action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to give a quick list of the so-called key priorities where progress needs to be made. These are also mentioned in the Commission’s November 2010 opinion. These include the reinforcement of the rule of law, the continuation of the reform of public administration, as well as the strengthening of public administration capacity, the adoption of an electoral law that complies with the constitution, and increased media freedom. This is not only important from a legal point of view, but also represents a touchstone for the political maturity of the authorities. Furthermore, it is extremely important to guarantee the legal status of persons who were forced to leave their homes and to respect their rights, as is the fight to eliminate organised crime and corruption. We are expecting serious progress from Montenegro in this respect as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for any subsequent step to be taken in the stabilisation and association process in general, and specifically in the commencement of the accession negotiations, it is very important for Montenegro to make progress in these areas and also to make further efforts. It is essential for Montenegro to fulfil its undertakings and to be able to present tangible results.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Montenegro plays an important part in regional cooperation. It engages in close cooperation with its neighbours and we honestly welcome the constructive role it is playing in stabilising the region and promoting good neighbourhood relations, particularly as the country holding the Presidency of the South-East Europe Cooperation Process.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Montenegro is home to the new workgroup on culture and society of the Regional Cooperation Council, the Cetinje Parliamentary Forum. Integration is inconceivable without regional cooperation, and Montenegro sets an example in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution to be adopted by Parliament represents an actual stocktaking of achievements. It is an accurate account of the current situation and a useful guideline to the tasks of the candidate country. I congratulate the rapporteur, as well as all those who actively participated in the creation of the document.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to encourage Montenegro and the Montenegrin authorities to continue their reform efforts and to endeavour to meet the expectations of their own citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, it is an honour for me to address the European Parliament on the European integration process of Montenegro. Let me start where the Presidency has ended in congratulating the rapporteur for Montenegro, Mr Charles Tannock, on his report, and expressing my gratitude to all honourable Members who have contributed. Parliament plays a key role in enlargement policy. I believe that, with the concerted action of all the European institutions, we can achieve more.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegro’s overall progress towards fulfilment of the criteria for European Union membership has been remarkable. There is a growing political consensus. The country has made important progress in putting in place its legal and institutional framework. It is also strongly committed to regional cooperation. There is a solid record of structural economic reforms and progress in most areas of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council decision to grant candidate status to Montenegro is a recognition of these achievements and a strong signal which confirms the credibility of the European Union’s enlargement policy. The country has entered a decisive stage. Candidate status is a great responsibility for Montenegro. Tangible results are needed in order for Montenegro to be able to move to the next stage of European integration. I am confident that the European Parliament resolution will send the right message to Montenegro of acknowledging past achievements, but also the strong expectation that the reform process will be pursued with determination and that all the key challenges on Montenegro’s path to European Union membership will be thoroughly addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I met the new Prime Minister of Montenegro, Dr Igor Lukšić, last week. His commitment to pursuing the reform process and his strong determination to meet the key priorities set out in the Commission opinion are encouraging. On 17 February, after public consultations with civil society and talks with the Commission services, the government adopted an action plan to address the priorities. It is now crucial to focus on implementation and establish a solid track record.</p>
<p class="contents">The key priorities set out in the opinion are a significant, but achievable, challenge that requires the involvement and commitment of all actors in Montenegro. Previous enlargements have shown the importance of addressing key issues under the political criteria, as well as Chapter 23, early in the accession process. Early solid achievements in this area in Montenegro, notably, in the politicisation of the public administration, the strengthening of the independence of the judiciary and the effective fight against corruption and against organised crime, will later ensure smooth negotiations and integration into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegro must improve its electoral framework, in line with the recommendations of the OSCE/ODIHR and the Venice Commission. The Parliament needs strengthening, which is an important priority for both the Commission and the European Parliament. Effective compliance with European standards in the field of human rights is essential, in particular, regarding freedom of expression and relations with civil society. Further efforts are needed to strengthen anti-discrimination policy, notably, gender equality and the effective protection of vulnerable groups. Sustainable solutions are needed for displaced persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Other shortcomings identified in the opinion and in your draft resolution also need to be addressed. Montenegro needs to strengthen its administrative capacity and to upgrade its preparation in a number of areas of the European Union <span class="italic">acquis</span>. The future of Montenegro undeniably lies in the European Union and we should act responsibly. The credibility of our enlargement policy is based on the enlargement countries respecting the conditionality towards the European Union and the European Union respecting its commitment towards the enlargement countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in all our interests to ensure that the progress of Montenegro towards the European Union is based on solid achievements and concrete results. Montenegro’s performance this year will be assessed in the enlargement package due in October 2011. Only when the Commission has established that Montenegro has achieved the necessary degree of compliance with the accession criteria, in particular, the seven key priorities set out in the opinion, will it be in a position to recommend opening negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have been extremely impressed by the diligence and commitment of the entire Montenegrin Government. No matter how small it may be, it is certainly one that works extremely hard. I would pay very special tribute to the former prime minister, Milo Ðjukanović, and his recent successor, Igor Lukšić, who have both been pragmatic and, at the same time, single-minded in their approach and in their quest to lead their country towards EU accession and NATO accession.</p>
<p class="contents">The onus is now on Montenegro to meet the EU’s expectations. In particular, the Montenegrin Government needs to address the seven key priorities identified by Commissioner Füle in the Commission’s opinion. I particularly emphasise the issue of corruption and organised crime, on which there are clear and well-defined benchmarks for measuring progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that last month, the government adopted a very well formulated action plan aimed at responding to these priorities and demands. In my view, Montenegro is now ready to start negotiating EU membership as an official candidate, and it is curious that the Commission should be insisting on a significant time-lapse between the granting of official candidate status and the opening of negotiations. This delay has no real justification or apparent basis, according to my reading of the Treaties. More importantly, it is hardly the most positive signal to send to Podgorica, or indeed to countries elsewhere in the region, such as Macedonia, working hard to obtain candidate status.</p>
<p class="contents">I only hope that this enforced wait, which now is inevitable and is frustrating to Montenegro, will not result in a weakening of the country’s commitment to an engagement with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegro should be judged solely on merit, facts and achievements. Its case should not be tied to the progress in other neighbouring states in the western Balkans. Montenegro is a small country but a beautiful country, which has enjoyed remarkable stability and economic growth since its peaceful divorce from Serbia. It has few, if any, internal ethnic or religious problems, unlike some of its larger neighbours. It has a minor border dispute with Croatia, which it will resolve peacefully before the International Court of Justice. It has recently negotiated and ratified extradition treaties with both Serbia and Croatia in the fight against organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">It is euro-based: it has the euro without being in the eurozone, believe it or not. Its economy remains undiversified – sadly – relying mainly on tourism and one aluminium smelter. It needs to create more jobs in hydroelectric power for export, and financial services may well be another solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I remain optimistic for what is essentially a very good news story in the western Balkans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to urge my fellow Members to give their support tomorrow to the report that we have before us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in particular, to emphasise the fact that I have a very positive view of the European Council’s decision of December 2010 to grant Montenegro candidate status with the prospect of EU membership.

The political and economic stability that Montenegro has continually shown right from the time it became independent is immense. This country is often described as a success story – and we heard it today from the Council, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Tannock, I also think it is regrettable that candidate status has been disconnected from the right to begin negotiations. I therefore believe that the Commission should initiate membership negotiations as quickly as possible and set a date to start these negotiations with Montenegro. It is clear that the reform process must continue, for example, within the judiciary and with regard to combating conflicts of interest in public administration, and that the priorities recommended by the Commission must be dealt with, but I would nevertheless like to praise the government of Montenegro for the positive reforms that it has succeeded in implementing so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we have Montenegro’s ambassador with us here in the Chamber, and I hope and look forward to the day when we can welcome not only the ambassador, but the whole of Montenegro to the EU and the representatives of Montenegro to this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that Montenegro can now pursue a path towards EU membership. I agree that the Commission should initiate the negotiations as soon as possible, provided, of course, that Montenegro continues to move towards the EU’s targets.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that Montenegro has now been granted candidate status sends out a strong signal about the EU’s commitment to the future of whole of the former Yugoslavia in the EU. Like Croatia, Montenegro can show the remaining countries the way to EU membership. Rapprochement to the EU is a key factor for both prosperity and stability in the region. That is abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegro is a small, new and peaceful country that is strongly committed to regional cooperation. It has good relations with its neighbouring countries and, hence, good prerequisites for success in the forthcoming membership negotiations. However, there are areas that require vigorous reforms. The legal and administrative capacity to form a fully viable society based on the rule of law has been strengthened, but more is still required. Corruption and organised crime are rife and the legal system needs a great deal of further enhancement in order to meet the EU’s requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled a number of amendments in order to point out that Montenegro also needs to strengthen the position of women, secure freedom of the press, safeguard the fundamental rights of workers and minorities and, in particular, develop civil society. We must not forget that these, too, are crucial areas in the forthcoming EU negotiations. I welcome Montenegro’s membership of the European Union as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, by adopting the resolution on Montenegro, we wish to renew, in principle, the commitment towards continuation of the process of European Union enlargement and towards enabling all the states of our continent to develop under the aegis of Union membership, then we first need to ensure fulfilment of the following steps, first of all for Montenegro, and then also for Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania, not forgetting Turkey of course.</p>
<p class="contents">For Montenegro, this would mean that the granting of candidate status and the decision, in principle, to start negotiations should be followed by the actual opening of negotiations. Meanwhile, much more work awaits the Montenegrin Government in terms of harmonising legal systems and enabling administrative capacities. The fight against corruption, in all its diverse forms, must continue and must result in the conviction of those who have engaged in corrupt practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Ensuring equality and respect for women is not a task that deserves to be highlighted today only. Freedom of expression, media independence and protection of minorities are all values which any candidate for membership in the European Union must unconditionally respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The young Montenegrin democracy must provide an appropriate and prominent place in its society for NGOs. Commissioner, I would like to bring to your attention a particular wish which I heard while staying in Montenegro and speaking to its politicians there. It is important that relations between Montenegro and Serbia evolve without Serbia attempting to interfere with its neighbour’s development through ethnic Serbian parties. That school of thought has already done great damage in the history of south-eastern Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As previous speakers have said, I would also like Montenegro to move forward with negotiations and I hope the delay will not be too long. I am happy also to hear from the Hungarian Presidency that they are strong supporters in the enlargement process. So I hope there will be progress this year, at the latest, following the progress report. Montenegro has achieved a lot in the past and in recent years, but there are still quite a few areas of concern. I would like to mention three: fighting corruption, discrimination and ecological issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fight against corruption and organised crime, I am glad that in this report, we also demand from the state authorities that they refrain from pressurising NGOs and civil society organisations that investigate corruption and organised crime. They should be free to do their work and support the state in removing corruption and organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is anti-discrimination. There are still lots of groups where, despite good legislation, anti-discrimination is not working: Roma, Ashkaeli and Egyptians, LGBT people; we should also mention gender equality on International Women’s Day.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on ecological issues, Montenegro defines itself in its constitution as an ecological state, which is great. The problem is, despite the beautiful coast and mountains, if good transparent progress is not made by having environmental assessments, then this beautiful countryside is in danger of being destroyed. So, I hope that this country will move forward, involve civil society, and have transparent processes in its ecological areas, especially hydro-electric power plants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In common with the other former Yugoslav republics, it has had to cope with the collapse of Communism, coming together with the collapse of the state, the war that followed, and then having to build a new system on the ruins of the old.</p>
<p class="contents">This is no easy task and some of the negative features of the previous system have lived on in new guises. What is important, however, is the emergence of a younger élite that has committed itself to a European future, in which it was certainly helped by the unsuccessful union with Serbia. Problems remain, of course. We have heard about some of these, the usual ones that former Communist states have had to cope with: corruption, criminality, abuses in the administration of justice, a not particularly efficient public service, and the like.</p>
<p class="contents">The remedying of these and parallel flaws in the political, economic, legal and administrative systems will require a major effort on the part of the leadership, and it should be prepared for both active and passive resistance from the beneficiaries of the existing system. Every former Communist country has had to face analogous difficulties. The determination of both élites and public opinion to offer a European future is probably the single most important factor ensuring Montenegro’s eventual accession to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From an economic perspective, the country has achieved a certain level of macro-economic stability, and has also advanced successfully in the sense of fulfilling the political criteria set out at the Copenhagen Summit, or the Copenhagen sitting of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must bring more pressure to bear, especially in the area of strengthening the rule of law – including reforms to the judiciary – and it is also essential to continue the ongoing effort in the fight against corruption and organised crime. It is also desirable to see progress in the reform of the public administration and electoral reform, and a stronger role for parliament</p>
<p class="contents">Emphasis must be placed on the implementation of freedom of expression and media freedom. It would also be appropriate to cooperate with civil society, and to try and address discrimination and the social and economic integration of minority groups in the population, including the Roma. Regional cooperation and correct neighbourly relations are undoubtedly one of the other preconditions for a successful Euro-integration process.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Montenegro has made a considerable effort in the attempt to fulfil the criteria set out for successful integration into the European Union, and it is therefore time to consider granting candidate country status.

Montenegro is a major hope for the process of European Union enlargement across the Western Balkans.

The critics are not Montenegro’s enemies, the independent media are not enemies, but a valuable asset for Montenegro. Obviously, combating corruption and organised crime remains key.

At the same time, I wish to mention how important it is to comply exactly with the Copenhagen criteria, which are key to the progress of EU integration. Although a great deal of progress has been made, the Montenegrin authorities still have reforms to implement in key sectors. For example, I feel obliged to mention the report from the Commission on the spread of corruption and illegal tax transactions. With this in mind, the most important measure is to create a specialist structure for combating these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the rights of minorities, and I am referring here, in particular, to those of the Roma, still do not have the necessary legislative basis. The reference to the status of minorities in the fundamental law, together with their rights, will be a positive sign for European integration. I welcome the promotion of Montenegro as a state championing the green movement. One of the EU’s key objectives is environmental protection. On this point, I want to draw attention to the adverse impact which excessive, poorly managed tourism has. One consequence could be to extend the future accession negotiations.</p>

The political dialogue between this country and the EU institutions is at a very advanced stage, despite the fact that it has not been going on for long. Evidence of Montenegro’s high level of commitment and strong political will to make changes can be seen in the way that it has implemented reforms under the Bologna process, for example, or in the improvements it has made to the functioning of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">As emerges from the Commission communication on Montenegro’s application, however, continuing high levels of unemployment point to a discrepancy between the skills which are available and those which are required, thus revealing the education system’s weak points. Montenegro should therefore make every effort to ensure that all social groups, including those at risk of social exclusion, have the opportunity to receive high quality general education and training, in order to equip its citizens with skills which increase their chances of employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is a European dimension, demonstrating that the principles and values governing the European Union’s actions are still attractive to the rest of Europe. The second dimension relates to the Balkans, since this process shows the other Balkan states what path they can, and indeed should, follow.

<p class="contents">The social and political changes that have taken place in Montenegro in recent years are a positive sign not only for the EU, but also for the country’s neighbours. The Montenegrin Government has also won plaudits from the UN over the broad spectrum of problems it has managed to address. According to the United Nations Development Programme report, Montenegro is capable of fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty, universal primary education and a reduction in infant mortality, by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">Montenegrin premier, Igor Lukšič, stated during his recent visit to Brussels that Montenegro’s priorities are EU and NATO membership. I therefore personally consider Montenegro’s efforts enormously important, and I fully support the assistance and aid which the EU is providing to the country, and I believe that this country will join the EU in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Montenegro is at the start of a journey which will neither be easy nor simple, but it has a prospect of accession and a road map, and it can benefit from the experience of the countries in the region which have completed the path of accession not very long ago. It is important that the next country report is positive and allows accession negotiations to actually begin.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union has successfully made a crucial contribution to the process of reconciliation in the former Yugoslavia. Once all the states formed from the disintegration of the Yugoslav Federation have been admitted to the European Union, this will also close the final wounds of a violent past, which is still an issue for the entire European community.

Instead, we have seen an increase in economic migrants. In this context, information campaigns in these countries are undoubtedly important, so that we can make it clear that a visitor’s visa is not the equivalent of asylum or a job in the EU. The fact that the EU had to exert pressure to close the so-called travel agencies which specialised in emigration to the EU demonstrates the lack of awareness of the problem. We will have to wait and see how effective the planned early warning system for mass movements relating to the Roma problem will be.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people seem to believe that their future does not lie in their home countries in the Balkans, such as Montenegro, but want to make use of their newly acquired freedom of travel to enter the EU illegally. However, they do not have the right to access Europe’s social security systems.</p>

<p class="contents">The country has now entered a decisive stage. Tangible results are needed in order for Montenegro to be able to move to the next stage of European integration. The momentum created by candidate status should not be lost; reforms should be pursued with determination.

The pace of Montenegro’s progress towards European Union membership depends on its own achievements, and that should explain my hesitation in prejudging an enlargement calendar as many of you have invited me to do.

It is encouraging to see that the European Parliament continues to support with all its heart Montenegro’s European integration efforts. I would like to reassure you that the concerns and tasks you mentioned during this debate are on the agenda of the ongoing dialogue between the EU institutions on the European perspective of Montenegro, and we are making every effort to address them properly.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been multiple mentions and questions as to what happens in the time between the granting of candidate status and the commencement of the accession negotiations, that is, why we are not beginning the negotiations immediately, without delay. Perhaps you, too, are aware, and both the Commissioner and I have mentioned it, that now that Montenegro has obtained the status of candidate country, the Commission has set out conditions it must fulfil. There are seven such conditions, including the rule of law, taking action against organised crime, the fight against corruption, etc., and the Commission will evaluate the progress made in these areas, which will then be tabled before the Council in autumn, after which we will be able to decide whether we have reached a stage where we can launch the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, thank you for this debate and I believe that this, too, proves that the European Parliament is ready to send out a positive signal to the Western Balkans region. A signal which proves that the enlargement process is under way, that it still exists, and that it needs to be credible. This means that the progress made with each country in the region is based on a personalised approach and is performance-related. In the case of Montenegro, this refers to what has been said here; in the case of Serbia, it means that the answers to the questionnaire received have been prepared and will now be evaluated by the Commission; and in the case of Croatia, it means that the country must finish its homework and prepare in every possible way to ensure that the negotiations can be concluded during the term of the Hungarian Presidency. This way, the process remains credible and we can ensure that our immediate neighbours, these true European countries, remain on the right track, and that they will ultimately be able to join the EU once they have reached the appropriate stage of preparedness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If you will allow me a personal comment, this is the place and time where I have to thank my colleagues in the office, my political advisor in the LIBE Committee who has been behind this strategy for years, and my head of cabinet in the last few years who has fought with me.</p>
<p class="contents">I also owe gratitude to my family who allowed me to be in the forefront of this fight, a fight which has, in the end, produced a result. We have an agreement spanning six political groups, 27 Member States and five very important parliamentary committees. In this way, I believe we are able to send a message to the Commission, the Council and the Member States that must be reckoned with and we have therefore made a great step towards an EU-level effort to alleviate the poverty and social exclusion of our continent’s largest ethnic minority.</p>
<p class="contents">A significant proportion of European Roma face such substandard conditions – almost totally disconnected from the economy resulting in their exclusion from basic human rights – that fostering social inclusion cannot be viewed within the framework of general policy ratification but must be handled as bridging one of the most enormous gaps in the fulfilment of constitutional and human rights in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU-level effort to alleviate the poverty and social exclusion of European Roma must therefore place its primary emphasis on the fulfilment and promotion of the fundamental rights to employment, housing, healthcare and education.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly outline the most important principles and recommendations of my report. Above all, the strategy must be an internal EU strategy, the general oversight of priority areas and objectives must therefore be within the Community structures and it should in no way be divisive for the EU, creating splits among the Member States. On the contrary; establishing a new body to coordinate and supervise the strategy would be unnecessary and would create a wasteful overhead.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of supervising, coordinating and monitoring must therefore be fulfilled by the Commission and, to this end, it would be worth considering retaining the Roma task force as a permanent body.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should report annually on the progress of the strategy, evaluate the results and submit its upgrading proposals to the Council. In this regard, the European Roma strategy scoreboard, a mechanism similar to the single market scoreboard, could be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">The appointment of an administrative body or a government official to be the national contact point for the implementation of the strategy’s objectives, and furthermore to act as a source of advice and reflection for the Commission supervisory strategy, would also bring significant practical benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy must also take into account the territoriality of exclusion since the geographic distribution of social disadvantages is not uniform throughout the Member States, but poverty and social exclusion are concentrated in underdeveloped micro-regions, which, in many of the new Member States, are predominantly inhabited by the Roma community.</p>
<p class="contents">Common, comparable and reliable indicators are essential to present a realistic analysis of progress and to meet the requirements of effective monitoring. I recommend adopting the Laeken indicators and their complementary components to measure social and territorial exclusion, as well as to evaluate progress.</p>
<p class="contents">An all-European crisis map is necessary to measure and identify the micro-regions by their distinctive attributes.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of the cohesion budget should be set aside in the next multiannual financial framework in a performance reserve for the strategy. This could provide vital resources and devise incentives for implementation by allocating funds on a competitive basis defined by the criterion of how the proposed project or intervention supports and implements the objectives of the strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">This way, on the one hand, we could depart from the general practice of large contributions maximising their returns from the unabsorbed funds and, on the other hand, a direct link could be created between the allocation of financing and the reproduction of results.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the principles and the priorities that I believe the European Roma strategy must sustain and I am looking forward to your comments on my report.</p>

<p class="contents">Let us not forget what is at stake here. We are talking about the life chances of millions of our fellow European citizens who have the right to the same opportunities as everyone else, and our societies cannot afford to ignore the potential that lies in them. Therefore, please allow me to congratulate you on the excellent draft resolution you are about to adopt, and which I strongly support. We share your ambition to ensure that promises are followed by deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">On 8 April, the International Day of the Roma is celebrated worldwide. On that day, the Hungarian Presidency will be organising the fifth meeting of the Integrated European Platform for Roma Inclusion in Budapest, which I am sure many of you will also be attending. As a central feature of this event, the Commission will present its strategic communication on the subject, and we ask Mrs Járóka to present the main points of the resolution there.</p>
<p class="contents">After that, the Hungarian Presidency will draw up draft Council conclusions, which we hope the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will adopt at its meeting on 19 May. These conclusions will exclusively deal with the issue of Roma integration, and we will endeavour to strengthen cooperation between the EU and its Member States in respect of the economic and social integration of the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, we are planning to organise exchanges of views on the Commission’s ideas in other Council formations as well, and at the end of May, the General Affairs Council will hold a policy debate in preparation for the June meeting of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for us to be able to make progress, we must set aside all stereotypes, generalisations and prejudices. We must be aware that the living conditions of the Roma are far from being homogenous everywhere. Moreover, we must keep in mind the historic reasons for their social exclusion. The benefits of the political changeover and the transition to a market economy that took place in Central and Eastern Europe are not enjoyed to an equal degree by all citizens. A large number of Roma drifted to the periphery of society in this very period of the past 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, it is particularly important that we firmly condemn acts of aggression inspired by racist motivations, whoever the perpetrator is. In a difficult economic situation, the vulnerable become even more so, and often seek the reasons for their misery in each other. However, we possess shared values and means to defend them, as it has been more than ten years now since the Council adopted its directives prohibiting racial discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the fact that special emphasis has been placed on the elimination of segregation. Segregation forms a vicious circle and creates fault lines within societies. I am also very pleased that the resolution covers gender equality as well. Let me remind you of an earlier resolution Parliament adopted in 2006, which deals with the situation of Roma women. All women must be allowed to put their abilities to good use. We need more Roma women in decision making as well. Ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur for this subject, Mrs Lívia Járóka, can inspire us all in this regard as well – particularly the women, but also the men.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to thank Mrs Járóka and all of you for participating in this vital process, and I would like to remind you once more that the Hungarian Presidency is determined to achieve substantial results in this area. I ask all of you to assist with this effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The social and economic integration of Roma is, I think, a moral obligation, but also, as Parliament’s report rightly pointed out, an economic interest of our European societies. It is a priority for the EU and it needs commitment and the joint efforts of national and local authorities, civil society and the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Ms Lívia Járóka on the wonderful work she has been doing. She has been doing it by trying to integrate the whole House and getting a paper proposal which represents the meaningful input of parliamentarians from all political parties, and I think that is a real achievement. This will help us, Ms Járóka, to keep Roma inclusion high on the political agenda. It will help us to take the necessary steps to improve the situation of the Roma people and their social and economic integration into society.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to update you on where we stand. As you might remember, on 7 April 2010, the Commission adopted a communication on the social and economic integration of Roma in Europe, which was the first ever policy document dedicated specifically to Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication contained a concrete list of actions to help Member States make their policies for Roma integration more effective and to define the main challenges ahead: discrimination, poverty, low educational achievement, labour market barriers, housing, segregation, and so on. Then came the assessment of the Commission’s internal Roma Task Force, which was set up on 7 September 2010, and which very clearly showed that there is no evidence that strong and proportionate measures are in place in the Member States to tackle the social and economic problems of a large part of the EU’s Roma population.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation is neither acceptable nor sustainable and therefore, the Commission is working on an EU framework for national Roma integration strategies which it will present in early April. This House has called for an EU strategy and the Commission is responding to this request. We all agree, I think, that we need effective policy planning and implementation, that we need a strategic approach. We also agree, I think, that the primary responsibility for Roma populations lies with the Member States in which these Roma populations are moving, and it is for that reason that the Commission is drawing up this EU framework combined with national Roma integration strategies, because we need both: we need to know where we are all going together and we need to know where each individual Member State will go in order to adapt specific policies to the problems of the Roma in that Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU framework to be presented in April will build on your resolution, Ms Járóka, on the work of the Commission’s Roma Task Force and, of course, on the wide range of contributions received from Member States and from civil society. There is a need for concrete actions, for clear commitments, to make better use of the range of legal and financial instruments available in order to achieve a breakthrough. I will not speak for long on this, because my colleague, Mr Andor, is responsible for this dossier, but the Europe 2020 strategy leads to a new path for persistent economic and social actions for those who are marginalised and we know that poverty is a very big problem in Europe’s largest minority. Here, determined action is needed both at national and EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also considers that it is very important to learn from the lessons of the past and to make sure that the efforts of all stakeholders, at all levels from the EU down to the local level, are very well coordinated. For this coordination work, we do have the European platform for Roma inclusion, which is a unique mechanism for involving the stakeholders. I think it would be important to reinforce the role of this platform in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I also heard with great interest Parliament’s proposal to have a national contact point and we will consider this when we prepare the EU framework. I would also like to assure you that in drawing up the framework, the Commission will pay special attention to the need to monitor developments and follow the process and the progress on the ground, and here I appeal to Parliament. This must not be a case of a very good report by Parliament and then an interesting framework from the European Union; this must be a work in progress and a measured work in progress, a monitored work in progress, so that we can see where we are going in future and, in this regard, we will continue to work closely with the Member States and with this Parliament, as well as with all the stakeholders.</p>

<p class="contents">The report is both helpful and encouraging. It is helpful because it contributes to the ongoing debate on how to further the integration of Roma people into the economy and society. It is encouraging because it shows that the Commission and Parliament have moved in the same direction and that our views on the way forward largely coincide.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission agrees that the Roma issue is one of the most important strategic challenges that Europe faces and, at the same time, it provides one of the most promising opportunities for the continent. When we speak of opportunities, we also mean economic opportunities. There is indeed a social and economic necessity coupled here with a moral imperative.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Parliament’s report makes a convincing case for the need to adopt a holistic approach to tackling the socio-economic situation of the Roma. It suggests focusing on a number of priority areas, such as education, employment, housing and healthcare. These are indeed areas of critical importance for the successful integration of the Roma people.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I welcome the focus in the report on the importance of using EU funds in the most appropriate way. It is essential to underpin policies with sufficient financial resources. Although we have made progress in this area, more needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I agree with Parliament that we need to put in place a strong mechanism to monitor national strategies for Roma integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have taken good note that the report advocates focusing on the territorial dimension of poverty and, in particular, in underdeveloped micro-regions. The Commission will carefully look into this interesting proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that a number of Member States will not be able to make sufficient progress towards the Europe 2020 targets unless they take concrete steps to improve Roma integration. It is, therefore, high time for determined action at both national and EU level. Although Member States are primarily responsible for designing and implementing Roma integration strategies, the EU can indeed support them. We need to ensure that efforts at all levels are part of a coherent and consistent policy framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies – which, as the Vice-President has already said, the Commission will present in April – will provide the opportunity for the EU institutions and all stakeholders to join forces and make a tangible difference to the lives of Roma people in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 2009, József B and his wife were sentenced by a Hungarian court to 10 months’ imprisonment for the endangerment of minors. Their crime was that their two children did not attend school. While they had gone to school, however, the children had been sent home regularly because they turned up in muddy shoes and covered with dirt. In the Gipsy colony where they live, there are no paved roads, and so every day, the children had to cross a meadow and by the time they got to the school, their feet were covered in mud. They endured the humiliation of being scolded and sent home for as long as they could, and eventually chose to avoid school more and more often, for which their parents were sentenced to prison.</p>
<p class="contents">The children of József B and his wife did not miss school because they did not want to learn. Rather, it was their circumstances that did not allow them to learn. Without appropriate clothing and shoes, water and electricity at home, and without school supplies, they did not have a chance to finish even primary school. Helping communities with multiple disadvantages to catch up is a complex process, which can only be achieved step by step, in keeping with local needs and over the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe can assist in this by setting goals based on real data, providing the necessary tools, calling the Member States to account for the accomplishment of the goals set, and monitoring the changes in the situation of the Roma. It is also designing less bureaucratic, quicker and more transparent methods than before, thereby supporting individual communities in the long run until they can truly provide for their own needs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough to build a school for the children of József B. They also need work to make a living, and the parents need to be able to feed and clothe their children and have them educated. Suitable housing conditions are required, where children can prepare for class, and where they have lighting and heating. Passable roads are required, which provide access to school and the workplace. And there is also a need for compassionate words, which can efface the humiliations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Roma strategy will not bring about immediate change, but will give an opportunity for change. The real question is whether we can create rules and conditions which can help those who are unable to compete for resources and who barely have the capacity to assert their own interests. Non-discrimination must be guaranteed, and not only in the labour market but in all areas of social life as well. Segregation in towns and schools must be eliminated, real opportunities must be created and Roma communities must be involved at European, Member State and local levels. And, above all, political commitment is required from everyone who can contribute to the improvement of the current situation at European level as well.</p>

The integration of the roughly 12 million Roma in the European Union cannot be achieved without the desire to do so from both the Roma and the majority in the relevant Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for the Roma population’s integration lies with both Member States and the European Union. European resources must be used to improve the engineering infrastructure, build new homes or repair existing ones, provide better education and improve access to the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no general solution which can be applied in the same way everywhere. Different approaches may be required even within one Member State, in its different regions. I believe that the beneficiaries of European funds should be involved in building their own home or environment so that they feel a sense of commitment to the solidarity which has been shown to them and they then obviously become good householders.</p>
<p class="contents">The political establishment and business community must rediscover the Roma and ensure better access for them to the labour market so that they can contribute to the European Union’s economic development and prosperity. I truly hope that this report will be properly implemented and will help improve the Roma’s social and economic integration on our continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I myself was rapporteur for this Committee, we agreed very strongly there and then that this was a matter of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We have 10 to 12 million Roma in the EU, of which they are full members. They must also have full rights: human rights in the proper sense of the word. That also means that they can participate in the decision making of societies and in the European decision­making process.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look to the future, we know that education is the key issue. Education is also the right way to integrate the Roma minority into society and encourage them to be active. Things need to be improved rapidly, with regard, for example, to housing and infrastructure. Above all, it is most important to emphasise the need for a change in attitudes among us other Europeans. Segregation and discrimination need to be eliminated. We have to create proper opportunities and understand that every child and young Roma person is a unique individual, a unique citizen of the European Union, just like all the rest of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union must face up to the reality of the Roma problem, one which is dictated by the Roma’s economic situation in general, but especially by aspects of their own tradition: nomadic lifestyle and low education level and, by extension, a lack of professional qualifications. Education represents an opportunity to gain a qualification, a profession and a job, which is an absolutely essential step towards Roma social integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Responsibility for integration does not lie entirely with the authorities. The Roma community needs to understand that it has to make the necessary efforts and that it has to really want to become integrated into society, regardless of country of origin or residence. The priority areas covered by the strategy must include increasing the level of civic education, adapting the Roma population’s culture and traditions to modern society and promoting vocational training and retraining. I think that these areas, in addition to education, must be key objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States of origin must make the biggest contribution to the integration process, but an EU approach also has an extremely important role to play. The future strategy devised by the Commission must propose framework programmes adapted to the nomadic lifestyle of some of the Roma community, which will be developed and implemented in a similar manner in all Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is hard to imagine the way in which these people live in some European capitals. This is a vicious circle from which it is very difficult for them to escape.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to both Commissioners for mentioning the issue of poverty. I believe that the struggle on behalf of the Roma is, above all, a struggle against poverty and not only amongst the Roma. We must make sure that we do not create a new divide, where the poor people outside the Roma communities are critical of the fact that the Roma are suddenly receiving large amounts of money or a great deal of attention. We need to make sure that this is a joint struggle which, of course, also aims to combat all forms of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts made on a local level are also important. Very often, it is the case that a lot is done by communities or regions, but unfortunately, not always with the support of the national government. We need to find a way to introduce European funding at a local level. Therefore, we have drawn up an alternative resolution, which I will be speaking about shortly. This resolution has been introduced mainly at the suggestion of Mr Enciu, who will also be explaining his position on this subject, in order to highlight the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission can come up with a good Roma strategy. As both Commissioners have rightly said, this is all about a process for monitoring the situation and providing support. In their words, it is work in progress. We need to find out what really happens to the funding, because for too long, we have sat by and watched while very little has been done. I do not want to say that nothing has happened, but it has certainly been far too little and the funds have not been put to the best possible use.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish the Hungarian Presidency every success. We will give you our full support on this issue, so that we can produce a new strategy and so that you can say that this is one of the successful achievements of your Presidency. You have our support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank Mrs Járóka for her excellent report. Because we want to support her report, we will be withdrawing our alternative resolution. We simply wanted to highlight the problem relating to local authorities and communities. However, we also want to support Mrs Járóka’s report as a clear statement from the European Parliament.</p>

In my view, this is not necessarily a moment of celebration: I prefer to see it as a moment when we have to be wise and to look at what we have achieved so far and what we want to achieve in the future. However, because I am aware of the huge amount of work that has been put into this report, please allow me to congratulate and thank not only the rapporteur and the other Members involved, but also the staff of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and our policy advisers.</p>
<p class="contents">When we first began discussing this issue, we were all hoping that the Union was actually moving towards an EU strategy on Roma inclusion. Instead, we will have a framework, and then the Member States will decide whether or not to draw up their own strategies. I am afraid, given past experience – and please allow me to be pessimistic here – that this may be a process that is very much money driven, funding driven. In my view, people in the developed countries ‘discovered’ the Roma not necessarily because they recognised the bad conditions in which Roma were living in their countries of origin, but because they were bothered by the presence of Roma in the streets and on the margins of cities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about more than funding. It is very much about the basic human rights of this population group. The Commissioner spoke of work in progress. I hope that we shall see not only work but also some real progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, this communication from the Commission has been eagerly awaited by the Roma themselves, of course, and by all their supporters and anyone who attaches importance to the European Union’s fundamental values.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will therefore have to develop a framework, a European strategy, for the national action plans. Its responsibility will extend far beyond the development of this European framework for the national action plans, because the Member States will make progress on this subject only if they are given a strong incentive by the Commission to commit themselves to it. This will require – as the report explains very well – an extremely precise evaluation of the results obtained, with the use of benchmark criteria and indicators. It will also require the involvement of all interested parties and Roma communities in the first instance. I believe that it is very important to make the connection with the Council of Europe’s programme on the training of Roma mediators. This is an essential condition if the inclusion projects are to be crowned with success at regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the European Commission also needs to get involved through its own projects, run by itself, pilot projects – that is what this report proposes – which could be run, for example, in the micro-regions that we have spoken about, so that exemplary, remarkable projects can convince all interested parties to become involved in this inclusion process.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, then, that the European Commission should also be able to use its right to officially complain when the values, European legislation and national action plans are not as they should be, bearing in mind equal access to all rights, non-discrimination and freedom of movement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only when we implement a uniform strategy of this kind will it be possible for the Roma and Sinti living in the EU to be treated as equal EU citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What is it all about? It is about guaranteeing free movement for everyone. It is about abolishing Roma special schools immediately and, if I can express it like this, ending the apartheid system for Roma in Europe. It is about equal access to education, healthcare and social services. We are not doing these people a favour. We are granting them their legal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left strongly reject the idea of a separate policy for Roma and Sinti. We need a policy which takes an integrative approach right from the start and which compensates for the disadvantages suffered by Roma and Sinti, for example, in relation to access to work, the right to settle or the use of EU funding. There is, though, one thing I would like to add. None of this will have any effect unless we resolve one problem which involves combating racism and the stigmatisation of Roma and Sinti throughout Europe. We must see this as one of Europe’s central tasks and take ruthless measures to combat discrimination. We must not tolerate a two-faced approach among the Member States and in the EU as a whole.

This report seems to be a little unbalanced, because so many paragraphs call for support for the Roma, be they men, women, children, the elderly (...). None of them call for any measures to severely punish those Roma who show anti-social behaviour, for example. Who stops Roma children going to school, if it is not certain Roma parents?</p>

Every time a Roma horse dealer tried to charge an extra couple of euro a leg, out would jump a bowler-hatted tax-gatherer and sinner and demand one of the poor animal’s limbs as tribute to President Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">When the time for the debate on the EU strategy on the Atlantic arrived, I fully expected it to be proposed that a stretch of that ocean should be reserved for the water-borne branch of that noble tribe. They might sell fish hooks to passing boats and promise to cover hulls with a quantity of tarmacadam that they just had left over.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should find a particular member of the Roma, preferably with disabilities and conflicting sexualities. We could then make this person president of the Commission. He would start by selling this place off and nobody would dare to complain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Her many years of work have reached an important milestone today. After a long struggle, it has now become clear that the issue of the Roma is a European issue, and this holds true even if – as my fellow Member, Mr Borghezio pointed out – we must look for the solutions at Member State level. However, a single European area indeed requires a single strategy, too. We cannot approach the Roma strategy solely from a cultural perspective. This is not just a minority issue. Similarly, it cannot be solved solely by means of social policy. It is therefore important for the strategy to include comprehensive and targeted measures, and formulate focused objectives. Of the key areas of the strategy, education and access to education must be highlighted. The reason for this is that education is a fundamental aspect of employability. In several Member States, there is a large number of Roma groups caught in the trap of poverty, and there will never be a sufficient number of jobs for them, because without qualifications, they are essentially unemployable. The training of Roma girls merits special attention, because it would appear that they tend to become early school leavers more often, and also because girls are exploited to a much greater extent in work at home. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats has been involved with this issue for a very long time. In the past eight months alone, our working group has visited almost all of the Member States where the Roma situation is often very complicated indeed. We were able to visit not only settlements where Roma live in extremely poor conditions, but also to see some good examples. This includes examples where there has been very good cooperation at the local authority level with the Roma living in these settlements, and we also saw good examples where local politicians had made a real effort to resolve the situation to the benefit of the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">Our problem is that we also encounter enormous levels of prejudice in our societies – and I mean now in those Member States where the problems with Roma are perhaps worse than in other Member States. These are the prejudices of the majority section of the population, and I therefore believe that any action plan that you submit to us, Commissioner, will have to include a way to tackle this huge level of prejudice on the part of the majority population, to explain to the majority section of society that help for the Roma and the inclusion of the Roma in society benefits not only the Roma but the whole of society, and therefore the majority as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Hungary, where the Roma currently make up around 6% to 8% of the population, they will exceed 50% of the working population by 2050. Of course, this makes it all the worse that the life of the Roma in the EU is characterised, as it always has been, by unemployment, a level of education that is well below average, organised crime and prostitution, as well as a retreat into a parallel society.</p>
<p class="contents">This report addresses a few of the problems, but in a one-sided way. Integration is not a one-way street. The Roma must make a contribution to all of this. They must send their children to school and become integrated into the labour market. Women in Roma communities, which have old-fashioned structures, are often in a particularly poor situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Their lack of education and their exclusion from the labour market, which will only become worse unless we act now, will exacerbate even further the integration problems caused by demographic changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is an excellent report because, of course, it condemns any kind of discrimination or racism against the Roma, and we like it because it promotes true integration by taking an admirable cultural approach. We like it because it not only sets out rights but also highlights certain needs.</p>
<p class="contents">We also dealt with it in the opinion that we gave as the Committee on Culture and Education. I am thinking, in particular, about the whole part relating to schooling for Roma children, in which we point out that schooling is both a right and a duty, in which the children’s families must also be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that the future strategy for the Roma minority should focus on education as the core instrument for promoting social inclusion. Alongside the promotion of Roma culture, it is also important to recognise that the Roma should make an effort to learn about the customs and culture of the peoples with whom they live, so as to facilitate real integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the only thing missing in this report is a reference to Directive 2004/38/EC on the free movement of EU citizens. In this regard, we have been waiting for a long time for the Commission to give us an interpretation of how to put it into practice, and we now need to know what it is right and fair to expect the Member States to do.

However, I want to point out that the reason for the failure of Roma integration policies hitherto has not been for the want of strategies, published plans or even funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Proper integration can only be achieved through involving the Roma community, the Roma themselves, in other words, those people who, along with the local authorities, have the ability and, in particular, the desire to implement the programmes. Who is better aware of this community’s deep-rooted problems, if not the community itself? Not to mention the local administration which handles the problems on a day-to-day basis. Implementation of the future strategy must be based on structured dialogue and cooperation between the Roma communities, the local authorities and the non-governmental sector. Roma must switch from the role of spectators to the role of players involved in turning these measures intended for them into a reality.

You have worked very hard on it and you have also taken us on a number of visits to the area in Hungary where you come from. Since then, the Committee on Regional Policy has been to Romania in order to witness the situation on the ground there. Doing that really allows you to see the state of things. You are given a warm welcome and people play music, but there is also another side to it: the backwardness and lack of integration. For those reasons, I, as rapporteur, addressed that change at the beginning of last year in the Regional Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now possible to allocate 4% of regional funds to housing for vulnerable groups, in this case, the Roma. We must admit that the funding falls short of what is necessary and that the programmes are not primarily benefiting the Roma’s housing needs. Now, that is really crazy. Europe is offering opportunities but, on the other hand, no one is making use of them. That also applies to the Social Fund. We should definitely conduct that debate together.</p>
<p class="contents">During the upcoming meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, the Romanian Udrea will come to discuss this with us. The Committee framework will offer the opportunity for greater governance when countries fail to support regions and local authorities. I, indeed, have a lot of expectations on that score. Sometimes you even have to resort to coercion, if the usual arguments do not work. Your pilot projects would be a very good set-up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, however, we must be realistic and realise how many documents we have about the Roma situation which are not always reflected in the concrete results visible on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Officially, none of the Member States have any legislative obstacles or discriminatory policies, implicitly or explicitly, which will affect the Roma. However, forms of discrimination do exist and have been alluded to in this Chamber, if we refer to the values declared and adopted by the European Union. We must also acknowledge that there are cultural differences which sometimes seem irreconcilable. I believe that, more than any other policy aimed at social integration, education is the most powerful instrument for improving this community’s situation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must bear in mind the particular characteristics of this ethnic group, which, on quite a few occasions, are the cause of their problems. For example, Romania has implemented positive discrimination mechanisms, which includes reserving special places in secondary schools and university faculties. However, many of these places, funded by public money, have disappointingly not been taken up.</p>
<p class="contents">The report puts forward important and necessary measures. I hope that they will be implemented by all Member State governments. At the same time, cooperation is required from the Roma community, which must assume its responsibility and change its situation for the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission should draft a strategy with reference to them, one that would supplement and support the Member States’ own actions, because it is the Member States that have, and will continue to have in the future, the main responsibility for their own citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Any future strategy must be built on a comprehensive and concrete approach and cooperation between the Commission, the Member States and, in particular, Roma organisations. My own country, Finland, has been prepared to offer its own national Roma strategy for common use. It is also vitally important that the Roma should be able to participate in, and actually influence, the planning of measures aimed at improving their position. They must not become objects of policy managed from on high.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor will any short­term project to improve the socio-economic status of the Roma produce any structural social changes, and so the implementation of Roma policy must be closely linked to national developments in different areas of life. Similarly, the EU’s financial systems must be closely tied to peer review processes. I would finally like to propose to the Commission the notion that the monitoring of Roma policy should itself have a permanent monitoring system. We need to develop a monitoring system for the Member States for the implementation of Roma issues, one that would have a permanent structure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to approach today’s debate from the perspective of children, because today, all children in Europe should be guaranteed access, in practice as well, to opportunities and upward mobility, whether it be children belonging to a majority community or to a minority one. This means that all children should be given the chance of physical and mental development, which involves daily warm meals just as much as the right to education.</p>
<p class="contents">All this, which should, of course, exist today as rights of children, including Roma children, should, on the other hand, exist as obligations and responsibilities of the state and, I stress, of parents. Today, the percentage of children living with multiple disadvantages in extreme poverty is 19% at EU level, and a sizeable proportion of these children are Roma. Using the Járóka report as its basis, a EU level Roma strategy must therefore strengthen Member States’ and social solidarity, for example, by means of crisis maps, and must also encourage local initiatives. It is, after all, in the interest of us all to prove that it is possible to change our attitude to our environment. I welcome the fact that the Hungarian Presidency treats the development of this Roma strategy as one of its foremost priorities and is in close cooperation with Mrs Járóka on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this does not mean that this phenomenon had not been well known even before that. I myself live in a Member State, Romania, where the otherwise diverse Roma community has lived side by side with Romanians and Hungarians for decades. Although these relations were never entirely free of frictions, tensions have increased over the two decades since the fall of communism. In the former communist countries, it was, in fact, the Roma who were the greatest losers of the transition to a market economy, because the types of activities from which these communities had traditionally been making a living disappeared or have been on the wane. We have a shared responsibility; all of us are responsible, but the Roma communities are responsible for their own fates as well, and so is Europe for not having acknowledged the problem until now. The key message of Mrs Járóka’s report is that the prohibition and complete elimination of discrimination is far from being enough to solve this, I repeat, European problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, national minorities could be integrated effectively on the basis of the mutual shared, but asymmetric, responsibility of the majority and the minority.

At the same time, we must utilise the particular qualities of the Roma population, their customs, culture and traditional handicrafts.</p>

I believe the Commission will benefit a great deal in the run-up to the delivery of the European framework, and it means a lot to me personally when we develop the future cohesion policy, especially the future of the European Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand from this discussion that we have to go forward with simplification. We have to go forward with making more room in the ESF for social inclusion. We have to develop a territorial approach that suits the specific social conditions of the regions where most Roma live, and we have to do more to create employment for unskilled or low skilled people.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, however, to clarify two things very briefly. Firstly, poverty plays a big role, but we should not believe that the situation of the Roma as a category is identical with that of poor people in general, because poverty and unemployment are much higher among the Roma than in mainstream society. That is why I believe Europe 2020 is a good framework and will help in developing the appropriate strategies, policies and financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we come to the question of why the Commission is working on a European framework as opposed to a European strategy as such. I have no time to elaborate on this, but it is simply because of the diversity of the reality on the ground. There is a common European problem but how it appears in various Member States, and how it should be translated into national strategies, differs from Romania to France or from Slovakia to Portugal, and we have to be aware of that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be taken into consideration in the elaboration of the work that the Commission is doing at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU framework for national Roma strategies will first be presented to the European Platform for Roma Inclusion because we need – as many parliamentarians have said – to include the Roma population in our work and for them to take on their responsibility. It is also very important – and here I look to the Presidency – that there will be a follow-up of the work we do in the coming months so that we can see how all the projects will be implemented in practice. I agree with the Members who said that the regional funds are unfortunately not utilised as they could be and I also agree with those who say that the local authorities are sometimes the ones who can best find a solution. We have to help them to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Free Movement Directive has been questioned by some Members. The analysis of the transposition by all Member States has been finalised. In 2010, we visited 21 Member States and six visits are planned.

This is the best possible timing, because in April, the Commission will publish its communication and we then wish to incorporate that communication into the work of the Council. This means that after the debates conducted in the competent Council formations, we will also ask for the support of the European Council in the adoption of the conclusions. That is to say, there must be commitment to the Roma issue at the highest level – at the level of Heads of State or Government, on the part of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add a few thoughts to the debate about the question whether we are dealing with an ethnic issue or rather with some sort of social or economic challenge. I would not, and cannot, resolve this debate. I believe that we are dealing with both and that it is important that we maintain both approaches. As Commissioner Andor has said, it is a social and economic issue in that extreme poverty still represents a general problem in many places in the EU Member States. At the same time, there is an ethnic discrimination of sorts within extreme poverty, and we must therefore pay special attention to the Roma when providing opportunities. However, if we do not provide any, there is no point in us demanding access, on a human rights basis, to the little to no opportunities, because then there is nothing to access. However, if we do provide opportunities, then in the process of creating them, we must pay attention that the Roma, too, have access to them and are not elbowed out.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we all need to take a new approach. It would be good if we could identify the opportunities inherent in this problem; if we could shift our perception of the Roma issue from problem to opportunity. Just imagine what a tremendous workforce base, what a workforce asset and potential this group of people, this crowd, has in terms of internal labour supply.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said on several occasions, improvements in education are the best investment. Indeed, education is investment in the future, and this is a key point when we are talking about people who are inactive, not just because they have no jobs and no opportunity to study, but who are inactive in a deeper sense of the word, because they have given up hope. They believe that they would not stand a chance anyway, and therefore no longer expect anything from life. Maybe they have reached a point where all they expect from the state is to provide them with aid. It is very important to enable these people to change from objects of these measures into subjects, and to participate in this themselves, as partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Little has been said today about good practices. I consider it important that we keep a record of good practices, and I believe it is just as important that we do the same with bad practices, because we can often learn more from the faults of bad practices than from good practices. I also believe that the examination of funds, the examination of the use of funds, and here I am referring to European Union funds, indicates the presence of both good and bad practices.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, it is indeed perhaps the most important task for us to convince the majority; to convince the non-Roma majority in Europe, that integration does not exclusively represent some sort of humanitarian dictate, but it is also in their fundamental interest. After all, Europe belongs to all of us, and the majority can only feel well if the minority feels well, too. Thank you very much for this debate and I trust that we can continue to count on your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank you very much for all your valuable comments. They reinforce my and my very good shadow rapporteurs’ view that political slogans will never become a reality without a proper legal basis, financial support and incentives as well as an EU mechanism to coordinate the actions of the stakeholders, ranging from local governments up to the Council and harnessing the advantages of multi-level governance. This will place the whole situation in a new light. I firmly believe that, on the basis of the tasks, objectives, principles and instruments defined by all the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and furthermore based on the shared competences as well as the supporting, coordinating and complementary actions of the Union, a very strong strategy on Roma inclusion can come into existence.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to express the hope I have formed, over the past six years, that the upcoming Commission Communication will be able to endorse these points and provide a very good basis on which the Hungarian Presidency can pledge its commitment to launching this European Roma strategy. I am very grateful for this. I am aware that this European strategy is not going to solve the problem; I know that a huge amount depends on us, the Roma. Words and promises mean nothing without actions outside of Brussels and in the Roma settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments and Roma must do what they have signed up to: take determined action to deliver tangible results. We understand our responsibility in this and we are fully in favour of our common partnership. This process for us Roma, and I believe for the whole European Union, is about much more than mutual trust. It is also about building a community of values that we can all share, and that we can all enjoy, to be able to really challenge the difficulties that we have been discussing here over the last six years. I thank you very much for all your support and I would like to join Renate Weber and the other shadow rapporteurs in thanking the secretariat of the Committee on Civil Liberties and all the advisers who, with us, have been fighting very hard for this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This includes the European Union strategy on Roma inclusion, initiated by the European Parliament. The inclusion of this ethnic group is not merely an obligation in terms of human rights, but also an economic necessity, and not only is it a moral imperative, but also in the strict financial interest of all the Member States. Moreover, given the extent of exclusion, the overall inclusion of Roma is essentially an issue of human rights. I would like to underline that by adopting a common strategy for the whole of Europe on Roma inclusion, we in the European Parliament are demonstrating that the European Union is not just leaving Roma integration problems to be addressed by the Member States themselves. As we have seen from recent events, these problems are impossible to solve purely at national level, and consequently there is a need for close cooperation between the European Union and the Member States. It is also very important for the European Commission and the Member States to mobilise existing EU strategies and measures and to coordinate actions, and find common ground in order to ensure the social and economic inclusion of Roma. The strategy will only be actively implemented once a common European approach on issues of European Roma integration has been found. Furthermore, we should involve representatives of the Roma community as much as possible in the process of drafting EU policy on Roma issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The nature of poverty has changed substantially over the last two decades in Central and South-Eastern Europe. The political and economic changes have led to the break-up of traditional communities, and the Roma have thereby lost the option of being mobile, and have become the most excluded and least educated subgroup in society. The Roma population has, moreover, displayed the typical trait of demographic growth. While the majority of society is ageing, the proportion of Roma in society is rising through high population growth. All this makes it clear that, unless employment levels can be increased among the Roma, and unless they are better integrated into the majority of society, the costs of maintaining the situation at a bearable level will constantly rise, including costs for social assistance and benefits, essential costs for education, additional costs for providing security, administrative costs for supervising social spending and also higher costs for healthcare. Roma integration is therefore not merely a moral duty and a duty in terms of human rights protection but, above all, an economic necessity as well. Most of the measures implemented so far are so-called legally unenforceable regulations. However, if there is to be progress in this matter, the EU strategy on Roma inclusion must go beyond this so-called soft law and must be included in the instruments established through primary law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The biggest barrier to Roma inclusion with the majority society is poverty and low levels of education. Education is the key to raising living standards and to the constantly sought-for creation of civil society. Job creation is extremely difficult and, as a member of numerous youth organisations, I know what the current situation is for young people on the labour market. The situation is many times worse among the Roma population, resulting in the marginalisation of the Roma and increased criminality, which only further exacerbates the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not so long ago that France deported the Bulgarian and Romanian Roma. These actions came under scrutiny not only because of a suspected breach of basic human rights, but also EU regulations.

I agree with a number of my fellow Members who said that it is very important to create a strategy on Roma inclusion at European level. In every Member State, we have excellent examples of how we should reduce Roma exclusion in various areas: education, culture, employment, healthcare or even Roma participation in political and civil life. However, such initiatives are not visible enough. In my opinion, the European Union would therefore be an appropriate platform to improve cooperation between the Member States, to pool and disseminate good practice and experience, or to provide funding. Although the EU level is very important, I believe that the most effective results can be achieved by acting at local or regional level. Only in specific localities or towns will we gain a better understanding of those areas’ problems, needs and social environment and, as a result, projects being implemented will be closer to those for whom they are intended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also debating discrimination against women today, and when debating this strategy, it is therefore also necessary to talk about discrimination against women from minority groups in particular. The Roma are among the most disadvantaged population groups throughout Europe. I have read the statement of Mrs Járóka: ‘Poverty threatens the new generation – not on account of their Roma origins, but on account of their parents’ unemployment’. I would like to add that this is also on account of social exclusion. Unemployment will continue, particularly for the Roma population, but we know how to integrate Roma into cultural activities and into civic life immediately.</p>

It stands as eloquent proof of the Hungarian Government’s commitment in this regard that the rapporteur, Mrs Lívia Járóka, who is the only Roma Member of the European Parliament, is one of the Hungarian delegates of the European People’s Party, and that Mr Zoltán Balog, the presenter of the case, head of the newly established State Secretariat for Inclusion, is engaged in supporting the betterment of the Roma people, who suffer from multiple disadvantages. Based on these facts, we can rightly conclude that the Hungarian EU Presidency is leading Europe by good example in the settlement of issues relating to the Roma. With regard to the Roma strategy, I believe it is important to stress that the integration of the 12 million Roma living in the EU is a common issue for Europe, whose resolution shall require the contribution of both the individual Member States and the EU institutions. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán aptly pointed out that if we do not wish to ‘export’ the problems of the Roma – who live in extreme poverty and social and ethnic exclusion – through ‘nomadisation,’ that is, emigration to the developed EU countries, then we must find a solution to their current, untenable situation through joint action and with combined efforts. I wish the European Parliament, the European Commission, the European Council and, last but not least, the Hungarian EU Presidency, successful work in developing and bringing to a final conclusion this momentous strategy for the integration of the Roma by June this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title29"></a><a name="creitem29"></a>

<p class="contents">Given that there are already more than 85 million people in Europe living below the poverty line, does the Commission not consider it necessary to draw up a framework directive on a scheme to guarantee a sufficient minimum income in Europe as a whole? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission believes that, in addition to acting as automatic stabilisers, minimum income schemes can play an important role in protecting the most vulnerable from the worst effects of the crisis by providing safety nets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recommendation on the active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market and the EPSCO Council Conclusions of 17 December 2008 on common active inclusion principles to combat poverty more effectively both highlight the importance of access to adequate resources, alongside quality services and inclusive labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation calls on the Member States in particular to ‘recognise the individual’s basic right to resources and social assistance sufficient to lead a life that is compatible with human dignity as part of a comprehensive, consistent drive to combat social exclusion’.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach outlined in the recommendation has proved to be a step in the right direction, especially during the economic crisis. But more needs to be done to fully implement active inclusion reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commission announced in its communication on the European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion, it will report in 2012 on the implementation of the common principles on active inclusion, focusing, inter alia, on the effectiveness of minimum income schemes.</p>

The background to the situation is as follows. As a result of a decision by the European Council in 2007 and subsequent resolutions by the European Parliament and the Energy Council – in other words, after wide-ranging consultation with Parliament and the Member States – the Commission submitted its proposal for an ecodesign regulation in 2009. This included the gradual changeover from conventional light bulbs to energy-saving bulbs which make more efficient use of electricity. We believe that in the European lighting and light bulb market, it will be possible to achieve a total saving of 40 billion kilowatt hours, which corresponds to electricity costs of between EUR 5 billion and EUR 10 billion. The directive includes a number of safety measures, with the focus being on mercury and maximum limits. These were lowered significantly once again in September last year in order to further reduce the potential risks to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The findings in the study commissioned by the German Federal Environment Agency have led us to ask the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks to issue another statement. After reviewing the entire body of scientific literature, the committee has come to the conclusion that broken compact fluorescent bulbs are very unlikely to present any risk to human health.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is one problem in this area. The studies are based on trials involving adults. Of course, it is obvious that children need to be considered separately, which is why we are working together with the German Federal Environment Agency to produce the appropriate results for children as quickly as possible. We are monitoring the situation very carefully. I am in contact with the aforementioned agency so that we can carry out a rapid, joint evaluation of any additional tests it organises.</p>
<p class="contents">Our overall conclusion is that, because of the need for confidence among everyone involved, we will continue with the gradual implementation of the regulation. However, we will be happy to report to Parliament again if findings emerge which could give rise to a different evaluation. This is the situation at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important that we ensure that victims have access to their rights and receive the support and protection they need. This is a strategic priority for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take this opportunity to highlight the courage of Mrs Hughes, who is campaigning for stronger victims’ rights across Europe. I think that her determination should serve as an inspiration to us all to strengthen victims’ rights and to reinforce citizens’ trust in our judicial systems. We need this stronger mutual trust to ensure that the victim’s needs are recognised and protected, not only at home, but also cross-border. We need to ensure, too, that victims are not forgotten by our judicial and legal systems.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission will propose a comprehensive package on victims in May. This will address the quality of treatment that victims receive in the aftermath of a crime and during the criminal proceedings. It will ensure that victims receive the same minimum standards of treatment in all EU Member States, irrespective of their nationality or country of origin. Our proposals aim to promote a change in attitudes towards victims, to do more to ensure their recovery, and to minimise the risk of their being further harmed by repeat victimisation during the proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">In very concrete terms, what will the package consist of? Firstly, a horizontal directive on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, which will, for example, clearly establish the following enforceable rights: easily accessible victim support services in all Member States; the right to interpretation during interviews; a minimising of contact between the offender and the victim during proceedings, with any new courts to be designed so as to provide separate waiting areas; and the right in all Member States to request a review of the prosecution.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I will also propose a regulation on the mutual recognition of civil-law protection measures to ensure that any victim who is at risk, and who benefits from a protection measure taken against a potential offender in one Member State, can continue to benefit from such a measure when they move or travel to another Member State. That instrument will be complemented by another instrument on the mutual recognition of criminal-law protection measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We also intend to introduce a wide range of non-legislative measures to ensure that the new legislation works effectively, and we will propose a road map on the strengthening of victims’ rights to ensure that these rights remain high on the political agenda in the years to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, too, have felt that victims have been somewhat absent.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to procedural rights, we have focused strongly on people who get into trouble because they may have committed a crime: we have been concerned to see that their rights are looked after, as we should be in our rights-based society. Very often, however, victims are victimised a second time when they come to court, and nobody cares. It is a very unfair situation, amounting to a negation of rights. That is why I hope this victim package will change not only laws but also mentalities, and that everywhere in our courts, our police stations and our hospitals – as the honourable Member rightly urged – people will have a special care for victims and will know that they should not be treated just like anyone else. It is of the utmost importance that this should also apply cross-border, to people in a Member State other than their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">So I rely on Parliament to help the Commission produce the best legislation possible, and also – with regard to the codecision aspects of the package – to be swift so that it can be put forward for agreement with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it will tackle some major fiscal impediments to companies’ competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the lack of common corporate tax rules and the divergence of national tax systems often lead to over-taxation and double taxation. Moreover, businesses are faced with heavy administrative burdens and high tax compliance costs. This situation creates disincentives to investment in the EU and runs counter to the priorities set in the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Significant progress has been made so far on the technical preparation of the CCCTB proposal. It is now time to offer companies a single set of rules to make it easier and cheaper to do business in the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The CCCTB is scheduled for adoption by the College of Commissioners on 16 March 2011. I am convinced that the final proposal will greatly contribute to a better environment for businesses, growth and jobs in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does the Commission consider that such a system will result in a change in trade patterns for agricultural products in Romania?

<p class="contents">One of the possible solutions to deal with the so-called carousel fraud in this sector would be to apply the reverse charge mechanism. Under this arrangement, which is not an exemption scheme, supplies remain taxed but the person liable for the payment of the VAT to the tax administration is no longer the supplier but the recipient taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the recipient is liable to pay the tax instead of the supplier is the only modification to the standard regime, according to which a taxpayer supplying goods to another taxpayer collects the VAT and pays it to the State while the recipient taxpayer can deduct this amount via his VAT declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Both under the standard and the reverse charge regimes, should the recipient be a final consumer, he will not be able to deduct VAT and will bear it entirely.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, VAT still remains neutral for taxpayers and there would be no distortion of competition. Because the recipient can simultaneously pay and deduct the very same amount in his VAT return, this modification has the merit of removing the need for an effective payment of the VAT to the tax administration. Therefore, it avoids fraud arrangements that are based on non-payment of the VAT by the supplier followed by deduction of the VAT by the customer, who is in possession of a valid invoice.</p>
<p class="contents">A downside of this system is the fact that it could create other risks of fraud, since all VAT would be collected at the last stage in the supply chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, such a system should, in the Commission’s view, preferably be limited to agricultural products which are normally sold to intermediaries – taxable persons – and not destined for supply to final consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, as this arrangement would deviate from the normal VAT rules set out in the VAT Directive, Romania would have to be granted a derogation by the Council on the basis of that directive; the Commission is still examining the issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Statement by the head of the OECD on the possible restructuring of eurozone Member State debt and Commission’s standpoint</span></p>
<p class="contents">On Thursday, 27 January 2011, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the head of the OECD, Angel Gurria, asserted that ‘one country may need restructuring, that is Greece’. It should be pointed out that this is the first public statement on the question of restructuring a eurozone member’s debt by the head of an influential international organisation that cooperates closely with the EU on a range of political, economic and social issues.</p>

Our joint overall assessment is twofold and I will outline it briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the programme has made further progress towards its objectives; and secondly, there remain considerable challenges to be overcome in order to secure fiscal sustainability, restore competitiveness and ensure a viable banking sector.</p>
<p class="contents">While there have been delays in some areas, the underlying fiscal and other reforms necessary to deliver the programme’s medium-term objectives are now being put in place. However, major reforms still need to be designed and implemented in order to build the critical mass necessary to secure fiscal sustainability and economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenging efforts of consolidation will be supported by a bold privatisation programme, as indicated by Prime Minister Papandreou. The government has expressed its commitment to substantially scaling up its privatisation programme with a view to realising EUR 50 billion in proceeds from privatisation by 2015. This has the potential to cut the debt ratio by more than 20 percentage points of GDP over the next five years. Furthermore, determination in implementing the privatisation programme will increase economic efficiency and support higher investment and exports.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, the government’s full commitment to this process of privatisation, and not least its determination to tackle privileges and vested interests, will indeed be critical to realising the ambitious objectives and thus utilising the potential for substantial improvement in the market sentiment vis-à-vis Greece. The Commission therefore encourages Greece to show resolve in its privatisation programme.</p>
<p class="contents">This relates to a comment made by the OECD Secretary-General: this year, 2011, is the decisive year for Greece in terms of restoring the credibility of its economic policies and that is a prerequisite if it is to regain market access in the course of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the authorities should achieve, or even surpass, the fiscal target for this year and articulate a robust medium-term budgetary strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Greece should achieve a decisive breakthrough in structural reforms over the coming weeks and months. Determined implementation of the programme should strengthen credibility and the confidence of citizens and investors alike.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, through the combination of these policy measures – i.e. meeting the fiscal targets and implementing the privatisation programme – and the EU measures of extending the loan maturities and revisiting the pricing policy in the light of debt sustainability, concerns about debt restructuring can, and will, be addressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, Moody’s has downgraded Greece’s credit rating to the same level as Angola; this was unwarranted and is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, Commissioner, we are all wondering what will ultimately suffice in order for Greece to get back on its feet: a simple extension? A reduction in interest rates, as you also mentioned? Renegotiation of the terms of the memorandum? Eurobonds? The European growth bond? All of the above? Or perhaps something else?

<p class="contents">Moreover, as I said in my previous reply, it is essential for Greece to embark on a very ambitious programme of privatisation which will help reduce the debt burden. It is also very important, in the context of the comprehensive strategy to be decided this March in the European Union, that the Member States look at the issue of debt sustainability.

I would like thank the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to the report and the rapporteurs for the opinion of the relevant committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Together, we have succeeded in conveying a clear message, Mr Tajani, which is that we want to move industrial policy closer to the centre of the political arena, for good reason. Industrial policy will help us, firstly, to create good quality, future-proof jobs in Europe and, secondly, to secure investment in Europe. Our competitors all over the world are making good use of industrial policy, for example, in the United States, China, Brazil and India. Thirdly, we are faced with challenges relating to sustainability, both in terms of the climate and the economic and social foundations of our society. Against this background, it is important for us to put industrial policy at the centre of the political arena.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, this means that we expect industrial policy to be integrated in such a way, Mr Tajani, that it becomes the focal point of legislative initiatives within the European Union. We do not want to see environmental, trade and competition policies being drawn up first and only subsequently being coordinated with the interests of European industry. On the contrary, we must define the other areas of policy on the basis of the strategic interests of a sustainable industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />Secondly, Mr Tajani, we need better coordination between the industrial policies in the different Member States. Therefore, I would like to ask you, and we have included this in the report, to make use of Article 173(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to coordinate industrial policy in the Member States more effectively, so that we really are all moving in the same direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, of course, focus on a number of specific areas. On the horizontal level, we need to look, in particular, at innovation policy throughout the entire value-added chain. We must succeed in supporting the entire economic chain, from fundamental research through to the market launch of products, and in bringing the best solutions for our society onto the market.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to pay more attention to resources. Simply saying that this is important is not enough. We need to introduce practical legislation which will significantly increase resource productivity. In industry, labour is responsible for 20% of costs and resources for 40%. That is a starting point for action on raw materials. The mobile phones that we all use contain rare earths and metals, which are seldom recycled. The recycling rate for mobile phones is only 1.5%. That is a starting point for creating jobs and increasing the competitiveness of European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last point in this context. Innovation and resource productivity will not happen by themselves. They depend on the employees who are involved. For this reason, a sensible industrial policy must also take into consideration the skills and the involvement of employees. If we can bring this about, then I am confident that we will have future-proof jobs in European industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know it is not easy in a Chamber organised like this one, with so many parliamentary groups, to succeed in arriving at a synthesis that will allow the debate on industrial policy to be wound up positively. I would therefore like to thank you for the work you have done because, if we truly want to put action to promote the real economy at the heart of our political action in favour of the social and market economy, we – the Commission, Parliament and the Council – must work together.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with your appeal for greater cohesion by the Member States, but there is an encouraging sign from the Council, which has, in fact, supported the Commission’s position. In addition, in the countries where it has been possible to present the industrial policy document, there has been some willingness – albeit to varying degrees in the different countries – to take part in joint action under the governance of the industrial policy. As the Union does not want to impose decisions on the individual Member States, this is an attempt to coordinate their policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This appears to me to be a move in the direction of your request, but it also confirms that Europe needs its own industry in order to address the immediate challenges of finding a way out of the crisis. We cannot think of overcoming our current difficulties – a situation that is being made worse by the ongoing crisis in the Mediterranean region – without solid action to promote our industrial and business policies, because they are the only ones that can enable us to develop and create new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The report you have prepared, Mr Lange, rightly emphasises the economic, environmental and social challenges we face: in short, the sustainability of our industrial policy. It places sustainability on the same level as competitiveness, because these two dimensions are closely connected. Indeed, I am convinced that in today’s world, these two aspects cannot exist without each other.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this, we must also equip ourselves with modern, competitive industry that makes a clean break with the old method of industrial policy making. What does having modern industry mean? It means having industry that is efficient in resource use, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, which implies an economy aiming at becoming a green economy, via the route of a greener economy. This industry must also be accountable, tackling difficulties on the basis of constant and fruitful dialogue with the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe a strong signal needs to be sent out that the 2010 industrial model cannot be one based on State aid and that, to be competitive in the era of global challenges, European industry cannot afford not to focus on innovation and research. That is why, before issuing the industrial policy document, the Commission presented its document on innovation policy, which I think is absolutely fundamental to the development of a genuine industrial policy and also helps identify paths to follow in the sector of raw materials research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a coincidence that one of the innovation partnerships mentioned by the Commission is precisely about raw materials, researching ways to recycle and replace raw materials. It is therefore clear – not least because we will talk later about rare earths in the following debate – that innovation, raw materials and industrial policy are all part of a single strategy, and, to my mind, the revision of the Small Business Act also forms part of the same strategy. By putting this series of political and legislative acts into practice, therefore, the Commission is demonstrating that there is a will to implement political action in favour of industry and business.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to governance and industrial policy, I think the process is well under way, as I was saying before, both within the Commission and in the Member States. Within the Commission, as you know, President Barroso called on me at the beginning of the mandate to chair the group of Commissioners on industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have called two group meetings so far, one before the communication was adopted to discuss political priorities, and the second to discuss the practical implementation of the communication, with particular reference to the competitiveness test and the standardisation strategy. I consider the group of Commissioners to be a special tool designed to provide political guidance and ensure that initiatives are consistent in terms of industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Member States, I believe the reaction has been positive. As I was saying, on 10 December 2010 with the Hungarian Presidency, we launched the first cooperation exercises on access to credit for small and medium-sized enterprises, which will be followed by other, similar exercises, in close cooperation with the Member States. We will continue to give you the necessary details for ongoing collaboration between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, Madam President, please allow me to say a word about the importance of supporting entrepreneurship among women. It is no coincidence that today is 8 March, and I have always said that we need more women entrepreneurs, but once they have decided to commit themselves, we must also be in a position at least to give them good advice.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we have decided to do by including an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> action during the revision of the Small Business Act. The Network of Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors that we have already launched will continue to exist, but we want to go beyond awareness raising. We want women entrepreneurs to be able to receive good advice from experts, and to this end, we are about to launch a consultation exercise in the very short term to support certain initiatives aimed at providing mentors for new female entrepreneurs who would like one.</p>
<p class="contents">These people can give them concrete advice on starting up and then managing a business. The aim is to roll out this initiative in at least 10 Member States and then expand it to the rest of the 27. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite your efforts, Mr Vice-President, the Commission has still not always realised that.</p>
<p class="contents">A great many acts, of which the documents on the Europe 2020 strategy or certain free-trade agreements that have recently been approved or are under discussion will not be the last, are still biased towards the service economy and the strengthening and development of services, particularly in the financial, banking and insurance sectors. In contrast, the real economy is giving us opposite signals, as you have said. Production and exports are rising and we are witnessing a reversal of the trend for relocations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must encourage these signals, since no great economy in the world can escape the central importance of industry. Hence, we need to complete the internal market and to speed up the implementation of strong initiatives in support of innovation and research, technology transfer, product traceability, protection of intellectual property and promotion of European production, not to mention effective rules against dumping and for true reciprocity in bilateral negotiations. This report is a step in that direction, and I am very grateful to Mr Lange and all those who have worked on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that economies cannot prosper without heavy industry and that industry cannot exist without factories.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all gathered together in this House to stand up for Europe’s industrial jobs. There is no conceivable future for industry without confidence in scientific and technical progress. Therefore, at a time when Europe should be beginning extensive work to identify the Arianes and the Airbuses of 2050, the Commission has to realise that, with the crisis, the rules put in place are no longer suited to today’s economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The issues of free trade and free and undistorted competition have become dogmas. We cannot be the only economic area in the world to unilaterally apply free trade principles while having no idea of what our main competitors are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore regret the fact, Commissioner, that there is a certain amount of nervousness when it comes to issues associated with strengthening the European Union’s anti-dumping arsenal and to applying the general principle of reciprocity in trade with third countries. The worst situation is one where the European market is too open in the face of competing markets which are too closed.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the context of the fight against climate change, I would like it, Commissioner, if we could implement tools in addition to greenhouse gas emission allowance trading, such as the carbon inclusion mechanism at our borders. In this way, we could re-establish a balance so as to make relocations to third countries less attractive for our companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We should improve the help available to our SMEs and reduce their costs; we should strengthen European patents and the fight against counterfeiting with ‘made in’ origin marking. Likewise, if Europe cannot access raw materials, we will no longer be able to talk about an innovative industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern relates to education, training and research, as well as a culture of innovation and science, which must hold pride of place once more within the European Union.</p>

I am grateful for the Lange report, the excellent work done by our fellow Member, and Vice-President Tajani’s communication.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision means some important things, the first of which is that the revitalisation and recovery of Europe’s economy and the resilience of employment, as has been said, depend partly, and perhaps especially, on the recovery of the whole manufacturing sector, both the more advanced and the more traditional parts of it, and on the support it is given. That is because it is still possible to push the boundaries in manufacturing, something that was not so obvious until a short time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the recovery of industry in Europe also means that our competitiveness is not only in play in the financial or tertiary sector, but here as well, and it is not too late for us to take up the challenge to make Europe competitive in industry <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point, as has been said, is that the new industrial policy focuses on factors rather than sectors; it focuses on factors and instruments that can genuinely promote new companies and a new capacity for resilience and modernisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel it is important to highlight once again these new factors on which we need to act: credit – we are calling for new initiatives in addition to those already announced by the Commissioner on the subject of credit – raw materials, energy prices, innovation, research, the need to enhance the capacity for the technological transfer of the results of research and innovation within companies in Europe, in new products and new ways of organising production.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make good use of a highly unique industrial fabric in Europe, particularly in certain countries, which is that of small and medium-sized enterprises, the quality of enterprises and of their products, and the unique nature of European industry. I think we should rediscover these manufacturing traditions and manufacturing roots in many countries in order to innovate and change them.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the question of location, which is very important. European policies are successful if they find a region able to tackle them. We therefore thank Mr Lange and look forward to an excellent collaboration with the Commission in order to arrive at concrete results very soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have been looking over at Mr Lange and thinking that there has been a lot of commotion about an own-initiative report. A total of 500 amendments and 50 compromise proposals have been tabled with the aim of making industry in Europe a world leader again. We can only achieve this by means of an integrated and sustainable policy. We need to ensure that research and innovation are at the heart of our strategy. Therefore, we must put in place a regulatory framework which will support innovation and sustainability at the same time. The major challenge faced by your report was finding the right balance between environmental goals and economic competitiveness, while also avoiding protectionism. I am looking at Mrs Grossetête, because the French always want to introduce a touch of protectionism. At the same time, we need to support small and medium-sized businesses, promote the European patent and prevent knowledge theft, particularly with regard to China. We also want to see fewer regulations being imposed on European industry as a result of red tape. This means that we need to focus on reducing the amount of bureaucracy. Mr Lange, you have succeeded in covering this quite well in your report, so I would like to thank you for your hard work.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this report can only represent the first step. We need to link the concept of industrial policy, which people in many Member States find it hard to discuss and which the Germans, in particular, have always been unwilling to talk about, with the competitiveness pact, which will be presented to the Heads of State or Government over the next few weeks in order to safeguard the euro area. If we do not manage to do this, then we will have a problem. We must coordinate areas such as cohesion, industry, trade, research and innovation, but also social issues, the climate and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The current example of E10 in Germany demonstrates that this is not happening. This is all about adding bioethanol to petrol. The EU has put in place an important strategy, set itself the 20-20-20 targets, and we have said to the Member States that they must implement it. The Member States, and Germany in particular, were part of the decision-making process and supported everything that was decided. However, when it came to putting it into practice at home, they suddenly cut back the tax incentives and the consumers stopped cooperating.</p>
<p class="contents">If we fail to convince consumers, as was the case in Germany with E10, then we will not be able to implement climate policy in combination with industrial policy. We need to have the consumers on our side. That is the central message. For this reason, I wish the industrial policy project every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report covers almost everything and, in some places, contains contradictory information.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe that this report represents important progress. In the past, it was often the case that only the French or those on the left-wing who were in favour of strong state control spoke up in support of industrial policy. It was a taboo subject for everyone else. Now we are in the new position of having reached a basic consensus about the fact that we must have an industrial policy in Europe and that it must be a joint policy at a European level. I think that this is a significant step forward and I am grateful to Mr Tajani for highlighting this so clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot go on as we did before and Mrs Grossetête is absolutely right about that. We cannot treat industrial policy as something which emerges almost by chance at the end of our free trade policy. We need to turn things back the right way up, but not on the basis of illusions of state control and not with the idea that the state must take a regulatory role and intervene directly in business. The state must create a sensible framework which promotes innovation and, in particular, environmental innovation, and which will allow progress to be made in these areas by exploiting competition. However, we do not want to see strong state control or protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">In future, we will only be able to ensure that European industry is in a strong position if we take seriously the task of environmental innovation on a central level. Therefore, I would like to say in conclusion, Mr Tajani, that I am very grateful to you for explaining that sustainability and competitiveness are not opposites, but must be put on the same footing and coordinated with one another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The competitiveness of European firms depends on the continuing economic stability of Europe. We are all surely aware of these arguments, but on the other hand, we are constantly trying to take on commitments, be they in the form of extreme requirements for environmental protection or mandatory tax obligations to ensure financial stability. It is certainly important to assess the impact of industrial output on the environment in a stringent manner, but we must not indirectly burden industry with regulations that are almost overstated. This may lead to a situation where, in a globalised world, European industrial production is more weighed down by political decisions than is the case elsewhere</p>
<p class="contents">I consider the most important thing in the report to be the emphasis on the importance of supporting science, and research and innovation. Europe has long ceased to be a leader in the area of innovation. It is of fundamental importance to support innovative projects. I very much agree that there is a need to rework financial support procedures for innovative projects. Our aim should be to simplify the administration and, at the same time, to change the overall approach as well. It is essential to take account of the commercialisation of research and the financing of European funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That requires a change in the positions that have been taken to date, in which the European Commission did not have the least concern for striking a balance between the need to defend a prosperous industry, specifically manufacturing industries, and international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Industrial production is fundamental to sustainable growth and employment in Europe, which necessitates another EU and external trade policy that defends our industries, including those that guarantee jobs in countries and regions where unemployment is already very high. To this end, it is essential to give full attention to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and to research and development; to take into account regional development, and the specific characteristics of each country and industrial sector; and to improve workers’ qualifications and training.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are many contradictory positions in the report we are debating. While, on the one hand, it advocates defending industry and SMEs, on the other, it includes proposals calling for the liberalisation of international trade, on free competition, on the deepening of the internal market, and on public/private partnerships. However, such proposals do not defend our industries like they should, as the European reality has already demonstrated. We have therefore tabled some proposals to remove these most damaging aspects; we hope that they will be adopted tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">We advocate industries that are efficient in terms of using resources that are less dependent on carbon, that value jobs with rights, and that guarantee equal rights for women in terms of access to jobs, to promotion, to wages, and to participation in management and administrative bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to guarantee all this, it is essential that there be an EU framework, and in that sense, the European Commission has an important role to play in terms of industrial policy, of external trade, of financial policy, and of research, science and innovation that supports SMEs, as well as in terms of commitment to training and reskilling workers, and to the dignity of those who work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, the economic crisis has shown us that countries with an industrial base not only survive; they also prosper. Look at Germany, look at China, look at Spain. Spain is holding up under the economic crisis because it has an industrial base.</p>
<p class="contents">My country, Greece, had an industrial base, Commissioner, but we have managed to wipe it out, for various reasons. I would like to focus on a very topical problem faced by Greek industry this week. Mr Trichet made a statement about a possible rise in the European Central Bank base rate within the next month. This caused a surge in the 3-month Euribor interbank rate, to which thousands of business loans in Greece are linked. In a single day, the Euribor registered its biggest increase since September 2008, causing massive problems to Greek businesses, which are already suffering under the recession.</p>
<p class="contents">On the same day, however, the Europe director of the International Monetary Fund stated that the European Union’s monetary policy will hold up and does not need to be tightened. We are not saying that Mr Trichet should not raise interest rates. However, there could be a smooth transition, to avoid this explosion in loans that we are seeing. Do you think you could intervene, Commissioner? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From now on, the facilitation of the operation of SMEs should be a priority in all documents and all subjects. These small companies create the majority of jobs, and have the highest capacity to reinvent themselves and take the greatest role in innovation and preventing the European economy from falling even further behind. Quite importantly, they pay the largest share of taxes into our budgets, meaning that it is largely they who sustain bureaucratic administrations. In return, bureaucracy, together with bankocracy, has created a legal institutional and economic environment which intends to make the operation of SMEs impossible. This short-sighted practice, which serves the profit-mongering of multinational companies, cannot go on any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is correct in stating that speculation on the financial markets must be prevented, but at this point, we need to do more than that. Express penalties should be imposed on those banks that do not facilitate the supply of funds to SMEs through their credit policies. The report also makes a passing reference to the fact that in the new Member States, industry is losing ground, and that the EU must find the means to halt unfair practices by large companies. We must state openly that over the past years, multinational companies of the old Member States, with the assistance of EU bureaucracy, bought out and ruined the majority of the manufacturing industries of the new Member States, and then bankrupted the companies operating there and took over their markets. The result is millions of people without a job and a future outlook, profits easily acquired in the east, and sizeable tax revenues in the west. Also, with the assistance of bureaucracy, much of the technology accumulated in Europe has unfortunately been transferred to China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the various political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, this report tries to answer a question that has already been under consideration for a long time: do European industries have any future in a global world?</p>
<p class="contents">I think the answer is yes. Yes, because European Union countries are proving that they do. Yes, because there are also specific European industrial sectors that are proving that they do.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this has to do with a number of aspects: some are related to the job market, because we need a flexible job market, not a rigid one; others are related to productivity, financial policies and tax incentives. However, allow me to highlight three that are now closely linked to the European Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. These are two key issues. Enterprise and innovation are key elements of the future of any industry in Europe. Particular attention should be paid to young entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, strengthening the internal market and making sure it is competitive and, internally, based on free competition. Therefore, the subsidies still being given to transport, energy, and publicly owned businesses should be reduced so as to ensure free competition within the European internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, respecting the conditions of competition within the international framework: when it comes to environmental policies and product sourcing, it is vital to compete on equal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want protectionism within the European Union, nor do we want protectionism when our industry competes with third countries and third regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That probably says something about the status of industrial policy in the social debate and in politics for rather a long time. However, now industrial policy is back in any case – I think that is clear from this report, too. The service sector will continue to be important, but it is also becoming clear that it is highly dependent for its development on us having strong industrial production and a strong industrial sector. These two things go hand in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, industrial policy is central to one of the most important political issues: work for everyone, full employment. However, if modern industrial policy stopped there, nothing would have happened over the last 25 years. Modern industrial policy is so much more than that. Today, it also involves playing a part in the major transition – the radical switch to environment and climate sustainability – and not posing a barrier to it, but actually contributing to this transition. This is currently an element in the competitiveness of industry – that is clear when you look at the investments that are being made in a number of our competitor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to raw materials is part of this – a requirement for industry therefore, but, at the same time, also part of the transition. It concerns everything from energy efficiency to resource management and recycling, for example, in the form of what we refer to as urban mining. Another key issue for a modern and sustainable industry is recurrent training programmes. We will not, and we must not, compete on the basis of low wages and poor working conditions, but on the basis of qualified and skilled people who work, and who want to work, in industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A crucial role in this will be played by the integration of all the factors in the European Union influencing industry. I will mention just some of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, guaranteeing sustainable, long-term deliveries of key raw materials for developing Europe’s high-tech sectors. In this context, I urge increased cooperation with third countries with an abundance of raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, an economy based on innovation and the free movement of knowledge. I urge for the key link to be strengthened between education, vocational training and professional life. Europe produces the most PhD holders in the world, but fails to successfully convert their skills and knowledge into really practical market solutions. We must build European innovation centres where cooperation will be actively fostered between knowledge and the needs of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the transition to a low carbon economy is a key step. The high-tech edge Europe has will enable us to enjoy to the full the potential and benefits of the ‘green’ economy in the future. All these elements require a new level of cooperation between Member States and European institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we come out of the biggest recession for the last 60 years, we really have to galvanise our industries to be competitive in global markets – backing small firms, boosting enterprise, and supporting all those who want to create jobs. So the linkage between innovation skills and sustainability is evident. Not necessarily by using funds – we can do this by strengthening the internal market, trade promotion and providing a supportive framework for innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, one element missing for me is the digital agenda. Everyone in Europe, every business, should have the right to have access to the best IT, mobile and broadband at super speeds. Were you aware, Commissioner, that South Korea fixed the aim last week to have, by the end of next year, Internet speeds plugged into every home that will be 200 times faster than those in the average household in the US? As was said by one senior IT executive, for Europe’s competitiveness, one has to realise that it is much better enhanced by investing in IT compared to physical infrastructure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first concerns the fact that Europe must aim for a pioneering spirit, so that technological priorities come first in some areas, in order to achieve not just comparative advantages, but also absolute advantages, because average quality products command average prices. Secondly, I would like to say that it is important to aim for two-way mediation between large and small systems, because concentrating on large systems will not bring the desired results. General Motors is an example of failure which cost US taxpayers USD 57.6 billion. The third issue is that industrial policy should not depend solely on the so-called political and economic élites, but should be based on a great stream of small innovations from below, in other words, large technological breakthroughs depend on a great number of small innovations which come from work collectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">They have been successful in transforming the discovery which we all made during the crisis, namely, that industry is obviously more important than many people thought, into a report, and in ensuring that industrial policy is moved nearer to the top of the European Parliament’s agenda. The fact that this debate is being held in the evening may be a disadvantage. This subject is so important that we need to talk about it at other times as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As some Members have already said, industrial policy is not about the state intervening, but about it establishing the right framework. The state does not need to decide on the content of industrial policy or to distinguish between good and bad industry. Instead, it must create the opportunities for industry to develop within a framework. We must focus on those areas where we can really help in terms of innovation and research.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is very helpful that Mr Tajani has provided us with information which makes it clear that the question of competitiveness is of the utmost importance in many areas of European policy. In future, it will be very useful to use this as a criterion and to consider whether our political decisions will always, frequently or just often enough help or harm the development of industry in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like us not only to have a report and a topic for further debate, but also to change the way we act after this and to take this subject seriously, because industry is important.</p>

Commissioner, we welcome the fact that the Commission has understood this, and has taken back industrial policy for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, whom I wish to congratulate on his excellent work, has already explained how we interpret the transition to an industrial policy that is smart, resource-efficient, and sustainable from an environmental and social viewpoint. Of what he said, I would just like to emphasise one aspect that I consider to be crucial: human capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Assuming that every job should be ‘green’, it is vital for European workers to have the appropriate skills, not only to improve the competitiveness of our industry, but also so that no worker is left by the wayside.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a strong foundation: young Europeans have never been so well prepared, and yet we lack engineers, we lack young entrepreneurs, and we lack innovative policies for managing human resources. We should therefore encourage synergies between those universities with a strong entrepreneurial culture and companies that are truly driven by knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to training, we need to adjust work skills to the demands of the new economy and to do so in a way that is economically accessible for workers and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, industry should place greater emphasis on organisational innovation, understood as a more flexible and dynamic sharing of risks and responsibilities within companies. Only then will it be able to incorporate and capitalise on the talent and knowledge of its workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to say a word as a member of a group that has opposed the launching of an enhanced cooperation on the EU patent, because we think it affects the internal market, territorial cohesion and legal certainty. The Court of Justice of the European Union has supported this position in Opinion 1/09 published on 8 March 2011, which concludes that the draft agreement establishing a European and Community Patents Court is not compatible with the provisions of the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is actually largely a matter of how we can bring competitiveness to European industrial policy and, on the other hand, how we can respond to the structural change that has come about through job cuts in basic industry in certain areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that industrial policy is part of the change. We need to see this change and we also have to be able to adapt to it. We have to look forward in industrial policy and create a sustainable one based on our own European strengths and our regional resources. An example of this is the bioenergy sector, where there is a good deal of potential in Europe, I believe.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional structures will allow us to support a sustainable industrial policy in Europe, and because of this, we need to stress the importance even more of innovative clusters and broad cooperation between actors, educational institutions and companies.</p>
<p class="contents">When speaking about a European industrial policy, it is, of course, very important to include the SME sector – small and medium­sized enterprises. We need to be able to reduce red tape for SMEs, as has been said here on many an occasion, and do everything we can to support opportunities for SME entrepreneurship, both now and in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It implicitly recognises the Lisbon strategy fiasco by rightly asking for 3% of the Union’s gross domestic product to be dedicated to research and development and by proposing, above all, that the private sector be heavily utilised.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it still has a vision of competitiveness that is focused on a deadly cut in labour costs, when we actually need to develop competitiveness based on training, capital savings, energy and raw materials. The report also implicitly admits the failure of the financial markets to channel savings into investments that will create wealth. Resolving this problem requires social control of credit or credit requisition for the benefit of employment, research and development, and wealth creation. We need European and national public financial centres to guarantee industrial financing. Our Parliament cannot simply take action to ensure that the large European industrial groups do better. Our main objective must be to provide more and better quality industrial jobs in the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This flagship initiative linked to the Europe 2020 strategy has therefore been both useful and timely, and for this I am grateful to the Commission and to Commissioner Tajani in particular. I also thank the rapporteur, Mr Lange, for the work he has done and my colleague Mrs Grossetête, who, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), made a significant contribution towards reinforcing the positions put forward by the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I decided to make my contribution with amendments illustrating the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are considered by everyone to be the anchor chain of Europe’s basic industry, the part that knows best how to stand firm at times of crisis and how to innovate while keeping prices competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the role played by thousands of small and medium-sized European entrepreneurs needs to be supported with solutions to the difficulties and constraints that they have pointed out on several occasions: I am referring to better access to credit, the possibility of more transparent and less costly participation in public calls for tender and, above all, administrative simplification across the board, which everyone regards as the real revolution that this continent now needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Commission has highlighted the subject of efficient and responsible raw material use, and I also consider it important that we are going to discuss rare earths soon. The attention devoted to the subject of intellectual property protection is significant.</p>
<p class="contents">I can finally see a route marked out that I hope will soon lead us to set standards and guarantees that are valid throughout the European Union.

Tomorrow, his collaborative method will be crowned with success. Moreover, Commissioner, this is an opportunity for the Commission, which provided us with a rather disappointing communication.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone who hails from a large region heavily hit by the crisis, when it had already been affected by industrial restructuring, I have listened to the message of the unions, which have constantly challenged us. We need an industrial policy, all of whose components work towards the same goal: constructing a strategy that is based on sustainable, employment-centred growth that is built around the optimisation of skills and which shows that social and technological innovations are compatible with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the key to European competitiveness and not the use of the workforce as an adjustment variable, as the Commission proposed in the European semester. The best move the Commission could make is to rapidly integrate the Posting of Workers Directive into the work programme and to begin fiscal harmonisation starting with corporate taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this policy should take shape not only at national and European level, but also at local level in the context of an effective cohesion policy. Our choice is a regulated financial market, and we share the desire to consolidate the single market, but not at the expense of an inequitable labour market which is subject to social dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Madam President, we are debating an ambitious industrial policy, and this morning, we voted on a tax on financial transactions, and on Eurobonds.</p>

Europe is currently finding its competitiveness in global markets decreased. As such, Europe needs to find ways of strengthening its industrial base to face up to new challenges. This report’s very goal is tabling proposals to relaunch European industry. An integrated and sustainable industrial policy must be based on scientific research, on innovation, on increased resource efficiency, on a commodities strategy, on reinforcing SMEs, and on developing regional networks. In particular, it is essential for energy efficiency and the introduction of information and communication technologies to constitute the basis of this new industrial revolution, so as to increase competitiveness, economic growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the emphasis given in the report to traditional European industry, which is essential to our economy. Measures such as the introduction of new technologies and increased reinforcement of scientific research and innovation in sectors such as the manufacturing industry are of crucial importance. This is the only way that we will be able to return Europe to global leadership, which is so necessary for Europe’s competitiveness and economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Merkies  (S&amp;D). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Bernd Lange, on an excellent report and on the fantastic cooperation on his part. Industrial policy is making a comeback. It is not, however, making a solo comeback, because it is not alone. Together with two other flagships, two other strategies, this strategy stands at the heart of the European agenda for jobs and a healthy economy. Most of all, though, it is a strategy, not just for the present, but for the future, too, a viable future.</p>
<p class="contents">Industrial policy should be considered together with all the other strategies, concerning the Union of Innovation, raw materials and the efficient use of natural resources. These three form the core. It must be a holistic approach, where different policy areas work closely together. However, are they really different policy areas, given that industry – as you, yourself, Commissioner, have said – is not the enemy, but the ally of sustainability?</p>
<p class="contents">Industrial policy cannot function without an integrated market. The internal market is still too fragmented and requires completion. The whole industry, especially small innovative companies, stand to benefit from that. Producers are allowed to offer their opinions, but they must also accept responsibility, and that means ultimate responsibility for the product. The aim is to promote clean production and sustainable products, because I believe that this, ultimately, is the future of Europe. It will help us create cradle-to-cradle industry and encourage intelligent use of raw materials and a healthy economy. Industrial policy has been neglected and left to the market for too long.

<p class="contents">Industry accounts for 60 million jobs plus two extra jobs in related services for each job in industry, that is to say, 180 million jobs in total. It accounts for three quarters of our exports, namely 5.5 million enterprises. What must we do? We have to act and to protect ourselves. Self-protection is not protectionism; we must therefore have an industrial policy. Some say: agriculture in South America, industry in China and services in Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, if we do not manufacture more cars, more planes, more ships, more trains, more satellites, more medicines, more nuclear power stations, we will be ruined! As for services, we will have them because we will have an industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to make three proposals. The first relates to industry standards. Whenever we set industry standards, we must have impact studies to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with these standards on EU territory.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concerns education and research. We must have the best engineering schools in the world and we must support them. We must reconcile the public with science. As regards research, we are going to review the Seventh Framework Programme. We have EUR 30 billion to spend in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Let us allocate a portion of these envelopes to industry as a matter of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The third is funding. We could create a European Industrial Investment Fund. I have a suggestion to make. We owe EUR 37 billion to the pensions of EU staff; let us put this fund into a pension fund, which would be a long-term savings vehicle. I share the view on monetary policies. Let us be very cautious about exiting the crisis. Let us ensure that we do not have interest rates that are too high, which would result in a strong euro and put a brake on industrial exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Maintaining high-value production in Europe remains essential and, at the same time, it is a mainstay of the knowledge and learning of many people in our countries and of the continued development of our competitiveness. This report rightly sets industry high on the European agenda and that is important for both large industry and small and medium-sized enterprises. In Europe, we can boast excellence in many fields. I am thinking of the energy, space travel and automotive industries, which are all doing splendidly at the moment. Then I am also thinking of the automotive industry’s supply chain, which is essential for Europe. Just look how clever and clean the EU 2020 strategy is!</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do have one concern, and that is globalisation. We have rightly established The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and we will soon have the European patent. Nevertheless, Commissioner Tajani has put the issue of the necessity of a worldwide level playing field on the agenda. It is great that Chinese companies are investing in Europe, but we should have a level playing field there. If it is, indeed, the case that large government funds are being invested in this, then something is wrong. Returning to protectionism is not one of our goals – as Mr Audy has just said – but this is about ensuring the necessary transparency in key sectors, such as the ICT and other key European sectors. This is not a European veto. We are not saying ‘these are the shareholders, those are the supervisors’, but it is really important that we, representing Europe, look into this properly. It would not be out of place to start a debate on this, in response to Mr Lange’s excellent report. It will continue. Commissioner Tajani, I wish to invite you to join in that debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For you, as Commissioner, that must be a real shot in the arm. There is considerable consensus amongst the various groups that industrial policy in Europe has a future and that it should be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the extent of that consensus, however, because, if we were to try to establish what kind of industrial policy we mean and which of its elements should be retained in the future, then we would all disagree. You yourself have referred to the fact that we need an industry which uses less energy and fewer materials. I am with you on that, as far as short-term objectives are concerned. Regarding the long-term objectives, we need to make a much bigger leap. As you know, Commissioner, management means looking ahead. We must have the courage to say that, by 2050, we will have an energy supply system which is wholly based on renewable and sustainable energy and we have to start preparing industry for that <span class="italic">now</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, material management. We must, indeed, ensure that these mobile phones are more effectively recycled over the next few years, but in the future, we have to ensure that we manufacture mobile phones which are completely embedded in a cradle-to-cradle-concept, so that all the essential components of that mobile phone are systematically recovered and used to produce new mobile phones. It is that kind of overall policy that needs to be developed by 2050 and I expect the Commission to take decisions <span class="italic">now</span> that will ensure that industry has a clear framework to work towards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be noted, however, that those services linked directly or indirectly to companies are an integral part of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a few criticisms and proposals to make. With regard to paragraph 89 on enhanced cooperation on the European patent, I believe, Mr Tajani, that the single European patent is essential and indispensable, especially for us Italians. The deadlock that has been created through enhanced cooperation can, in my view, only be broken by taking the European patent forward just in English, because using three languages would create an unheard-of precedent.</p>
<p class="contents">My second consideration is the lack of any innovative financing proposals. The text often mentions the need to move swiftly towards the building of trans-European infrastructures, which are crucial for the continent’s development, but it says little about how to finance those networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier today we adopted an own-initiative report analysing in depth the system of project bonds in a public/private partnership system, which would thus offer guarantees on securities issued by the companies that are set up to build and run such infrastructures; Mr Audy has just quoted some examples.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no reference to the link between the European Union’s industrial policy and strategic policies for the Union such as Galileo, ITER and others. There needs to be a greater link between research and innovation. Mr Tajani, I believe the challenge facing us is of vital importance for maintaining the social context. In fact, the slight recovery that we have seen cannot reabsorb the number of people made redundant over the last three years. It is, unfortunately, necessary to act in time and quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, this industrial strategy is financed, which is in marked contrast to the 2000 Lisbon strategy. If it were not financed, it would remain empty words. The main source of this funding is EU project bonds, Eurobonds and euro projects. In voting this morning, we faced up to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this strategy protects our industries. This report is for opening up Europe; it is against giving it away. It is for exchanges founded on reciprocity and balance.

Unfortunately, our relevant policies are still often based on the idea that markets must regulate themselves. In this respect, the Europe 2020 strategy is a pioneering initiative, the first to acknowledge the need for a new approach. European industry must retain its leading position in key areas, and must not be allowed to lag behind events.</p>
<p class="contents">We must treat the new structure of the financial sector and the coordination of the fiscal macro-economy as priorities, because only through their reform can we ensure the success of our industrial policy. We need a new, comprehensive regulatory framework which can steer the financial system back to productive investments. An industrial base that is competitive on a global scale and a knowledge-based industry focused on production must be at the heart of our industrial policy. To this end, however, we will need the entire innovation chain. In this case, we should not only talk about technological innovation, but about the innovation of product design and quality as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must encourage synergies within the sector. These include the link between energy policy and industrial policy. Energy supply is an essential factor, and the new, growing markets lie in renewable energy sources, which may consequently result in the creation of new jobs. Reliable access to raw materials is also crucial, and faces us with an increasingly serious challenge. In addition to securing already existing resources, we must also be able to realise our recycling efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also do everything in our power to strengthen SMEs, as they are key actors in European industrial production. We must encourage their highest possible participation in public procurement and must provide them with access to favourable bank loans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am in favour of this important report, which represents Parliament’s contribution to the debate on Europe’s industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many positive points in it, which I strongly support. First of all, I think every possible effort must be made to reaffirm the key role of European industry on the world stage and to offer particular support to small and medium-sized enterprises, which form a vital pillar in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I fully agree with what the report says about the urgent need to introduce European provisions regarding origin marking in order to make companies more competitive and to enable European consumers at last to make informed choices about products normally associated with a reputation for quality. Unfortunately, it is well known that some states have been opposed to this specific point in the Council since 2005. We must, however, try to break this deadlock, based on the strongly favourable position adopted by Parliament on several occasions, and this is important during the legislative process of a number of EU acts. The voice of the European public cannot be ignored again, especially when it is based on such solid foundations: it is a question of making our policies more democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is surely the one concerning young entrepreneurs – whom you, Commissioner, referred to more than once in your report – because I believe they are truly the future of our industrial policy. I still have doubts about certain aspects, such as the explicit reference to new legislation on resource efficiency, the creation of task forces at national level to manage restructuring operations, and especially enhanced cooperation on the European patent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe needs a new approach to industrial policy and the funding of programmes related to it. In addition to the structural reforms in the European Union’s financial perspective, the emphasis should be on innovative financing measures. I am not only talking about Eurobonds or project bonds, but about completely novel approaches to industrial policy, science and the funding of innovation. We must take innovative small businesses and help them grow. We must find new ways to help companies to share risks and combine various instruments, including on a pan-European basis</p>
<p class="contents">Estonia has experience, for example, with revolving funds, which guarantee risk, rather than giving out grants and direct assistance. In the innovation cycle, these funds have facilitated a considerable increase in such funding for businesses.

It must also improve the European Union’s competitiveness and create jobs across the whole Union. Industrial strategy must identify the strategic areas in which we will invest, as well as the necessary raw material sources. I call on the Commission and Member States to ensure that these priorities are supported by the future financial perspective, the annual budgets and EU sector policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy consumption is an industrial production indicator. We need an eco-efficient industrial policy, providing production capacity across the EU in a sustainable manner and reducing the Union’s energy dependency. The Union’s competitiveness depends largely on its capacity for innovation, research and development and on the link between innovation and the production process. Public funding must be increased for research and development in order to mobilise private investment, while simplifying procedures and cutting red tape are a prerequisite for industry’s increased involvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore very much welcome both the attitude of Commissioner Tajani and the report of our colleague, Mr Bernd Lange, on this subject. It has been a pleasure working on this report. Every one of the participants wanted to add something to it. We were not arguing about what the difficulties were, but rather about how we could accelerate this process. It is imperative that we understand that the European Union must play a leading role in setting its own goals, and also in pulling the Member States along on this road.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must coordinate, lead and hold the Member States to account for what they have achieved in this area. Industrial policy provides Europe with the opportunity to gain a competitive advantage in manufacturing industries, biotechnology, nanotechnology, the chemical industry, or even in fields related to the aerospace industry. We must understand that in the industrial policy of the 21st century, the intensity of knowledge and the efficiency of material use are increasing. At the same time, we must strengthen vertical relationships, from education to research to market opportunities. Supplier relations, including small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as horizontal relations, must be established. We believe that social dialogue cannot be circumvented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Realistically, however, we have to accept that Europe has not had its own industrial policy so far.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, productivity in the manufacturing sector in Europe is going through difficult times, while emerging countries are not only growing but also investing heavily in research and technology. To make industry and employment grow in Europe, we need to deploy special measures in addition to the current rules, even to the extent of reviewing the distribution of competences between the Member States and the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Redistribution policies and systems also need to be reviewed in line with a new cultural approach to industrial relations, with the company profit-sharing model at the focus of our reflections. The Europe 2020 strategy sets out goals that the European Union cannot afford to miss and, if it is to achieve all the targets set, Europe must overcome the challenge of industrial growth by strengthening training and research in support of small and medium-sized enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is good news. However, the way in which the current EU regulations operate is blind and arbitrary, resulting in the opposite effect, or, in other words, limiting our progress towards this goal. The European copper industry has become an example of such an adverse impact. There can be no question about the fact that both the Climate and Energy Package and the benchmarks directive will cause a drop in the production of copper, which, as we all know, is a metal which is in great demand for innovative and energy-efficient technologies, particularly in relation to electricity transmission and heat transfer in heat exchangers.</p>

A strong competitive environment is developing, in which we will have to try harder and harder to maintain meaningful employment for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In this competition with other industrial centres, we are disadvantaged by two serious drawbacks. The first comprises the enormous differences in the legal environment which regulates ways of doing business, dispute resolution or the enforcement of obligations, and these differences prevent a broader opening up of cross-border business through the jurisdictions of the Member States. This is related to the second drawback – the excessive bureaucracy, which not only consumes the money generated by industry while producing no added value, but even harasses those on whose labour it lives, by means of all kinds of statements, regulations and guidelines.</p>

I say this because we must not believe – and I think I have been clear both in the course of my speech and in the report on industrial policy that I presented to the Commission – that enterprise and industry are merely economic capital, because they are also human capital, the region, the local community in which they operate.</p>
<p class="contents">As I also said during my hearing before Parliament prior to my appointment as Industry Commissioner, this is my vision – a broader vision – which stems from a concept that is part of the Treaty of Lisbon, namely, the social market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate aim of all our actions, both in terms of economic policy and in terms of the real economy, is social policy. Our objective is not to enrich entrepreneurs or investors, although the enrichment of investors is one instrument for responding to the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to apply and defend the choices we have made and are making – which are contained in the Europe 2020 document – with a strong effort to apply the political choices that we have made. I am not concealing from you, nor from myself, the dangers that still exist. Speculators are still active, and I do not rule out the possibility that they may still try to have one last throw of the dice.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be very clear that we are on the side of the real economy. Speculation that enriches only those who perform a transaction is very different from the action of a business or industry that creates prosperity for many citizens. However, we must remain vigilant, and work and apply our industrial policy. Consequently, the Commission’s industrial policy document contains a series of competitiveness tests that will be used to monitor the application of a serious industrial policy, which will allow our entrepreneurial system to take up the challenge in the globalised era.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor am I avoiding the question asked by Mr van Nistelrooij: I believe that the game must always be played on a level field and according to the same rules. Madam President, when Anderlecht plays Liège, the rules must be the same whether it plays at home or away, and the same principle must also apply to our industrial system. When our industries play in Europe, they must see the same rules applied as when they play outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a good rule for defending not only the market, competition and growth, but also the rights of workers in the European Union. Yet when it comes to defending the European industrial system, I believe that it is right to support the principle contained in the document that we are discussing in favour of origin marking. I consider that Parliament is once more giving a strong signal in harmony with the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">There are doubtless many other things that need to be done to reduce the bureaucratic burden on companies and industry. As the revised Small Business Act states, we have to reduce the time taken to set up a business and we have to cut red tape, which can be excessive and which crushes the will to do business. We have to help young people to become entrepreneurs, and we need to do a great deal of work in connection with training. I therefore believe in the importance of clusters, where schools, universities, SMEs, large companies, research and innovation work together to enhance the competitiveness of our entrepreneurial system. We already have 2 000 clusters in Europe, and I believe that this pilot scheme must be rolled out.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to access to credit, a great deal has been done, but we can do more. I am very pleased to hear that the Managing Director of the London Stock Exchange – the United Kingdom is one of the countries where much has been done to help services, banks and finance – will take full part in the credit access forum organised by the European Commission to show that the world of finance, or part of the world of finance, wants to participate in the growth and development of SMEs and our industrial system.</p>
<p class="contents">This signal from London – and it is not the only signal to have come from the United Kingdom – makes me hopeful that this trend will be reversed. We need this to happen in Europe in order to help the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to raw materials – a topic that has arisen in several debates – I am absolutely convinced that we must continue along the road taken. The European Commission has issued a document and there will be a debate, as a result of which we are now working on part of the raw materials issue. As I said in my first speech, I am totally in favour of conducting research into raw materials recycling. We can also work on finding substitutes for rare raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in an activity also linked to our innovation policy, one of the innovation partnerships envisaged by the European Commission relates precisely to innovation in the raw materials sector. I repeat, recycling and substitution are areas which I believe we should continue to explore in order to provide our industry with specific responses, including international policy initiatives, as I have said on many occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the agreement with the African Union and after opening a debate with the Russian Federation on the issue of raw materials, I shall travel to Latin America at the beginning of June to discuss the raw materials issue with Brazil, Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must give industry and the SME sector a specific response in this respect. Therefore, we must continue to work on implementing the Small Business Act. There is a great deal to do; we have asked all the Member States to appoint an SME ambassador, as the European Commission has done. The signals being received are positive; some countries have already appointed an ambassador, or have indicated their intention to do so, and in a broader context, too, because we must not separate large-scale industry from SMEs. The growth of the real economy is linked to the internal market, industrial policy and SME policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the role of the unions has been mentioned several times, I will conclude by saying that, for the first time, an Industry Commissioner has met representatives of industry, SMEs and the unions to discuss restructuring policy. A new season of debate has begun, one that will see workers’ and employers’ representatives sitting together round a table in meetings organised by the European Commission, to promote economic growth and the greater good of all EU citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, we want to link together sustainability and competitiveness and develop them further. Thirdly, we must not take a dogmatic approach, because this area cannot be regulated by the market alone or by the state alone. We need practical, sensible measures. Fourthly, this is just the beginning and not the end of the discussion on modernising industrial policy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are extending a hand to you, Mr Tajani, but we are also aware that we must take you at your word. We are expecting concrete legislative proposals and also concrete measures to provide financial support, particularly in the field of research.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Tajani, if we are successful, and if the hand that we are extending to you and the statement that you have made are compatible, perhaps we will find ourselves in a situation similar to that at the end of the wonderful film ‘Casablanca’, when Humphrey Bogart says to the police captain: ‘I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When discussing the EU’s industrial policy, we must answer the following question: what kind of industry does Europe need – a corporate, branch-driven industry, characterised by large-scale mass production, or small-scale regional industry, or maybe even national industry?</p>
<p class="contents">Large, supranational corporations, which can sometimes be richer than some countries, accumulate huge profits, and also taxes, including VAT, in one location, most frequently their place of origin. Apart from employment, the countries in which production takes place are left with only expenses. Fiat, for example, is a supranational corporation which generates revenues equal to 4% of Poland’s GDP in statistical terms, but its profits and the majority of its tax revenues go towards another budget.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of this, the company has recently transferred the production of its Panda cars to Italy, for political and national reasons, since it can certainly not be for economic reasons. A conflict of interests is apparent here. The social situation is deteriorating in Poland, but improving in Italy. Supranational corporations have already ravaged Poland, buying up industrial firms for 10% of their value after the end of the People’s Republic of Poland. The mistakes made by liberal doctrinaires, including Balcerowicz, resulted in the borders of Poland being opened up to global competition from wealthy corporations. This quickly resulted in the destruction of our industry, the closing down of competitive plants and scientific infrastructure – and huge unemployment. This is now affecting the old EU Member States, after something of a delay. A sound industrial policy is needed, but not economic nationalism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title31"></a><a name="creitem31"></a>

Tsoukalas, </span></span>  <span class="italic">author.</span> – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. Rare earth elements are critical to hundreds of high-tech applications and key to the development of green technologies. EU industry depends totally on REE imports from China, which holds a monopoly over 97% of world production and has 36% of global economic reserves. China has strong scientific research in the field and has achieved a palpable competitive advantage in producing alloys and end products.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, EU industry lacks both access to raw materials and the know-how for processing them. Although rare earth elements are not as rare as their name suggests, experts estimate that it takes around 10 to 15 years to reorganise a viable production line. The European Union is developing a medium-term strategy for raw materials; however, the problem of rare earth elements is much more immediate. Increased domestic needs in China and its efforts to limit the environmental impact have already resulted in very strict limitations on exports, at a time when global demand is increasing. China has set lower export limits for the first half of 2011, down 35% compared with last year, but stricter limits are expected in the second half. The shortfall is expected to make itself keenly felt over the next six months, with increases in the prices of rare earth elements and disruptions to production lines. Experts estimate that there will be a global shortfall of 40 000 tonnes of rare earth elements in 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions to the Commission are direct and urgent:</p>
<p class="contents">-	What short-term measures is the Commission proposing to take, along with its partners, to establish alternative sources of rare earth elements?</p>
<p class="contents">-	What is the state of play in our talks with China and our international partners on the subject? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A successful EU raw materials strategy must be aimed at encouraging free trade. It should contain sustainable and resource-efficient management, innovation and access to raw materials for European companies. It should not involve stockpiling raw materials with taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is increasingly dependent on a small number of key resources and is falling behind in the race to secure alternative sources, but it is private companies, not politicians, who can determine the need to build up stockpiles. If it is an efficient use of resources, they will do so. What we need instead is a comprehensive raw materials strategy that involves all aspects of access to rare earths. This includes trade, research and innovation, recycling and development of transport and infrastructure to enable development of domestic sources. We need better management of raw materials supply within Europe and effective measures to encourage recycling and reducing waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is rich in natural resources and is also strategically placed with its proximity to the resource-rich Barents region. With minerals, metals and forests, northern Europe has the potential to respond significantly to EU raw material needs in a sustainable way.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to encourage innovation and research into alternative solutions and find ways around materials that European companies find too expensive. The EU strategy must be based on free trade and must ensure that both developed and developing countries can benefit from the sustainable supply of raw materials. We should also use the aid-for-trade mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs actions aimed at innovation and eliminating trade barriers in third countries, not a policy of stockpiling rare and critical raw materials and undermining democracy abroad. We need suggestions from the Commission regarding raw materials and rare earth elements. We are still looking for these suggestions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we do not ensure the availability of these materials, we will do away with the most technologically advanced sectors of our economy. No areas of our policy must therefore be neglected. We must skilfully use the resources we already have and which have been abandoned unnecessarily. We must use trade policy instruments to ensure effective prevention of free trade violations. We cannot therefore limit ourselves to using only the expensive and still very limited possibilities open to us for recovering materials from used appliances.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several questions at least which should be put to the European Commission in the context of the communication on raw materials. Firstly, has the Commission assessed the impact of China’s protectionist raw materials policy on European industry? Secondly, what role can recycling play in comparison to the opportunities provided by trade policy and own resources? What is the ratio between these three possibilities? Thirdly, does the Commission have at its disposal an assessment of the costs involved in increasing the share of recycling in the European raw materials policy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first concerns the supply of raw materials from outside the European Union through agreements with the African Union. We have put the raw materials issue on the agenda of our meetings with the Russian Federation. Moreover, as I said during the previous debate, in June, I will travel to Brazil, Argentina and Chile to initiate diplomatic action with those Latin American countries as well. Then I will talk about the relationship with China.</p>
<p class="contents">The second pillar is about ensuring a more sustainable supply within the EU. This is why we have updated the implementing rules of Natura 2000, in agreement with Commissioner Potočnik. We want to ensure that they are interpreted in a way that will not harm extraction activities but, at the same time, we want to ensure that the environment is still respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The third pillar concerns recycling and the efficient use of resources. I would repeat what I said during the previous debate: as part of our innovation policy, we are planning a series of innovation partnerships in various sectors, one of these being the raw materials sector. One of the innovation partnerships will concentrate, in particular, on activities that we can carry out in the raw materials recycling and substitution sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The new communication emphasises, in particular, the situation concerning the supply of rare earths and other essential raw materials. There is no doubt that the reduction in the rare earth export quota decided by China significantly limits the global supply. We are assessing the situation in order to identify the most suitable multilateral instruments, including the World Trade Organisation and our bilateral relations with China.</p>
<p class="contents">At the WTO, we have initiated a dispute settlement procedure against China regarding access to the nine principal raw materials in 2009. The examination of the case is at an advanced stage, and the conclusions will, of course, be very important for our discussions concerning the initiation of a WTO procedure on rare earths.</p>
<p class="contents">At bilateral level, the Commission has taken up the issue with the Chinese Government on several occasions, from both a political and a technical point of view. At the end of 2010, a working party was set up between the EU and China to facilitate the dialogue on issues relating to rare earths and other raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will conduct, within the scope of strategic partnerships and of dialogues on future policies, an active raw materials diplomacy with the aim of guaranteeing access to these materials, and to essential materials in particular. One example, as I said, is the initiation of a bilateral dialogue in the context of the 2011-2013 Joint Africa-EU strategy, which includes a section specifically dedicated to raw materials. I have already told you about our relations with Russia and Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the EU, the Commission is supporting the exploration of essential raw material deposits, and this objective is promoted in particular by the ProMine 2009-2013 project, which comes under the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As for recycling, it presents huge technological challenges, particularly since the quantity of raw materials contained in many products is infinitely small. Our strategy is intended to promote recycling through measures aimed at improving the implementation and application of EU waste management legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we shall continue to encourage research and innovation in the recycling and substitution sector, as has already been done under the Seventh Framework Programme for financing projects concerning the substitution of rare earths. In this context, the Commission is examining the possibility of launching an innovation partnership in the field of raw materials and hopes to present a specific proposal within the next few months. We have also begun a cooperation exercise with the United States in the field of innovation, and we are examining the possibility of cooperating with Japan as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we shall continue to keep a close eye on the problem of essential raw materials in order to define the priority measures required, and we believe that security of raw material supplies is essentially the responsibility of companies. However, we are prepared to discuss, in close cooperation with the Member States, the costs, potential benefits and added value of a raw material stockpiling programme.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we are doing, but naturally, I am always ready to listen to any suggestions from Parliament in order to ensure that the Commission continues to work actively on a matter that is crucial for the competitiveness of our European entrepreneurial system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Raw materials will help to ensure that we have a healthy industrial sector in future and, therefore, it is important for us to conclude bilateral agreements with China and many other countries, and not just in the field of trade policy. For example, we should also be focusing on investment protection agreements, because we can sign long-term contracts in this area which will protect the return on investments in the new mines that we urgently need. In other words, long-term contracts will provide protection for our investments so that the new mines, which will be competing with existing ones, can receive the financial support that they require.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) follow-up conference to the Doha round, we can also investigate the situation of the Singapore issues. We have already put together a good package of measures in Singapore and we need to take this forward, perhaps even in parallel with the current Doha negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to find out whether there has been a breach of anti-dumping regulations with regard to the prices which industry in China pays in some cases for raw materials for processing and the surcharges imposed on European industry. Work on clarifying this is already in progress. However, this is not just about rare earth elements (REEs), but also about magnesite, for example, which is the most important raw material for fireproof products and which is essential for the production of steel, glass, cement and other materials. We should be considering possible substitute products which can be used in the future and perhaps establishing our own research programme for these products.</p>

Rare earth elements are, of course, rare on the market, but not in the ground. There are a number of reasons for this. They have quite simply not been of sufficient economic interest to quarry in all of the places where we know they are present. There have also been environmental and working environment disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU ought to invest a great deal in research and development. It ought to invest in resource efficiency and, in particular, in recycling, as has been said here throughout the evening. This, of course, requires everything from intelligent, simple and smart collection strategies to ecodesigns which make it easy to take batteries out of devices that are to be recycled. However, we also need to move away from our colonial impulses in our cooperation with other countries in other parts of the world.

I cannot see that Europe has a strategic weakness and it must not remain dependent. To put it more bluntly, in some ways, the Chinese are doing us a favour by making it entirely obvious to us that we need to escape from our current position of dependency.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we must not make the additional mistake of creating antagonism between Europe and China. There are opportunities for cooperation in this area. However, when we look towards Asia, we should also take Japan into consideration. Over the last year, Japan has been in a more difficult position with regard to access to REEs than Europe has. Japan has also reacted more quickly and more effectively. The Japanese Government has spent USD 1 billion on research into the substitution and recycling of REEs. How much are we making available as part of the Seventh Framework Programme?</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that we need trade policy. We must also develop our own reserves, where they are available. However, in my opinion, the strategic focus of our policy on REEs must be innovation, raw material efficiency and technological leadership. We need mandatory targets for raw material efficiency. We also need specific, concrete plans for recycling REEs. The Commission’s communication makes no direct mention of recycling. This is no longer a solution for the future, but one which we need now. Many companies have already been doing this for some time, including Rhodia, BASF, Osram and many others.</p>
<p class="contents">Substitution is another key factor. Even China is now beginning to invest in substitutes for REEs, because it is obvious that it cannot continue using these substances at its current rate, even to meet its own requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be quick to make the most of the opportunities offered by the current situation and we must not complain that these opportunities are open to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are therefore an essential factor in continued technological progress and greater innovation in the European Union. The fact that they are used so widely means that demand has increased, while opportunities for increasing the amounts extracted are growing rarer.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, 124 000 tonnes of rare earth elements are extracted annually worldwide, and demand for them will grow by as much as 50% by 2012. Around 97% of the global supply is extracted in China, which is crucially important, since China has been reducing extraction and exports since 2006. In August, it announced that it would be reducing exports by over 50% and creating strategic reserves. What is more, many companies extracting rare earth elements in other parts of the world are, in fact, Chinese-owned. The take-over of a rare earth elements mine by a Chinese mining company was recently blocked in Australia. This is a very serious problem relating to the monopoly on the extraction of these raw materials. We must do everything in our power to prevent any risks in connection with this key economic sector, which guarantees Europe’s growth and future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The statement also included a specific reference to the importance of sustainability criteria. The summit was attended by Latin American countries, but the same laws apply to China and other states.</p>
<p class="contents">The extraction of rare earth elements (REEs) has led to serious environmental damage in China, as was the case in the past in the USA and elsewhere. This must not continue.

<p class="contents">China is also interested in investing in high-tech production facilities for processing REEs, because it does not just want to be a supplier of raw materials. The Commission should therefore play the role of mediator here.</p>
<p class="contents">A modern raw materials policy must be characterised by partnership.

In 2007, the Commission also made an announcement and presented its raw materials strategy. My problem is that the announcements we have heard over recent days and the announcements we have heard over recent weeks are very similar to those made in 2007. However, I have the impression that very little has happened since then.</p>
<p class="contents">Little has happened at least when it comes to us asserting our own interests. It seems to me that many other states are promoting their interests very aggressively. This is known as the ‘colonial reflex’. I see this happening not in the countries of the European Union, but specifically in China, which is using the issue of raw materials, and of rare earth elements (REEs) in particular, to maintain its monopoly and put other countries at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">I increasingly often ask myself, Mr Tajani, who should be responsible for ensuring that something actually happens. Is it your Directorate-General? Is it you? Is it the Directorate-General for Trade? Is it Mr De Gucht? Is it the other commissioners? Who really has overall responsibility? What concrete steps must be taken? Whose actions should we be measuring and when, in order to ensure that measures are actually put in place by the European Union? I would be very grateful if you could investigate this issue, because we are all aware that the Chinese are continuing to play an active role and are imposing export restrictions and duties, which present our companies with huge problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Commission finally drawn up a list of all the products where the Chinese currently have a competitive advantage because of their export restrictions?

The processes for mining, refining and recycling rare earth elements have severe consequences for the environment if they are not managed properly.

We can therefore congratulate the Commission for the raw materials strategy. Nevertheless, the potential shortage of raw materials in the future should not only make us focus on solving the issue of access to raw materials. I agree that this may be a very good opportunity to turn the European Union economy towards a model based on using resources more efficiently. A reduction in the use of raw materials and much greater concentration on the efficient processing of raw materials are probably the quickest route to reducing the Union’s import needs. Proper investment in new processing technologies and the creation of substitute raw materials would facilitate a significant reduction in dependence on imported rare earth elements. This could ensure a leading role for Europe in this area and would make a major contribution to the implementation of the goals set out in the Europe 2020 strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crisis which was announced as being financial is, in reality, a much larger, global crisis. It is a crisis that is also rooted in the confrontation between economic growth as it is understood by capitalism and a planet Earth that is generous but finite. The roots of a system, capitalism, which subordinates everything to the dynamic of profit and accumulation, also lie in this inability to understand nature and its limits; but nature does, in fact, have limits.</p>
<p class="contents">The move toward a world that is polycentric from the economic and political points of view opens the way for increased competition for resources: it awakens and feeds conflicts. The foreign-exchange and trade wars that we have been witnessing are worrying symptoms, but not isolated ones. Other wars are queuing up as threats to the present and future, and it is also about all these things that we are talking when we are debating what has been brought before us today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps we could even start producing them ourselves. I welcome your initiative for a new partnership, one which includes substitution in its remit, but I think that the other members have already mentioned this and they are right: we have to try to conserve raw materials here in Europe. That is very important. We need to increase collection. We need to switch to other business models, in order to recover rare earth elements for recycling wherever possible. We can do this through innovation and, to that end, we need greater efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have one very important concern: are you going to ensure that, if those rare earth elements become even rarer, they will be reserved for the most important applications? Are you going to ensure that, should these metals become even rarer, the applications we all need the most, those that are the most urgent, will ultimately be enabled to continue? For example, are you going to ensure that, instead of ending up as part of a McThis or McThat, these metals are allocated to windmills? Will you look at that issue as well?

Investments in prospecting for raw materials, particularly in mineral deposits, involve a long and expensive process with a long wait for returns. It is therefore only the largest investors which can afford them. They are mainly monopolists and can set their own conditions, as was the case with the rare earth elements. It has now turned out that Europe’s growth is limited due to a lack of lanthanides, in particular, samarium and neodymium, which are needed for the production of high-energy permanent magnets and which are used in wind energy and to power electric vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for the European Union to pay attention to the security of raw materials, in the same way as it pays attention to energy security. This relates not only to rare earth elements, but also to other rare raw materials and materials used as catalysts, for example, rhenium and the platinum metals, tungsten, molybdenum, lithium, selenium and so on.

<p class="contents">As Mr Scholz emphasised, since the Madrid meeting, the European Commission has begun to take determined action. In other words, it has not just made announcements; it has taken specific measures. When I say specific measures, I mean the preparation of a list of 14 rare raw materials on which action is needed – a list which, unfortunately, I fear will have to be extended.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the first agreement with the African Union has involved several months of work and has culminated in an agreement within the African Union/European Union action plan, which sees Africa directly involved in a joint effort with the European Union and with the Commission. That effort concerns both what we can do within the EU to analyse our needs and an analysis of the real possibilities of extraction work in Africa, the possible implementation of a geological service and the plan to create trans-African network infrastructure to support the mines from which it will be possible to expand the extraction industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement with the Russian Federation to put raw material agreements on the agenda is another definite result – not just an announcement – and two meetings have been held.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, the European Commission document on raw materials is not merely an announcement, but a Commission-approved text that outlines a clear and precise strategy, as I told you, which is based on three specific pillars on which we intend to continue to work.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision to create an innovation partnership linked to an action that will see the private sector – and, I hope, also Parliament and the other institutions – participating in innovation and research with the aim of identifying robust recycling and substitution measures yielding real results is not just an announcement, but a specific measure on the part of the European Commission. It is a request that has been approved by the College and which is therefore part of the Commission’s innovation strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the WTO, naturally, we shall continue to work to resolve the issue by diplomatic means. The trip to Latin America is another specific measure, not just another announcement, because visits connected with such sensitive issues require dedicated preparation that must subsequently produce real results. Naturally, I shall inform Parliament about what has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to certain locations in Europe where it is possible to check whether raw materials are present in the subsoil – I am thinking of Greenland, the Barents Sea and other locations in northern Europe – we need to check whether extraction activities are possible and whether they are economically viable. However, we are ready to support any initiatives aimed at carrying out possible investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week, a political debate, but one that includes technical aspects too, will be held at the European Parliament building in Brussels. It will focus on the opportunities that exist in the Barents Sea, and I will be present in order to discuss with some Swedish ministers and some experts whether those opportunities are economically viable or not, and whether they are viable from an environmental point of view – another area where we need to see whether it is right and appropriate to carry out investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the WTO, I am responsible for the industrial part of the raw materials issue. Commissioner De Gucht is responsible for the commercial part. He has already said very clearly that he intends to defend the interests of the EU. Indeed, and I also say this for the benefit of those who are interested, including Mr Caspary, who I believe asked the question – if he wishes, I will forward it to him by tomorrow morning – paragraph 5(2) of the document in the raw materials communication mentions possible anti-dumping measures and commercial action.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to the action at the WTO, for which Commissioner De Gucht is responsible – as I have said during my speech – we have initiated a procedure with Mexico and the United States regarding nine raw materials, which do not include rare earths. The examination is already at an advanced stage of completion. Hence, the conclusions will also be crucial in terms of indicating the steps the Commission should subsequently take with regard to rare earths. We are evaluating the situation precisely in order to identify the most suitable instruments in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to the recycling of rare earth elements, and the question asked by Mr Rinaldi during his speech, I can answer by explaining the recycling measures that we as the European Commission intend to take. Current legislation covers 40% of the waste produced in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proposed to expand significantly on Commissioner Potočnik’s proposal, which is not my proposal, regarding the targets for recycling electrical and electronic waste containing rare earths. Other measures are also planned in order to improve the action concerning products and to facilitate their end-of-life recycling. Legislation is already being drafted, and Commissioner Potočnik intends to continue to work along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to industrial policy relating to rare earths and raw materials, it is my intention to continue to move forward and not to make promises, because I am not accustomed to making them – I am accustomed to honouring the commitments I make, particularly those I make before Parliament, as I have done ever since I obtained a vote of confidence from the committees to which I presented myself. I intend to continue to move forward and to honour all the commitments I have made, without making announcements, but by trying to provide specific responses to the needs of European companies and citizens, including in this sensitive area of industrial supplies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the European Commission communication on the raw materials initiative, we have to strive to ensure that an ambitious common strategy is defined quickly for this sector. We really must prevent Europe from becoming totally dependent on the current monopoly enjoyed by China, which today produces 97% of these metals and are indispensable for high-tech industries. It is therefore necessary not only to re-evaluate the extraction potential within Europe, but also to recover these precious elements from waste by means of more effective recycling. In this respect, the European Union must urgently invest more resources in technological research, aimed, in particular, at an easier and more economical form of extraction of rare earths from electronic waste. One need only think, for example, that up to 350 grams of gold could be extracted from one tonne of mobile phones, if they are recycled correctly. The road to guaranteeing a sustainable supply of these elements is still long and cannot develop without greater cooperation with resource-rich countries through strategic partnerships and ongoing relations. Finally, I would like to see timely measures adopted to deal with the increase in the prices of these materials, which are of strategic importance for European industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

EU industry is entirely dependent on imports of rare earth elements from China, which has a virtual monopoly in this area, since it controls 97% of global production. China possesses 36% of confirmed global reserves of rare earth elements and 59% of estimated total reserves and, at the same time, is endeavouring to conclude bilateral agreements in order to secure proven reserves throughout the world. EU industry lacks access both to rare earth elements as raw materials, and to the expert scientific and industrial knowledge needed to process them. Furthermore, while global demand for rare earth elements is still growing, China has announced drastic cuts to its exports, as vividly described by a group of Japanese experts during a very interesting presentation they made when visiting the European Parliament in February 2011. In connection with the unquestionable need for exploitation of rare earth elements by industry in the EU Member States and the need for research into them, I would call for dialogue with the People’s Republic of China on increasing exports of these raw materials and for our efforts to be focused on searching for alternative sources for their extraction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title32"></a><a name="creitem32"></a>

The question is what role gas will play in the near future in heat generation, conversion to electricity, industry and as a fuel for transport and, therefore, in our energy timetable leading up to 2050, where it will be of huge importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to consider how the transport routes should be developed, including pipelines, infrastructure and terminals. Other issues include investment costs and the forecasts concerning the gas price in the energy mix. The European gas market currently has a volume of around 520 billion cubic metres per year. Part of this comes from our own deposits in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, but more than 60% of our gas supplies are imported from third countries and this figure will soon reach over 80%. For this reason, new deposits, such as gas in rocks, will be a useful supplement to existing deposits and will therefore reduce our dependency on imports.</p>
<p class="contents">There is currently a boom in sales of tight gas and shale gas from the USA. Ten years ago, no one would have believed how quickly and how dramatically the production of gas from rocks, which is extracted using water pressure and chemical agents, would transform the market. Until a few years ago, the USA was an importer of gas. Now it is an exporter, even given its own growing demand for gas. Therefore, the gas market, which has always been a continental market, is, for the first time, on the way to becoming a global market, with gas from the USA being supplied to liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not drawing any conclusions from this development at the moment. The issue of avoiding increasing dependency, the open market and world trade all speak out in favour of it. It is also in the interest of some Member States. However, on the other hand, it is important to make it clear that we have environmental regulations governing running water and groundwater and the extraction of raw materials from the earth. We also have legislation concerning hydrocarbon resources which aims to allow non-discriminatory access to the environment and also to protect it. In addition, there are health and safety regulations for EU citizens. All of these things have to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">There is potential for research and, where appropriate, for extraction, firstly in Poland and then also in the United Kingdom and Germany. In Germany, however, there is also the issue of acceptance. It will not be possible to extract this gas without the acceptance of the people in the regions and the local residents.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is monitoring the process and is also prepared to issue expert reports. I believe that we will not have a clear idea of the proportion of our own gas from rocks on the European market for three to five years. We must follow up these developments without prejudging them. However, it has to be said that even if we make use of these deposits, they will only ever supplement existing sources of gas. This means that imports of conventional gas from third countries such as Norway, Russia and Algeria, or by sea from Qatar and other states, will definitely continue to play a central role in meeting the needs of the European gas market in the decades to come. Infrastructure such as new, secure pipelines and additional LNG terminals will remain important. I think there is the possibility for us to extract our own gas to supplement imports, but this will definitely not be able to replace imported gas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In view of the Energy Council’s recent conclusions on energy and the broad public debate, I believe that shale gas may, in the long term, become one of the ways in which energy sources can be diversified. The European Union should not preach to the converted; instead, it should take a closer look at the United States, for example, to see how the extraction of shale gas has already revolutionised the energy market there. Assuming that this will have even greater consequences for the global market in the future, obtaining shale gas should also be a priority for Europe, in particular, because resources of the gas exceed conventional gas reserves in the European Union fourfold, according to the Second Strategic Energy Review.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the European Union should carry out initial analyses of the extraction of shale gas in Europe. The potential for shale gas has already been noted in Germany, France, Romania, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland and Great Britain, among others. If possible, financial support should be provided for research programmes, which would allow safe and economically viable technologies for extracting gas from non-conventional energy sources to be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">I will permit myself to ask two questions. Firstly, is the Commission taking steps to carry out initial analyses of the possibility of exploiting gas from alternative sources in Europe, and is it preparing technical and economic feasibility studies of such extraction in the context of work on the energy infrastructure priorities between now and 2020? My second question is as follows; has the Commission made any provision in the planned 2014-2020 financial perspective for support for geological research with a view to estimating the potential of existing deposits and the possibility of extracting shale gas in Europe, which will accelerate technological development in the field? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Meanwhile, the rapid depletion of our own natural gas resources may make the Union even more dependent on third country suppliers and weaken our industry’s competitiveness. Gas from alternative sources may be an effective way out, fundamentally redrawing Europe’s gas supply map and redistributing economic levers. However, it is necessary to take action immediately and we could take advantage of the experience already gained by other countries. Recently, there has been much discussion about the potential of shale gas, and today, Commissioner, you also indicated that this was noted in the conclusions of the European Council of 4 February. I believe that the European Union really must establish concrete plans as a matter of urgency and begin to research possible deposits of such gases and their use. Of course, as you mentioned, shale gas must not and cannot be the only way of reducing energy dependence. However, if the predictions of European Union geologists are confirmed, then gas reserves may be found not just in Poland and Germany, but possibly also in other countries. In future, this would help reduce the influence of third countries on the European Union’s economy and its competitiveness. Unfortunately, in this area, we lag at least a decade behind the United States, where the ever-increasing quantities of shale gas being obtained have completely transformed the gas market. I believe that efforts in this area need to be intensified and concrete measures need to be adopted to use these sources in the economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That said, I think that this optimism should be considerably tempered, first in the United States, where shale gas is indeed widely used. Several States are moving towards a moratorium and the Independent Panel of Experts (IPE) has been commissioned to carry out an impact assessment, which will take more than two years, to analyse the environmental consequences of this exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, at a time when we are trying to substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, it would appear to be totally inconsistent with EU policies for an impact assessment of the purely climatic impact in terms of greenhouse gases of the exploitation of these deposits not to be carried out before any in-depth research were undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Commissioner, you said that we must comply with environmental standards. We take note of and welcome that. Nevertheless, in countries where exploration licences are granted – and I am thinking in particular of my own country – it is clear today that environmental law has been totally forgotten; it is not applied and we are in breach of the law. The Aarhus Convention is not applied, people have not been warned, there is no public inquiry, there is no impact assessment, and there is concealment of the dangerous chemicals that are used.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is absolutely unacceptable to continue in this way and the real issue, Commissioner, is whether the exploitation of shale gas on such dense terrain as European terrain, which is totally dissimilar to American terrain, is not incompatible with our laws to protect the environment and people’s access to information.</p>

<p class="contents">We are nonetheless 10 years behind the United States in terms of exploitation. What can we see? We can see that the groundwater has been contaminated by the chemicals that have permeated this hydraulic fracturing. We can also see air pollution. We can now see that there are volatile organic compounds (VOC) and even ozone has appeared because of all the substances released into the air. We can see that the health consequences affect not only people living in the vicinity but also cattle and, of course, the users of the phreatic nappes, because they can no longer drink the water they contain. Last week, the New York Times reported that, as well as polluting the groundwater with hydrocarbons and biocides, the contamination also emits radioactive elements.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, as Mrs Lepage pointed out, eight licences were signed without any debate, without any consultation, without any impact assessment. And you talk of social acceptability? There is genuine rebellion. The latest demonstrations in the département of Ardèche were attended by more than 20 thousand people precisely because they care about their land. And you say, ‘It is an economic opportunity’. But whom does this gas benefit? Are we talking about<span class="italic"> cui bono</span>? Is it about choosing gas for the needs of industry to the detriment of the reserves of water in the phreatic nappes? The New York moratorium is a good illustration of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore simply requesting that the licences be revoked. For explorations to take place while we have no guarantee of compliance with the Groundwater Framework Directive, the Air Quality Framework Directive or the Aarhus Convention is out of the question. We therefore await your responses and we will refuse, in Europe, in France and in the countries involved, to allow these non-conventional forms of gas to be exploited in the absence of these guarantees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Long-term, fixed contracts and price mechanisms based on oil prices have been replaced by much more flexible agreements, and the spot market is starting to play an increasingly important role. Both individual consumers and industry are benefiting from this, since we are all paying lower bills. Europe cannot afford to waste this potential and an opportunity of this kind, particularly since the EU’s emphasis on moving away from coal means that gas is increasing in importance in the European economies. This opportunity to diversify gas sources and increase the share of own resources, and thus reduce our dependency on imports, has now emerged in countries including Poland, France and Germany. Work on obtaining gas from non-conventional deposits is at an advanced stage in all of these countries. Let us remember that this sector does not expect us to provide it with money or special preferential operating conditions. It is a sector which is already investing hundreds of millions of euro in Europe, and it needs only one thing: for barriers not to be put in its way, and for it to be treated equally. The European Conservatives and Reformists in this House also expect this of the European Commission. Let us hope that we – Europe – do not waste this opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The non-traditional sources have a lower concentration of the raw material than the traditional deposits. In addition to coal methane or gas trapped in less permeable rocks or gas hydrates, the most promising source appears to be shale gas. The best experience with the extraction of this gas has been in North America, where extraction from non-traditional sources accounted for up to 42% of total production in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the estimate of the International Energy Agency, there may be up to 991 billion cubic metres of non-traditional gas reserves in Europe. They are probably located mainly in Poland, Germany, Hungary, Romania, Sweden and Great Britain. In 2007-2010, Poland issued almost 60 licences for shale gas prospecting and extraction. The holders of these licences include major global energy concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore clear from what has been said that these new non-traditional gas sources are also becoming an interesting alternative for the exploitation of new horizontal extraction technologies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, we need to cut the energy cake into as many pieces as possible and it is clear that gas will continue to play a significant role in this respect in future. Of course, we must focus on the efficient use of gas. We need more efficiency not only in our production processes, but also in our consumption. We must ensure that the charges resulting from CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions are paid by the consumer and not by the producers because otherwise, international competition will be distorted. It should be of no significance to us whether the gas which produces CO<span class="sub">2</span> is used inside or outside Europe. Europe is the region with the greatest buying power. If we import products with a high proportion of CO<span class="sub">2</span> or transport them within Europe, this must not affect our competitiveness.</p>

This area is, of course, promising to a certain extent, because it could result in a reduction in our dependency on gas imports. In fact, we are already benefiting from this. You have referred to the fact that prices are falling because of the large supplies of unconventional gas coming from the USA. However, as you have said, we need to create an atmosphere of trust if we want this subject to be investigated in an impartial way.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing to review the regulatory framework. I was surprised to hear your spokesperson saying recently that there would definitely be loopholes in the regulations. However, in contrast to the USA, the Commission has omitted to do a number of things. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is undertaking a major study. I would like to know why we are not doing something similar or, at least, waiting to find out the results of the study before we take any further steps. We currently need a political moratorium on shale gas activities until we can answer the questions which many citizens are asking, because they have realised that action has been taken too quickly in the USA. Problems are occurring there which are more significant than people initially wanted to believe and the USA now finds itself in the sort of difficulties that we definitely want to avoid.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I am calling on you, as the Member of the Commission responsible for this area, not to persist in doing what you have planned, but to carry out more in-depth investigations, as the Americans are, in order to create an atmosphere of trust. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to these deposits, the United States has gone from being a gas importer to a gas exporter, and use of these deposits has also resulted in tangible environmental benefits, for example, by limiting the amount of coal mined and the resulting coal damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Scientists are forecasting that a similar scenario could occur in the European Union. Exploitation of non-conventional gas deposits in Europe is the best alternative given Parliament’s high expectations with regard to reducing CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions, and thus reducing coal mining. What is more, we have recently seen a marked rise in the price of gas obtained from conventional sources. The situation in the Middle East is also having a definite impact. The possible exploitation of deposits will therefore enable a real reduction in the costs of generating energy, since it is an alternative to imports which are growing ever more expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">The extraction of non-conventional gas also makes it possible to reduce unemployment, as seen in the United States, where experience has shown that such extraction pays off. In the US state of Pennsylvania alone, around 200 000 people have found work extracting and processing non-conventional gas, and the local economy gains over USD 8 billion every year from taxes, orders placed by extraction companies and concession fees. Let us therefore not lag behind, and let us take concrete measures to benefit from this huge opportunity and potential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Commissioner has already said, the geological conditions for the existence of such gas potentially exist in many countries. Amounts in Poland are estimated at 1 000-3 000 billion m<span class="sup">3</span>, with annual exploitation of around 14 billion m<span class="sup">3</span>. Europe cannot afford to neglect this issue, if only in view of what has happened on the American market. After all, gas as a fuel will remain a key source of energy for a long time to come, as emerges from the Second Strategic Energy Review, for example. At the same time, this report reveals that Europe is dependent on supplies from third countries. In view of the current conflicts in North Africa, for example, which are causing repercussions on the fuels market, we should therefore ask questions about whether such alternative sources may be found in Europe itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the question will arise of what environmental impact such undertakings will have. I think that we should earmark a large sum of money for research into environmentally-friendly methods for extracting gas from alternative sources, such as shale beds. It would appear that Europe could be a leader in this field, too. If we wish to meet our environmental goals, we must, on the one hand, acquire new sources of gas and, on the other, specify the technology and method of exploitation in such a way as to prevent far-reaching environmental damage.

<p class="contents">Gas produced from alternative sources would have an important role to play in the European energy market. Europe could use it to diversify its energy sources, thereby reducing dependency on third countries. One of the options available may be to exploit Europe’s gas reserves in an unconventional manner. Three oil companies have already obtained a licence to do this in Romania. Gas hydrates, also known as ‘flammable ice’, are in great abundance in the Black Sea. If it is exploited locally, this asset will reduce the EU’s dependency on Russian pipelines.</p>

As we know, these resources have been exploited at rates far higher than their natural rates of replacement, meaning that their inexorable exhaustion is looming on the horizon.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of natural gas is comparable to that of oil, except that it is less widely distributed, and it is harder to transport and store. We therefore urgently need to diversify our energy sources. There are no miraculous solutions and it is necessary for the still available reserves of fossil fuels to be managed very carefully, wisely and sparingly. However, whatever alternatives may be found for energy supply, it is almost certain that overall energy consumption will have to decrease in relation to current levels, which is not necessarily a very bad thing. It is for this scenario that we must prepare ourselves, starting now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I think we have to ask the Commission to make an impact assessment.

Obviously and ideally, we would have this from renewable sources and we have our policies in that regard, but otherwise, we have to look for it from other sources. We cannot continue to be dependent on Russia – you saw what they did in Georgia a few years ago – and on regimes like Gaddafi’s at the present time, with the effect this has on prices.</p>
<p class="contents">We look to ourselves, and if we have alternatives – which we have here through shale gas – we must exploit those to the full. There are those who are concerned about the environment, but the European Union’s record on the environment is second to none. Ask any farmer in Europe and they will tell you how concerned we are about the environment and the measures we take to protect it. The same can apply here, but we have to look at every means of getting gas from alternative suppliers and – if I might say this tongue in cheek – we can have great gas in so doing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Günther Oettinger, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, let us try to forecast where the gas market is going. Today, we have presented our communication about the Energy Efficiency Plan which involves a focus on saving energy, using it more efficiently and not wasting it, along with the security of the energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we also have a growing requirement for energy within the European Union. Just one example of this is mobility. In Germany, there are 520 diesel-engined vehicles for every 1 000 people. In the new Member States, the figure is below 200. These two figures will converge, but they will move up rather than down towards the level in Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, our own deposits of gas are shrinking. The amounts have fallen significantly in the United Kingdom during the last decade and will do the same in the Netherlands over the next decade, which means increasing dependency. In addition, a lot of our hopes are, of course, pinned on gas. Why is this? Although it is a fossil fuel, it is far more environmentally friendly when it comes to CO<span class="sub">2</span> emissions than coal or oil and much more flexible than nuclear power and coal. For this reason, gas is essential in order to ensure that electricity can increasingly be generated from renewable energy sources. If we look at the subject of the base load, it is currently around 8 000 hours per year, while the figure for wind power, depending on the situation, is between 2 000 and 5 000 hours and for solar energy between only 600 and 2 000 hours. This makes it clear that we need gas. If we want renewable energy, then gas is its logical partner, however difficult that may be for many people to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore working on the basis of an annual requirement of 600 billion cubic metres in Europe, rather than 300 billion. This will result in a dependency level of 80%. For this reason, we must first diversify and modernise our transport routes, so that they meet the latest technical requirements. We must also eliminate islands, develop our storage capacity and diversify our sources. This means that, alongside Russia, Norway, Algeria, Qatar and Libya, we should also obtain gas from the Caspian region. Gas from this area can be brought into the European gas market via the Turkey-Greece-Italy Interconnector (ITGI), the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) and Nabucco. In the interests of diversification, I do not exclude the possibility of using gas from rocks in the Member States. This process is only just beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is the question of whether we need regulatory intervention from Europe. Why might this be the case? Let us assume that Poland hands out licences arbitrarily and this puts the groundwater or the soil in Poland at risk. This would be unlikely to have any major impact outside Poland’s borders. We need to look at the following question, if we do not want to take ourselves too seriously. Do we not trust the government in Warsaw to ensure that there is clean water and clean soil for the sake of the health of its citizens and to protect ownership rights? I trust every democratically elected government in Europe which is accountable to a parliament and to the public to do this. Therefore, if we are serious about subsidiarity, we need to consider why a borehole in Poland should be controlled, authorised or rejected by Brussels and not by Warsaw. I have fundamental confidence in the national governments. I do not distrust them. Nevertheless, I am happy to discuss the subject of common regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">We must investigate whether the European regulatory framework is sufficiently comprehensive and whether environmental law, soil conservation law, groundwater regulations, health and safety at work for the employees involved and people in the area and ownership rights will all be guaranteed. I do not know, but I suspect that what my spokesperson said is right. There is room for improvement in the European regulations. That is true in all areas. It applies to the quotas for women and it also applies here. For this reason, we will investigate the possibilities for improvement. We will also ask the Member States to give us a common, coordinated list of authorisation requirements. All this has been happening without any definite conclusions being drawn. The USA is similar to Europe in some ways, but not in others. It has a quite different population density and, therefore, subjects such as local residents, health and safety and groundwater play a quite different role than in densely populated areas in central Europe, such as Poland, Germany or France.</p>
<p class="contents">We will commission an expert report which will involve investigating what the risks are on the basis of typical applications for test boreholes within the EU and whether the legislative framework in the European Union is up to the job, whether the legal regulations in the Member States are adequate, and whether, and if so where, we need to introduce improvements at an EU level. I advise everyone not to bring emotion into this subject. In reply to the French Member of this House who said that their interests were not being protected, I would say that in France, my interest in seeing the highest possible levels of safety for nuclear power plants is much more important than trial boreholes for shale gas, at least at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last point which is off the record. I am very grateful to you for coming here so late in the day and for staying to take part in the debate. I regret the fact that a whole series of Members, and I was a Member of this House for a long time, which is why I can say this, have taken the floor and then left the Chamber. I do not think that there are any important events going on elsewhere. I believe that it is not fair to me or to you to take the floor and then to leave. This sort of behaviour is not good for Parliament’s reputation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for this is that the exploitation of alternative gas sources in the EU would significantly mitigate Europe’s increasing gas imports and the gas supply exposure of Central and Eastern European countries. Additionally, a consideration we must not ignore is the fact that the spreading of new gas sources within the EU could contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner. In the United States, the new technology has already revolutionised the gas market over the past few years. As a result of the use of alternative gas sources, which currently constitute more than half of the US production, gas prices have dropped significantly and the country no longer has to rely on import sources. In Europe, the world’s largest gas market, the exploitation of alternative gas sources is still in its infancy. Despite the success in the US, the results of the European pilot investments launched so far fell short of expectations. In addition to different geological conditions, investors are also faced with higher regulatory and environmental risks in Europe. In order to translate the American success to the EU, it would be important for Europe to have an appropriate strategy for alternative gas sources. A comprehensive assessment at European level would be required in order to clearly identify the opportunities lying in alternative gas sources, as well as the related risks. This, because Europe cannot afford the luxury of renouncing the option of alternative gas production that could be exploited within the EU in an age where the traditional gas sources of the North Sea are being depleted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that the potential existence and extraction of shale gas in Europe must not be ignored and I expect the Commission to prepare a technical and economic study on the feasibility of extraction. There are various sources of funding available in Europe which can support Member States in making the necessary investment in infrastructure, production and in measures aimed at achieving energy efficiency at regional and local level. These include, in particular, loans and guarantees from the European Investment Bank, or finances available via regional, structural or cohesion funds. Based on these financing instruments and within the budget outlook for 2014-2020, the Commission must also identify a financing solution for exploiting gas from alternative sources, which could have a far-reaching impact on the European gas and energy market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title33"></a><a name="creitem33"></a>
