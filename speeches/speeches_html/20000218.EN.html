This declaration – which, as I have said, implicates the European Parliament, although no such declaration was put before this Parliament – is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation. I thank the President, Mrs Fontaine, who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House. Mr President, as well as discrediting the PNV, <span class="italic">Eusko Alkartasuna</span> and the democratic government of the Basque Country – who have the kind of attitude which, in the case of Ireland, deserved the Nobel prize – by calling them Nazis, the declaration insults representatives of the European citizens – as in my case: I represent a section of Galician society – by saying that we are more dangerous than the Nazis, and insults groups which are clearly democratic, with decades of history, in an unacceptable and crazy way, which I would like to condemn here and now. I would like these words to be heard, because the European Parliament cannot be implicated in this way in a crazy declaration which I consider to be totally unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings. I have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform. We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers. That would be more productive and I do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already overloaded being cut again and again because of this kind of show-piece.

It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU's areas of competence. A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas.</p>
<p class="contents">One such area is tourism which, by its very nature, is very much a national concern. In so far as tourism falls within the political domain, it should be at national, regional and local level. Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU's financial support for less well-off regions. Even in that respect, any cooperation should, however, be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment, there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation. However, such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy. The report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism. However, the Swedish Christian Democrats would oppose any such development as we believe that tourism is a matter with which the European Union should only be marginally concerned.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to Parliament's various resolutions on the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which Parliament held last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday. The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available. They can also be consulted on the Commission's Internet website. I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament's comments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector. Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation. I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein’s firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stenmarck (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV) </span>Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition. And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long. The EU’s competition authority has intervened in all other areas, but not in the postal sector. We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the EU’s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market. We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States. That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission's determination to make progress serves as a model. The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects. It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices. All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market. It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now. It can hardly be because customers are satisfied. We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion. If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services. The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road. During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved. Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus. The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement. Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect.</p>
<p class="contents">Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies. They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services. It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993. That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player. However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen. That shows that competition really is working. My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too. It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I thought I had the floor. Perhaps we can discuss this later on. However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly. That is usually the case. That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997? There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now. I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today. I am very fond of him. He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners. It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive. Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties. That has only happened recently. For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this. We really have not progressed very far.</p>
<p class="contents">However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about. It was about gradual liberalisation; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector. These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The postal service is not just for Christmas. It is for life. In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service. It is about keeping communities together. The postal service is also the bus service. The postal service is also the social service. The postal service is also the doctor. If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities – we were voting earlier on tourism – will lose their tourist trade. We will cut them off.</p>
<p class="contents">The postal services are important. That message must be taken back from here today. The Commission must listen to it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should first of all stand for better service. This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly. Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer’s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically? The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet? </p>
<p class="contents">Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready – at least partly ready – by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition. </p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, as a new MEP, I am trying to get to grips with the dossier and I must admit that I have great difficulty doing so. I have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the European Commission at the time, and I am also coming across documents from Post-Europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect. I think that the Commission could have been more pro-active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested. As far as I know, that has still not happened. I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help me in my task as a new Member. Like Mr Miller, I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or, if at all possible, within the next couple of days. </p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the universal provision of services. What is happening on this score, how much does it cost, how does it work, how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have? I would welcome more concrete information on this. Apparently, the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so. There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office. Moreover – and Mr Miller has already pointed this out – it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round, even in my country, however densely populated it may be. But in Belgium too, there are a great number of people, older people for example, who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman. We should not overlook this fact: postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels. </p>
<p class="contents">The postal service is also extremely important to companies. A study has shown that 90% of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10% between individuals. What exactly do you intend to liberalise? I would like more information on this, because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services. There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job. We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed to a universal postal service, as the European Parliament has shown on several occasions, the postal service is actually, as some speakers have already mentioned, a key factor in social and territorial cohesion. In this connection I should like to ask one of our Swedish MEPs for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of Sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution. That is not the sort of postal service that we want.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic value of the postal service was recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail. It is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a ‘public service’, which makes it possible for everyone resident within European territory to receive the service, and this entitlement must remain an acquired right, an <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter of the European Union’s recognition of a high-quality postal service, available to all, remains valid today, and we are increasingly concerned. That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism come Monday. Let us point out that Parliament’s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them. This resolution of 14 January 1999 required that, prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector, involving 1.7 million employees after all, the Commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation. Well, we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses, something we certainly do not want.</p>
<p class="contents">We value our public service, our universal postal service, because we know, and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens, that the citizens value this service and the Commission undertook, during Mr Bolkestein’s hearing, to maintain this universal service throughout the European Union. I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them.</p>
<p class="contents">We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive. We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of "privatisation" and "liberalisation"! Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations. Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment. I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services. Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk. Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union. So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days. On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying. We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament’s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003. Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block. The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case? Apparently, they were. It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year. Moreover, the Commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which, according to Article 23, it was to submit by 31 December 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Should we complain about this delay? We do not think so. If the Commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards, no one doubts that it would present it without delay. For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable. In these circumstances, it is quite reasonable for this House to express concern today, asking an oral question which urges the Commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks? The main risk is that the Commission, without adequate justification, might upset the balance which exists now by proposing to go swiftly on to a second phase of liberalisation which would, in some countries, throw off balance the funding of the universal postal service, making it unmanageable. Today, following the 1997 compromise, Member States can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff, with a weight of less than 350 grammes. It may be supposed, for example, as Commissioner Bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 September last year, that the Commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 grams and two and a half times the basic tariff. This solution would not, in our opinion, be a fair one and indeed the Commission would have no irrefutable figures to support it. But, unfortunately, we are aware since Seattle that the Commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The second scenario, which we prefer: to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper, detailed objective study of the effects of the 1997 directive. In saying that, we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with, but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wonders if the idea of foisting unified management rules on the postal services of the fifteen Member States might not be, essentially, flawed. In France, for example, the unequal distribution of the population over a vast territorial area makes the obligation to provide a public service absolutely indispensable in mail distribution if one wishes to maintain the equality of citizens and social cohesion. But other countries, in other situations, may have alternative analyses. In our opinion, each one must be free to make its own organisational choices. </p>
<p class="contents">In fact, Article 86 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 90, stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them. But who defines these tasks? Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised? Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures. To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Esclopé (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered. During Mr Bolkestein’s hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking “that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted.” What has become of it? Do we have the results of this impact study? As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service.</p>
<p class="contents">Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation. Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed. This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service. I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, “The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000” – you can see how topical this is – “the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present.”</p>
<p class="contents">So you can appreciate why I am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation, and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation. As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day. The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents. So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home. If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression. </p>
<p class="contents">Once again, Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants. They will be told that they are too expensive, without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services, where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas. Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle. They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment. In sport the saying goes, “Do not change a winning team.” Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory? The universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget. </p>
<p class="contents">We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood. We are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes, or even 50 grammes. So be it. But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies. So, once again, why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest, valued in France, by Senator Larcher, as it happens, at FF 8 billion? </p>
<p class="contents">If revenue is lost, then public interest operations will be revised and cut, and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made. What we should do now, I feel, is wait, particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service, which many of our fellow citizens still value highly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it. In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland, for example, English companies certainly operate there. But this directive has never been transposed into national law.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives. That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government. A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators. But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands. This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a rural area. I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years. For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago. I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation. We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education. Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel. So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided. So, the Commission, in bringing forward their new proposals, must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services. In rural areas, for many years, even before the Irish Free State came into existence, we sometimes had this service of a post office. Today, it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service. But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland. I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service. It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas. We must implement what the directive insists on, that the postal service is available to everybody.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As is known, the Commission should already, before the end of 1998, have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/67, guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service, securing its economic viability, and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved, including postal workers and customers. To that end, the Commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services, the consequences of liberalising cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector, the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process, excluding distribution, and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission – although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union’s Member States? The postal services in Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands or Belgium are, of course, all different. With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands? How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25%, as opposed to less than 5% in other countries? How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office’s business<span class="bold"> </span>abroad? We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject. It will most certainly be necessary, we say, because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable, to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits. But what will those limits be? Are we naively to grant ‘freelance’ enterprises the right to operate selectively and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot, of course, be checked?</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means towards improving services.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves, what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide? This question should be answered in light of the fact that the age-old monopoly has <span class="italic">de facto</span> been undermined by all kinds of courier companies and by technological developments, such as fax and e-mail. </p>
<p class="contents">But then again, the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment. Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect. I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company. </p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce. One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs. In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance. Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices, especially in rural areas, play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities. Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services. Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery. Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on. But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result. Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments. Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote. They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs. </p>
<p class="contents">I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village: “The postal service belongs to us all; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft”. The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors. The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices. They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees. </p>
<p class="contents">Such companies have always been around, but they used to be banned, whereas these days they are being heralded as progress. The end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices. They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages. They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff. </p>
<p class="contents">It is time we stopped this trend. A fault confessed is half redressed. We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Incidentally, many thanks to Mr Scharping, the Chairman of the European Social Democrats, for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in Austria from his homepage and therefore not advising anarchists in favour of violent action to go to Vienna tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that electronic mail, electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future. I also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service. We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market. I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular, which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe. Even the tiniest village has a post office and in future e-commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e-mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means. That is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important. The collection, sorting, transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension. I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests. We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid. That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services. We should take a look – thinking also of benchmarking – at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector. This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service? I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive. We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender. In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system.</p>

By equalising tariffs, i.e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them.</p>
<p class="contents">They also play a major role in maintaining links between people. As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities? Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs. We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe. Indeed it is regrettable that to date – as the resolution we are debating points out – the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999. That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved. These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects. The delays in the Commission’s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question. </p>
<p class="contents">By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases. The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland. It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that. I do not believe that it is anybody’s intention to do so. I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece. But they might accidentally do great damage. The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place. If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate. The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability.</p>
<p class="contents">The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily. The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes. On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously. I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances.</p>

A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff.</p>
<p class="contents">This service must therefore be kept public. This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators.</p>

<p class="contents">I think ours is a different approach! European policy has liberalised monopoly markets – energy, telecommunications and air transport – and the target, the focus, was always the consumer. The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services. I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs. He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so!</p>
<p class="contents">The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here. I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends. I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr Rübig, who also talked about e-commerce. That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market. It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy. We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe? These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy. And here I want to turn to an area where in my view – and this is a point also made in this debate – Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition. We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I believe that, as this debate has shown, we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas. So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament. I have mentioned the example of social services before: nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer, including the pensioner in an old people’s home, and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition, whether that is the right course. I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits, the positive aspects of competition. For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I emphasise the word ‘could’, and that is if it is done well and with care. Wrongly done, the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality. Social problems will increase, interregional disparities will grow, and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest, areas where there are more people and, especially, more businesses. On the other hand, the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants, and the people that will not benefit from the new services.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology. I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland, as testified by the present public system. I think, however, that common rules have to be applied to this sector, so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the Wild West, or even the Wild East. We need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers, millions of service users, in a great rush.</p>
<p class="contents">But, despite the unfavourable opinion of ten European postal services, a form of unacknowledged privatisation is brewing in the corridors of the Commission. By lowering the price/weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising mailshots or cross-border post, the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector. Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether total or partial, privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse. Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of fighting amongst themselves, public postal services should cooperate, take staff on and guarantee decent, stable working conditions, while meeting the needs of service users in terms of both post delivery and savings bank services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding. This study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last. I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now. Today’s debate makes it quite clear that Parliament wants more emphasis on speed, not speed at the expense of quality, but then slowness alone does not mean quality either.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my second point, namely the snail as symbol of our postal services. What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold. Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner, but it still takes far too long. That means that since the days of mail-coaches and taxis, we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services. It may be true, as was said here, that today we have new possibilities, e.g. electronic possibilities such as e-mail, but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very, very important role and that, in particular, young families, the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail. </p>
<p class="contents">So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms, namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other, define the limits. But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite! By embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial privatisations we have also witnessed in Germany, we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation, which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise!</p>
<p class="contents">Some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman. Let me add to that, the importance of the post offices. They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas. I come from Munich, a very densely populated urban conglomeration, but we have the same problem there. One urban district post office after another is being closed down. We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities, who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops. That is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people. For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening, that reflects a rapid decline in quality, while at the same time prices are sometimes rising, which is something else we must note.</p>
<p class="contents">So, yes to liberalisation, but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation, rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission. I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste. That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not know if Mr Monti is aware of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of last week, 10 February, which recognised the possibility of the German postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly.</p>
<p class="contents">Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation – before 1 January 2003 – because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates. This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union, what consequences would that have for free competition? For the moment, it appears that, in the only country where liberalisation has taken place – Sweden – there has been a 59% increase in the price of postal services. We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place. It is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries, which will no doubt have implications for competition, which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations. For example, there are currently companies which set up in Holland because the postal charges are lower than in Germany and the same may happen in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wonder whether the Commission’s package on postal liberalisation will include the preservation of free competition, because it is very possible that – as has happened in most sectors in the Community today – it will lead to concentrations of large companies which will cancel out the benefits of this theoretical liberalisation. At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised – as is the case with national postal services – there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs. In a service which is theoretically liberalised, free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies abusing their dominant position, agreements between companies and other similar circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation, taking strict account of free competition, because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future. My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For us in Finland, a sparsely populated country, a visit to the post office is a social event. In the world of networking, the mail service is the most democratic of all networks. It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships. The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers. For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure. Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down. Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone’s reach in society. The post office is democracy. It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies. Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50% of companies’ turnover.

<p class="contents">In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt, on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service. Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I would suggest that there is a solution. It is already employed widely in the transport sector. Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender. The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract. Let us call this a negative tender franchise. This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system. Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner? The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time. Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender? It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national – probably under overall EU supervision – to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose. Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States. It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all. Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a shop. It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend. Often they are located together, each service being made more viable by the existence of the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Scotland also has many island communities, some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries. It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across London. And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged. The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes. That is the measure of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service. It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein. May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal. Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation. This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu. The Commission’s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware. But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made. It is Commissioner Bolkestein’s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year. The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible. The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive. A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence. The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003. Further liberalisation will occur afterwards. In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services. The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity. The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up. So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality. Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance. This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers. We can see in the incumbent operators, in public post offices, a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers’ needs continues.</p>
<p class="contents">The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal. That proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs – not to fewer jobs – in the framework of a progressive, gradual evolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of universal service was mentioned by Mrs Isler Béguin, by Mr Miller, whom I thank for his personal message, and by many others. We are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion, especially in the sparsely populated rural areas, one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning. We believe that the universal service is a pillar and I am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Gillig, but others like Mr Markov and Mr Ésclope, voiced concerns about employment. Experience in other sectors show a sort of U-curve pattern: a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place, as, of course, the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive; then a second phase of steady employment, as new jobs in newcomer operators balance further potential employment reductions; finally, a third phase of net job creation, both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation. The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">On the availability of the studies, – a point raised by Mr Staes and others – copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999. They have all been available on the Commission’s Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested.</p>
<p class="contents">The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services. I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data. This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection. Does that not say a lot about management ability? No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties. Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition. Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring. Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators. This applies both to the post and other sectors. If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July. We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made. The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post’s numerous recent acquisitions. I will not go into the details due to lack of time, but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses. In a sense this is where its work begins.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition. In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition. That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone. Most companies hate competition. Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty. The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern. The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers. Postal services must continue to be public services. All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions. In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities. Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff. The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff. Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities. I wholeheartedly agree. However, it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints. In my own country, Italy, there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately ITL 50 million a year per capita, or EUR 25 000, that is, a total cost of around EUR 5 million. Liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra ITL 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled. That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail. I know that this service is unprofitable. It would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services. Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money. If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee, particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service, then the public service must be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service, even if our post offices operate like businesses. They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If liberalisation continues in this area too, then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service.

<p>At present, there is a ban on the use of the bovine growth hormone (BST) within the European Union. However, there is a loophole regarding the importation of milk and milk products produced from cows given this hormone.</p>
<p>How soon can the proposed Authority deal with this issue?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Council has decided to provide a joint answer to the questions by Mr Seppänen, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo and Mrs Scallon, as all three concern food safety and the establishment of a European Food Authority.</p>
<p>1. In reply to the questions by Mr Seppänen and Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, the Council wishes to stress that, following the Commission's submission of its white paper on food safety, a wide-ranging debate has been taking place on the Commission's suggestions concerning a European Food Authority. The principle of such an authority has been warmly welcomed by the Member States. The Commission is preparing a timetable under which it is hoped that the Authority will be set up in 2002. Mr Seppänen will no doubt agree with me that it would at this stage be premature to speculate on a geographical location for this new Authority.</p>
<p>2. Following on from answer No 1 and in reply to Mrs Scallon, the Council considers that the European Food Authority, once set up, would certainly be competent to deal with matters related to the impact of growth hormones on milk and dairy products. On 17 December 1999, the Council adopted a decision to prohibit the marketing and administration of growth hormones for livestock, on the basis of scientific considerations related to animal health and welfare. As is stated in the final recital of that decision, it has been established, by the report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, that BST can adversely affect the health and welfare of animals.</p>
<p>Concerning the problems related to human health, the Commission, when it adopted the above decision, stressed that the Scientific Committee (Public Health) had, with respect to consumer risk assessment, drawn attention to the lack of available data, and that should scientific developments confirm the existence of the risk the Commission would submit suitable proposals to the Council with a view to ensuring appropriate risk management, which would also cover imported products.</p>
<p>In the present state of scientific knowledge, there is no justification for a ban on public health grounds on imported dairy products obtained from BST-treated cattle. Such a ban would not be compatible with the Community's international obligations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Can the Presidency say what efforts it will make to put regional policy at the centre of this programme, in other words to begin by narrowing the gap in technology that currently exists within the UE? What concrete proposals will the Presidency be making to ensure that the peripheral regions of the Community are given priority in any plans to create a more democratic and widespread access to new technologies, thus compensating, in some measure, for their disadvantage?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Modern information technology makes an important contribution towards eliminating the disadvantages of peripherally located regions. The Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration of the European Community therefore puts a distinct emphasis on the development of the necessary technologies: Euro 3.6 billion have been allocated to its Specific Programme ‘User-friendly Information Society’, during the period 1998-2002. This programme is closely co-ordinated with activities supported by the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Presidency of the Council has given full consideration to the regional dimension of the development of the innovation and knowledge society. The Special European Council of 23-24 March in Lisbon, ‘Employment, economic reforms and social cohesion – for a Europe of innovation and knowledge’ is called upon to define, at the highest level, a new strategy for growth, competitiveness and employment. Its key question is how to develop a society of innovation and knowledge with more and better employment perspectives and increased social cohesion as between the different regions of the European Union. The preparatory paper submitted by the Presidency contains the blueprint for an ambitious but realistic approach to the challenge of the innovation and knowledge society. By reinforcing RTD activities, enabling broad access to Internet, speeding up the construction of trans-European broadband telecommunication networks and ensuring the wide dissemination of the necessary information technology skills through education and training of the population, it aims to remove most of the remaining problems, particularly prevalent in the peripheral regions, with regard to access to innovative technology and information.</p>
<p>The Commission submitted its Communication ‘Europe, An Information Society for All’ on 17 December 1999; this will also be discussed at the Special European Council. This document calls for an ‘Europe’ initiative with the ambitious aim of bringing everyone in Europe – every citizen, every school, every company – online as quickly as possible. Both the Fifth Framework Programme and the Regional Funds are called upon are called upon to contribute to financing the efforts required.</p>
<p>The Presidency further intends to initiate a political debate on the Commission Communication ‘Towards a European Research Area’ at the informal meeting of Research Ministers on 6-7 March, with further, more formal discussions taking place at the Research Council on 15 June. The Commission’s paper, which sets the pattern for future thinking on the European Union’s RTD policy, suggests strengthening considerably the role of the regions in research and training in science and technology as well as creating centres of excellence and enabling the transfer of knowledge to the economic sector at regional and local level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0063"></a>

<p>The Council would like to remind the honourable Member that the process for amending the Treaties is laid down in Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union, which stipulates that the government of any Member State or the Commission may submit to the Council proposals for the amendment of the Treaties on which the Union is founded, that amendments to be made to the Treaties are adopted by common accord in a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States, and that the amendments shall enter into force after being ratified by all the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the importance of the opinion of political bodies below state level in discussions on amendments to the Treaty, but it is bound to recall that as the law stands, these bodies can only play a full role through national governments, in accordance with the constitutional requirements of each Member State.</p>
<p>With regard to information, political bodies below state level will be kept informed of discussions in the conference by their respective governments, in accordance with the processes applying at national level. Bodies below state level in each Member State will in this way be able to benefit from information coming direct from the conference, which has taken certain measures to ensure that its work is as transparent as possible. Accordingly, all official documents from the conference, together with all documents from public or private bodies transmitted to it, will be made available to the public using the most rapid and efficient means of communication.</p>
<p>With regard to any proposals or suggestions emanating from political bodies below state level, it will be possible for these to be taken into account in the same way as proposals from other public or private bodies which are not directly party to the conference.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the Committee of the Regions’ debates and opinions on topics discussed by the conference will of course reflect the concerns and wishes of bodies below state level in the Member States in respect of general questions of concern to them.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0073"></a>

<p>The Council considers that security of gas supply in the EU is of growing importance in view of the increasing EU dependence on energy imports. The priority of the Council attaches to this issue has been underlined in the Council conclusions of May 1996. Since then, the Commission has presented a Communication on EU Gas security of supply in November 1999, which the Council is examining with great attention under the Portuguese Presidency. The conclusions which will be presented to the Energy Council in May 2000, will take into account all aspects of security of supply, including the impact of enlargement.</p>
<p>As concerns the ongoing enlargement negotiations, specific attention is being given to nuclear issues. On 7 December 1998, the Council adopted conclusions on nuclear safety in the context of the enlargement of the European Union which give a clear message to the candidate countries. In particular, they emphasise the necessity of the earliest practicable closure of reactors which cannot be upgraded to international accepted levels of safety at a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>The Council is convinced that the accession of new Member States will contribute positively to the achievement of the objectives of energy policy: security of supply, competitiveness and protection of the environment. Furthermore, the Council recalls that the enhancement of the external dimension, including the enlargement process, is part of the strategy for integrating environmental aspects into energy policy that was submitted to the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999.</p>
<p>In this strategy, the Council sets a high priority on the promotion of new and renewable sources of energy, which will contribute to an increased use of environment-friendly renewable energy sources and thereby lead to diversification of energy sources.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0075"></a>

<p>In recent month, the “tax package” has been the subject of heated debate in the Council and the various bodies concerned with this dossier. This applies both to technical meetings and high-level meetings. These debates have revolved around both technical issues and issues of principle. Whilst enormous progress has been made, especially with regard to the Code of Conduct on business taxation and the Directive on the taxation of interest and royalty payments, it was not possible to agree conclusions on the three elements of the “tax package” before the Helsinki European Council on 10 and 11 December 1999.</p>
<p>In view of this, the “tax package” dossier was presented to the European Council which, in its conclusions, requested the Council to establish a high-level working group with the remit of finding solutions to the present problems, in particular with regard to the Directive on the taxation of savings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 31 January 2000, by way of follow-up to the above-mentioned conclusions of the European Council, the Council set up a high-level group on taxation. This group is to present to the Council an overall report on possible solutions to outstanding problems as well as on the Code of Conduct on business taxation and the Directive on the taxation of interest and royalty payments. This group is due to meet for the first time in February 2000, and the Council will in turn present a report to the European Council by June 2000 at the latest.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0086"></a>

<p>Relations between the EU and Libya, which have been troubled for years, were once again put to the test by Romano Prodi's invitation to Muammar Gaddafi, which was ultimately withdrawn without any justification of substance. Ongoing promotion of cooperation with Mediterranean countries is a basic EU priority. Phasing Libya into the Mediterranean cooperation programmes is absolutely vital and the EU institutions must therefore make a cautious and measured attempt at rapprochement with Libya. Hasty and superficial moves only produce negative results which run counter to the objectives of a long-term policy. Apart from the lack of clarity about the practical arrangements involved, there are huge question marks over the haste with which Prodi's invitation was issued and the unsatisfactory procedure used.</p>
<p>Can the Council explain the grounds for the invitation? What procedures were followed and what were the circumstances under which it was issued? What strategy will it pursue in the immediate future to create the appropriate structures for an effective endeavour to integrate Libya into the EU's policy of cooperation in the Mediterranean?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. The Council is aware that the human rights situation in Syria is not acceptable, despite the progress made in recent years. The Syrian Government signed the Barcelona Declaration in 1995, in which it undertook to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. More recently, in 1998 and 1999, Syria has freed hundreds political prisoners with long sentences, including Lebanese citizens. The Council is pleased that these prisoners have been freed, but remains concerned about the remaining prisoners of conscience, about reports of torture, the continuation of the state of emergency and the absence of freedom of expression. The Council is also pleased that Syria is considering signing the Convention against Torture and the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women.</p>
<p>2. The Council remains concerned about political prisoners and continuing reports of torture. This applies in particular to the five human rights defenders of the Committee for the Defence of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria (CDF), who are still being detained despite having completed prison sentences of eight to ten years imposed by the Supreme State Security Court in 1992. Just as for other countries, these cases are being monitored through joint reports by the Heads of Mission in Damascus. The conclusion of the agreement, which should include a framework for regular political dialogue, should permit these reports to be stepped up and to be presented on a regular basis.</p>
<p>With regard to the future EU-Syria Association Agreement, this should include the section on human rights. The Commission recently confirmed this as being the European Union’s position during the latest round of negotiations on the association agreement, having stressed that respect for human rights is an essential part of all Community agreements with third countries. On this occasion the issue of the state of emergency was also raised, and there is an expectation that Syria will ultimately abolish this law, in particular once it has signed a peace agreement with Israel. During the visit which the High Representative, Javier Solana, paid to Syria in January 2000, there were again discussions on EU-Syria relations and the Middle East peace process (MEPP).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0096"></a>

<p>The Council is concerned about violations of human rights in Turkey. Referring to the cases mentioned by the Honourable Member, it is aware that Dr Ayan, a psychiatrist working at the Izmir Office of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey, was detained with 74 others on 30 September 1999 in a village near Izmir, when they tried to attend a funeral of a prisoner killed in Ankara Central Closed Prison.</p>
<p>The Helsinki European Council decided that Turkey is a candidate State destined to join the Union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to the other candidate States. Compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria is a prerequisite for the opening of any accession negotiations. The Council underlines that stability of institutions guaranteeing human rights and respect for and protection of minorities is one of the Copenhagen political criteria. The Council believes that its decisions in Helsinki will encourage Turkey to take further steps in the field of human rights and democracy.</p>
<p>As has been the case for the other candidates, and building on the existing European strategy, it was agreed in Helsinki to establish for Turkey a pre-accession strategy to stimulate and support its reforms. This will include enhanced political dialogue, with emphasis on progressing towards fulfilling the political criteria for accession with particular reference inter alia to the issue of human rights. In practice, in all the political dialogue meetings with the Turkish authorities at the level of Foreign Ministers (Association Council scheduled for 11 April) and Political Directors (meeting scheduled for 30 March), as well as the Joint Parliamentary Committee meetings (scheduled for 21-23 February), the Council addresses human rights issues.</p>
<p>It is in this framework that the Council can best address cases such as the ones referred to by the Honourable Member, including asking for further information on the circumstances of detention and for speedy clarification of the charges.</p>
<p>The Council underlines that, in the spirit of the European Parliament’s request made to the Council in the context of the EP’s assent to implement the final phase of the Customs Union, it continues to closely monitor human rights and democratic developments in Turkey.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0108"></a>

At the third preparatory meeting, held in Brussels on 26-28 January, agreement was reached on key issues. The OAU Algerian chair has now dropped its demand that the so-called ‘SADR’ (Sahara Arab Democratic Republic) would be invited. We are now in agreement on the content and structure of the agenda. The EU Troika will be meeting the African side again in Pretoria on 21-22 February to continue the preparatory work and address the still outstanding issues. Once these are solved, substantial work remains to be done in the short time remaining until the Summit.</p>
<p>Though it is still not possible to guarantee that the Summit will be held in Cairo on 3-4 April, as planned, the prospects today look far better than they did only a few weeks ago. Both the EU and the African side agree on the need to hold the Summit as scheduled and I am hopeful that our representatives will now be able to successfully conclude the preparations. I wish to confirm that for the EU, the full participation of Morocco at the Summit is absolutely essential.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0111"></a>

<p>1. The Council does not share the honourable Member’s view that the Y2K problem was merely a major hoax. The risk of electronic and computer systems malfunctioning in such vital areas as electricity and water supply, transport, health care and so on was very real. For this reason the Council believes that the authorities responsible in these areas were right not to underestimate the danger that this computer problem posed, both economically speaking and as regards human safety. Notwithstanding this, although an EU-level coordination effort was mounted in order to address this situation in a coherent way, it is impossible to quantify the cost of this operation, as it was supported by all the public and private bodies concerned in the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p>2. On the other hand, the Council shares the honourable Member’s concerns about the development of a number of endemic diseases which were thought to have been eradicated, and about the spread of certain viruses and infectious diseases such as AIDS, which are jeopardising the already fragile health systems of many developing countries. Unfortunately, the EU is not in a position to provide a definitive response to scourges of this kind. Nevertheless, I can assure Mr Theonas – and the major debate on development policy held in this House today is proof of this – that the EU is once more doing everything in its power to provide these countries with aid to encourage, as far as possible, their economic development and to alleviate the problems their population suffer. Contrary to the honourable Member’s statement, development aid and food aid provided by the EU itself and through its Member States are fortunately far greater than the amounts that were allocated to tackling the Y2K bug, and are amongst the highest per capita levels in the world.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0113"></a>

<p>On 25 November 1999, the Russian mathematician Dimitrii Neverovskii was sentenced to two years' imprisonment – the maximum penalty under Article 328 – by a court in Obninsk (Kaluga district) for his conscientious objection to military service. From the SIZO 37/01 prison in Kaluga where he is being held, Mr Neverovskii has once again, in an appeal published in Libération on 7 January 2000 and elsewhere, denounced Russian policy in Chechnya, while urging young Russian conscripts to ask to undergo the civilian service provided for in the Russian constitution as an alternative to military service. In an emergency resolution passed on 20 January, the European Parliament declared that it was 'stunned at the sentencing of (…) Dimitrii Neverovskii ' and called on the Russian authorities to 'review urgently the case of Dimitrii Neverovskii in the light of the Russian constitution'. On 18 January, Mr Neverovskii was transferred to a solitary confinement cell. On 26 January, he embarked on a total hunger strike. What approaches has the Council made to the Russian authorities, or does it intend to make to those authorities in the next few hours, to urge a rapid review Mr Neverovskii's trial and obtain his immediate release? </p>

<p>In order to deal with the present situation, the Council firmly supported the establishment of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), and has contributed to the appropriate budget. Furthermore, it has assumed responsibility for the fourth pillar of UNMIK, which is concerned with economic reconstruction and recovery.</p>
<p>To assess progress made to date by UNMIK, it is important to be aware of the extremely difficult circumstances in which it finds itself operating: the large number of refugees and people from Kosovo itself who have been made homeless and who have had to be rehoused; the destruction of the majority of the infrastructure; the radicalisation of all sections of Kosovo’s population both before and during the war; the collapse of the economy and the total absence of internal income from taxation; and the implosion of administrative structures at local and provincial level and of the police force and the judicial system, because of the war and because of ten years of neglect following the removal of Kosovo’s autonomous status by Belgrade. In this context, UNMIK, in conjunction with the other international bodies and organisations involved, has been able to make very substantial progress in achieving the objectives of UN Security Council Resolution 1244.</p>
<p>The Council also supports the decision of Bernard Kouchner, the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to create a provisional joint administrative council which should gradually bring all ethnic groups into the administration of Kosovo. To date, Kosovo’s Serbs have refused to take part in this or other similar bodies. The EU has appealed to Kosovo’s Serbs to reconsider their boycott, and to help in this way to build a multiethnic Kosovo and to guarantee a place for themselves in the new administrative structures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0120"></a>

<p>You will recall that in April 1999 the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO ruled that certain aspects of the Community banana regime were not in conformity with WTO rules. Since then, the Commission has conducted intensive contacts with interested parties with a view to putting forward a proposal, which would be generally accepted as resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>In absence of a solution acceptable to all parties, the Commission has submitted to the Council in November 1999 a proposal amending the EC banana regime. The proposal, on which the European Parliament has been consulted, is currently under examination within the Council. This document states that the discussions of the Commission with interested parties would continue during the period in which the Council and the Parliament are examining the proposal. By the time the Council is ready to take a decision, that is to say by the time Parliament expresses its opinion, the Commission will make a report on the outcome of the discussions with the interested parties. At present the Council is not aware of any progress in direction of an agreed solution.</p>
<p>The Council has consistently taken the view that the dispute with the US over the EU’s new banana import regime should be dealt with according to the relevant multilateral rules established within the framework of the WTO. As regards the concessions suspended by the US in the banana case, the EU is challenging before a WTO panel the compatibility of these sanctions, in particular because they were applied before a multilateral ruling was issued by the WTO.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0126"></a>

<p>1. The European Union is obviously aware of the various aspects of this process. As Elian Gonzalez is too young to take legal decisions, the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service (INS), which is part of the US Department of Justice, had to decide who could legally represent him. In addition to Elian’s father, a great-uncle and three attorneys claimed this right of representation. Having interviewed these persons and assessed the relevant facts, the INS determined that Elian’s father, Juan Gonzalez, who resides in Cuba, was the only person legally authorised to speak on behalf of his son in respect of his status as an immigrant in the United States.</p>
<p>2. Furthermore, according to the INS, there is no doubt that Juan Gonzalez has a genuine and continuing father-son relationship with his son. Juan Gonzalez also made it very clear to the INS that he wished Elian to return as quickly as possible. On the basis of these facts, the INS considered that Elian should return to be with his father, and stated that it was inclined to take the necessary measures for this return to take place on 14 January 2000. The INS emphasised that this decision was based on the facts of the situation and on the law, be it either US law or international law, which both recognise the privileged relationship between parents and children. Moreover, family reunification is an important principle in American immigration law and in INS practice. Janet Reno, the US Attorney General, publicly confirmed the position of the INS.</p>
<p>3. Before the family reunification could take place, the attorneys in Miami brought an action in the Federal District Court against the INS decision. US District Judge Hoevler has set a hearing for 22 February 2000 to determine his legal jurisdiction in this case, which is provisionally set for 6 March. The US Department of Justice and the INS have stated that they will defend this action. For its part, the European Union has no authority in this matter and will accordingly not intervene.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0091"></a>

<p>The Commission confirms that between 1994 and 1999 local development schemes represented approximately 10% of the total Structural Fund regional operations (approximately 15% including Community initiatives and innovative measures).</p>
<p>The concept of ‘local development’ covers a great range of types of operation, and so is sometimes difficult to consider in isolation. In addition, local development is not the primary goal of some types of operation (aid schemes for investment in business, training, infrastructure, etc.) which affect clearly designated areas or social groups.</p>
<p>For the period 2000-2006, the Commission has framed guidelines<a href="#defann_26_3" name="refann_26_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> intended to assist Member States in preparing future programmes. Local development and employment schemes are incorporated into several Community priorities (particularly in the sector devoted to regional competitiveness and the sector given over to the promotion of employment).</p>
<p>The new Structural Fund local development objectives (1 and 2) for the new period, representing approximately 80% of the funding (approximately EUR 160 billion for the given period) will continue to have considerable impact in regional and local development. The new Objective 3, although horizontal, will also play a role in promoting employment, including at local level.</p>
<p>The success of the approach advocated by the European Commission in the 89 territorial pacts for employment has made it possible to raise the awareness of political and economic operators and to promote this approach within regional programming (for example, Objective 1 Italy and Spain).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Commission considers it difficult to commit itself to a specific threshold to be achieved as far as local development is concerned. It does, however, note that Member States have clearly appreciated the value of combining endogenous development approaches with equipment operations or more sectorially based economic operations.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is probable that local development schemes will continue to increase in relative volume and their effectiveness will be acknowledged.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the region of Sarandapotamos in Kithairon a major EVDAP (Athens Water Supply and Drainage Company) project is under way to increase the capacity the River Mornos pipeline. The company management has decided, with the backing of the Ministry for the Environment, Regional Planning and Public Works, to install a pipeline in the bed of the River Sarandapotamos, despite the fact that this region is a wooded gorge of great natural beauty with a wide variety of rare flora and fauna. Some 8 000 trees will have to be felled for the project to be completed, and the mechanical diggers and the explosives will irreparably harm the wildlife (birds, reptiles and deer) and the balance of the ecosystem, brutally violating the wild beauty of this winding gorge.</p>
<p>Given that the project in question is funded at a rate of 65% by the Cohesion Fund, that the decision of the Ministry for the Environment, Regional Planning and Public Works (Official Government Journal No. 281/23.3.93) designates Sarandapotamos 'a site of special environmental importance which should be protected' and that studies and proposals exist for the project to be undertaken by means of an underground pipeline, will the Commission say what measures it intends to take to avert the threat to this invaluable natural site?

<p>The Commission, using Cohesion Fund appropriations, is funding together with the Greek authorities the project to increase the capacity of the Mornos Aqueduct linking the Mornos and Evinos reservoirs with the water treatment plants serving Athens.</p>
<p>The installation of an 8km pipeline in the bed of the River Sarantapotamos, which the Honourable Member is referring to, which is not associated with any classified area or any area proposed as such by the relevant Greek authorities under Nature Community legislation (Directive 79/409/EC<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the protection of wild birds and directive 92/43/EC<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the protection of wild fauna and flora), is one element of the major project to reinforce the Mornos Aqueduct.</p>
<p>The Commission is extremely concerned to ensure that the environment is protected. It pays particular attention to the conditions for the implementation of projects, especially environmental conditions, and requires that directive 85/337/CEE<a href="#defann_28_3" name="refann_28_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> be respected on the assessment of the impact of some public and private projects on the environment prior to the approval of cofinanced projects, and that the specific studies that are necessary be drawn up.</p>
<p>I can inform you that the project under discussion here, i.e. increasing the capacity of the Mornos aqueduct, has undergone an assessment of this type, in compliance with Greek law which incorporates the relevant directive. This appraisal has been concluded, by interministerial decision, conditional upon compliance with environmental conditions. This stipulated two alternatives for the installation of the pipeline: either its installation in the bed of the River Sarantopotamos or the construction of a tunnel.</p>
<p>According to the Greek authorities, the first option still requires forestry studies and feasibility studies to be drawn up (granting of permissions for access roads). These studies are still in progress. The definitive technical solution is to follow.</p>
<p>In this connection, I can assure you that the Commission shall remain attentive both to respecting the environment and to the conditions under which the project is executed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that the project will in principle be co-financed in the context of the community support framework 2000-2006. The exact amount of Community contribution will have to be agreed in the framework of the preparation of the relevant operational programme for the period 2000-2006.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is aware, a condition for the Community financing of specific projects is their compliance with the relevant provisions of Community legislation. However, the simple fact that a complaint has been submitted to the Commission contesting the legality of the award procedure for a specific project, does not constitute proof that a breach of the relevant provisions has taken place.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to note that, as the honourable Member already knows, it has received two complaints contesting the award of the Thessaloniki metro contract to the current contractor. As regards the first complaint, which was submitted in 1997, the Commission decided to close the case after receiving the clarifications and assurances from the Hellenic authorities.</p>
<p>The involvement of the Ombudsman concerns this complaint, which is evidently different from the second complaint, which was submitted to the Commission at the end of November 1999 and is currently under consideration. In that respect, the Commission does not intend to wait for the Ombudsman’s decision on the first complaint before assessing the merits of the second one.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to inform the honourable Member that it is in the process of finalising its examination of the second complaint. In this context, the complainant has already forwarded a copy of the concession contract (as published in the official gazette of the Hellenic Republic) to the Commission in order to facilitate its assessment of the case.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission put a proposal to the Council in March 1997, the main thrust of which is the need to modernise the Community system for the taxation of mineral oils and to extend its scope to all energy products.</p>
<p>The main aim of the proposal is to allow the Community to reap the full benefit of the single market and in this way, to meet its environmental objectives.</p>
<p>This proposal has been under discussion for three years in the Council. A compromise document presented last May by the German Presidency, which constituted the minimum acceptable to as many as fourteen Member States, was finally rejected due to strong opposition in particular from Spain.</p>
<p>As said to the Commission on 25 November 1999, during the discussion with the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, leaving one Member State out it would be ‘an ugly thing’, due to distortions to competition which would benefit the Member State staying outside. The Commission announced the intention to contact Madrid in April, after the upcoming Spanish elections, in order to explore whether a solution could be found. It remains committed to this position.</p>
<p>For these two reasons the Commission has not authorised preparations to apply the energy taxation proposal on the basis of the Treaty provisions on closer cooperation under Articles 43 to 45 of the EC Treaty and Article 11 of the EC Treaty. It takes the view that these provisions should not be used to implement a common framework of taxation such as for energy products.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to make the point that, pending the achievement of a political solution with Spain, it is important to continue discussions at expert level in order to tackle remaining technical problems, such as state aid, minimum taxation level for all energy products, tax exemptions or reductions and tax reimbursements. These issues are equally important and their discussion should not be postponed until a political solution is found with Spain.</p>
<p>It is also important to emphasise that the use of fiscal instruments is not enough to ensure the achievement of all Community commitments in the area of environment and the internal market. They need to be accompanied, in a balanced way, by other instruments of legal, technical or voluntary nature, in order to ensure the achievement of these commitments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0082"></a>

<p>Since 1 January 2000 the PSW (Dutch Pension and Savings Fund Act) has stipulated that pension capital may only be transferred from one pension scheme to another if there is a change of employment. This means that on reaching personable age a person entitled to a pension can no longer transfer his or her capital to a different insurance company, since there is no question of a change of employment. The most important reason for this provision in the PSW is to prevent the flight of capital abroad.</p>

<p>The question of the Honourable MEP refers to a law that entered into force in the Netherlands on 1 January of this year. Additional time will be needed in order to enable the Commission to assess the impact of the law on Community provisions. At this stage, only the following preliminary remarks can be made.</p>
<p>Two questions are in fact being asked. Does this provision distort competition? Does it infringe Single Market rules with regard to the free movement of services and capital?</p>
<p>As regards competition, European rules only apply (except the state aid rules) to anti-competitive behaviour of undertakings – i.e. entities that exercise an economic activity. The prohibition at stake is laid down by the Dutch State in the Dutch pensions and savings funds act. It follows that, even though the prohibition may possibly distort competition, the European competition rules do not appear to apply. It is only in case the Dutch State, by adopting the prohibition, has been involved in anti-competitive agreements, decisions or concerted practices or undertakings, that Article 3, 10 and 81 of the treaty may apply.</p>
<p>From a single market perspective, if the law prohibits the transfer to both domestic and foreign providers, there would apparently be no discrimination on the basis of nationality. Infringement of the free movement of services principle would seem difficult to prove.</p>
<p>As the provision prohibits residents to move the capital accumulated from one country to another, one could argue that the application of the free movement of capital principle is hampered. Such restriction would have to be justified by one of the general exceptions of the EC Treaty applicable to the freedom of capital movements, and in particular, could possibly be based on Article 58 which allows Member States ‘to take all requisite measures to prevent infringement of national law and regulations, in particular in the field of taxation and prudential supervision of financial institutions’.</p>
<p>The matter will be examined further, the Honourable Member will be kept informed of any action the Commission could launch in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0115"></a>

<p>The question is about cross-border credit transfers in euros: the Honourable Member is surprised at the fact that, given the same initial amount, the recipient may receive an amount which differs from one Member State to another and sometimes even from one bank to another.</p>
<p>Concerning the use of conversion rates between the euro and national currencies, as established by Community regulation<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, all the information available to the Commission indicates that they are being applied properly by banks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the use of these fixed conversion rates has resulted in exposing a whole range of charges previously hidden in exchange rates. Some of these charges, such as the exchange charges, have disappeared, but others, such as the handling and transfer charges still remain. These charges can differ greatly from one bank to the next. The introduction of the euro has thus had a considerable impact in terms of transparency regarding the costs of cross-border operations.</p>
<p>The Commission has known for a long time that cross-border operations involving small amounts are expensive. Following a number of studies in 1993 and 1994, it proposed a directive on cross-border credit transfers <a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which came into force on 14 August 1999. The directive requires a high level of transparency to be provided for clients with regard to costs and to the time necessary for a cross-border credit transfer. In particular it stipulates that, unless otherwise indicated by the party authorising the transfer, the recipient must receive the amount sent in its entirety.</p>
<p>More generally, the Commission agrees with the idea that the surcharge for cross-border operations is not compatible with the proper operation of the internal market. A single market, a single currency, and a single payment area are necessary. On 31 January 2000 the Commission therefore adopted a general communication on this issue of payments of small amounts within the internal market. The purpose of this communication is to find practical solutions to ensure that cross-border payments are as reliable, fast and inexpensive as domestic payments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The sinking of the Erika highlighted the environmental risks associated with the operation of oil tankers. The Commission has therefore started to draw up a communication on oil tanker safety.</p>
<p>As regards the possibility of controlling vessel access to Community waters, it is important to point out that the Community is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which does not permit measures to prevent access on the basis of general criteria such as the flag a vessel is flying.</p>
<p>The Commission is nonetheless convinced of the need to intensify vessel inspection within the Community both by Member States, in their capacity as port States, and by classification societies. Without prejudging the specific content of the communication, it is anticipated that vessel inspections carried out within the framework of the directive on the inspection of vessels by the port State will be intensified. In particular, greater attention must be paid to aspects relating to the structural condition of oil tankers.</p>
<p>The Commission also intends to propose strengthening the directive on classification societies and to take the necessary initiatives with a view to establishing charterer liability in the event of an accident.</p>
<p>The Commission further intends to propose measures to expedite the removal of single-hulled tankers which entail greater risk of pollution in the event of accident.

<p>The Commission has been informed of the results of a recent enquiry carried out in the United Kingdom<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This study examined the migration of epoxidised soya bean oil (=ESBO), which is used as a plasticiser in the manufacture of gaskets for the lids of glass containers used for baby food.</p>
<p>The results of this study showed that, generally, the level of migration of ESBO is largely below the legal limit (=60 mg/kg of food) applicable for this substance, according to the Directives 90/128/EEC<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and its Fifth amendment 1999/91/EC<a href="#defann_36_3" name="refann_36_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, both based on the opinion of Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). Moreover, the results of the UK study are quite in line with results obtained previously in another enquiry carried out in Sweden<a href="#defann_36_4" name="refann_36_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, where all the samples were below 60 mg/kg of food. In the UK enquiry however, 5 of 137 samples exceeded the legal limit. The implications of these results should be examined by extending the enquiry to other samples, representative of the current production. The Commission has already contacted the Joint Research Centre (Ispra) informally, in order to study the possibility of planning a large enquiry at Community level, as soon as possible. As a precautionary measure, the British authorities have asked producers to reduce the levels of ESBO migration because of this exceeding of the legal limit value, and the special characteristics of the consumption of food by babies.</p>
<p>Further to the previously mentioned experimental study, the Commission intends to collect all the data published on this specific issue, and to supply it to the Member States and the European professional organisations, in order to draw this new issue to their attention.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission agrees with the Honourable Member, and with the British authorities, on the appropriateness of writing to the producers of this type of plasticised gasket to ask them to reduce ESBO migration into baby food.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission agrees that efforts need to be increased in order to promote renewable sources of energy but at the same time, energy efficiency needs to be enhanced more vigorously. The Kyoto commitment is binding and therefore requires effective measures which lead to concrete and quantifiable reductions of CO2 emissions. Increased use of renewable energy sources and improved energy efficiency are the main tools available to meet the Kyoto commitment.</p>
<p>So far, measures at Community level have concentrated on actions of financial support (for research and demonstration of new technology, pilot actions to test new methods and for targeted information and training), and on voluntary commitments and agreements on both renewables and energy efficiency together with considerable cooperation, networking and exchange of experience. Many of the voluntary initiatives taken have been under the auspices of such Community programmes as Altener and SAVE and involve Member States agencies, institutions and local and regional governments, industries and branch organisations.</p>
<p>Recent indications from programme evaluations together with new statistics on energy intensity and on the use of renewables, show that there is a need for even more activity at Community as well as at Member State level. While continuing and possibly increasing financial support for research and demonstration, (a call for tender is currently open with a deadline for submitting proposals by the end of May 2000) pilot actions, information dissemination and voluntary agreements with Member State governments or industry, further regulatory measures have to be considered. One example is minimum energy efficiency standards for tradable goods. At the same time continued development of technology, infrastructure, the removal of market barriers and the creation of a level playing field for renewables are important tasks. The Commission is currently preparing a draft directive aimed at creating a framework for access for renewable energy to the internal electricity market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0101"></a>

<p>A top priority for the commission is to ensure that it meets the European Community's commitment to reduce its emissions of six greenhouse gases by 8% during the period of 2008 to 2012 in comparison with their levels in 1990. The Commission in 1999 issued a communication entitled ‘Preparing for implementation of the Kyoto Protocol’<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which examined possible ways of implementing the obligations of the Kyoto Protocol. The further elaboration and implementation of common and coordinated measures (CCPMs) together with, and as a complement to, national policies and measures will play an important role.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to use all its available legal and financial instruments and to propose new ones if necessary. Comprehensive information on this subject will be provided to the forthcoming Environment Council and to the European Parliament.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions form energy use if the most important greenhouse as. The Helsinki European Council considered the integration of environment into energy policy one of the key measures that can contribute to developing a sustainable energy system and to meeting the Kyoto target and beyond. The increased penetration of renewable energies would play a key role.</p>
<p>The measures and initiatives proposed by the commission in the White Paper ‘Energy for the future: Renewable Energy Sources’ are under implementation, following the Action Plan attached to the White Paper. Furthermore, new Community regulations regarding other policies (regional fund-ERDF), agriculture fund-Agenda 2000, development funds, etc.) now include measures aimed at promoting renewable energy sources. Also, efforts at national level in the Member States are considerable. The Commission is preparing a progress report on the implementation of the White Paper and the Campaign for Take-Off that will be issued during the coming months and transmitted to the European Parliament and the Council during the second quarter of the year. The Commission is also preparing a draft directive for a framework for access for electricity produced renewable energy to the internal market for electricity.</p>
<p>Taking into account the European Parliament and Council resolution on the White Paper, the Commission launched the ‘Campaign for Take-Off’ in April 1999 which is aimed at concentrating efforts in the key sectors (solar energy, wind energy and biomass) as well as attracting investments. At the same time, the promotional actions of the Campaign are on-going: the RE Partnership scheme is being implemented and Renewable Energy (RE) Partnerships have been signed with the industry (BP, REPSOL, etc), municipalities (Malmo, Vaxo, Bologna, Barcelona, etc.), and industry associations (geothermal, etc).</p>
<p>Concerning the ALTENER Programme, now being incorporated into the Energy Framework Programme, about 240 projects (on RES) have received Community support in 1998/1999. Calls for proposals are designed to support the renewable energy sources Strategy and the Campaign for Take-Off.</p>
<p>The statistical data provided by Member States to the European Statistical Office are now completed and consolidated up to the year 1997. The share of renewable energy sources at the end of 1997 was:</p>
<p>10.7 per cent of total primary production;</p>
<p>5.8 per cent of total inland consumption;</p>
<p>8.1 per cent of total inland consumption according to the substitution principle;</p>
<p>14.0 per cent of total electricity generation.</p>
<p>In the White Paper of 1997, the indicative objective is laid down as 12% for the contribution by renewable sources of energy to the Community’s gross inland energy consumption by the year 2010. As outlined above, the strategy in order to achieve this objective is to implement the Action plan of the White Paper.</p>
<p>Energy sector statistics (not yet consolidated) show that the trend of continuous increase, mainly in wind and solar but also in bio-mass, will be confirmed in 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to set up an efficient monitoring system in order to permanently monitor progress achieved. If the trend falls short of the expected results, the Commission will propose further measures in order to achieve the Community indicative targets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commissioner responsible for employment and social affairs, Mrs Diamantopoulou, recently appeared before the European Parliament’s Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights and, together with other matters, outlined the Commission’s new action plan for employment, which takes on board the provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam on action to combat discrimination based on sex, religion, race, belief, and so on. One of the grounds included in this article is the fundamental freedom of sexual orientation, yet, judging by what the Commissioner said, this has not been included in the Commission’s plan.</p>
<p>Although the Commission’s position on the application of Article 13 to all its policies is to be welcomed, there is some doubt as to whether all of the grounds referred to in the article are to be included.</p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to include in its plans all the grounds for discrimination referred to in Article 13, or only some of them, since it has so far failed to do so?

<p>The Commission is very active in the fight against all forms of discrimination, in particular in the employment and social fields.</p>
<p>The Commission has adopted on 25 November 1999 a package of two legislative proposals and a programme to combat discrimination in the Community based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty. Both the employment proposal and the action programme address discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Together, these two proposal will constitute a comprehensive basis for action to fight against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, providing a minimum level of legal rights, supported by practical action to promote the effective application of those rights on the ground.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the European employment strategy, the 1999 Employment Guidelines (new guideline 9) require Member States to give special attention to the needs of the disabled, ethnic minorities and other groups and individuals who may be disadvantaged in the labour market. In this regard, the Council Recommendation on the implementation of Member States responses have been lacking focus and calls for a coherent set of policies combining integration and non-discrimination.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new Community initiative EQUAL financed by the European Social Fund gives clear priority to an active and preventive approach to equal labour market opportunities for all.

<p>Over the last four years the Commission has engaged the Radio sector into a dialogue aimed at identifying the issues of importance. The sector was in fact asked, within the constraints of the principle of technological neutrality, to justify why action should be taken in order to support it. Even though the sector has responded vigorously to the Commission’s request, it has, so far, not been able to demonstrate the market failure which would justify Community action.</p>
<p>The Commission is in no way attempting to discriminate against radio, particularly by comparison to other media. Simply, the radio sector has been able to operate without creating the economic deficits prevalent in other parts of the audio-visual sector. The honourable Member touches upon the very important issue concerning the transition of radio to digital. This transition, which is expected to last several years, has to be seen across the whole audio-visual sector and is very closely associated with the so-called ‘analogue switch off’, the timing of which will vary from one Member State to the next. Any action, therefore, should have to be decided in due course and take into account not only any possible market failure but also to ensure that Member States are not discriminated against on the basis of their technological development and therefore their capacity to respond to any potential programme of support.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0038"></a>

<p>The Honourable Member refers specifically to an export credit guarantee by the British government to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu dam in Turkey.</p>
<p>Issuing insurance guarantees by governments for large, long term export transactions to third countries is commonplace throughout the world. There have been moves within the Community to harmonise progressively the differing systems inside the Community – e.g. by Directive 98/29/EC which entered into force on 1 April 1999. In addition, detailed rules have been agreed at the OECD for export credits of two years and more. World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules prohibit export credit guarantee programmes where they operate at premium rates inadequate to cover the long term operating costs and losses of that programme, and may, therefore, be considered a subsidy. The Commission would like to point out that there has never been a dispute in WTO regarding distortion of competition in relation to export credit guarantees granted by Member States.</p>
<p>As regards the specific transaction referred to, the Commission is aware that co-ordination has taken place between export credit agencies (ECAs) in order to ensure that all ECAs involved would put the same environmental conditions in their offer.</p>
<p>The Commission has no current plans to introduce proposals for further rules, but will continue to play an active part in negotiations at the OECD, in accordance with the conclusions of the G8 Summit in Cologne in 1999.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0043"></a>

<p>The Commission wishes to remind the Honourable Member that one of the chief objectives which the Community has been striving to achieve for a long time in the wine and spirits sector is in fact championing the protection of designations of origin and geographical indications as well as renowned traditional designations. The aim is to protect them at both Community and international level.</p>
<p>At Community level, in 1989 the Council adopted a regulation which affords exclusive protection to the geographical and traditional designations used for spirituous beverages sold within the Community.<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Under the terms of this regulation, the traditional designation ‘ouzo’ enjoys exclusive protection within the Community regarding spirituous beverages flavoured with aniseed manufactured in Greece and complying with defined particular specifications.</p>
<p>At international level, the Community has signed bilateral agreements for the protection of designations for spirits, including ‘ouzo’, with Mexico and Switzerland. The EC/Mexico agreement has been in force since 1 July 1999<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> whilst the EC/Switzerland agreement is currently being ratified. In current negotiations with a great many third countries, particularly the countries of eastern Europe and Canada, the Community is also promoting this objective to ensure that the term ‘ouzo’ is protected as a designation reserved exclusively for Greek products.</p>
<p>More particularly concerning the overall agreement between the Community and South Africa on trade, development and cooperation, signed on 11 October last year, Appendix X of this agreement in fact lays down specific protection conditions regarding the designations of origin ‘port’ and ‘sherry’.<a href="#defann_43_3" name="refann_43_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> This appendix does, however, also stipulate that a separate agreement on wines and spirits shall be negotiated between the two partners. In these negotiations which were held alongside the negotiations on the main agreement, the Commission left no room for doubt as to its determination to ensure that the protection of the Greek designation ‘ouzo’, and indeed of other terms (‘grappa’, for example), should form an integral part of the ‘wines and spirits’ agreement. To date, the South African delegation was not prepared, as a matter of principle, to grant such exclusive protection to Greek products alone. The implications of this situation are currently a matter for intense consultation between South Africa, the Council and the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of the reports on traces of cocaine in banknotes. Using banknotes as ‘paper straws’ for inhaling cocaine is a well-known way of administering this dangerous illicit drug. In the British study the Honourable Member is referring to 5% of the banknotes examined showed high levels of cocaine indicating that the notes had been handled by drug dealers or used to inhale the drug. The traces have then been transmitted from note to note e.g. in bank sorting machines. Mass spectrometric analysis, as such, is a reliable method to analyse traces of drugs but it is impossible to draw any conclusions on the availability of cocaine based on these kinds of studies alone.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member knows, the European monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol produce regularly statistics and analysis on the drug situation and trend in the drug use and drug trafficking in the Union. Based on this information, there does not seem to be any rapid rise in cocaine availability or use in the Union. Seizure statistics from Europol show a slight decrease in the amount seized in 1998 compared to 1997. Europol also collects information on the street price and purity of cocaine as an indicator of availability. The price and purity levels have been relatively stable in most Member States.</p>
<p>According to the latest figures from EMCDDA 1-3% of the whole adult population in the Union and 1-5% of young adults have tried cocaine. However, there are some signs of increased availability of cocaine, especially in metropolitan areas. The EMCDDA and national focal points are developing systems for early detection of new trends in drug use.</p>
<p>The Commission has already been active in developing methods for physical detection, drug profiling and biological monitoring of drugs and precursors. This is a priority in the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration Activities (1998-2002). The Community Programme on drug prevention funds projects that cover also prevention of cocaine use.</p>
<p>The new Drug Strategy (2000-2004) endorsed at the Helsinki European Council last December states that accurate and reliable information is a prerequisite for effective action and rapid reaction to the threat posed by drugs at local, national and Union level. The Commission, the Member States, Europol and EMCDDA will continue to work together in accordance with their respective roles and competencies to achieve this goal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0050"></a>

<p>Glyphosate is a plant protection product currently being evaluated in the framework of the first review programme of existing active substances undertaken under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92. The objective of the evaluation is to determine whether it can be included in a positive list of substances (Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC on the placing of plant protection products on the market) that can be used in plant protection products in the Community. The Regulation provided that any interested party could submit before 30 April 1995, to the Rapporteur Member State (for glyphosate, the RMS is Germany), technical or scientific information with regard to the potentially dangerous effects of the substance or its residues on human and/or animal health and/or on the environment. The Rapporteur Member State reviewed all information submitted for glyphosate and prepared a draft assessment report (monograph) on it. This was submitted on 1 February 1999 to the Commission and the other Member States.</p>
<p>According to the usual procedures provided for in the Regulation, the monograph was immediately forwarded for an expert consultation (peer-review) with specialised experts from five Member States to examine in detail all areas of human health and environmental safety (physico-chemical properties, toxicology, residues, ecotoxicology, fate and behaviour in the environment). Data gaps were identified and new data was requested, supplied and reviewed. The process also allowed that any other relevant new information be taken into consideration or be considered during further discussions with all Member States in the framework of the Standing Committee on Plant Health and its working groups. The monograph and the results of the peer-review for glysophate will be discussed by all Member States in the Evaluation Working Group to any other parties.</p>
<p>The monographs were always considered as draft documents reflecting the views of one Member State on (usually) incomplete data-sets. The Commission considered it inappropriate to release such draft documents because (i) they are intermediate documents in a long, thorough review process; (ii) they do not reflect the views of the Commission; (iii) being based on incomplete data packages, they might be misleading if not read together with the results of the technical and scientific information requested and supplied after their preparation; (iv) release would require clearance under the standing rules of the Standing Committee on Plant Health and (v) they represent the views of one Member State and these views often change on the basis of new information, of peer-review, and of exchanges of views with other Member States. Moreover, the volume of the documentation involved would place another huge burden on scarce Commission resources. Since 1996, the Commission has received about 65 such draft assessment reports. They range in size from about 300 to more than 1000 pages.</p>
<p>In all cases, before it takes a decision, the Commission consults the Scientific Committee on Plants and seeks the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health. Moreover, when a decision is taken, a review report with the most important information (overall conclusion, particular use or risk management conditions, major endpoints on identity, physico-chemistry, toxicology and environment) is made publicly available. The background information which includes the draft assessment report of the Rapporteur Member State, the report of the peer-review and all comments and clarifications submitted after the peer-review are kept available by the Member States, as laid down in all Decisions taken so far on inclusion of active substances in the positive list. As a final assurance, in all cases a decision on any active on any active substance can be reviewed at any time if there are indications that this should be done.</p>
<p>The current practice of not making available the monographs is now under review in the light of a number of factors, including the need for greater transparency in Community decision-making. The recent proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0030">COM(2000)30</a> final) regarding public access to documents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will inform this review.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will be informed of the outcome of this review process in relation to the release of monographs submitted to the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is following closely the issue of risks to health and the environment posed by brominated flame retardants.</p>
<p>The use of certain brominated flame retardants in textile articles intended to come into close contact to the skin has been prohibited in the Community for several years. These prohibitions were introduced in 1979 and 1983.</p>
<p>In 1991, the Commission proposed to ban the marketing and use of all 10 substances that are now under discussion because of possible risks to health and the environment. However, the European Parliament chose not to deliver an Opinion during its first reading and in 1995 the Commission decided to withdraw its proposal because of lack of political support.</p>
<p>These brominated flame retardants are currently the subject of risk assessment under Council Regulation (EEC) no 793/93 on the evaluation and monitoring of the risks of existing substances. Once the risk assessments have been finalised and reviewed by the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment, the results will be published in the Official Journal. Based on the results of these comprehensive assessments, the Commission will propose, if necessary, appropriate risk reduction measures.

<p>The Council and Parliament have recently agreed a Commission proposal for a Regulation on Orphan medicinal products, which provides some financial support to stimulate the research, development and marketing of medicinal products to treat rare diseases in humans. However, it is recognised that the main incentive introduced by this Regulation is market exclusivity for products that are designated as orphan medicinal products.</p>
<p>There are certain similarities between the human and veterinary sectors in the problems of availability of medicines for small markets. To certain extent, the lack of availability of veterinary medicines to treat ‘minor diseases’. In both cases, the research and development of potentially valuable medicinal products can be hampered by the absence of potential profits, which makes these areas unattractive for investment by the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>The Commission is prepared to consider adapting the approach adopted in the Regulation on orphan medicinal products to the development of veterinary medicinal products. However, it would have to be convinced that such a development would in reality stimulate the availability of veterinary medicines for minor species. For the time being, it is clear that there are major differences between the markets for human medicinal products and the markets for veterinary medicinal and such a project could not be undertaken without a clear assessment of both the costs, benefits and market implications of such a proposal. The Commission is currently working on a proposal to amend Council Regulation 2377/90<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and Council Directive 81/851/EEC<a href="#defann_52_2" name="refann_52_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, in order to address the problem of the existing lack of veterinary medicines for minor species and for certain indications (minor uses). This proposal will be sent as soon as possible to the Council and the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Finally, in the context of a general evaluation of the veterinary medicines approval system, the Commission has recently started the process of evaluating the entire system of authorisation and supervision of medicinal products in the Community. Based on this evaluation, a proposal for modifications to the existing system will be made to the Council and Parliament in 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has become increasingly concerned in general about the welfare of animals. The Commission’s responsibilities towards animal protection have increased under the recent amendment of the EC Treaty. The Protocol no. 33 of the EC Treaty on the welfare and protection of animals requires the European Institutions and Member States to consider animal welfare a priority when drawing up transport, single market and research policies.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware, both from information gathered during inspection missions and as a result of the receipt of complaints from animal welfare organisations, that journeys which are in breach of the provisions of Council Directive 91/628//EEC as amended are still taking place in the Community.</p>
<p>Concerning the importation of animals and in particular horses from third countries it should be noted that the greater part of the journey has often taken place before reaching the border of the Community. On this subject, the Commission is currently re-examining its position with regard to enforceability against operators who neglect the welfare of animals before they have reached the Community’s frontier.</p>
<p>A working group of the Standing Veterinary Committee has recently been established to consider particular problems in the enforcement of the Directive in respect of long-distance transport operations.</p>
<p>Concerning the experience of Member States derived from the application of Directive 91/628/EEC, a specific report will be presented to the Council and to the Parliament during the first quarter of inspections performed by the Food and Veterinary Office.</p>
<p>The Commission may consider amending current Community legislation on the basis of the conclusions of this working group.</p>
<p>The Commission will also, in due course, take decisions as to whether to open further infringement procedures under Article 226 (ex-article 169) of the EC Treaty against the Member States involved in respect of the most severe cases of inadequate enforcement of the rules of the animal transport directives.</p>
<p>In relation to the principal Eastern European third countries involved in the transport of livestock to the Community, various informal contacts have taken place in relation to animal welfare and the relevant legislation of those countries has been obtained. The Commission will consider making more formal approaches to the countries concerned in due course.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0067"></a>

<p>Research on climate change has continued to be supported by Framework Programmes during the last two decades. In line with the Swedish research, the other European climate models also predict an increase in global temperature and variability of precipitation while uncertainties remain as regards the regional impacts of a climate change.</p>
<p>The Key Action on Global Change, Climate and Biodiversity of the ‘Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development’<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> research programme of the Fifth Framework programme for research and technological development (RTD) targets the objectives of quantifying climate change prediction on decadal and seasonal/inter-annual variation time scales and to assess its impacts. In addition, it also includes a dedicated theme on Mitigation and Adaption to Global Change. The research under this topic comprises both socio-economic and natural sciences.</p>
<p>A coordinated research effort is already underway by forming clusters of relevant research projects. These projects provide input to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the international programmes (e.g. International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, the World Climate Research Programme, and the International Human Dimension Programme).</p>
<p>Mitigation strategies with regard to various impacts resulting from climate change will require a complex blend of geographical, social, economic and scientific information combined with carefully developed policy and instruments to implement that policy. The Commission is aware that these important aspects are likely to need further consideration in the future.</p>
<p>In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 8%, the reduction target foreseen in the Kyoto protocol, the Commission is currently in the process of identifying a number of policies and measures, especially in the area of transport and energy.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to launch the European Climate Change Programme (ECCP) in which all relevant stakeholders will be invited to cooperate towards the elaboration of a package of Community-wide policies and measures to the fulfillment of the Kyoto obligations as a first step.</p>
<p>Indeed, scientific evidence suggests that further reductions will be needed to mitigate the increase of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere thereby mitigating the impacts of climate change both in many developing countries, as well as developed countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European sea port policy is currently undergoing a number of developments mainly as a result of the Commission’s ‘Green Paper on Sea Ports and Maritime Infrastructure’ which was, in its outlines, endorsed by the substantial number of comments received from interested parties, by the Council and by Parliament.</p>
<p>The first immediate result of the Green Paper has been the Commission proposal to include sea ports in the Trans-European Network. This proposal is currently in the legislative process. We expect a positive outcome soon.</p>
<p>Peripheral areas have a specific treatment in the Decision 1692/96 on Community guidelines for the development of the Trans-European transport network – (TEN-T). The development of linking infrastructures to peripheral areas is set as a priority in Article 5(b).</p>
<p>Section 5 of Annex II of the existing TEN-T Decision fixes the criteria and specifications for port projects of common interest, paying particular attention to the development of intra-Community maritime links with island and peripheral regions of the Community.</p>
<p>In addition ports located in Objective 1 areas can benefit from Community Support Framework programmes and the Community Initiative Interreg actions for the period 2000-20006.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, the Commission intends to take initiatives in particular on access to the port services sector and on public money flows to and within ports whilst fully taking into public service obligations.</p>
<p>Inextricably linked to ports is short sea shipping. The Commission is currently setting out the details of a bi-annual work programme, together with Member States and all other interested parties, which should enhance the prospects of short sea shipping, and particularly so for the peripheral island regions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0076"></a>

<p>The Commission shares the concerns referred to by the Honourable Member with regard to child labour and other practices inconsistent with core labour rights. While the International Labour Organisation has well-established mechanisms for supervising the application of international labour standards, including the ILO’s minimum age Convention, these do not provide a basis for trade measures preventing the import of goods produced using child labour. The Commission remains of the opinion that the solution of such problems lies in the application of positive incentives and other forms of assistance, and not in the use of sanctions against countries which to not adhere to accepted standards in this field.</p>

<p>In its initial preliminary draft budget for 2000, the Commission proposed appropriations for the School Milk Programme of EUR 53 million. It subsequently raised this amount by EUR 31 million to EUR 84 million when it presented an amending letter to the preliminary draft budget in October 1999. The final amount adopted by the Budget Authority was EUR 83 million. However, this amount is unlikely to be sufficient to cover expenditure for the scheme under the current aid conditions.</p>
<p>In view of the tight budgetary framework and taking account of the conclusions of an evaluation study into the operation of the scheme, the Commission has recently submitted a proposal to the Parliament and the Council on a co-financing of the scheme. The proposal suggests an equal distribution of the financial burden between Community and national budgets, while allowing Member States to finance their share through a contribution from the dairy sector.</p>
<p>As to the possibility of extending this type of programme to other groups in the society, the Commission is not considering such initiative at the moment, notably in view of budget limitations.</p>
<p>It is important, however, to note that besides the school milk programme, a further EUR 211 million is foreseen in the 2000 agriculture budget for the distribution of food to less well-off groups in society.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0085"></a>

Ongoing promotion of cooperation with Mediterranean countries is a basic EU priority. Phasing Libya into the Mediterranean cooperation programmes is absolutely vital and the EU institutions must therefore make a cautious and measured attempt at rapprochement with Libya. Hasty and superficial moves only produce negative results which run counter to the objectives of a long-term policy.

<p>Several contacts took place since this conversation through regular diplomatic channels in both written and oral forms.

<p>The Commission has always stated that a cornerstone of the Erasmus programme is a good balance of flows between countries and disciplines, and that participating countries should try to guarantee a certain degree of reciprocity. This principle is clearly reiterated every year in the guidelines to the national agencies in charge of Erasmus to help them draw their national action plan for the mobility of students, as well as in the guidelines for the universities applying for an institutional contract within the framework of the SOCRATES/ERASMUS Programme. However, mobility flows cannot be totally controlled as they also reflect cultural trends and the attraction exerted by specific cultural and linguistic environments. It is precisely to try to cope with this imbalance in flows that the Commission has launched in 1996 a pilot scheme to organise intensive linguistic preparation courses in the less widely taught and spoken languages.</p>
<p>Given the fact that Erasmus student mobility is largely managed in a decentralised way, the Commission has to rely on the national relays for the promotion of the programme. The Commission provides support to the Socrates/Erasmus national agencies to organise information campaigns targeted to the largest number of potential applicants for the mobility scheme. National authorities supervising the higher education, national bodies in charge of its internationalisation and, in particular, the national agency running the Erasmus mobility programme, have also a role to play in offering incentives to partner institutions in the Erasmus programme so that they promote more efficiently the outward mobility. This can be done through a more active information policy – raising awareness, in particular, about the less favoured countries of destination – an a better linguistic preparation to allow more students to go abroad. The Commission works closely with its partners in that direction.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0090"></a>

<p>The Commission agrees that the increasing traffic volumes in and around Europe’s cities are creating serious problems for the quality of life of many European citizens.</p>
<p>The EC Treaty includes sustainable development, as one of the Community’s objectives and transport has to play a key role in achieving this. This requires a strategic approach. The Council made a first step in 1999 by adopting strategies to integrate environmental concerns into sectorial polices for transport and energy, and the Commission will this year revise the 1992 White Paper on the Common Transport Policy.</p>
<p>As part of the strategic approach, a new Green Paper will present views on how to develop more accessible, attractive and clean transport systems in Europe’s agglomerations, while reducing the role of the individual car.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees that information technologies can help reduce traffic-related problems. Intelligent transport systems and innovative services (traffic management, traveller information, on-demand buses, tele-shopping, etc) can help to reduce transport demand, but only as part of an integrated policy package and combined with demand management strategies.</p>
<p>Demand management has been addressed by the Commission’s transport/environment expert group in support of the Council integration strategy. The Community’s Fifth Framework Programme (FP5) for research and technological development (RTD) supports the development and application of IT based transport solutions through several Key Actions.

<p>The Commission is well aware that the human rights situation in Syria remains far from satisfactory, despite progress in recent years. It recalls the Parliament’s determined stand to delay approval of the 3 and 4 Financial Protocols between the Community and Syria in the early 1990s. This contributed to increased awareness on the Syrian side that human rights are of particular concern to the European Union in its relations with third countries.</p>
<p>Since then, the Syrian Government has signed the Barcelona Declaration in 1995 and released thousands of long-term political prisoners, including Lebanese citizens, most recently in 1998 and 1999. The Commission welcomes these releases but remains concerned over the remaining prisoners of conscience in Syria, reports about torture, the continuation of the emergency law and the absence of freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The Commission and its partners work towards continued progress on human rights in the spirit of Barcelona Declaration. That is, in a constructive manner based on dialogue. In this context, the most recent round of negotiations for the Community-Syria Association Agreement last November brought tangible progress. The Commission and Syrian negotiators openly discussed all issues pertaining to the human rights clause of the agreement. The Commission made clear that respect of universal human rights constitutes an essential element of all our agreements with third countries. It also raised the issue of the emergency law. The Syrian authorities indicated that the emergency law is not meant to be permanent and that Syria is in the process of eliminating it once the causes behind it would disappear. This could be connected to a final peace agreement with Israel. Syria is also considering joining the Conventions Against Torture and on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. These are encouraging developments.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission remains aware and highly concerned about political prisoners and reports of torture. This applies in particular to the human rights defenders from the peaceful Committees for the Defence of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights in Syria (CDF). While two CDF members have been released recently, there are still detained after serving eight-year prison terms imposed by the Supreme State Court in 1992. As in other countries, such cases are covered by a Community monitoring provided through joint reports by the Damascus Heads of Missions. This could intensify and become more regular with the conclusion and eventual ratification of the agreement;</p>
<p>The responsible member of the Commission will be visiting the Middle East including Damascus in early April. Discussions on human rights and the negotiations for the Association Agreement will continue then. But human rights will be also discussed in other countries of the region. At the same time, the Commission will also work on starting a new set of MEDA Democracy projects in the region this year promoting human rights and democracy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0098"></a>

<p>A business impact assessment appears as part of the documentation accompanying every legislative proposal, which has been identified as likely to have a significant impact on business. This is published as part of the document (COM), which is submitted to the Council. The Office of the Official Publications distributes these documents and they are, therefore, available to outside interests and scrutiny.</p>
<p>To answer the specific questions raised by the honourable Member:</p>
<p>In April 1999 the ‘Guidance Notes for DGs on Completion of Business Impact Assessments’ went to inter-service consultation, and had the agreement of the Directorates-General and the Secretariat-General. Within the new Enterprise Directorate General the system will be re-launched.</p>
<p>Business impact assessments should be carried out for any legislative proposal from the Commission deemed to have a significant impact on business.</p>
<p>The new Unit for ‘Regulatory co-ordination – simplification and impact of legislation on SMEs’ within the Enterprise Directorate general will take on the task of revising and strengthening the business impact assessment system. The commitment to carry out business impact assessments is firmly anchored in the new Enterprise Directorate General’s work programme for 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0110"></a>

<p>On 25 November 1999, the Russian mathematician Dimitrii Neverovskii was sentenced to two years' imprisonment – the maximum penalty under Article 328 – by a court in Obninsk (Kaluga district) for his conscientious objection to military service. From the SIZO 37/01 prison in Kaluga where he is being held, Mr Neverovskii has once again, in an appeal published in Libération on 7 January 2000 and elsewhere, denounced Russian policy in Chechnya, while urging young Russian conscripts to ask to undergo the civilian service provided for in the Russian constitution as an alternative to military service. In an emergency resolution passed on 20 January, the European Parliament declared that it was 'stunned at the sentencing of (…) Dimitrii Neverovskii ' and called on the Russian authorities to 'review urgently the case of Dimitrii Neverovskii in the light of the Russian constitution'. On 18 January, Mr Neverovskii was transferred to a solitary confinement cell. On 26 January, he embarked on a total hunger strike. What approaches has the Commission made to the Russian authorities, or does it intend to make to those authorities in the next few hours, to urge a rapid review Mr Neverovskii's trial and obtain his immediate release? Furthermore, what steps does the Commission intend to take to enable a representative of the European Union to visit the prison where Mr Neverovskii is being held to check on his state of health and talk to him? More generally, what steps has the Commission taken, or does it intend to take, to urge the Russian authorities to finally transpose into law the right of conscientious objection enshrined in the Russian constitution?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Many municipalities and counties in Sweden have opted to allow competition for the provision of services that were formerly local authority operated and controlled. However, this has provoked widespread criticism, especially in the case of public transport. One point that has not been adequately clarified concerns the scope for returning such services to local authority control after the relevant contracts have expired.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider the return to local authority control of services which have been opened up to competition, and the operation thereof by local authorities, to be compatible with Community rules?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The question concerns the relationship between services of general economic interest and Community law. In essence, it is asked whether Community law would allow to re-monopolise certain communal and regional services which were previously opened to competition.</p>
<p>Granting and maintaining an exclusive right for the performance of certain services could be contrary to Community law, in particular the rules on the freedom of establishment of the free movement of services, as undertakings from other Member States are excluded from establishing themselves in the Member State concerned and providing the same services. According to the case law of the European Court of Justice, a monopoly can be justified by imperative requirements in the public interest or to the extent it is necessary for the necessary for the performance of a public service obligation in the sense of Article 86(2) (ex article 90) EC Treaty. The Court has made clear that the State measure in question must be apt to realise the objective pursued and has to comply with the principle of proportionality which means that it must not go beyond what is necessary to attain this objective.</p>
<p>On this basis, a monopoly for local or regional public services could for example be justified it can be shown that in order to guarantee that all consumers have access to certain essential services of high quality at affordable prices there is no less restrictive means than to grant an exclusive right to one single operator. However, where competition has already been introduced in a service of general economic interest but has rendered unsatisfactory results in terms of reliability, universality and affordability of the service, a less restrictive means to ensure these features could be to set up State regulation imposing adequate public service obligations on the competing operators providing the service in question.</p>
<p>As a separate point, with regard to State ownership in undertakings, Article 295 (ex article 222) EC Treaty states unequivocally that the Treaty shall in no way prejudice the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership. In this respect, Community law is neutral and Member States, regions or communes are therefore neither hindered nor obliged to give up their stakes in public undertakings and privatise them. No are they hindered or obliged to obtain or re-obtain ownership in private or privatised undertakings thus turning or returning them into public undertakings. However, these rules have to be distinguished from the separate issue discussed above, i.e. whether services of general economic interest can – possibly subject to some regulation - be ensured by undertakings competing with each other, no matter whether they are private, privatised or public undertakings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0119"></a>

<p>b)	the increasing threat posed by imports from China to these industries made more acute by the particular characteristics of the Chinese economy;</p>

<p>On 5 July 1999 the Commission published the notices of competition COM/TA/99, COM/TB/99 and COM/TC/99. As these are internal Commission competitions, they were published in an administrative notice, as well as on the Commission Europe + net. These competitions are internal to the Commission and, consequently, need not be published in the Official Journal.</p>
<p>On 2 December 1999 – after prior consultation with Vice-President Kinnock – Mr Reichenbach, the Director General for Personnel and Administration, decided to prolong the deadline for submission of applicants from 30 July at 16.00 hours until 22 December 1999 at 16.00 hours. The Vice-President supported this decision fully. The Director General for Personnel and Administration took this decision in his capacity as Appointing Authority and in conformity with Staff Regulations.</p>
<p>Mr Reichenbach explained the reasons for his decision to the Joint Committee (Commission Paritaire) at its meeting of 17 December 1999. He reported that he had been concerned that several potential candidates for the competition had been denied admission purely on the technical grounds that they had not submitted all required identity documents in the precisely prescribed manner. The Director General took the view that these were not justifiable reasons for preventing admission to a competition and consequently extended the deadline in order to provide an extra opportunity for completion of formalities. He agreed to re-examine the number of successful candidates for each competition in the light of the number of additional candidates who would now be eligible for the competition, following the reopening of the deadline, in order not to disadvantage those candidates who had been accepted initially. He informed all staff of the above in a message of 12 January 2000.</p>

<p>When I was 8, my father was killed in a road accident. I was in the car with him at the time, and can still remember the childish distress I felt when I saw that he was no longer moving. At present, some 43 000 people are killed on the EU’s roads every year – a figure equivalent to the population of a fair-sized town. Portugal has made road safety one of its main objectives. In fact, protecting human life ought to be our number one priority. Portugal has said that a directive needs to be drafted concerning the blood alcohol limit for drivers.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal on this subject has been pending since 1988. Recently, the Commissioner responsible for transport, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, said, however, that this was a matter for which the Member States were responsible and that there was no need for European harmonisation.</p>
<p>I am shocked at this turn of events, as there is no question as to how dangerous drinking and driving is. It is calculated that introducing a limit of 0.05% in all EU Member States would save about 1000 lives each year. Young people are often involved! Must we decision-makers wait until something tragic happens close to home before we react? Cutting the alcohol limit in all Member States is vital, so harmonisation is needed. No rational argument can be adduced against it.</p>

<p>The Commission shares the Honourable Member’s concern that drinking and driving is still a major road safety problem.</p>
<p>For many years the Commission has investigated the problem of drinking and driving and the road accidents which it generates. The conclusion, from a road safety point of view, is that national and European actions to reduce the incidence of drinking and driving are a priority to make Community roads safer. Most experts will agree that what is required is a package of measures to tackle this problem embracing blood alcohol content (BAC) limits, effective and targeted enforcement, penalties, and re-habilitation programmes for serious offenders.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that lower BAC limits are an essential requirement to underpin national and European action to reduce illegal drinking and driving and that 0.5 mg/ml is considered to be a sensible general maximum limit. The adoption of such a maximum limit by all Member States would provide a clear and consistent message to drivers on Community roads that drinking and driving is a dangerous activity.</p>
<p>The original proposal for a BAC limit of 0.5 mg/ml, brought forward in 1988, remained unadopted simply because too many Member States objected to such a measure on the grounds of subsidiarity, even though they themselves were prepared to accept 0.5 mg/ml. Indeed, since 1988 some Member States have accepted 0.5 mg/ml in their national legislation. Against this background, the Commission is preparing a Council recommendation which would set out how should be proceeded to deal with this important road safety problem.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0130"></a>

He felt that the Commission had a strong, hierarchical culture behind which anarchical network-based power games of a personal nature took place.

The Commission does not, therefore, share the Honourable Member’s view that LEADER+ should be applied to wider areas. The Commission considers that such an approach could compromise the local, bottom-up character of the Initiative, and would risk that the limited financial resources available were scattered too widely to secure a genuine impact.

<p>Extending the terms of the directive, as envisaged by the proposal, to professions and categories of business other than financial establishments involved in activities likely to be used for the purposes of money laundering, has a more general scope than the laundering of gains from fraud and other illegal activities harmful to the financial interests of the Communities.</p>

<p>Two Swedish oxen are at risk of being put down since the Swedish National Board of Agriculture refused to grant an exemption for them from the EU Directive on ear tags for bovine animals. The oxen are used for events on a nature reserve where farming practices of yesteryear are demonstrated.</p>
<p>The National Board of Agriculture points out that the EU allows exemptions from the requirement to apply plastic ear tags to cattle only in respect of animals intended for use in cultural and sports events (bullfights).</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that exemptions should be granted for animal-baiting, as in the case of bullfighting, but not for the use of oxen in cultural events on a museum farm?</p>
<p>Does the Commission not have a duty to ensure that EU rules do not give rise to absurd situations?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the present time, Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and on the labelling of beef and veal and beef-based products does not afford the Commission the possibility of approving an identification system offering the same guarantees as those resulting from ear-tagging except for bulls intended for cultural and sports events. To this end, the Commission has adopted regulation (EC) No 2680/1999 of 17 December 1999 approving an identification system for bulls intended for cultural and sports events (See OJ L326, 18.12.99, p. 16).</p>
<p>Subsequent to establishing the elements of the system for the identification of bovine animals, the Commission has been made aware that the application of ear-tags in compliance with Community requirements may prove to be unsightly in some situations such as, for example, museum farms. So in the proposed Parliament and Council regulation establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and on the labelling of meat and veal and beef-based products, abrogating regulation (EC) No 820/97 (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=1999&amp;nu_doc=0487">COM (1999) 487</a>), the Commission no longer refers exclusively to bulls, but in general to bovine animals intended for cultural or sports events (Article 4(1), final sentence). It must however be stressed that, should the Parliament and the Council accept this wording, it will be up to the Swedish authorities, if they deem it necessary, to submit a request to the Commission with a view to the recognition of an alternative system offering equivalent guarantees for the type of situation described by the Honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
