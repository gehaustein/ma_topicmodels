<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joaquín Almunia,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I am going to read the Commission statement on relations between the European Union and Switzerland, and although you and I speak the same language, I shall do so in English. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Commission is pleased that this item has been put on the agenda because it is now more than two years since we last discussed Switzerland. It was in 2004, on the occasion of the conclusion of the 10 new bilateral agreements. Let me start, therefore, with a general remark.</p>
<p class="contents">The bilateral and multilateral relations that link the EU and Switzerland are very good. Switzerland is a highly valued partner for the EU in many areas. Our bilateral relations are based on a solid foundation of around 20 important and over 100 smaller sector-specific agreements. These agreements range from free trade in goods and the free movement of persons to Swiss participation in our research and Schengen cooperation. Any existing differences should not have an inordinate impact on our relations.</p>
<p class="contents">In February, the Commission adopted a state aid decision on Swiss cantonal tax favours for certain types of companies, in particular holding companies. This decision has received much media attention in Switzerland and has been dramatised, by some, into a major conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Legally, the Commission has no doubts that the cantonal tax schemes qualify as subsidies, because these tax regimes offer unfair tax advantages to companies established in Switzerland for profits generated in the European Union. Income generated in Switzerland is taxed higher than profits made in the EU. This unequal treatment is at the heart of the state aid problem. The rules in question are liable to distort competition and may affect trade between Switzerland and the EU. All criteria of Article 23 of the agreement of 1972, the provision which declares such state aid incompatible with the proper functioning of the agreement, are therefore fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically, too, it seems hard to accept that a neighbouring country that enjoys privileged access to our internal market and takes part in a large number of our programmes and other activities should grant such tax favours. The benefiting companies are often set up with the sole aim of avoiding the taxation of profits in our Member States. I would like to point out that tax schemes of this kind or similar are not allowed inside the EU, pursuant to the state aid rules set out in the EC Treaty. In the past, the Commission has adopted decisions against them. We are not against tax competition, which also takes place among the Member States, but it must be fair.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wants to find a mutually acceptable solution. Therefore, we also asked the Council in February for a mandate to start negotiations with Switzerland on this topic. Member States support the Commission in this respect, and such a mandate is currently being prepared in the Council. I am also counting very much on Parliament’s support in this matter. We proceed from the belief that we will find a solution for this problem, just as we have always found solutions for problems in our relations with Switzerland in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">On a different matter of importance, I would like to express the Commission’s expectation that Switzerland will, hopefully, soon be ready to negotiate the inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania in the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons. If Switzerland were to exclude the citizens of two Member States from this very important agreement, it would be unacceptable for legal, institutional and political reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Bulgaria and Romania should also receive a financial contribution from Switzerland for the reduction of economic and social disparities, on the same terms as the other 10 new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the Swiss position on EU accession and the European Economic Area, there is currently no alternative to further strengthening of bilateral relations. With that in mind, the Commission is prepared to look into the Swiss proposal for the negotiation of a general framework agreement, provided that it brings an added value to our relations, for instance with regard to the updating of existing agreements in line with the evolving Community <span class="italic">acquis</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that these statements also largely meet with the consent of my group. The relationship between the European Union and Switzerland has been a special one since time immemorial. Commissioner Almunia touched on the various agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, our partnership with Switzerland is characterised by particularly close cooperation but which has not, as yet, ended up with Switzerland becoming a member of the European Union. Nevertheless, Switzerland is an extremely important trading partner as well as being a friend and neighbour. I find this particularly congenial since my electoral district directly borders Switzerland. I would therefore like to appeal to all sides not to jeopardise these good neighbourly relations by means of stubbornness or excessive demands placed on one side or the other.</p>
<p class="contents">The tax dispute has already been touched on. The topic of Switzerland would certainly also be cause for a comprehensive discussion here in Parliament. Today, however, as has been described by Commissioner Almunia, we are obviously concerned with the subject of fiscal practices. On this theme, I would like to say that, unlike our colleagues from Great Britain, for instance, and representations to the contrary coming out of Switzerland, we are of the opinion that this issue does not involve intervention in a country’s right to levy taxes, but is more an issue of whether enterprises which belong to the European single market, and which may enjoy the advantages afforded by this single market, are receiving unjustified subsidies. We are talking about the principle of equal treatment and the abolition of hidden subsidies. In this respect, the approach adopted by the Commission, that the Swiss have to apply some finishing touches here, is the correct one, even if it may have been more prudent to begin with negotiations instead of a procedure. The statement that it is a matter for the canton is neither applicable nor effective in my opinion because what we are talking about are hidden subsidies which must be abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the EU must clarify the fact that while it naturally respects Switzerland’s sovereignty on tax matters, the EU’s basic principles, which Swiss enterprises also benefit from, must apply to all enterprises within the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that we must find a solution to this problem in the interests of European enterprises, as well as its citizens, to which both parties have contributed. That is why I am calling on both the Commission and our Swiss neighbours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that Switzerland, as a friend of the European Union, benefits from the same conditions of access to the EU internal market as any Member State. You cannot have your cake and eat it, meaning, in this case, that you cannot have both the internal market and exceptions for certain Swiss cantons.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a question here of referring to this or that media figure among natural persons, but indeed of referring to substantial sums that are at stake due to the practices being developed by certain legal persons. Therefore, once a problem has been identified between friends, it should be dealt with. This is what you are proposing to do. You will have my group’s full support in this matter, and I am delighted that other groups in this House share this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Switzerland is concerned, we are told that Swiss internal affairs are being interfered with. However, in an international trade environment, freedom is not unilateral. Account must be taken of others’ circumstances, and the freedom of one party stops where that of the other begins. I believe that, when it comes to our excellent relations with Switzerland – and President Barroso reiterated this when he was in Bern the other day – this is how we must act.</p>
<p class="contents">At times, Switzerland has been able to divide and rule among Europeans, and everyone will recall the circumstances in which, after the Feira conclusions had come out and we wanted to adopt the Directive on the taxation of savings within the Union, some people used Switzerland to divide us. I am delighted that the conditions for negotiating the mandate granted to the Commission will clearly enable the Member States to speak with one voice, while showing respect for Swiss sovereignty. That is a very good sign, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like simply to make an obvious point: when one considers the logic of the Swiss taxation system, the idea that a taxation system should take account of external costs is absolutely integral to the Swiss thinking on taxation. To put it plainly, certain Swiss practices confirm the fact that, from the moment that production does not take place on Swiss soil, the cost of infrastructure or of employing qualified workers does not have to be incorporated in the taxation system. We must – at the very least in terms of trade with the European Union – highlight the following situation: as the taxation system developed in certain Swiss cantons currently stands in relation to that of the EU Member States, we are losing revenue, since these production activities are being developed on our territory and the tax on the capital gains generated in this way is being channelled into Switzerland to avoid the need to provide any funding for these external costs. I wish you luck in the negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Here in Parliament we have long wanted to discuss the whole of our relationship with Switzerland and to celebrate Swiss success in three successive referendums on EU issues – referendums that would scarcely have passed in many of our Member States. Although Switzerland is not a Member State, Swiss people are informed Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">We wanted to discuss the interesting government report on European policy last autumn to recognise that, yes, the Swiss wish at present to pursue their own national interests outside membership, but also perhaps to counter some misconceptions about what might be on offer here. In my view it amounts, as the Commissioner has said, to building on the bilaterals and perhaps a framework agreement that simplifies the administrative load on both sides. However, what some of us would call ‘membership-light’ is not on offer, and that is where the current difficulties over cantonal tax might stem from.</p>
<p class="contents">Either you are a member of the European Union or you are not. Switzerland is not, and both sides do well to recall that. Switzerland does not enjoy the benefits of membership, nor is that country subject to all of the obligations. That is the difficulty of such an atypical, variable geometry: it will forever throw up problems and sources of irritation. However, those problems should be solved with goodwill.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take the tax issue head on. If what the Commission really wants from Switzerland – which I suspect to be the case – is to extend the Code of Conduct for Business Taxation, then let us talk about that. Even between Member States it is a voluntary code. I have no doubt that there are offshore taxation arrangements in a Member State I know only too well that would not bear close scrutiny, yet I do not see such activity from the Commission in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a discussion as benefits the relationship between the EU and our nearest geographic neighbour in the heart of Europe, a country providing our second largest export market and an inspiration to us and many in terms of its democratic structures and internationalism. Instead, we tell the Swiss that their cantonal tax systems are ‘predatory’. That is a strong and unpleasant word. If they are indeed predatory, I would expect to see a line of obvious cases of actual harm to Community trade: practical examples that could be cited and demonstrated as having this predatory effect. I have seen none mentioned. Indeed, the Commission relies instead on an argument that it does not have to demonstrate but merely show that the structures could have this effect. However, there are no actual examples and I wonder whether that is because, under examination, they would not stand up against the strained argument that is put forward – an argument against a non-member state, based on an old free trade agreement, designed primarily to deal with the trade in goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at it in another way. Perhaps my voters in Yorkshire might wonder why I spend so much time on Switzerland. However, if my northerly region of England had enjoyed over the years the level of fiscal autonomy vis-à-vis London that Swiss cantons have in their country, maybe we would not have been such a drain on EU Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Switzerland contributes financially to our enlargement process with popular consent. This is a deep and complicated relationship, one that over the years I have found exasperating and frustrating, but never, ever dull! We are often told to be nice to the Swiss before a referendum. We are asked continuously what we will do if they vote ‘no’. The answer is that the choice is always that of the Swiss people, but if they wish to work with us, we have to work with them in a respectful and proper way. The best I would like to see is that one day there are Swiss ministers in the Council, a Swiss Commissioner and Swiss colleagues here with us to debate these issues, not us doing so at second remove. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If the Swiss federal tax system were well known to the taxpayers of the EU Member States, it would be a model to be imitated – as indeed it is – especially with a view to protecting economic freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind the Member States’ taxpayers that Swiss legislation is based on important principles, such as the principle of legal equality, the principle of economic freedom and, above all, the principle of the guarantee to property.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of legal equality imposes the duty to tax according to economic capacity. Thanks to constitutional provisions, the principle of economic freedom forbids the collection of certain taxes on trade that would be prohibitive in the context of trade policy. Lastly, the important principle of the guarantee to property, enshrined in Article 26 of the Federal Constitution, forbids the imposition of tax when it takes the form of expropriation; thus the guarantee to property constitutes a limit to taxation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what needs to be learnt by those Member States which, like Italy, still oppress taxpayers with their tax legislation and tax burden, which in Italy exceeds 40%. From this great historical experience, we need to learn the principles of economic freedom contained in the Swiss Constitution. Those of us from Padania have the good fortune to be the next-door neighbours of those free people of Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, let us also think about the principle of freedom of belief, on the basis of which people are not obliged to contribute taxes to pay for the costs of religion if they do not belong to that religion, and also the fundamental right to express one’s wishes directly through the referendum on taxes. It is time to do away with the Member States’ fiscal dictatorship over taxpayers! Let the people have their say on taxes! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, both the EU and Switzerland are benefiting from cooperation and bilateral agreements, for instance, in connection with security and asylum. On the other, we have relentless negotiations, demands and even blackmailing, for example, in connection with the extended freedom of movement of persons and the taxation of savings income, or currently in connection with company taxation as regards which, it is the intention to use derogations relating to rail transit, which are so important as far as Switzerland is concerned, as a means of exerting pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">When Switzerland tightened its Asylum Act many years ago, the European Union did not hold back with its criticism. This was designed to clamp down on the 75% of applications for asylum which were incorrectly submitted every year, which is actually what happened. This about-turn by Switzerland, which has traditionally been so welcoming to visitors, forced those persons within our Union who dream of multiculturalism to reconsider, and the Union actually had to make an example of this Swiss Asylum Act.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time for us to seek solutions together to common problems which we face in the tax sector, as well as with regard to migration and integration. Above all, we should use Switzerland as an example in terms of direct democracy, for only if EU citizens are once again under the impression that their intentions are being taken seriously, that they can have their say in matters, might we then be able to extricate ourselves from the crisis currently facing the EU.</p>

These have seen the prospering of both the Swiss and Member States of the European Union. The bilateral agreements should be recognised by all representatives of a joint and shared desire for prosperity. There are further indicators that show the things we share and the direction we are heading: amongst other things, Switzerland is the second-largest trading partner of the European Union after the United States. 900 000 EU citizens live and work in Switzerland, while many more travel between these borders on a regular basis. However, the present disagreement between the Commission and the Swiss Government is disconcerting and should be addressed swiftly.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that the issue of double taxation which the EU and Switzerland are facing is no small one, but I would not like to see threats made in the preliminary rounds of negotiations, or in later rounds for that matter. The issue of double taxation does not offer an easy way to investment, jobs and revenue for the Swiss cantons that allow the double standards. The Council and Commission and Parliament should do its utmost to protect the interests of the Member States.</p>

<p class="contents">However, I would like to hear what Mr Almunia has to say about the ultimate political goal of these relations. In other words, is the development of closer relations between the European Union and Switzerland undertaken with an eye to membership of Switzerland in the European Union at a future date; if so, when can we expect this, and what must Switzerland and the European Union do before then? If the development of closer relations is not aimed at Switzerland's membership, but is aimed instead at a privileged partnership for Switzerland with the European Union, then what should be the principles of such a partnership?</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that bilateral agreements definitively solve the problem of Switzerland's political future; therefore, I would like to hear from Mr Almunia something similar to a <span class="italic">road map</span>, from which one would be able to see the direction of the Commission's work in developing the European Union's relations with Switzerland. From the material presented it is hard for me to say whether the Commission has such a <span class="italic">road map</span>, or whether temporary agreements are a substitute for it.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal would be as follows: it is necessary to produce a <span class="italic">road map </span>of the development of relations between the European Union and Switzerland, the ultimate goal of which would be either Switzerland's membership in the EU, or its privileged partnership in terms of the yet-to-be approved Constitutional agreement. In order to choose either solution, it is essential to know the Swiss people's own opinion about the prospects for their country.</p>
<p class="contents">Until we solve this political problem, we will continue to make various agreements, and both parties to the negotiations will try to demand more favourable conditions for themselves at the expense of the other party.</p>
<p class="contents">As I study the existing and planned agreements, I have serious doubts as to whether we might just be making greater demands on Switzerland, which is still not a member of the European Union, than on the European Union Member States themselves. In my opinion, the opposite should be the case.</p>

We need only to think of Jean Jacques Rousseau or Johannes von Müller. However, it seems to remain an island, a <span class="italic">Sonderfall</span>, beyond the united Europe which surrounds it on all sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember that, in a referendum held in 1992, 50.3% of Swiss citizens themselves voted against their country joining the European Economic Area. I do not wish to interfere in the internal affairs of the Confederation in any way. In highlighting the good cooperation between Switzerland and the European Union in almost all areas, I hope that the right solution can also quickly be found in terms of taxation. This is extremely important in order to achieve transparency in terms of our cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the new Member States, including my own country, I would specifically like to welcome the outcome of the referendum held on 26 November 2006, which accepted the establishment of a Swiss Financial Instrument to the tune of one billion francs. For their part, these countries have flung open their doors to Swiss capital investments. In Poland, for example, imports from Switzerland rose by 20% during this period, while exports increased by only 5% less. I am sure that Swiss funds will be used sensibly for innovative purposes, including scientific research, providing support for small and medium-sized companies, as well as protecting the environment and fostering regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to add that Switzerland has a particularly positive image in the European Union. According to my data, around 72% of Europeans would be happy to welcome the Swiss Confederation into our common European home. Perhaps it would be wise to make the most of this positive attitude. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why is the Helvetic Confederation richer, more content, more orderly and better administered than the European Union? Allow me to suggest a reason. Switzerland is founded on what one might call the ‘Jeffersonian principle’: the notion that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the people they affect. The European Union, by contrast, is founded on the converse principle. The very first line of the very first article of the Treaty of Rome commits us to an ever-closer union. Whereas power in Switzerland is dispersed, power in the EU is concentrated, and from that one structural flaw come most of our present discontents: the unintended consequences of our directives and regulations, the inflexibility of our policies, the sense that the government has become remote from the governed, the determination of our national electorates to vote ‘no’ to Brussels at every opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Why then do we keep bullying and hectoring the Swiss over their refusal to join us? Why do we attack their success in keeping their cantonal taxes down? Why do we encourage that minority of Swiss legislators who see EU membership precisely as a way of sidestepping their voters and escaping their system of direct democracy? Is it that we envy our neighbours their success or is it that we fear that our own citizens will be encouraged by their example to demand independence for their own states?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me propose an alternative approach. Instead of seeking to drag Switzerland into our Union, why do our Member States not instead apply to become cantons of their confederation? They are, after all, getting something right, these Switzers! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Switzerland is a wealthy country, which does not have to be a member of the Union and, at the moment, does not wish to join the Union. At the same time, it is a good, strategic partner for the European Union. When one has such a partner, Commissioner, one negotiates and discusses, rather than initiating proceedings. I agree here with my colleague from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. As a Polish MEP, the case of Switzerland reminds me of the unfortunate and, until now, unsuccessful attempts of certain German and French politicians, such as Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, to unify taxation in the European Union, which would <span class="italic">de facto</span> lead to an increase in tax in my country. There will be no consent to this move. I am therefore not surprised that the Swiss now complain about Brussels interfering in the internal affairs of their country. This whole matter shows that the Union should take a look at itself. It should reform its own economy in such a way as to make it truly competitive, without resorting to proceedings, penalties and demands addressed to third countries or its own members. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I wish to insist that the Commission considers relations between the EU and Switzerland to be very good. Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had the opportunity to meet the President of the Helvetic Confederation on 3 April. They discussed these very good relations, which do not exclude some legal problems, which can be likened to those which exist among the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Every time the Commission considers that the Treaties or Community legal provisions are not fully respected, as guardian of the Treaties, it is obliged to react. This has been the case with the issue under discussion: the tax decisions adopted in some cantons of the Helvetic Confederation. It is not about tax competition. It is about the enforcement of the rules that were adopted in our Agreement with Switzerland of 1972. It is not about tax competition but state aid. The Commission very often opens this kind of procedure on the grounds of failure to enforce state aid rules in the Member States, and it is a very important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know whether you are aware that over 20 000 letter-box companies have been established in Switzerland with the sole purpose of avoiding taxation in the European Union Member States. We have been discussing this issue with the Swiss authorities since 2005. We have not found a solution other than to open this procedure. We are asking the Council for a mandate to negotiate with the Swiss authorities to reach a solution to this conflict. I hope that, in the coming weeks, the Council will give us this mandate with the backing of a very large majority of the Member States. I hope that during the negotiations, these issues, which constitute sizeable problems for thousands of European companies, will be resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report was approved almost unanimously within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality with just one abstention and that makes it clear that this is a balanced report, which is intended to highlight not just the situation of disabled women but also the extremely important role played by women responsible for and dedicated to care and assistance for people suffering any kind of disability, as well as the work of the associations involved in it.</p>
<p class="contents">This report – which we will vote on later in this House – contains an important appeal: the need for both the European Commission and the Member States to try to introduce and implement flexible measures and a system of assistance that reflects the heterogeneous nature of this group of people, so that they can be applied and adapted to each case, since there is no place for stereotypes here, and women generally suffer double discrimination. On the one hand, because they are women – which is still a handicap in many European regions, regrettably – and, on the other, because they are disabled.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to provide appropriate resources and policies, with innovative services, in order to guarantee the most independent and autonomous life possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress the importance of the development of information and communication technologies, a fundamental tool in the integration of disabled people into society.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to increase public awareness from childhood, since it is they, the children, who hold the key to the future in their hands.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue to promote consideration and debate in order to progressively reach a situation in which equal opportunities are a reality for everybody, regardless of their gender or their social, economic or political status.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, finally, to stress the role of families – in particular women, who in the majority of cases are responsible for caring for disabled people – and the crucial role played on a daily basis by associations of disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that the work of families and organisations be supported and recognised, from both economic and social points of view, since in many cases it is an activity that requires full dedication, leading to isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, and although this is a subsidiary issue, I believe that we institutions of the European Union must consider all working together to that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The different forms of discrimination suffered by disabled women and young people prevents them from living independently, since these barriers often deny them access to education and to the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is entirely unacceptable that around 80% of disabled women are victims of violence. The risk of suffering sexual abuse is four times higher for disabled women than for women who are not disabled. The European Union must protect the rights of these people and allow them effective access to all forms of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Herranz, who has had the initiative to draw up this report with a view to increasing public awareness of the dramatic situation I have just referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, it is entirely appropriate that this Parliament should be adopting a resolution on the situation of disabled women in the European Union. The draft resolution is absolutely right to mention the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, signed by the European Commission on behalf of the European Community on the same day that it became available for signing, 30 March last. At least 22 Member States have added their signatures. Furthermore, I would like to point out that the Commission inspired the specific provisions of that Convention on respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of disabled women.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's adoption of this resolution is also fully in line with the European strategy in the field of disability, a strategy that contributes to the implementation of the measures mentioned in the report. The Commission is therefore already working on the application of the provisions of the directive combating the discrimination suffered, in particular, by disabled people who want access to employment and professional training. Furthermore, the new regulation on the Structural Funds introduces the use of accessibility for disabled people as a criterion for the selection of projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I also take note of the appeal to the Commission that it draw up legislation to guarantee the autonomy of disabled men and women. In this regard, the Commission intends to launch an impact study to look into the possibility of proposing new legislation in this regard, on the basis of Article 13 of the Treaty, which makes it possible to extend the scope of the current directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission will shortly begin a study on the current situation of disabled women, taking account of the provisions of the United Nations Convention. This study will provide us with a basis for defining specific actions, and will also make it possible for the Commission to gather data and information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must, together with them, ask what solidarity they really need, and furthermore, we should accept everything these people offer as testimony to the undeniable value of their lives. But I ask myself whether political institutions at all levels are able to take this step. As a doctor and a woman who sympathises with disabled women, I do not view their situation as a punishment, but as an area in which human society can gain great inspiration and a beautiful fountainhead for a world founded on solidarity, hope and love.</p>
<p class="contents">People with disabilities are a very great source of inspiration for us. With their moral and spiritual resources they are of irreplaceable value to the human race. They show us and teach us that human beings have value simply through the fact that they exist and not through what they possess or through what they are able to produce. European society, which is often in thrall to the pernicious influence of economic neo-liberalism, does not understand these things. A person with disabilities represents a living challenge to our shared humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is also a challenge to us to show respect to all of those who, formally or informally, care for people with disabilities. The formal recognition of those who care for people with disabilities should be the aim of all institutions. I would therefore like to conclude by requesting that the European Commission undertakes a study into the recognition of informal work in the field of caring for people with disabilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are a range of legal instruments, such as the UN Convention, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 13 [of the Treaty on European Union] and the Manifesto of Disabled Women which we should observe very closely. At all levels, it is clear that women are not victims; rather, they are repeatedly disadvantaged. This multiple discrimination must also be reflected in measures adopted by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have designated 2007 as the ‘European Year of Equal Opportunities for All’. Here too, however, women, especially women with disabilities, constitute a marginal group. As has been stressed so unequivocally by Commissioner Almunia, 80% of women with disabilities are also victims of violence, everyday violence. They repeatedly experience violence and, above all, sexual violence on a very much more frequent basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The DAPHNE programme must therefore put a stronger emphasis on combating this violence and we must also strengthen the networks of women with disabilities. In their working lives, women have it doubly difficult if they suffer from a disability. They already suffer in any case. Unemployment levels among women are above average and the social exclusion of disabled people is increasing at a rate which is no longer acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore use the best model from all European countries as an example and make much better use of the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund for promoting model projects and remind Member States of their duties. We have written gender mainstreaming into the structural regulations but do not have the funds available to proceed with sanctions against the Member States which do not abide by it. This is a fairly central requirement. It is clear that greater pressure must be applied here.</p>
<p class="contents">We require integrated education. This is necessary for both sexes. It is a very important learning curve for people both with and without disabilities to be prepared as early as Kindergarten to live an independent life. To this end, we must not let charity prevail and we must quite definitely help men and women obtain their rights as well as establish barrier-free access for them, and not just to buildings and public local transport, but to new media as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that the Gender Institute can help bring the organisations and best practices together. Every one of us may wake up tomorrow suffering from a disability. What matters is strengthening each person’s individuality and valuing his or her uniqueness. Then we really will be in agreement on many issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that attention needs to be given to the situation of women with disabilities, and measures taken to remedy that situation. People with disabilities are discriminated against, and women are discriminated against. There is, then, double discrimination against women with disabilities, not to mention the further discrimination that exists against those that happen to be women, disabled, of a different ethnic background and of a different sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Member States and society that have a responsibility to remove all obstacles to everyone participating fully in society. In particular, account needs, then, to be taken of the situation of women with disabilities. It should never be the person with disabilities or her relatives that bear the responsibility. We have a collective and common responsibility to build a society characterised by solidarity, and full participation by everyone in all aspects of that society - for example study, working life or social and cultural life - is something for which we should take responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In quite a few Member States, it is women who bear the main responsibility for the care of children with disabilities and of relatives in a similar situation. I read an extremely telling quotation by the mother of a child with disabilities, who said: ‘I am not only a mother but also, among other things, a physiotherapist, occupational therapist, nurse, neurologist, teacher and architect specialising in adapting our home for the needs of our disabled child.’</p>
<p class="contents">Not only are women carers, then, but they also have to fight for the rights of people with disabilities. I think that it is very clear from this report that it is women who often bear the main responsibility. That is unacceptable. It is not women’s but society’s responsibility to enable all people with disabilities, together with their families, to lead independent lives and to make decisions for themselves. This is also, of course, a demand for gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Girls and women with physical and mental disabilities are subject to more violence and sexual abuse than other groups. Not only, then, do they suffer discrimination because of their disabilities; they are also subject to abuse. Women with mental disabilities, in particular, are open to abuse, often perpetrated by people in their immediate circle. These women are in a dreadfully vulnerable position. If we are to prevent abuse, we must be aware of such violence and afford it greater visibility.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not our sympathy that women with disabilities need or demand, but the self-evident right to participate fully in society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why all actions aimed at providing support for people who are disabled, ill or who have difficulties in adapting to their surroundings, not only prevent social exclusion or poverty, but also foster social integration, as well as improving the quality of life and the mental and physical health of people who are in some way disabled, allowing them to lead a fulfilling life.</p>
<p class="contents">All action taken to provide more information and increase awareness of disability and which includes providing disabled access to buildings, educational opportunities, reducing red tape in the support system and increasing funding, especially for disabled women and children, should be a priority for programmes at a national and European level. It is important to improve access to the labour market, including Internet access, to make use of tax incentives aimed at promoting the employment of disabled people and to make working time more flexible, especially for mothers with disabled children.</p>
<p class="contents">It is equally important to make the institutions more accessible, to improve the monitoring of how aid is allocated, to provide physiotherapy services and psychological support across the board and to increase the number of certified therapists and instructors.</p>
<p class="contents">However, providing support and care for disabled people, which helps their physical and personal development, should not encourage selfishness. The problem, especially in my country and in other poor countries which have joined the European Union, is not so much a lack of desire to help people who are in some way physically or mentally disabled, but rather the fact that there is poverty and unemployment, a lack of funds for transport, wheelchairs and other equipment which, together with measures to make buildings accessible for the disabled, would facilitate mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly 15% of Poles are disabled. These people face many problems on a daily basis, in spite of an extensive network of NGOs and legions of volunteers who want to dedicate their time to helping others. In Poland, there is a lack of schools for autistic children, there are not enough reading materials written in Braille for the blind and poor, disabled people cannot afford specially adapted cars. In addition to this, almost all tax relief has been abolished for people who already live in poverty, sometimes even extreme poverty, as a result of low pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous socialist governments in particular followed macroeconomic goals in their approach to disabled people. They abolished family-friendly tax relief and significantly reduced disability benefits. This happened when the country was adapting its legislation to fall in line with legislation in the European Union, where neo-liberal utilitarianism, rather than human worth and dignity, is what really counts.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of mentally disabled children attend special rather that mainstream schools, which does not help them to integrate. That is why even the most well-drafted and meticulous reports dealing with the issue of disability will remain theoretical entities, with no opportunities for practical implementation, in view of the greed of the wealthy and the fact that moral values and principles have been replaced by market laws and the free movement of capital in one direction, namely from the poor to the rich. That is why we appeal, once again, for solidarity. We need solidarity not only on paper in the Union's documents, but in the decisions and actions taken. We especially appeal to the decision-makers, who are responsible for safeguarding our health and our society, for solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, in the European Union, the rate of employment of disabled women stands at 2%, compared with 36% for disabled men. These women are under-represented, and sometimes not represented at all, in many areas of social, professional, cultural and political life not just in France, but throughout Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In France, the law stipulates that companies with over 20 employees must meet the target of having a 6% disabled workforce. However, the average rate of employment of disabled people is in reality only 4%. It is downright unfair that companies should prefer to pay fines – even very large ones, at times – rather than to employ disabled people. However, 40% of disabled women are constantly seeking employment. This grotesque situation must stop.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I am surprised to note that the techniques of quotas and of positive discrimination, which are widely used by Parliament to, among other things, promote foreigners’ rights within the European Union or female participation in political parties and professional decision-making bodies, are not recommended so strongly for disabled women, or even provided for in this report.

This convention stipulates that all 650 million disabled people worldwide have the same rights as people who do not suffer from a disability. It encompasses civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, and thereby offers effective legal protection. For the first time, disabilities are recognised as a human rights issue. It is regrettable, and here I would also very much appreciate another statement from the Commission, that the EU Commission has got cold feet and refused to sign the additional protocol, which would have given individuals and organisations the right of appeal before the UN Committee of Experts.</p>
<p class="contents">When we here in Parliament talk about disabled people, especially about disabled women and girls, we must ask ourselves time and again whether we would not be better off talking about the impeding environment. When we look at this building and all other institution buildings, including those of the European institutions, it then becomes clear that we still have much work to do in order to actually improve the opportunities available to disabled persons. Here in this House, for instance, a woman or girl with a disability could only get access to the canteen via the freight elevator. This is very regrettable and we must certainly put our own house in order and see that we are also, alas, contributing to these people having no reasonable freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Worldwide, it is primarily women who have to endure a double dose of discrimination. As far as these women and girls are concerned, however, it is very important that we do not just talk about their misfortune, for these women are also self-aware and, although they have a disability, naturally have the same rights when it comes to shaping society.</p>
<p class="contents">It is especially regrettable that girls and women with disabilities experience much more than their fair share of sexual violence, be it by family members, care staff or other workers. In particular, there is also the fact that as far as these women are concerned, unfortunately, it is also very difficult that they are victims and do not have the same rights when it comes to getting married or starting a family. It is still the case that disabled girls and women are sterilised and forced to have abortions. There are many more compulsory abortions and because such women are not accorded the same rights in terms of sexuality or motherhood, their reproductive rights are also greatly restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the UN report, only a quarter of women with disabilities are gainfully employed. In this area, we must implement real change at a European level. We also know that, compared to men with disabilities, women, in part, earn just half of what men do. Here, too, we should again ask the European Union for more precise figures. We are already aware that, despite the principle of ‘equal pay for the same work’, glaring differences exist between men and women when it comes to women with disabilities. This is shocking indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">According to estimates by UNESCO, only 3% of people with disabilities worldwide can read and write, with this figure estimated at 1% when it comes to women and girls with disabilities. Here, we must make much greater efforts in the area of humanitarian aid, but we should also place the topic of educational opportunities and enhanced education, especially for girls with disabilities, quite high up on the agenda once again. In this area, Member States must do much more.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very important that we get this theme going at a European level and that we focus much more attention in this area. What is very important as far as I am concerned, however, is that our resolution should not fall behind the UN Convention. From there, we must actually make it much clearer that these women naturally do not just want to be seen as victims. They want to make it clear that although they have a disability, this disability should not result in discrimination on the labour market or in terms of education. We must attach greater importance to protecting these women against violence and send out very clear signals.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we really can take a step forward with our resolution and not fall behind the UN Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards its content, I think it is in everyone’s interest if I mention a few key points that characterise our work. Taking my cue from the report itself, my first point is that I think it is important, in our relationship with the Member States, to emphasise that the costs of disability must be borne by the community as a whole. The second point is that all the provisions, directives, projects and plans that are drawn up by the Community institutions must take account of the fact that some people in our countries have disabilities, and that they always constitute an important part of all the provisions that we must adopt. The third point is connected with the need to grant economic and social dignity to everyone involved in the care sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that in every country there is now a prevalent feeling that the right response to the problems of disability is to make the most of everyone’s residual abilities and to place them at the disposal of the whole community. That is the best solution for the differently able and also for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">We work so that our countries can achieve higher and higher rates of economic growth and development, because we believe that only a culturally and economically rich community can provide the solutions that these worlds expect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I therefore commend the rapporteur on her work and express the hope that the Commission and the Member States duly take on board the report’s proposals. We know that disabled people and their families generally have more difficulties to face in their everyday lives. They need help and measures that take account of their particular situation, so that they can take full part in the various activities of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the need to integrate disabled people’s needs and women’s rights into all policy areas at national, regional and local level, in particular the policies of town planning, education and training, employment, housing, transport, health and social services, including personalised assistance where applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">What are needed, therefore, are strong public policies backed by significant investment in particularly sensitive areas, in order to guarantee equal opportunities for women and disabled people. For this to happen, public priorities have to change.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot go on prioritising the nominal convergence criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact and, in turn, cutting public investment, as has happened in Portugal, leading to the closure of maternity wards, emergency services, health services and schools. This undermines human rights, especially in the more vulnerable sections of society, as in the case of women and the disabled.</p>
<p class="contents">It is wrong to declare that we want equal opportunities for all and to launch a propaganda campaign, only to pursue neoliberal policies that exacerbate inequality and social injustice. More than statements of intent, what we need is political change in order to prioritise social justice and genuine policies of social inclusion and equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yet another European resolution on a vulnerable social group, but to what extent are our proposals here in Parliament implemented? To what extent do they affect the policies targeted at the regions? To what extent are specific and special cases of disability addressed, be the disability major and visible or minor and invisible? To what extent are new technologies and new treatment methods planned for the disabled? How do we guarantee humane care for them? How are the European Structural Funds disposed of to help the disabled in their life, especially disabled women, taking account of the fact that they have full, but special rights to education and work and life. As my honourable friend, Mr Breyer, so rightly said, disabled women also want to have a full family life.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, of course, remember that it is women who take care of the disabled and that they too have rights, in order to be able to help. Do we ensure that women looking after the disabled have the possibility of developing the qualifications they have acquired from this work, so that they can re-use them? Do we recognise the service of women in the family, in schools and in the community? Do we recognise their voluntary service? Today we have an opportunity not only to vote, but also to see how – with specific measures – we shall implement everything we want for disabled women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think everyone in this House would agree that disabled women are often the most vulnerable individuals and the EU's values urge us to protect and to enhance the opportunities for disabled women. One way to approach this problem is by creating more education and labour market opportunities for women with disabilities, thereby granting them independence and alleviating the pressure on their carers.</p>
<p class="contents">Without adequate education it is very difficult to gain access to today’s labour market and to prosper. However, incorporating educational programmes for those with disabilities into our school systems and encouraging lifelong learning among women with disabilities would allow these women to support themselves and to maintain their independence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States should also encourage employers to hire disabled citizens by creating economic incentives to do so. The proposal in the motion for a resolution is a move in the right direction in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">No two people are alike and, even when we begin to categorise and label people, we must remember that every human being is individual and has unique needs. The EU Member States must take this fact into account when considering legislation related to women with disabilities. Women with disabilities constitute a very diverse group and all actions designed to support those women must take account of this diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. Yesterday we started a European truck tour to send this message to everyone in Europe. I think that alleviating the plight of women with disabilities is a very important priority in the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Avem nevoie de o Europă socială şi, tocmai de aceea, cred că persoanele cu handicap au un rol important şi un loc al lor în Uniunea Europeană. Europa va avea succes doar dacă utilizăm creativitatea tuturor cetăţenilor săi. Anul 2007 este anul egalităţii de şanse, dar, din păcate, deşi una din patru familii are o persoană cu handicap printre membrii săi, nu îi vedem nici pe stradă, nici în sălile de concerte, nici în mijloacele de transport în comun. Tocmai de aceea cred că avem obligaţia să facem mai mult pentru persoanele cu handicap. În acest sens, cred că utilizarea tehnologiei informaţiei şi a comunicării va ajuta persoanele cu handicap să se integreze în viaţa economică şi socială. În special, rolul femeilor este extrem de important şi delicat şi, de aceea, o atenţie deosebită trebuie acordată acestui subiect. Este important, întâi şi întâi, ca femeile cu handicap să poate fi integrate în câmpul muncii, dar, în acelaşi timp, să poată deveni mame şi să poată să aibă grijă de familia lor. Este importantă reconcilierea vieţii profesionale cu viaţa de familie şi, de aceea, cred că rolul femeilor cu handicap este important şi trebuie să protejăm aceşti cetăţeni pentru a se integra în Europa. Felicit încă o dată raportorul şi aş dori ca prin revizuirea pieţei interne, pe care Comisia Europeană o va efectua şi, de asemenea, prin măsurile viitoare pe care le vom lua, să ne gândim la persoanele care îngrijesc oamenii cu handicap, la femeile cu handicap, pentru a le putea oferi condiţii cât mai bune. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This topic will also be discussed tomorrow by the Conference of Presidents.’</p>

It also helps to increase the competitiveness of local companies and of the fisheries sector at European level. The effectiveness of this scheme can be illustrated by the fact that this compensation has enabled Réunion to increase the volume and value of its exports since 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Renewing this compensation scheme will enable us to continue our efforts to integrate the industrial, longline and coastal fishing sectors of the outermost regions into the internal market.

<p class="contents">Accordingly, the continuation of the compensation scheme for the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French departments of Guiana and Réunion into the period 2007-2013 means that we must finally adopt a specific development aid strategy for these regions, in particular in the fisheries sector, by strengthening the partnership. Accordingly, this should be a permanent scheme, with the possibility of a certain degree of flexibility, in view of the specific conditions in these regions and in order to make best use of the scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vital we lend these measures our wholehearted backing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, that the initial ceiling on compensation of additional costs, which has been set arbitrarily at 75%, be abolished. On the one hand, this rate is not based on any logical criteria and, on the other, there is no reason why fishery products should not benefit from such a favourable scheme as agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, that State aid for the production, processing and marketing of fishery products sourced from these regions be possible and that compensation be awarded for imported products, such as salt and oil, that are used during the processing of fishery products.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, that recourse to intra-Community imports be permitted, if the catches of the outermost regions’ fleets are not large enough to guarantee the profitability of the processing industries in these regions.</p>

<p class="contents">The key issue that needs to be addressed, however, is that of the RACs’ long-term financial viability. Given that the RACs are an integral part of the common fisheries policy (CFP), Community funding for their normal operations should be guaranteed on a permanent basis.</p>

It is difficult at present to carry out an assessment of the RACs given that only four of the seven are operational.</p>
<p class="contents">Our support for this proposal is based, however, on a vision of the RACs as an instrument for encouraging the decentralisation of the CFP, for ensuring that the fishermen and their representative bodies are involved in the decision-making process regarding the CFP – which we feel is not completely the case at the moment – and for guaranteeing that the interests of all Member States on the issue of fisheries are fairly represented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, it is clear that the Union’s external borders are a territory under the exclusive sovereignty of the Member States, but also territories whose integrity, monitoring and protection is in everyone’s interests, given that problems that arise on those borders tend to have ramifications for the other Member States.

It is the solidarity among the Member States that is the cornerstone of this project.</p>
<p class="contents">These teams have not been put in place with the aim of turning back these people. Rather, the aim is to provide European assistance to those Member States that admit too great an influx of illegal immigrants. Indeed, the events of last summer have confirmed the urgent need for difficult situations to be anticipated, as much for the Member States of destination or of transit as for the immigrants themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">These teams will therefore have the task of patrolling the areas surrounding the EU’s external borders under the authority of the national border guards of the host Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the rapid intervention teams will be able to exercise all of the powers necessary to carry out the activities of checking or monitoring the borders. However, it is stipulated that they shall have to fully respect people’s human dignity when carrying out their activities; equally, they shall have to respect the fundamental rights recognised by the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">On our continent, Communism has enslaved 300 million Europeans. Today, despite the fall of the Berlin Wall, it continues to exercise its intellectual terrorism. The fact that Mr Coveney does not dare mention the word in his report proves this. Some of our fellow Members, such as Mr Cohn-Bendit, go as far as to want to ban the people of Poland from de-Communising their country. That is an insult to the memory of the workers of Gdansk, of the insurgents of Berlin in 1953, of Budapest in 1956, of Prague in 1968 and of all the freedom fighters.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1917, Communism has killed more than 100 million people. Our Parliament, which has so much to say on the subject of human rights, should demand that Communism be put on trial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">1. The report fails to mention social, economic and cultural rights; neither does it call for these rights to be treated as an EU priority. While millions of people worldwide die of hunger, have neither housing nor work and live in deepest poverty, the EU report does not refer to these violations. It reduces human rights to civil liberties only, thereby disregarding the principle of indivisibility of human rights as set forth in the UN Charter;</p>
<p class="contents">2. The report does not mention human rights violations committed or supported by EU Member States. However, in order to avoid hypocrisy the EU needs to investigate and tackle human rights violations committed with the involvement or support of EU Member states in third countries or against third-country nationals;</p>
<p class="contents">3. The resolution calls for military intervention in Sudan. This is wrong because the protection of human rights must be through civilian, not military, action. War remains the most severe human rights violation, yet it is not mentioned in the report. No reference is made to the killing of civilians by EU Member State forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not mean, though, that the right of deeply religious people to express their opinions freely should be called into question on account of the suffocating atmosphere of political correctness and intellectual terrorism that is taking hold in this House. As Mr Claeys briefly mentioned yesterday, a freedom of speech phobia is beginning to set in here, an irrational fear of letting people express their opinions freely. This is one phobia we must fight with all our might, because this resolution is overshooting the mark. Where in the past, debates on homophobia were held on many occasions, these days, it is more about everyone indulging in a bit of Poland-bashing. After all, as in the Geremek issue on which nobody spoke with any authority yesterday, this is how the Left-wing inquisition on the issue of so-called homophobia in Poland took the moral high ground without any knowledge of the subject, or intellectual honesty for that matter.

However, caring about the image of our country cannot be an excuse for keeping silent in the face of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Homosexuality is not a disease, as some of the Polish participants in today's debate have claimed. Homophobia is the real disease which plagues many societies, including Poland. The resolution touches upon a fundamental issue; the serious situation facing thousands of European citizens, including thousands of my compatriots.</p>
<p class="contents">In Poland, as in other Member States, there is a feeling of dislike towards homosexuals. However, in no other Member State do members of the government and people in the public eye make statements which infringe fundamental civil rights and, as such, infringe the principles and values which form the basis of our democratic system.</p>
<p class="contents">In Poland, it saddens me to say, that homosexual people are harassed and insulted. If they come out, they encounter verbal or even physical aggression. If those in power do not go as far as to support these actions, they certainly do not oppose them.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as there is no place for racism or anti-Semitism in a modern democracy, there can be no place for discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Certainly not in the twenty-first century! That is why, following my own conscience, I intend to vote in favour of the resolution on homophobia in Europe, as it calls for the rights of those people to be upheld whose rights many others, particularly in Poland, would otherwise deny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, in the European Union, we encounter homophobia at every step. The failure to mention the infringements of the rights of homosexuals in other European countries makes this document incomplete.</p>
<p class="contents">The statements made by politicians such as Maciej Giertych, Jarosław Kaczyński or Ewa Sowińska fortunately do not translate into specific legislative measures. No legislation has been drafted which infringes the rights of homosexuals. However, I am afraid that this state of affairs may change. There is no support for the view that teachers who promote homosexuality among their students should be dismissed. These kinds of irresponsible statements are offensive to those who wish to live in a free, tolerant and open Poland. They are a threat to democracy and they do not reflect the views of the majority of Polish people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is one of the biggest hindrances to economic and social development in the EU and in the least developed Member States that suffer from economic difficulties, such as Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">The report clearly states the objective of using ‘the economic recovery to cut their budget deficits and by making labour markets more competitive’. The idea, in other words, is to cut the State’s social functions and to deregulate the labour market in terms of salaries and the job security of public administration workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary objective of this report is no longer zero deficit but budgetary excess. Naturally, the rapporteur is not comfortable with the 2005 pseudo review of the Pact, when there is clear evidence of the Pact’s irrationality given the economic recession the EU was experiencing. This, as we all know, is a political pact, the fruit of the prevailing neoliberal ideology, in which economic justification is just an alibi.

The brutal treatment of peaceful demonstrators and opposition politicians, as well as the threats made against Western ambassadors, show a regime whose ‘rule of law mask’ has finally dropped.</p>
<p class="contents">President Mugabe is battling to hold on to power using all means at his disposal. Given the deplorable economic situation (I can only recall an unemployment rate of 80% and an inflation rate above 1 700%) and increasing levels of repression, public opinion in the country is openly turning against him more and more. This is now no longer restricted to just the general population. Even his own party, the Zanu-PF party, is no longer fully behind him. His attempt at the party congress in December 2006 to postpone the Presidential elections by two years to coincide with the date of Parliamentary elections in 2010 was referred back to committee, where it failed.</p>
<p class="contents">In our capacity as the country holding the EU Council Presidency, we have, over recent weeks, made it quite clear where we stand in relation to events in Zimbabwe. In two statements on 12 and 14 March, the criminalisation of the peaceful ‘Prayers Meeting’, which took place in Harare on 11 March, was condemned, and the release demanded of those persons under arrest, along with a call for legal and medical aid to be granted.</p>
<p class="contents">In its note dated 13 March 2007, the German embassy in Harare, on behalf of all EU partners, emphatically called on the Zimbabwean Government to observe the principles of the constitution. Coordinating closely between themselves, EU ambassadors in the country expressed to the Zimbabwean Government the fact that they were ready at any time to look after those persons arrested and injured by the government, and were also prepared to do this personally.</p>
<p class="contents">In our capacity as the country holding the EU Council Presidency, we condemned in the strongest possible terms in our statement of 18 March the renewed arrests and mistreatment of members of the opposition on 17 and 18 March, as well as the imposition of a ban on leaving the country against two female opposition members seriously injured in the attacks on 11 March who wanted to undergo medical examination in South Africa. Following this, the injured opposition members were able to fly to South Africa. The majority of members of the opposition who had been arrested were released.</p>
<p class="contents">At the behest of the EU, in its debate on 29 March, the UN Human Rights Council dealt exclusively with Zimbabwe. In a declaration supported by 50 countries in total, the EU made it perfectly clear where it stood in relation to the current situation in Zimbabwe and called on the Mugabe Government to respect law and order, defend human rights and cooperate with the UN’s human rights mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all paying very close attention to the reactions of Zimbabwe’s neighbours. Our embassies in the region are involved in an intensive political dialogue with the governments of their host countries. We all agree in terms of our analysis that there are increasing signs that solidarity with the Mugabe regime is crumbling throughout the region as a whole, not least under the pressure exerted by civil society. In this regard, we are particularly hoping that our African partners will now openly show for the first time how important the solution of the Zimbabwe crisis is to them.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to individual remarks such as those made by Zambia’s President Mwanawasa when he compared Zimbabwe with the sinking Titanic, the policy change by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has particularly caught our attention. At a special summit on 28 and 29 March 2007, its Heads of Government acknowledged their regional responsibility in the Zimbabwe conflict for the first time. President Mbeki has been provided with a clear mandate to set a dialogue in motion between the government and the opposition. His activities are to be supported by his Tanzanian counterpart, Mr Kikwete, in his capacity as current Chair of the SADC organ on politics, defence and security. The Secretary General of the SADC will present a report on the economic situation in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">The principal demands placed on Mugabe by the SADC are to keep to the date set for the Presidential elections in 2008 and to cease repression of the opposition. On 30 March, the central committee of the Zanu-PF party decided to hold Presidential elections in March 2008 and to bring forward the Parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for 2010, to 2008 as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Mugabe has been chosen as the leading candidate without any internal discussions. At the same time, changes were announced which would forcibly improve the starting position of Mugabe and his party in the run-up to the elections. These include, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the increase in wards and, consequently, their gerrymandering, the appointment, not through direct elections, of senate members in proportion to the strength of the party in Parliament, and the fact that if the office of President remains vacant, the new President shall be determined by Parliament and not through new elections. These new regulations still have to become law as a result of changes to the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The government has not stopped the use of force against individual members of the opposition. It has branded members of the Tsvangirai wing of the MDC opposition party terrorists and, in so doing, is trying to drive a wedge between the opposition which united for the first time following the March unrest. The State has, however, refrained from prohibiting or breaking up large-scale events such as the ‘Prayers Meeting’ referred to in the country’s two largest cities. The ban on gatherings and demonstrations has also been lifted, except for several areas in Harare.</p>
<p class="contents">Already by the end of 2006, the party congress of the Zanu-PF party had demonstrated that Mugabe’s position was no longer undisputed. In the meantime, Mugabe has increasingly been developing a siege mentality, which has manifested itself, not least, in the formation of parallel organisations such as the youth militia, which falls outside the military and police hierarchy. Their impressive, even oppressive, presence in front of the central committee’s session building certainly had an impact on the decision-making process of politburo members in favour of Mugabe’s appointment as a Presidential candidate.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite Mugabe’s tactical victory at the central committee meeting on 30 March, which gave him the nomination as a Presidential candidate in 2008 and thereby weakened the position of his critics within the party, the feeling in Zimbabwe is that a sort of apocalyptic mood seems to be holding sway. Therefore, within the EU, in addition to discussions on current developments, thoughts have turned to the post-Mugabe era. Over recent days, both the EU/Africa working group and the EU/Africa Directors have looked into Zimbabwe intensively. Monday's Council of Foreign Ministers discussed the crisis in Zimbabwe in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions, the Council welcomed the SADC initiative and declared its willingness to support it, if called on to do so. It has underlined its view that only a broad, constructive dialogue can form the basis for genuine reform and national reconciliation in Zimbabwe. At the same time, it has stressed that the EU will also implement humanitarian measures in future which will benefit the population directly.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communiqué following the special summit in March, the SADC called on the EU to put an end to sanctions. In view of the current situation in the country, we will not comply. Our policy must remain credible. Reacting to the unrest which took place in March, and this is something which the Council also decided upon on Monday, we will widen the consolidated list of persons subject to sanctions to include the police officers who are primarily responsible for the current crisis and the human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">There is agreement between the EU partners that a solution to the crisis in Zimbabwe can only be achieved with African help. Following their political about-turn in March, our African partners expressly called on the EU to be patient. We will continue to monitor closely, however, whether, and to what extent, the SADC policy which is being striven for is acquiring some sort of shape.</p>
<p class="contents">We are conscious of the fact, however, that we cannot sit back indefinitely. In the foreseeable future, the EU will have to adopt a stance in relation to the SADC initiative in terms of its content. We will also react with the necessary vigour to events in the country. The EU cannot, and will not, remain silent on human rights violations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, we condemn the recent acts of violent repression against the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also fully supported the statements issued by the German Presidency condemning the recent violence, arrests and mistreatment of detainees. The Government of Zimbabwe was also called upon to release those detainees and to respect fundamental rights. The crisis should be resolved through dialogue with all political forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Monday, the General Affairs Council also issued conclusions to this effect. In this context, the Commission continues to attach great importance to enhanced dialogue with Zimbabwe’s regional peers. We fully acknowledge the major role they can play in promoting national reconciliation in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore welcomed the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of States of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which took place on 28 and 29 March 2007 in Dar es Salaam. The regional leaders decided to engage in the resolution of the Zimbabwe crisis by appointing the South African President, Thabo Mbeki, as a mediator. It was agreed with all the European Member States that a high-level message would be delivered to SADC on the subject. Firstly, to recognise the major role the organisation can play in the resolution of the crisis and, secondly, to give SADC real breathing space in its mediation efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel, therefore, that nothing should be done to jeopardise the SADC initiative and that the EU should be seen to be ready to follow SADC efforts to resolve the Zimbabwean crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it was agreed to make an effort to properly inform the region and Africa at large of the content of EU measures, or sanctions, regarding Zimbabwe. They consist of a visa ban for the Zimbabwean leadership and the freezing of their assets, in addition to an arms embargo. Trade, economic and essential aid cooperation has not been affected by the EU measures. In this sense, the level of aid committed to Zimbabwe in 2006 alone was around EUR 193 million: EUR 86 million by the Commission and EUR 107 million by Member States. This kind of assistance, for the direct benefit of the Zimbabwean population, is due to be continued. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every Member of this House will be aware of the appalling situation in Zimbabwe. We have expressed our views in some 16 resolutions in recent years, but the Mugabe regime persistently reminds us that no matter how bad the situation, it can always make matters tragically worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Millions have fled the country; many of those who remain are on food aid; hyper-inflation is expected to reach 5000% by the end of this year; unemployment stands at 80%; 3000 people a week die from HIV-AIDS; and Zimbabwe has the world’s highest orphan rate. Those are the grim statistics. When people try to gather or make any sort of protest, they are, as we have seen, brutally attacked by the regime’s police.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that there has been one positive development: Mugabe’s latest brutalities have at last provoked a response from neighbouring African countries. This must be encouraged. The Southern African Development Community has finally recognised that a crisis exists in Zimbabwe. That is a very significant development. It is further evidence that opinion across Africa is shifting. Mugabe is now seen by his peers as a dictator who has selfishly abused his own people and whose actions threaten wider economic development across the whole continent. They no longer accept Mugabe’s tired excuse that Zimbabwe’s problems came from outside.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear for all to see that it is Mugabe who has brought his country and its people to their knees. He went into the SADC summit expecting endorsement of his policies, but instead left with a flea in his ear and the appointment of South African President Mbeki as facilitator of the dialogue between Zanu-PF and the opposition. Mbeki’s task will be to create conditions for free and fair elections.</p>
<p class="contents">However, until freedom is restored to Zimbabwe there must be no let-up on the pressure on the regime. All too often, European governments have on spurious grounds failed even to apply the EU’s own travel ban and other restrictive measures.</p>
<p class="contents">When Mugabe finally falls from power, the international community must be ready to act without delay. I call upon the Commission and the Council to begin serious planning now for a massive, comprehensive and urgent programme of assistance to Zimbabwe for the post-Mugabe era. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is in stark contrast with the Zimbabwe of today, with its appalling statistics. Life expectancy in Zimbabwe is currently one of the world’s lowest: 37 for men and not more than 34 for women; 80% of the Zimbabweans are living below the poverty line; one third of the population have fled the country, with millions of people having sought refuge in neighbouring countries, and 50 000 more refugees being added to their number every month.</p>
<p class="contents">The economy of the country that was once known as Africa’s grain basket, has plunged by 40% in one decade, and there is no improvement in sight. The Zimbabwean economy is still shrinking by 5.7%, which makes Zimbabwe the only country in Africa whose economy is not growing. The hyperinflation, to which reference has already been made, means it is impossible for the many Zimbabweans who stayed in Zimbabwe, with its mass unemployment, to meet their daily basic needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union was right to decide to penalise with even more extensive personal sanctions the Zimbabwean leaders, who, with their state terror, have brought about this level of devastation. As we all know, there is a great deal more needed to find a way-out. This way-out is described in our joint resolution. It outlines how the country might go forward into a post-Mugabe era, describes concrete steps and measures, and, rightly, makes a dramatic call on Mbeki and the SADC members to block the door to state terror, with as heavy a hand as necessary, and to clear the path for dialogue in the post-Mugabe era.</p>
<p class="contents">We are behind the broadest possible opposition to Mugabe and in favour of Zimbabwe. We would ask the Council to extend the scope of the sanctions. Anyone who is responsible for this ever steeper downward spiral in this country that was once so proud must be called to account, including ministers, representatives, army leaders, the police and the secret service, as well as the governor of the central bank. We would ask the United Kingdom to use its presidency in the Security Council to add Zimbabwe to the agenda. Finally, we really do hope that Mbeki, playing an even bigger role, will bring the Mugabe regime to an end, for, after nearly three decades, it is time for it to be done away with for good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are afraid that, in the foreseeable future, Zimbabwe was, is and will remain precisely such a country.</p>
<p class="contents">The paradox lies in the fact that we are celebrating the 27th anniversary of this country’s independence. Unfortunately, this independence does not involve freedom. For example, one and a half months ago, the opposition was brutally crushed. Two people were killed and 300 were arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the political side of the situation, which we frequently most like to discuss in Parliament. However, there is also an economic side to the problem which is perhaps even more serious. In Zimbabwe, nearly 4.5 million people are malnourished, one third of whom have been helped by the World Food Programme, and have received food as part of that programme. This is a country where the average life expectancy is 35.5 years. As the previous speaker mentioned, Zimbabwe is one of the world record holders (in negative terms) in this respect. One fifth of its population is infected with HIV, and there 3 200 new cases every week. Zimbabwe has the highest rate of orphans in the world. The unemployment rate in this country stands at 80%! Eighty per cent of the population also live below the poverty line! Every month, a few thousand people flee the country. Over 30% of its citizens have already emigrated to neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe is the only African country in which the economy is in decline. During the last decade, economic turnover in this country fell by 40%, and this year it fell by almost another 6%. Last year, the average rate of inflation rose to 2 200%. This year, it will no doubt exceed 5 000%! Since 1998, agricultural production has fallen by four fifths! Zimbabwe's two main industries, namely tobacco and gold mining are teetering on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all just statistics and, tragic and telling though they may be, I am afraid that dry figures, percentages and numbers may obscure the individual tragedies faced by millions of people. Zimbabwe may be far away, but let us remember the words of Ernest Hemingway: ‘Do not ask for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.’ Zimbabwe is a country which has fallen into a ‘black hole’. It is disappearing before our eyes, it is ceasing to exist economically and socially, and the only sign of a functioning government is political repression. We cannot remain silent.

Why does the European Parliament keep addressing the subject of Zimbabwe? Is it because human rights are being infringed? No, ladies and gentlemen. Let us call a spade a spade. It is because Great Britain dreams of making it a colony once again and because the other large countries in the European Union are again dreaming of new colonies on the African continent. These are the facts. Zimbabwe acquired its independence through a hard and bloody fight against the British colonists.</p>
<p class="contents">Are there problems? Of course there are. Is the situation as it is described? Of course it is, but it is the result of years of colonialism, it is the result of the measures imposed all these years by the European Union and other imperialist countries, measures designed to achieve an economic stranglehold on and the political isolation of the Zimbabwe regime. In the final analysis, if and how the situation changes in Zimbabwe is a matter for its people and neither the European Union nor anyone else is entitled to interfere in its internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Today there is a plan which has been developing for many years. What is this plan? To fund and buy out the opposition. Millions are being given to various persons who stand as political opponents to the regime. Non-governmental organisations are being funded that consist of paid employees who stand for nothing in the community in Zimbabwe. There are sanctions and, at the same time, Great Britain does not keep to the agreements it has made with Zimbabwe. Even the illegal arms trade continued and Margaret Thatcher's son was arrested and that is a known fact and was reported in all the newspapers.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore consider that the European Union has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of Zimbabwe or any other country. Any problems there may need to be resolved by the people themselves as they so choose. That is why we voted against the joint motion for a resolution and we are saddened by the fact that, although you know that all the measures you take and the embargo you impose on Zimbabwe makes things worse and causes thousands of people to die, you continue with the same barbaric policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is there a connection between Zimbabwe’s President and these people indulging in this rather curious pursuit? Very much so, because in the immediate vicinity of Mugabe's estate – Africa’s largest private residence – respectable citizens keep their heads above water by hunting mice on a daily basis. Indeed, these animals are, according to them, like beef to us. This is how deep Zimbabwe, up to recently Africa’s grain basket, has sunk under Robert Mugabe’s tyrannical regime.</p>
<p class="contents">This regime is founded on a campaign that is absurd and criminal in equal measure, as a result of which since 2000, thousands of productive farms have been confiscated from their white owners and handed over to Mugabe’s incompetent and indifferent figureheads, resulting in a large-scale famine. By the way, Mugabe's Zanu-PF Party uses the food shortage as a weapon against the opposition. The correspondent R.W. Johnson recently levelled ultimate criticism of Mugabe's tyranny. He reported that in Zimbabwe, people are eliminated on a mass-scale like animals and that most casualties are the direct result of intentional government policy. This genocide is probably ten times worse than that in Darfur, yet it is ignored by the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">Arnold Tsunga, chairman of the human rights organisation Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, used identical words to describe the situation. Tsunga called Mugabe’s policy ‘cunning genocide’, because it is not being noticed by governments, aid organisations or the press. My message to the Council, the Commission, and to this House, is that this indictment of cunning, implicit genocide should never give us one moment's peace until such time as it can be withdrawn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You will actually stop at nothing and are legitimising a dictatorship. I recommend that you again take to heart the moving appeal given by Bishop Tutu, for I consider him to be above suspicion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is sometimes believed that it is impossible to sink any lower in a country if it has the lowest life expectancy worldwide, has the highest rate of inflation across the globe, if unemployment is running at 80%, if just as many people are living below the absolute poverty level, and if the economy has shrunk by 40% over the last decade. Unfortunately, the power of the regimes in these very countries is still sufficient to hit out at the population, as happened most recently on 11 March. Many were arrested and tortured. As members of Parliament, we are particularly horrified by the brutal mistreatment of our colleague, Nelson Chamisa, who, en route to Brussels for a committee meeting of our Joint Parliamentary Assembly, was brutally beaten up at Harare airport by regime thugs, losing an eye in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">My thanks go to the Council which clearly expressed its views on the Council situation on 13 and 18 March and in the General Council as well on 23 April, and also expanded the list of travel bans imposed on leading supporters of the regime. At least the SADC has recognised that there is a crisis in Zimbabwe and has employed President Mbeki as a mediator. We are aware that unfortunately, Mugabe feels somewhat encouraged following the SADC meeting and repression is also continuing throughout the whole of the country without the international community paying any attention.</p>
<p class="contents">South Africa always plays a key role. President Mbeki must play the role of mediator in a credible fashion. We know how difficult it is to accept that a liberator can evolve into a tyrant, but it is in Mbeki’s hands to go down in the annals of history as someone who, in the end, has also helped human rights and democracy in Africa on the road to success by taking the side of the long-suffering people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have never heard such perversion of the truth in my life as what he just said in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I welcome the joint motion that seeks strongly to uphold the sanctions against the ruthless violence of the regime that is plaguing Zimbabwe in the worst possible way. I thank those who have worked hard on this motion for a resolution, and I am pleased with the result.</p>
<p class="contents">Isolating Mugabe and other members of his regime is of the utmost importance in showing both the international community and the other African nations that the European Union Member States will not tolerate these blatant abuses of human rights and dignity. We have consistently opposed this brutal menace and will continue to do so together. Mugabe should remember his promise to step down and do so now. This is the only action that he could take to benefit Zimbabwe. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of Zimbabwe’s illegitimate government are not allowed to enter any EU Member State and I refer, in particular, to the EU-Africa Summit scheduled to be held in Lisbon in December. The joint motion for a resolution makes clear and reasserts that this move would seriously undermine the European Union’s resolve. It would hamper the future use of soft power wherever we might need it. The European Union sanctions in place put real pressure on Mugabe’s brutal regime. As such, they need to be reinforced, strengthened and taken to the next level.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the next level, it is well known that Mugabe is seeking financial backing and support from countries, such as China, that are not always as firm on issues of freedom and democracy as I and many others would like. This joint motion shows Parliament’s determination to take this issue to the UN Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the money that we give to Zimbabwe must be spent in the proper way and must not swell the dictator’s coffers.</p>

In the sad days following the loss of the first democratic Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, it is especially important for all those who have been rooting for democracy in Russia and for whom a democratic Russia ought to be an important partner for Europe, to now acknowledge that the Russia of today has not fulfilled all the dreams which we shared when Boris Yeltsin appeared on the political stage in that country. Unfortunately, these hopes have remained unfulfilled. We have to acknowledge this fact and that is what our resolution expresses. I would like to once again point out that I am pleased that the resolution is the result of a compromise between many, diverse political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that, for me, the images shown on television of how the demonstrations held by human rights campaigners in Russia were repressed, were indeed traumatic, as they also reminded me of the worst times in my country when street protests were brutally crushed by the police. I would like to point out that, surprisingly, the Russian Human Rights Ombudsman shares this assessment of the brutality of the Russian police. That is why our declaration contains an appeal to the Russian Duma and to our colleagues, namely Russian Members of Parliament, to set up a special committee to deal with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In appealing to you, Members of this House, to adopt this resolution, I would like to also appeal to the Russian citizens, who sadly currently do not have access to real information, to be aware that our actions are not a sign of Russophobia, as the Kremlin's propaganda often claims. In fact, quite the opposite is the case. Our actions, our struggle to defend human rights in Russia, to bring democracy back to Russia stem from our deep feelings of friendship towards this country and our deep respect for great Russian literature and for Russia as a great nation. We want that nation to enjoy the same freedoms that we enjoy in the European Union and I would like the European Parliament to be an institution that is like a beacon of light for Russians, illuminating the path to democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have observed the massive human rights violations in Moscow and St. Petersburg with dismay, where peaceful demonstrations against the authoritarian bias of the system were suppressed by violent intervention by the police, with attacks made against passers-by who were not involved and western journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">The intimidation and suppression of the freedom of speech, the freedom of assembly and the freedom of the press in Russia has become systematic. We are familiar with this type of disinformation and lies from the war in Chechnya. Many media are under government control or operate self-censorship. Independent journalists such as Anna Politkovskaya were murdered. With 13 journalist murders during Putin’s time in office alone, Russia occupies third place after Iraq and Algeria – an alarming result.</p>
<p class="contents">The political opposition cannot find any mouthpiece. The freedom of the press and freedom of speech are under immense threat. Potential political opponents of Putin, such as Chodorkovsky and Lebedev are sitting in prison without a fair trial and Gary Kasparov was arrested repeatedly. Non-governmental organisations are harassed by means of laws which curtail the rights of civil society. The Russian leadership is not only using its courts but the entire security apparatus as well in the meantime in order to intimidate political opponents. The powers that be in the Kremlin are hitting out. As a result, progress towards the rule of law and an independent justice system are also under threat. It is a perfidious strategy to brand people who are calling for genuine democracy in the country as extremists so as to take away their credibility. Putin is not a flawless democrat. He comes from the KGB and his origins leave their mark.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the United Nations, yet it violates basic fundamental and human rights. The EU is negotiating a new partnership agreement. This agreement must contain a section on human rights which is also a constituent part of all agreements and treaties. We are showing our solidarity with our friends in Russia who are fighting for a peaceful and democratic future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Russian Government committed itself to guaranteeing these freedoms as a condition for being admitted to the Council of Europe in 1996. Today, 11 years later, the majority of people in Russia feel insecure and have no trust in law and justice. Sixty-five per cent claim to be unhappy, and more than half disapprove of the Government, which is already heading beyond mere authoritarianism, as one opposition leader put it.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the Russian Government to react to this resolution, which is a unanimous expression of serious but friendly concern. We also expect the European Council and Commission to make it absolutely clear at the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit that restoration of these basic freedoms will be a crucial test of Russia’s ability and willingness to be a credible international partner.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point, Russia has become essentially an authoritarian state. EU leaders will share responsibility for the further worsening of the situation there if they are not willing or able to face these new realities with determination and clarity. Speaking with one voice, on the basis of European values, is the only way to help Russia back to the road of democracy. It is vital that Russian citizens should enjoy the same freedoms – including freedom from fear and police violence – that we have been enjoying. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I remember that the German radical student leader Rudi Dutschke, who has been dead for a long time now and was nick-named the <span class="italic">Bürgerschreck,</span> warned the Left in Western Europe against this position. In his view, what happened in Russia at the time was completely unrelated to Socialism or Communism, but very much related to what he referred to as an ‘Asian’ tradition. This is a tradition in which a small group, using the toughest measures, manages to remain in charge in a large and sparsely populated country.</p>
<p class="contents">Every time someone in Russia is put in power who wishes to resolve this unsatisfactory situation, there has, to date, been every chance that his successor would have resorted to the old abuses. Khrushchev in the 50s and 60s, and Gorbachev in the 80s and 90s failed to change Russia from the top down.</p>
<p class="contents">The current President, Putin, like the tsars and Stalin previously, seamlessly fits into this old Russian mould. He managed to gain power when his chaotic predecessor, Yeltsin, was no longer able to run the country, and, having gained popularity among the Russians by destroying Chechnya, is now in the process of taking away their democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunate is the country that owns oil or natural gas, because the possession of them, and of the wealth that exports bring in, puts the leaders in a stronger position of power and makes domestic change virtually impossible. Moreover, the criticism levelled by most of the outside world that wants to buy energy will quickly subside. Russia now finds itself in the same position as Saudi Arabia or Iran. Even in the two largest cities, which, so far, offered the most scope for criticism and diversity, demonstrations by opponents are made impossible. The European countries and their residents should not accept this lying down, but should act in solidarity with those who want to turn Russia into a decent democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand and comprehend the European Union's 'Realpolitik' vis-à-vis Russia; at the same time, however, we also need to defend the basic principles of our collective European democratic civilisation. From this point of view, I consider it necessary for the question of human rights to be placed high on the European Union's agenda and within the framework of reinforced political dialogue with Russia and its political leadership. A first opportunity will be the summit on 17 May and the meeting with President Putin.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should like to comment on something else. It would be a serious political mistake for the European Union to equate human rights in Russia and the situation that prevails there with just certain circles which are openly funded by specific Russian political refugees within the known clique of oligarchs. The recent statements by Mr Berezovsky in London are typical of the intentions of certain circles. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Attempts to bring democracy to Russia are being suppressed, as are demonstrations and freedom of speech. However, we must be aware of the fact that Russia does not have a tradition of democracy and that those, such as Alexander I, who wanted to bring democracy to Russia in the past, have had to give up or have been widely criticised, as was the case with Boris Yeltsin, as he passed away. We have to be aware of the fact that, according to surveys, more Russians want order than democracy. This is why, when we support everything that is positive in Russia and which brings hope, we have to be aware that, in dealing with the Russian Government, we are drawing up agreements with a government which has a different set of values to Europe. Russia does not have, and has no experience of democracy at home. Neither does it have any experience of normal, civilised behaviour in terms of external relations.

<p class="contents">We all watched the events of 14 and 15 April in Moscow and St. Petersburg with a great deal of anxiety. Quite a few of us wonder whether, in view of these developments, the freedom of assembly in Russia is in jeopardy. The Russian Constitution guarantees Russian citizens the right to assemble peacefully, without bearing arms, in order to hold rallies and demonstrations, parades and pickets.</p>
<p class="contents">This is obviously contrary to the manner in which the Russian authorities acted recently against demonstrators in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod. Gary Kasparov reported these actions to me in a personal telephone call. It also needs to be borne in mind that the demonstrations of 14 and 15 April differed from previous marches in that the militia acted in a more hard-line manner and that, on this occasion, accredited journalists were detained temporarily as well as attacked.</p>
<p class="contents">The reporting carried out by several newspapers after the incidents was thoroughly critical. <span class="italic">Kommersant</span> talked about ‘Making mincemeat of those who disagreed’ and <span class="italic">Moskovskiy Komsomolets</span> about ‘All power to OMON’, while <span class="italic">Novaya Izvestiya</span> talked about ‘A besieged fortress and unprecedented toughness’.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there were also reports in which events were played down. A similar picture could be seen in the reaction of the Russian Government. While some government offices defended the action, the spokesperson on human rights, for example, Mr Lukin, conceded that the police had substantially exceeded their authority. The Governor of St. Petersburg, Mr Matvienko, ordered all complaints regarding attacks by Russian police units to be investigated. Sergei Yastrzhembsky, adviser to the Russian President on EU issues, made the same demand, while Ella Pamfilova, Chair of the commission, pointed out that the actions of the militia had damaged Russia’s standing worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">The Federal German Government also reacted to these events and, on 16 April, publicly expressed its anxiety in a statement given by the EU Council Presidency. In addition, Germany’s Deputy Government spokesperson, Mr Thomas Steg, declared in Berlin on 16 April that the excessive use of force at the weekend was cause for concern. The action taken against journalists was also unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Federal German Government is awaiting a full account of events from the Russian authorities. Following the incidents in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the German embassy in Moscow immediately lodged a complaint at a high level and requested an immediate and full explanation. We will naturally also speak to the Russian authorities with a certain degree of vigour concerning the situation regarding the freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly at the forthcoming human rights consultations between the EU and Russia which are scheduled for 3 May.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of the human rights situation in Russia must continue to be followed very attentively. This especially applies to the freedom of speech and assembly and free and fair access to the media. As a member of the United Nations, including its role as a member of the new Human Rights Council, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, Russia is obligated to respect fundamental rights. Respect for these fundamental rights is also of the utmost importance in view of the forthcoming elections in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">We will make it clear to Russia that it is in the country’s own interests to do everything possible to ensure that the freedom of speech and the freedom of assembly are strengthened and not weakened further.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a substantial part of the values and human rights on which Europe is founded have been established by Russian intellectuals and artists. We should remind ourselves of this fact and ensure that we continue to tread along this path and not a different one.</p>

I should like to welcome the BBC staff working here in Strasbourg who, in tribute to their missing colleague, are in the public gallery today to listen to our debate.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">When a kidnapping takes place anywhere in the world, the victim’s friends and family always look to the media to keep the fate of their loved one in the eye of the public and of us as politicians. When the kidnapped person is himself a journalist, it is our responsibility to cherish their fate as they cherish others’.</p>
<p class="contents">Such is the case with BBC journalist Alan Johnston, abducted in Gaza 46 days ago. Alan’s career personally symbolises the outstanding reputation of the BBC for integrity and objectivity. Having previously worked in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, Alan is passionate about his reporting on the Palestinian people, with whom he has a close connection and for whom he has deep respect. This has resonated among his audience, 50 000 of whom have this week signed the online petition asking for his release.</p>
<p class="contents">Our first thoughts are, of course, with Graham and Margaret Johnston and with the other members of his family, to whom we send our sympathy and support.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of all the BBC management and staff and to journalists, trade unions in Britain and worldwide who have led the campaign for Alan’s release.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the colleagues here today told me that Alan is known quite simply as someone who brings stories to life. Today his life is our story. Alan Johnston’s courageous presence, as the only permanently-based Western journalist in Gaza, has precisely enabled him to report the suffering of the Palestinian people, and now he has become the ultimate case of a journalist caught up in his own story – a victim of the suffering itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that Alan remains alive and secure, but not who is holding him. We can speculate whether his abduction was for reasons of politics, money or recognition, but we do not know which, if any. We can recognise that to prevent what has happened to Alan from happening to others requires a political understanding and solution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, today our response is not political – it is humanitarian, to say to whoever is listening: release Alan Johnston without harm and without hindrance. The European Parliament should welcome the assurances of help made by Europe’s Foreign Ministers this week and of ‘permanent contact’ promised by our own High Representative. We are sure you will act on these promises. I understand too that Commissioner Almunia, responding to today’s debate, will pledge that his colleague Mr Michel will this weekend press Alan Johnston’s case with President Abbas and representatives of the Palestinian Authority. We thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament acknowledges the support and cooperation of the Palestinian Authority and we are proud of Europe’s support to sustain your staff and the vital services they provide, but it is your intelligence services who have been able to make contact with those who have abducted Alan, and it is in you that we place our hopes for a breakthrough.</p>
<p class="contents">In radio circles, they say that the biggest crime is to say nothing into the microphone. Alan Johnston’s kidnapping is the radio silence that now must come to an end.</p>

Alan Johnston was a good journalist, working for a well-known, popular and respected medium, namely the BBC. Alan Johnston was kidnapped, in spite or because of the fact that he specifically wanted to work for and among the people of the Middle East, an area currently facing crisis. He worked for these people as he informed the world of their situation and, by providing us with information, allowed us politicians to also attempt to resolve the crisis, a crisis over which we sadly have very little influence.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, kidnappings, terrorism and murder are sadly all phenomena that are part of today's world, a world where there are no principles left, not even – if one may describe it thus – the principles of warfare. These wars are being fought in the most base manner. Alan Johnston fell victim to this phenomenon. To a certain extent, we are all victims. I hope that the relevant authorities will do everything possible to free Alan Johnston. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These journalists risk their lives in order to serve the cause of freedom of information and consequently assist in promoting the Palestinian people’s fight for justice. The kidnapping of journalists such as Alan Johnston is, therefore, against the interests of the Palestinian people and is severely damaging their just demands.

Opposition from the neighbouring Israel has meant that the port and airport that had been planned with EU funds have not come into being, any more than has the open link with the much larger part of the future Palestinian state along the river Jordan. Israel was, for a long time, a place that offered employment, but it has largely taken this option away for fear of attacks, and admits far fewer people into the country via the border post of Erez.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel also controls the border crossing with Egypt. In this isolated area, a large section of the Palestinian population live like sardines, with no job, with no income and with no adequate housing. The wise decision to remove the Israeli colonist villages from this coastal strip may have done something for those who had lived in them and who were hated by those around them, but hardly anything for anyone else there.</p>
<p class="contents">Gaza is a disaster area full of people without any future to look forward to, and that makes it a sort of prison or breeding ground for acts of despair. For a long time, these acts of despair mainly consisted of suicide attacks against Israeli targets, but they also include kidnappings. Alan Johnston is the fifteenth journalist to be kidnapped in Gaza and in the month following his kidnap, nothing was heard about him for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">All Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas, Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and the PLO’s imprisoned party leader, Marwan Barghouti, unanimously condemn heinous acts of this kind. A lack of convincing success stories on the path to a state of their own and to provisions and income for their people has meant that they are losing control over events. Without any prospects for the future, unknown criminals are taking over power. This does not do anything to make the situation in Palestine or Israel any better. Journalists in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, are less and less able to follow events on the ground. This is why we must be vigilant, and this is why the kidnapped journalists must be freed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in this Parliament must speak out strongly to send a clear message of condemnation of the acts of violence that have taken place and the kidnapping of a man who has gained a reputation as one of the world’s leading media broadcasters. He has built up a reputation over many years – but in particular during the last three years in Gaza – as a broadcaster who is objective and balanced in his reporting of a very difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on everybody who has any influence or power over his captors to do all they can to secure his release. For the Palestinian people themselves, this crisis is adding to an already tragic situation. It is sending out a message to the rest of the world that not even experienced journalists are welcome or safe in Gaza.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a man who has been informing the rest of the world of the suffering, injustice and tragedy that continues there. Targeting him by kidnapping him is not only an appalling crime in itself, but it is self-defeating in terms of the Palestinian people’s cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Gaza is isolated enough without cutting off accurate media reporting. We are calling on the Palestinian Authority in particular to work for his release as an absolute priority and on the Council and Commission to maximise their efforts to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to Alan Johnston’s family and friends, I express my sincere support on behalf of the PPE-DE Group in this Parliament. I hope that their ordeal will soon have a relieving and positive conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I do not think any of us can imagine why he is being held. He is a man who has consistently spoken up for the Palestinian people. To kidnap someone like him is unbelievable. What do they hope to achieve? It certainly does nothing for the Palestinian cause, as many Palestinians themselves have pointed out. His only offence is his belief that the story of Gaza and its people should be told in a fair and balanced way, and he has being doing that in an exceptional manner for the last three years. He was the only foreign correspondent living permanently in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p class="contents">We all hoped that he would have been released by now, as the 14 others kidnapped since 2005 were released, and we are today adding our voices to those calling for the Palestinian Authority to redouble its efforts to secure Alan Johnston’s speedy release. We are also calling for all attacks on journalists to cease. What more can any of us say? I am sure that people across the EU are hoping and praying for his release. All we are doing today is trying to add our voices to those of his parents and his colleagues, and to say to his kidnappers: realise that if anything happens to him, you will have lost a strong voice telling your story to the world. All you will achieve is to isolate yourself and the Palestinian people further. That cannot be what you want. You want your voice to be heard, not to be further marginalised. These acts make it more difficult for those of us who have always supported the Palestinian cause to persuade people of the validity of the argument, and that is why it is completely self-defeating and betrays the Palestinian people, who continue to suffer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During his three years in Gaza he has taken a strong interest in social and political developments there and he has told the story of the people of Gaza. Therefore, as others have said, it very much harms the Palestinian cause for him not to be doing the job that he loves and does so well.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005 and 2006 alone, 181 journalists and assistants were killed, 1678 arrested, 56 kidnapped and 2780 physically attacked or threatened. The year 2006 saw the highest death toll since 1994 when 103 died, in particular in Rwanda, Algeria and the former Yugoslavia. Censorship and media bans are, of course, widespread and persistent.</p>
<p class="contents">In this joint motion for a resolution we are calling on all EU bodies – Member State diplomats, the High Representative for CFSP and the Commission – to strengthen and coordinate their efforts to secure Mr Johnston’s release. We are also calling on the Palestinian Authority to increase its efforts and it, no doubt, will give the matter all the greater priority if it is pressed by the Palestinian people. I thank all those in Gaza – journalists and citizens of all kinds – for their vocal demands for Alan Johnston’s release. They know that they need a journalist of integrity and commitment to give them a window on the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Free democracies cannot flourish without press freedom. As we insist on Alan Johnston’s safe return, we salute the courage of all journalists who put their safety on the line in order to bring the truth to the world and to allow us all to enjoy democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The BBC correspondent, Alan Johnston, was abducted in Gaza on 12 March. A large amount of anxiety was prevalent at last Monday’s Council of Foreign Ministers surrounding Mr Johnston, who has already been missing for six weeks. We call for his immediate and unconditional release.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Johnston is an internationally respected journalist with many friends in Gaza. It has always been a matter of concern for him that the world should see with its own eyes how things stand there. His abduction is a criminal act which I can only condemn in the strongest possible terms. At this point, I would also like to extend my sympathy to his family, which is fighting on his behalf, and which has already been living in fear and uneasy uncertainty for more than one and a half months now.</p>

<p class="contents">Margot Wallström, as Vice-President of the Commission, has made a public statement on the kidnapping of Mr Johnston on behalf of the whole College, expressing its deep concern over his plight and calling for his immediate release. This week, the kidnapping was condemned by the Council, which has called for Mr Johnston’s unconditional release. Furthermore, yesterday, my colleague Louis Michel also raised the issue of the abduction of the BBC journalist during a meeting with the Palestinian Deputy Prime Minister, Mr al-Ahmad. He asked him to use all his influence and contacts and to do everything in his power to locate Mr Johnston. The Deputy Prime Minister assured Mr Michel that he would do all he could to secure a rapid release.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Michel also repeated those requests in his meetings with other Palestinian interlocutors during his trip to the region. Intensive coordinated diplomatic efforts are under way for an immediate release of Mr Johnston. Our staff in Jerusalem are following developments closely and inform us that the Palestinian authorities, in cooperation with the security forces, are discussing all possible options with the UK Government, with a view to a successful outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">This remains a high priority for President Abbas, and we note the public statements that have also been made by Prime Minister Haniyeh, as well as by Mr Barghouti, on behalf of Palestinian prisoners, and by Palestinians around the world, condemning this kidnapping.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the kidnapping of a prominent journalist like Alan Johnston, who has done so much to bring the situation of Palestinians to the world’s attention, is particularly distressing. Those responsible for this abduction are doing a disservice to the cause of the Palestinian people and to the peace process in the Middle East.</p>

The human rights organisation, Karapatan, has recorded 839 cases of summary executions since 2001. All the victims were individuals who had given their support to matters of concern facing the Filipino people: farmers fighting for their land, workers and trade union leaders who are standing up for fair wages and better working conditions, and committed members of the clergy.</p>
<p class="contents">Arbitrary executions, omnipresent political repression, growing militarisation and the fact that perpetrators from paramilitary and military units are exempt from punishment and protected have, unfortunately, become a government trademark. For a long time, foreign countries have looked away. As far as the International Court of Justice in The Hague is concerned, ignorance and a misjudgment of the situation are just as responsible for the fact that foreign countries have turned a blind eye for a long time as the approval given by the USA which the government in Manila could, and can continue, to rely on.</p>
<p class="contents">We condemn the rough and systematic violations of citizens’ rights, the abductions, the disappearances and political assassinations. We firmly call on the State authorities in the Philippines to carry out the necessary inquiries and to bring those responsible to justice. We call on the State authorities to ratify the UN Convention on abduction by force and to enact the implementing provisions. All these steps are required as the first step in de-escalation so that, in a few weeks, halfway democratic elections can be guaranteed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has been formulated in the joint resolution, victims of these summary executions include members of opposition parties, the clergy, trade union leaders, farmers, journalists, lawyers, human rights activists and so on, as well as witnesses of other summary murders who were accused by government representatives of being a front for illegally armed groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The Arroyo Government bears a high degree of responsibility for over 800 political assassinations since he came to power in 2001. Within the framework of so-called counterinsurgency, the Filipino army and police also resort to ways of committing political assassinations. In a chapter of the report entitled <span class="italic">Orders of Battle</span>, in the light of documents held by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, it is clearly shown that summary executions are an army and police strategy. This report, on which basis the Armed Forces of the Philippines act, and which is also frequently implemented by the Filipino National Police, makes provision for a military fight against political opponents.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the Conservative group obviously wishes to strike any reference ‘to the role played by the armed forces in these murders’ from the joint resolution. This is nothing short of scandalous. This would not only amount to a slap in the face for the United Nations and its special rapporteur, but also a slap in the face for the victims and their friends and family. In the UN special rapporteur’s report, the following must also be emphasised: ‘Newspapers carry almost daily reports of senior military officials urging that such groups be neutralised and calling upon the populace to recognise that to support their candidates in the upcoming elections would be to support the enemy.’ That leaves nothing to be desired in terms of clarity and I ask that the passage mentioned not be deleted from the resolution so that this House sends out a clear signal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The current situation shows a clear pattern of political assassinations in the Philippines, and we must therefore call upon the government in Manila to take the appropriate measures with a view to putting an end to the threats and harassment against members of the opposition, journalists, farm workers calling for their rights to be respected within the context of the agrarian reform under way, human rights activists and even witnesses in trials of their victimisers.</p>
<p class="contents">Various human rights organisations – such as Food First Information and Action Network (FIAN) – have for a long time been warning, for example, of the non-implementation of national agrarian reform programmes, which means that many landowners are refusing to hand land over to the farmers. The climate of violence linked to this situation has now led to the assassination of at least 38 <span class="italic">campesino</span> leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">We should welcome the fact that the President has committed herself to the principle of ‘zero tolerance’ in the face of human rights violations, but their scale demands much more ambitious actions, particularly in view of the fact that various national and international reports directly implicate parts of the army and the police in those violations. Notable amongst these reports are the statements by the UN Human Rights Council’s Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, Philip Alston, and by the Melo Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is particularly alarming in the Bontoc peninsula, where hundreds of farmers are facing many cases of harassment and physical violence perpetrated by private armed groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that it is important to take note of the work carried out by the negotiation panel of the peace process as well as the government’s announcement that complete self-determination for the people of Mindanao would be guaranteed.</p>

The risk is rising that internal political conflicts will escalate. Since 2006, as has been mentioned by my fellow Members, journalists, human rights activists, lawyers, farmers and priests have been murdered. What is unclear is who the perpetrators are. It is clear, however, that the murders always follow the same pattern. The authorities are incapable of conducting investigations with sufficient thoroughness. The judicial system is overloaded, under funded and inefficient. The number of convictions is so low that one can almost already talk about a climate of impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">President Arroyo and his government are aware of the seriousness of the situation. A special police task force and the independent Melo Commission were set up. Their recommendations resulted in the State President ordering the strengthening of the investigation and prosecution processes, the establishment of special courts and, finally, the creation of witness protection programmes as well. In February, the UN’s special rapporteur, Mr Philip Alston, was able to question those responsible and affected extensively. I side with his demand that accusations regarding the involvement of elements of the military or individuals in the army should be examined. The European Union should offer both technical support and support in terms of personnel to enable these murders to be cleared up and the justice system to be improved in a sustainable manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In two weeks, elections will be held there. This will, in part, involve the election of new senators. Unfortunately, the situation in the Philippines is once again such that, while in other countries elections celebrate democracy to some extent and are refreshing even if they create tensions, the Philippine press are only writing about how many people will die and how violent the forthcoming elections will be. This has been happening for over half a year, and is something that I have been following closely. It is a bad omen for that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I visited the Philippines this year and tried to become acquainted with the situation. I would like to say that in the Philippines the voice of the European Union is listened to very carefully and it is a good thing that our Parliament is very critical of any violence which may accompany the political process. We should clearly ask the government of the Philippines to intensify efforts to ensure that political killings cease to be a constant part of the election campaign in that country. Unfortunately, it is a very extreme example of the political landscape in that beautiful country, which deserves to live in democracy, as we do. I am pleased that there are so many Members in the European Parliament who share this view and support our joint declaration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Government of the Philippines has degraded the military effectiveness of Islamist terrorists in the south-east, and negotiated a peace accord with one group and an ongoing ceasefire with another. However, for some time, sadly there has been a series of murky extrajudicial killings, allegedly carried out by the security forces. The government rightly recognised this as a very serious matter and ordered appropriate investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">This resulted in a series of recommendations this February from Justice Melo’s independent commission, set up specifically to address this issue, followed by a six-point government-endorsed plan to stop further human rights abuses and end the existing climate of impunity. I warmly welcome this approach, and in particular the setting-up of a dedicated police task force, Usig, to bring those in authority who have ordered human rights violations to eventual justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The government of the Philippines respects its citizens’ human rights in principle. A further positive note is the abolition of the death penalty in June 2006. The EU has worked towards this time and again.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there is cause for alarm. In 2006, the killings and abductions of journalists, left-wing political activists, civil rights activists and Church representatives increased significantly throughout the entire country. The opposition has provided reports of executions without court proceedings and holds the government and its security apparatus responsible. At the very least, the government is accused of failing to resolve crimes with the necessary vigour. For its part, the government rejects these accusations and suspects, at least in part, purges within the militant left-wing camp.</p>
<p class="contents">The most prominent recent victim was Bishop Alberto Ramento, who was extremely critical of the government. His murder was already described as having been cleared up the very day it had been committed. It was alleged to have been a robbery with murder committed by a youth. Grave doubts were expressed by Mr Ramento’s cohorts and criticism made of the inadequate and unprofessional preservation of evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Shortly before starting out on his European trip in the summer of 2006, President Arroyo appointed a Commission chaired by the former Supreme Court judge, José Melo, to investigate the murders of politically active government critics. The Melo Commission report was published in February 2007 in the face of massive public pressure. This report confirmed the accusation surrounding a lack of readiness to produce clarifying evidence and apportioned primary responsibility to the armed forces. An investigation by UN special rapporteur Alston has reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has repeatedly addressed the Philippines on this problem in an unequivocal manner through its embassies in the country and political meetings within the framework of the human rights dialogue. On the strength of this, and under public pressure from active Filipino civil society, the government gave a public presentation of the measures taken hitherto, acknowledged its shortcomings and asked the EU for support in establishing special courts and special public prosecutors’ offices, in consolidating witness protection, strengthening the technical and forensic capabilities of the security forces and in consolidating consciousness on the part of the security forces in observing human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">At the invitation of the Filipino Government, an EU mission is currently in the country examining the conditions for this request. Furthermore, the national Human Rights Commission and civil society should be strengthened with a view to observing the situation. In addition to the killings and abductions of critics of the regime and government, serious accusations are being levelled in the Philippines concerning torture, the disappearance of individuals, unlawful detention, human trafficking and the abuse of women and children. Above all in the military conflict with various Communist and separatist rebel groups, and in the fight against terrorism, human rights violations are regularly committed by the police and the military and acts of violence also committed by members of extremist groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In recent high-level contacts – including the meeting between President Barroso and President Arroyo last September, and between Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Foreign Minister Romulo in March – we have encouraged the Filipino authorities to advance their economic and social reforms, but expressed grave concern about the sharp increase in extrajudicial killings. We also made clear our support for the peace process in Mindanao.</p>
<p class="contents">Our primary concern is that the extrajudicial killings should stop and that the crimes which have been committed should be properly investigated and the perpetrators duly prosecuted, building on the conclusions of the reports of Senior Judge Melo and Professor Alston.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, together with Member States, is therefore responding positively to a request from the Filipino Government to provide technical support for investigations. Because the areas in which support has been requested are quite diverse, we are preparing a needs-assessment mission with Member State and Commission participation, which will visit the Philippines in May for direct discussions with the authorities and other interested groups, including civil society. The Commission is funding the majority of the costs of the mission and has played a lead role in its preparation.</p>
<p class="contents">The findings of this mission should provide a basis on which the EU can mobilise effective support for the investigations. Naturally, we will seek to work in close coordination with the UN rapporteur for extrajudicial killings, Professor Alston. I am very glad that Parliament has signalled its support. We must continue to encourage the authorities to make sure that the investigations are adequately carried out and that the perpetrators are brought to justice in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that progress is being made in the Mindanao peace process. A formal peace agreement may not be too far away. At present, we are giving substantial indirect support through assistance for rural development and health and improvement of livelihoods. We have signalled that we are willing to give important direct assistance when the parties are closer to signature of a formal peace agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the other insurgency involving the NPA, we should continue to encourage the Filipino authorities to re-open peace talks and allow those who are willing to abandon the gun for politics to do so, while ensuring that the new security legislation is implemented in full respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware that what he and his Greek party mainly want is to highlight the long-term conflict between the former British colonial empire and the former movement for independence, led by Mugabe, the country’s current President. This is underlined as a conflict between absolute evil and absolute good. Like my colleague Mr Pafilis, I am in favour of the Mugabe of the 70s and against colonialism, but he and I have very different opinions about the present, as I have made clear in previous urgency debates. I am in favour of land reform, in other words for the land of large farmers to be carved up in favour of small farmers. The way in which this is being done in Zimbabwe, however, has led to violence, intimidation and people fearing for their own lives, not least black farmers and workers on the land. Subsequently, towns, too, were on the receiving end of this sort of violence. Mugabe is no longer serving his people against colonial exploiters, but is plunging them into chaos, oppression and poverty. Since a regime such as this one is founded on violence and intimidation, and does not deserve to carry on, I will be voting in favour of the resolution on Zimbabwe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title36"></a><a name="creitem36"></a>

<p>I shall restrict myself in this answer to drawing your attention to some important facts concerning energy. At its last meeting, the European Council paved the way for a decisive change by adopting a comprehensive energy action plan laying the foundations for a European energy policy.</p>
<p>In particular, this action plan sets the binding objective of increasing the share of biofuels in overall EU transport petrol and diesel consumption to 10% by 2020. However, it states explicitly that there might be competition between the different possible ways of using the raw materials affected by this policy. The European Council has therefore called on the Commission to propose flanking measures this year to ensure sustainable production and use of bioenergy and to avoid conflicts between different uses of biomass.</p>
<p>It will be some time before all this is decided on and implemented; however, I believe that account will be taken of the honourable Member’s apparent concerns.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0211"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is binding on neither the Council nor the Member States, was not given orally during Question Time to the Council at the European Parliament's April 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council takes the problems associated with the cultivation of opium poppies in Afghanistan very seriously. As it stated in its conclusions of 5 March 2007, it recognises the significant and detrimental impact that production of and trafficking in drugs are having upon the stability and security of Afghanistan and the surrounding region as well as internationally, including on the EU Member States themselves.</p>
<p>In May 2006 the Council approved an Action Oriented Paper on 'Increasing EU support for combating drug production in and trafficking from Afghanistan, including transit routes' (doc. 9370/1/06), which comprises a consolidated framework for EU policy in support of Afghanistan and its neighbours.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of May 2007, the Council reaffirmed its commitment to supporting the Government of Afghanistan in its efforts to tackle drugs; it also called on Member States to continue their support, in particular through the rapid implementation of the recommendations in the EU's Action-Oriented Paper.</p>
<p>The Council has not debated whether farmers' crops should be bought up.</p>
<p>It conducts a regular dialogue on drugs issues with the Russian Federation, which is an important partner in efforts to control drugs, particularly those from Afghanistan. In addition, a conference of experts on drugs and drug addiction was held in Warsaw from12 to 14 November 2006, at which practical measures to promote cooperation between the two partners were debated (for conclusions, see doc. 16379/06). The conclusions agreed at the conference are currently being implemented. The issue of how drugs are smuggled out of Afghanistan was the main subject of the Second Ministerial Conference on drug trafficking routes from Afghanistan ('Paris 2 – Moscow 1'), further to the Paris Pact, from 26 to 28 June 2006 in Moscow, at which the Moscow Declaration and Recommendations were adopted. In addition, the drugs issue regularly figures on the agenda for meetings of the EU-Russia Permanent Partnership Council (PPC) on Freedom, Security and Justice.</p>
<p>The German Presidency also intends to hold a troika meeting with Western Balkan countries concerning drugs issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0217"></a>

<p>The Council wishes to inform the honourable Member that Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I) was adopted by it on 22 December 2000.</p>
<p>Apart from certain precisely delineated legal areas, the scope of this Regulation covers the essentials of civil and commercial law. The Regulation includes rules of jurisdiction relating specifically to object rights in rem in immovable property and to the rental or leasing of immoveable property. Article 22(1) lays down the rules of jurisdiction on the basis of which a person may bring a case before a court in a Member State.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the free circulation of judgments, the rulings handed down in a Member State bound by this Regulation shall be recognised and enforced in another Member State bound by the Regulation subject to rules clearly set out in it. Property law is a matter for the Member States’ national competence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 1980 Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations contains provisions on the determination of the law applicable in cases with a demonstrable connection to the law of various states. Article 4(3), in particular, stipulates which law shall be applicable where the contract relates to an object right in rem in a plot of land or a right to the use of one.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the Council would advise the honourable Member that work is being done on the communitarisation of this Convention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0225"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the April 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Where the further development of the EU’s immigration policy (Global Approach to Migration) is concerned, in particular the more intensive dialogue with third countries, the Council has been extremely active over the past year.</p>
<p>At the Conference of European and African Ministers on Migration and Development, which was held on 10/11 July 2006 in Rabat, and focused on West, Central and North Africa, the Rabat Declaration on a partnership between Europe and Africa on Migration and Development, and also an action plan with detailed measures and recommendation for cooperation in the field of migration, were adopted. Measures to combat illegal migration feature prominently in both of them.</p>
<p>The Conference of European and African Ministers on Migration and Development held on 22/23 November 2006 in Tripoli, which focused on the continent of Africa as a whole, saw the adoption of a joint African and EU declaration on migration and development, and also of the Ouagadougou action plan for combating the trafficking of human beings, in particular the trade in women and children.</p>
<p>The EU’s agenda for migration and development was set out in the conclusion of the meeting of the European Council in December 2006. The Heads of State or Government saw it as important that the Union’s policy in this area, which is of ever-increasing importance, should be made comprehensive and given coherent form in order to do justice to the issue’s increasing importance in foreign relations. The European Union’s intention is that the combination of measures to combat illegal immigration with others to make use of the potential benefits of legal migration and to address causes should have the effect of maximising the benefits of migration and reducing to a minimum its drawbacks. The following specific courses of action were decided upon:</p>
<p>Performance of the joint undertakings agreed on at the Rabat and Tripoli conferences;</p>
<p>More intensive dialogue with Africa on migration issues by sending specific EU missions to key African countries over the coming years; </p>
<p>The Member States and the Commission should integrate migration and development issues in their aid measures and the planning of programmes (and also in the country-specific strategy papers), enhance coordination among themselves and extend the joint planning of programmes.</p>
<p>Country-specific cooperation platforms are to be set up for migration and development.</p>
<p>Preparation of the Global Forum on International Migration and Development (to be held between 9 and 11 July in Brussels).</p>
<p>Improvement of practical cooperation with third countries in relation to returns and the speeding-up of negotiations on EC return agreements with third countries.</p>
<p>Development of measures to combat the smuggling of immigrants and the trafficking in human beings, especially for the protection of women and children.</p>
<p>Exploration of ways and means whereby circular and temporary migration between the EU and third states might be alleviated on the basis of proposals to be submitted by the Commission by June 2007.</p>
<p>Application of the Global Approach to Migration to the eastern and southern neighbouring regions of the European Union on the basis of proposals to be submitted by the Commission by June 2007.</p>
<p>In addition to that, deeper cooperation on migration issues will be among the main topics of the discussion that we are currently having with our African partners with a view to the adoption of a new joint strategy for the EU and Africa at the Lisbon Summit in November 2007. We are convinced that the European Parliament’s contribution to this process will be an extremely valuable one.</p>
<p>The abolition of poverty in developing countries, and hence the addressing of one of the causes of flight and illegal migration is not a matter for the Council to deal with on its own. On 20 December 2005, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission signed the European Consensus on Development, which states that the pre-eminent and all-embracing goal of EU development cooperation is the removal of poverty by means of sustainable development, together with the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals. The implementation of the EU Consensus on Development and the new financial instrument for development cooperation, together with the 10th European Development Fund and the successful conclusion of the ongoing negotiations on economic partnership agreements, will certainly help achieve those Goals, and it should be emphasised that the EU has agreed that it should give more and better aid. One objective set out under the European Development Consensus is that the Member States should strive to increase their development aid by 0.7% of gross national income by 2015 and set themselves the collective intermediate goal of an increase of 0.56% by 2010.</p>
<p>Finally, as regards the war on epidemics in developing countries and, in particular, against what are known as the diseases of poverty (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis), the long-term estimates are optimistic in so far as the number of deaths caused by these three diseases is expected to decrease on the assumption that the current efforts and trends in the fight against them are continued. The Council is firmly determined to place itself in the advance guard where the fight against AIDS/HIV, tuberculosis and malaria is concerned, and to redouble its efforts in the spheres of prevention, care, treatment and research.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0229"></a>

Altogether, € 96.8 m has been allocated to aid to Eritrea through the European Development Fund (EDF 9).</p>
<p>Does the Council really consider it appropriate that the EU should give aid to a State which treats its own citizens and those of other countries in the way in which Dawit Isaak is being treated?</p>
<p>Ought not the EU to suspend payment of this aid until Eritrea displays respect for freedom of speech and human rights?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council is fully aware of the critical state of human rights in Eritrea, evidence of which is furnished, inter alia, by the detention, since September 2001, of Dawit Isaak and of other journalists and politicians. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of their seizure, then, the EU addressed an urgent appeal to the Eritrean Government to either have the detainees charged and sent to face a fair and public trial with proper legal representation or to release them unconditionally. The EU also urged the government of the state of Eritrea in strong terms to provide detailed information as to where and under what conditions the detainees are being held, and as to their state of health, and EU representatives in Asmara have also approached the Eritrean authorities in relation to these matters.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the aid provided by the Commission to Eritrea in accordance with the national strategy paper and indicative programme for priorities for cooperation in the 2002-2007 period are the reduction of poverty in the country and the promotion of its economic and social development; this includes humanitarian aid and the reconstruction of social and transport infrastructures, support for the demobilisation and reintegration of the population groups involved in war, and support in the development of long-term strategies in the fields of food safety, transport and education.</p>
<p>Suspension of EC aid for Eritrea would necessitate the application of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, according to which this cannot happen until consultations between the parties have been held. No proposal has been made to the Council that this be done.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0232"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members, was not presented orally at Council Question Time at Parliament’s April 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Galileo is a major European advanced technology project, and any further delay would therefore be unacceptable. In February, prompted by the faltering concession negotiations, the Presidency, represented by the Federal Minister for Transport, Building, and Urban Affairs, Wolfgang Tiefensee, held talks in person with both the Commission and all the partners in the consortium, at which it emerged that the negotiations had been stalled since at least the beginning of the year. The eight companies involved have still not implemented their internal arrangements laid down in December 2005 regarding the key organisational aspects and have so far been unable to agree on a common approach.</p>
<p>That being the case, the Council decided at its meeting of 22 March 2007 to stress in no uncertain terms that the present situation can no longer be tolerated. In its conclusions it called on the bidding consortium to implement the December 2005 agreement and restart the negotiations with the GNSS Supervisory Authority no later than 10 May 2007. It wished to see substantial progress – and hence clear prospects for a successful conclusion to the negotiations – by the time of its meeting in June. The Commission was accordingly asked to report to the Council in June on the progress of the negotiations and, in addition, to draw up alternative implementation scenarios for the Galileo project so as to enable the Council, in June, to take a decision on the next stages of the project in full knowledge of the current state of play.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the other outstanding project implementation matters, the Council has asked the Commission to submit proposals to its June meeting with a view to securing the long-term public financial commitments entailed in the project and making EGNOS operational as soon as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0236"></a>

<p>Major changes in Egypt's Constitution are impending, with the aim of terminating the state of emergency which has already been in force for 26 years. However, the opposition and human rights groups are warning that the new Constitution will result in human rights violations. Members of the Egyptian opposition have protested outside Parliament in Cairo about President Mubarak's 'constitutional coup'. This week, the President intends to press through 34 amendments to the Constitution. These measures will be conducive to electoral fraud and increase the President's power. The amendments will turn Egypt into a constitutional police state. The President will then be able to have those who are suspected of 'any terrorist crime' tried by military tribunals, against whose judgment there will be no appeal. Moreover, religious parties will be banned and judicial monitoring of elections will be abolished.</p>
<p>What is the Council's view of the present developments in Egypt? What effect will these reforms in Egypt have on relations between the EU and Egypt?

<p>The EU has been actively following the process of constitutional reform in Egypt, which was concluded on 26 March 2007 with a referendum.</p>
<p>On 3 April 2007, the presidency, on behalf of the European Union, issued a statement on constitutional reform in Egypt, in which the EU noted that the referendum had been held only a few days after the parliament had agreed to it, so that little time was available for public debate.</p>
<p>The statement urged further reforms aimed at enhancing public involvement in the political process and went on to note that the EU will follow with great attention the developments in connection with the planned new anti-terrorism law and expects any new legislation to be in line with international standards.</p>
<p>The statement concluded by stressing that the priorities common to the EU and Egypt, as set out in the recently adopted EU/Egypt action plan, were at the heart of relations between the two and that the EU was determined to work with Egypt toward the end of their complete achievement; it also reiterated the EU’s readiness to help the reform process in Egypt by means of support and technical aid in accordance with the provisions of the action plan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0237"></a>

<p>Preparations are currently being made in Russia for the reopening of the trial against Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, who were convicted of tax evasion in 2005. Under Russian law, those convicted have the right to apply for remission of the sentence provided they have served half of it and have behaved in an exemplary fashion.

<p>The fact that new charges are, at this very moment, being made against the two men gives rise to reasonable suspicions that the trial, which has been politicised from the very beginning, could become nothing but a show.

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the April 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Concerning the Bologna Process, the Council wishes first courteously to inform the honourable Member that this process was not set in motion by the EU, but is an initiative undertaken jointly by 45 states throughout Europe. That being so, it lies outwith the formal decision-making framework of the European Community, and it is therefore not for the Council to put forward common positions of the kind referred to.</p>
<p>Turning to the subject of participation in EU exchange and educational programmes, the Council wishes to emphasise that Turkish Cypriots are regarded as citizens of the European Union and are therefore entitled to participate in such programmes without any restriction being placed upon them. As the honourable Member ought to be aware, though, the Republic of Cyprus does not, in practice, recognise the universities in those parts of the island over which the government does not exercise any actual control, the consequence of which is that the students matriculated at these institutions were not able to participate in these programmes. The Council, working together with the Commission and with the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus, will continue to examine possible solutions to this problem.</p>
<p>The Council would additionally observe that Regulation 389/2006/EC of 27 February 2006 established a Community scholarship programme enabling students in higher education and their teachers to study for the period of a year at a university in the EU. Although the numbers participating in this programme do not equal the numbers of participants in such programmes as Erasmus, the scholarship programme does make it possible for Turkish Cypriots to study at a university in the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0250"></a>

<p>Motorway building is of particular importance to the development of communications links and economic growth in eastern European countries.

<p>The building of motorways, which, from a long-term viewpoint, is an environment-friendly exercise of essential importance to society and the economy, leads to lower fuel consumption, greater safety and better environmental conditions in cities, towns and villages through which roads currently run. Despite this, it is a target for attacks by people who are not directly affected by the current state of affairs, and protests take place only once a start has already been made on implementing such projects.</p>

<p>The conditions surrounding the forthcoming EU-US summit on 30 April 2007 in Washington are favourable - relations between the EU and the US are in good shape. There is the political will on both sides to engage constructively and cooperate closely.</p>
<p>The forthcoming EU-US summit has the following objectives:</p>
<p>Firstly, a joint initiative to strengthen transatlantic commerce is to be launched. The core of the initiative is a mutual political commitment to deepen cooperation with a view to achieving regulatory convergence and a further intensification of economic links.</p>
<p>Secondly, cooperation is to be intensified on climate protection and energy policy, and on new energy and environmental technologies.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we intend to use the summit to signal the broadest possible agreement on current foreign and security policy issues.</p>
<p>Cooperation on international crisis management is to be further intensified. Our close cooperation with the US in Kosovo and Afghanistan provide a sound basis.</p>
<p>Combating terrorism remains a further important aspect of our cooperation. On this topic the EU will underline the significance of our international obligations, including human rights, refugee rights and humanitarian international law.</p>
<p>The EU-US air transport agreement is to be signed at the summit, an important step on the way towards further liberalising transatlantic aviation.</p>
<p>A further key issue for the EU is the US Visa Waiver Programme. The EU has raised this matter in its contacts with the US at many different levels and will do so again at the summit. We will continue to urge that possible new US rules should allow visa-free travel for all the EU Member States in the near future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0256"></a>

<p>Improving and simplifying the regulatory environment, to which the honourable Member refers, is a matter for which the EU institutions bear joint responsibility. In the case of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), simplification forms part of the reform package which the Council adopted in December 2002. The Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2003 on Better Law-making<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> introduced a wide-ranging EU strategy, intended to yield practical results in simplifying Community legislation in all sectors.</p>
<p>In April 2005 the Council welcomed the Commission communication, 'Perspectives for simplifying and improving the regulatory environment of the Common Fisheries Policy' and unanimously agreed that a multiannual action plan was required which should comprise short-term and long-term measures and a mid-term review. The Council also called on the Commission to devise measures to recast Community legislation.</p>
<p>In December 2005 the Council noted the Commission communication, '2006-08 Action Plan for simplifying and improving the Common Fisheries Policy'. When this Action Plan was presented, the Council agreed that at least once per six-monthly Presidency, progress in simplifying the CFP should be reviewed. Since the Conclusions of December 2005, the Council has regularly noted the Commission's reports on the progress made in this respect during the Austrian, Finnish and German Presidencies.</p>
<p>In addition, in the past year the Council has adopted a series of legislative provisions which have simplified and improved the CFP. These include, for example, Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 on the European Fisheries Fund<a href="#defann_21_2" name="refann_21_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and Council Regulation (EC) No 1966/2006 on electronic recording and reporting of fishing activities and on means of remote sensing<a href="#defann_21_3" name="refann_21_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, as well as the rapid adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 1941/2006 fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2007<a href="#defann_21_4" name="refann_21_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Council looks forward to fresh proposals and measures to simplify the regulatory framework of the CFP, for example a Commission proposal to simplify data collection and monitoring and to reform the technical measures to protect juvenile marine organisms.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drawn up by the Presidency and is binding on neither the Council nor the Member States, was not given orally during Question Time to the Council at the European Parliament's April 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council shares the honourable Member's concern that heavy debts in developing countries are a substantial obstacle to growth, as they reduce the scope for measures to combat poverty. The international community has responded to this problem in recent years and helped to reduce it by means of joint measures such as HIPC and MDRI.</p>
<p>The European Consensus on Development Policy, which the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission signed on 20 December 2005, recognises debt cancellation as one of the ways of implementing development aid. Debt cancellation, which is equivalent to indirect budget support, entails low transaction costs and tends to promote cooperation and coordination between donors, could help countries to reduce their vulnerability to external shocks where it is found to be necessary and appropriate.</p>
<p>As regards the ACP countries in particular, with a view to reducing those countries' debt burden and payments problems, the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement (Cotonou Agreement) contains special provisions to support debt relief and structural adjustments, under which resources provided for in the Agreement can be used to contribute to internationally agreed debt relief initiatives for the benefit of ACP countries.</p>
<p>The Council fully supports international debt relief initiatives, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative (HIPC), which now covers 49 countries, and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which was set in motion in 2006 after the G8 summit of 2005 at Gleneagles and has the purpose of bringing about complete cancellation of the debts of the HIPC countries to the IMF, the World Bank subsidiary the IDA (International Development Association) and the African Development Fund. Additional funding made available by the G8 ensures that the financing capacity of the international financial institutions is not reduced. The traditional debt relief instruments of the Paris Club are also available.

<p>Since the negotiations with the consortium of applicants on the Galileo contract had come to a dead halt, the Presidency of the Council met with the Commission in February and had talks with the consortium partners, which talks revealed that the firms involved in the project had not acted on the decisions they had taken in December 2005 on important organisational issues and that they, despite being pressed as a matter of urgency by the Presidency to discharge their obligations, had been unable to agree on a joint course of action.</p>
<p>The Council, therefore, when it met on 22 March 2007, resolved to make it plain to all the parties to negotiations, and to the general public, that this situation was unsustainable. In its conclusions, the Council set 10 May 2007 as the deadline for the resumption of negotiations between the consortium of applicants and the GNSS supervisory authority on the basis of the December 2005 agreement, and strongly urged them to achieve substantial progress in time for its June meeting; the consequence of this is that there is a definite prospect of the negotiations being concluded. Further to this, the Commission was asked to report to the Council on the state of negotiations and on the costs of, and funding for, the Galileo project.</p>
<p>The Commission is also requested to draw up alternative scenarios for the future implementation of the Galileo project in order that the Council may have a sound basis on which to reach a decision in June. The Council intends to take a decision on these scenarios in order to prevent further delays occurring to the Galileo process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0270"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the April 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council regrets the dissemination of false information or misinterpretations concerning its position on Cuba, which does nothing to help either the current internal deliberations or the improvement of bilateral relations. The Council has always refused to use coercive measures to bring about change, and that position is clearly expressed in the Common Position, which envisages the offering of cooperation and dialogue. Contrary to what is implied in the honourable Member’s question, dialogue with all sections of Cuban society can certainly not be understood as ‘interference in the affairs of a sovereign state’. To the best of our knowledge, Cuba’s embassies maintain regular and unhindered contact to all sections of society in the Member States or to the institutions of the European Union, and this is not regarded as interference in democratic societies.</p>
<p>The EU has had repeated occasion to point out to the Cuban Government the unsatisfactory state of human rights in its country, and it has, when it has done so, also demanded the release of all political detainees. It is for Cuba to bring about changes in these circumstances, since it is a Member of the Human Rights Council, and its conduct may therefore be expected to be exemplary. The Council notes with satisfaction that this policy is firmly supported by an overwhelming majority of the Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>It is perfectly normal that the EU should try to reassess its policy in the light of the new situation brought about by major changes within the Cuban leadership. The EU’s policy is autonomous and not comparable with the USA’s strategy, something that even the USA concedes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0253"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to thank the Honourable Member for giving it the opportunity to set out the Commission's view of the recent corruption case which raised a lot of media attention.</p>
<p>We are talking about investigations into tenders relating to the leasing and procurement of EC delegation buildings and their security installations in countries outside the EU. These investigations have been conducted by the European Anti-fraud office (OLAF) in close cooperation by the Belgian and Italian judicial and police authorities. On 27 March 2007 searches on the premises of the Commission, the Parliament and of several homes and companies led to a large volume of files being seized and three arrests have been made in Belgium. The main offences alleged by the Belgian judicial authorities were corruption, violation of professional secrecy and criminal conspiracy. More recently, on 11 April 2007, the Belgian Court decided to keep the three suspects detained in preventive custody. The Commission intents to collaborate in this inquiry and decided speedily to apply to be represented before the Court.</p>
<p>One of these three persons is a member of staff of the Commission, one a business man and the third is a parliamentary assistant. According to the Belgian authorities, the actual number of public tenders concerned and their financial impact is for the moment unknown. Therefore it is not possible to determine the exact measure of the damage.</p>
<p>As to the Honourable Member's question, these arrests were not the result of any new measures taken in the Commission, administrative or other. The OLAF investigation started in 2004. The Commission has been very vigilant not to tolerate wrongdoing by its staff for years and all allegations are followed-up vigorously. In spite of this 'zero tolerance' attitude of the Commission it is impossible to prevent all occurrences of fraud.</p>
<p>But the present case shows that our fraud detection and investigation systems, progressively refined since 1999, have functioned effectively and OLAF has confirmed that it has received excellent cooperation from all the European Institutions. Furthermore, the policy on rotation of holders of financially sensitive posts, introduced as part of the administrative reform, allowed the Commission to move the person under investigation to a different post without damaging the ongoing enquiry.</p>
<p>The Commission will carefully assess whether the case discloses systemic weaknesses as further information becomes available and draw appropriate lessons for the future.</p>
<p>Finally, the Honourable Member asked how many cases there has been since the beginning of 2006. In 2006 there was one comparable case concerning the arrest of a contract agent for passive corruption in the framework of public tenders. This case still remains the subject of a procedure by the competent national authority. During the period 1 January 2006 – 31 December 2006, OLAF opened 17 internal investigations related to allegations of possible corruption.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0204"></a>

<p>One of the principal objectives of cohesion policy is to contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy. Research technology and innovation are also considered as fundamental means of achieving regional development and convergence.</p>
<p>In view of this, what does the Commission expect will be the contribution of the NSRF for the period 2007-2013 to national and regional indicators in Greece under the Lisbon Agenda?

<p>(EN) The first question concerns the expected contribution of the Greek National Strategic Reference Framework 2007-2013 to the national and regional indicators for the Lisbon Strategy. On this matter, the Commission would like to emphasize that Greece has made a good start by allocating substantial amounts in Community contributions to Lisbon-type actions. Expressed in terms of the total planned Community contribution for convergence areas in Greece, 62% concerns Lisbon-related actions. For the regional competitiveness and employment areas the corresponding figure is 67%. Priority areas include the development of human resources, support for projects in the field of research and technological development by businesses and universities, and the promotion of digital convergence by support for broadband infrastructure and digital services in the private and public sector. To measure results, the National Strategic Reference Framework proposes a series of indicators, which include "Lisbon indicators" such as the percentage of the population that has completed advanced education, labour productivity, domestic expenditure on research and technology, and a synthetic innovation indicator.</p>
<p>The earmarking of funds for Lisbon-related activities is notably justified when examining the innovation performance of Greece, on the basis of the latest European Innovation Scoreboard 2006. According to this, Greece is found to poorly perform in many innovation indicators including: business R&amp;D<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> expenses, patents issued, early stage venture capital provision, lifelong learning and broadband penetration.</p>
<p>The allocation of funds will have to be matched by appropriate structures and beneficiaries for the implementation of the co-financed actions. In fact, already the current Third Community Support Framework was highly "Lisbonised": substantial amounts in funding were allocated to Lisbon-type actions, in particular under the Operational Programmes "Competitiveness" and "Information society" but also in the regional programmes. Unfortunately, the implementation of many such actions has revealed itself problematic, for which reason eventually funds have been transferred away from them. So the main issue to be resolved in order to implement successfully the Lisbon strategy in Greece, will be the establishment of suitable project implementation structures, which will ensure the effective and timely use of the available funds.</p>
<p>The Commission fully agrees with the Honourable Member that in this perspective the local and regional dimension should play an important role. There are large disparities within Greece in terms of "Lisbon indicators". Therefore, in the current negotiations on the Operational Programmes, the Commission pays particular attention to the inclusion of realistic regional strategies for Lisbon-sensitive domains. On the specific role of cities, the Commission would like to stress that for the 2007-2013 period, it has proposed JESSICA (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas) as an instrument for cities to prepare and finance integrated urban development plans. The Greek authorities intend to use this instrument and they are collaborating with the European Investment Bank Group on the assessment of current situation and on the evaluation of needs. Additionally, through the European Social Fund (ESF) support will be given the promotion and mainstreaming of innovative activities in training, education, employability programmes with focus on vulnerable social groups (youth, women, migrants, ethnic minorities etc) in order to minimise social disparities in cities and urban areas.</p>
<p>As concerns EU support for the establishment of an innovative environment, the Commission would like to stress that Cohesion Policy supports innovation mainly in two ways: a) the co-financing provided through the Structural Funds and b) the development of a system of regional governance based on strategic development, partnership, programming, monitoring and evaluation. Programmes co-financed through the Cohesion Policy should seek to target resources to encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship and the growth of the knowledge economy by strengthening research and innovation capacities and information and communication technologies. In many cases, the governance system is an innovative policy in itself. In this way, Cohesion Policy promotes capacity building for innovation: there is a shared responsibility of regional authorities, large and small businesses, universities and research institutes. Furthermore, the Greek political authorities at high level will be invited in the next months to take part in a European initiative, called “European Cluster Memorandum”, which aims at developing stronger innovation regional clusters in view to make them world leaders in their domain. This will be achieved through trans-national cooperation activities and by streamlining Community, national and regional funds in support of innovation clusters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) If we take the percentage of payments made with respect to the decided (committed) amount as an indication of the absorption capacity of Structural Funds, then as of 11 April 2007, the average absorption rate of 46.7 % reflects rather satisfactory performance in terms of Structural Funds implementation in the new Member States, given the fact that EU-10 have actually started the real implementation only in 2005, following the adoption of programming documents in 2004.</p>
<p>Absorption of Structural Funds varies between 38.6 % (Cyprus) and 64.7 % (Slovenia). Lithuania is just above the average of 46.7 % with an absorption rate of 47.5 %. By fund, the average absorption rate in EU-10 is as follows: ESF<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 40.0 %, ERDF<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> 46.8%, FIFG<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> 48.1% and EAGGF<a href="#defann_30_4" name="refann_30_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> 57.2 %.</p>
<p>Lithuania remains below the average rate with regard to the ESF Programmes (29.7 %). For other three Funds the absorption rate in Lithuania exceeds respective EU10 average rates: EAGGF 62.6 %, FIFG 58.1 % and ERDF 49.5 %.</p>
<p>The Commission, in addition to close monitoring of progress in programme implementation and funds absorption, to suggesting proactive initiatives as appropriate, regularly organises conferences to facilitate the exchange of experience and best practices in administration of Structural Funds among Member States. A series of three conferences aiming at bringing together partners to exchange best practices was launched in January 2006.</p>
<p>The first conference of this series 'Innovating through regional policy' - took place in June 2006, the second, in January 2007, looked at the 'responses of regional policy to demographic challenges', and the third, 'Fostering competitiveness through innovative technologies, products and healthy communities', took place in March 2007. All three conferences provided excellent opportunities for regional partners to learn from each others' experiences both through participation in the workshops and through networking.</p>
<p>The third conference was also the first annual Spring conference of the Regions For Economic Change initiative, whose aim is to address some of the core issues that Europe is facing and make a stronger link between the exchange of best practices developed in the inter-regional cooperation and urban development network programmes, and the main body of funding.</p>
<p>With this initiative, the Commission is taking unprecedented steps to support the exchange of experience and best practices. In addition to the annual Spring conference already mentioned, the Commission would like to highlight in particular the following three actions.</p>
<p>Firstly, a Regions For Economic Change website has been established to serve as an information tool on the priority themes set out in the Regions For Economic Change Communication, and on networks set up on these themes, as well as providing links to other important sources of information on Cohesion Policy, such as the Committee of the Regions' Lisbon Monitoring Platform.</p>
<p>Secondly, awards aiming to identify good innovative practices in regional development - the 'RegioStars Awards' - were launched at the March 2007 conference, with the objective of highlighting original and innovative projects which could be attractive and inspiring to other regions. The themes for this first round of awards, the winners of which will be announced at next year's Regions For Economic Change Spring conference, are: 'Supporting clusters and business networks', 'Technology transfer from research institutes to Small and Medium Enterprises', 'Energy efficiency and renewable energies', and 'Environmental technologies'.</p>
<p>Thirdly, through the fast track option, the Commission will offer its active involvement and expertise to Regions For Economic Change networks which bring together a good spread of territorial coverage and experience, include in their delegations both enthusiasts and those who can 'make things happen on the ground', ensure a link to the mainstream programmes and which have a particular focus on dissemination.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The ability of the new EU countries to make use of the assistance provided for them from EU regional policy funds will have a significant bearing on their economic and social development.

For example, by the beginning of 2007 Lithuania had been able to claim only around 30% of the structural assistance allocated to it in 2004-2006.

<p>(EN) The historical record has shown that the level of absorption of resources tends to be slower in the early years following the decision to allocate Community resources to programmes at national or regional level, which is then followed by a period of catching up. This is in the nature of the exercise itself in the sense that the preparation of projects under the European programmes is often a complex task in financial, technical and administrative terms. Moreover, the EU has always insisted that projects are prepared according to the highest standards, for example, in terms of respect for Community law and policy in fields such as competition rules, public procurement and the environment.</p>
<p>The new Member States are in this initial phase when new rules and procedures are being laid down. In some cases there is still need to further invest in qualified human resources.</p>
<p>It also has to be recognised that the new Member States that joined in 2004 face the particular challenge of implementing two programming periods at the same time: 2004-2006 and 2007-2013. This is one of the reasons why the Commission decided to offer specific help to them by creating the Jaspers technical assistance facility to support the new Member States in preparing major projects for Community support. Furthermore, strengthening institutional capacity and the efficiency of public administrations and public services becomes a specific priority for the European Social Fund interventions for the new programming period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>The administrative capacity to realise projects, especially major projects, can be a particular challenge, not only in the new Member States but also in the EU-15. This is the case, for example, in the field of transport, where projects tend to be large-scale, long-term and require a high degree of co-ordination. Such projects can be delayed by prolonged negotiations on financing or, of a legal nature, on contracts and planning issues, which are difficult to foresee at the outset. Evaluations have tended to confirm that the new Member States have successfully established the management framework for implementing cohesion policy. Moreover, there is already evidence of progress in relation to the learning cycle for the management of programmes. For example, in Estonia and the Czech Republic, evaluations noted that an extensive capacity had been acquired in terms of gathering monitoring data and defining indicators, baselines and targets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, more investment in human capacity is needed, particularly in the new Member States. In this regard, smaller countries with smaller administrations face a particular challenge. Training needs to be made available on all aspects of programme management, in project preparation for potential beneficiaries, and for external bodies involved in, for example, monitoring committees. The programmes for 2007-2013 place a particular emphasis on this aspect.</p>
<p>For the EU15, improvements in the governance of European cohesion policy programmes in the period 2000-06 exist. Examples include Italy where improved project appraisal, audit and monitoring capacity has been introduced. Austria has experimented with an original approach to evaluation, involving the collection of detailed information on inputs and outputs considered critical by stakeholders. Moreover, such improvements have often had positive spill-overs for other sectors of public intervention. The efficiency of administration of cohesion policy can also be improved by promoting the exchange of experience and best practices among Member States, and the Commission has actively encouraged this through publications, seminars and other events.</p>
<p>On institutional and administrative capacity building, the Commission has repeatedly insisted on the need to use cohesion programmes to reinforce administrative and institutional capacity beyond the implementation of cohesion policy. This is particularly important in the Convergence regions and Cohesion countries where the administrative and institutional obstacles constitute an important burden for socio-economic development. Investments in the institutional capacity of public administration and public services will also support the delivery and implementation of the Lisbon strategy. The programmes submitted so far by Member States reveal that an amount of almost €3.8 billion will be allocated for the period 2007-2013 to activities aimed at "improving good policy and programme design, monitoring and evaluation, capacity in the delivery of policy and programmes".</p>
<p>Regarding technical assistance, cohesion policy programmes have consistently sought to reinforce the management capacity of managing authorities in using the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. For example, the Commission made available to the Lithuanian administration specific, additional technical assistance to help assess the bottlenecks and identify solutions in the Cohesion Fund project preparation and implementation. This will also apply for the period 2007-2013.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0238"></a>

<p>(EN) The official draft of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) for Bulgaria was transmitted to the Commission on 16 January 2007, which was well within the deadline of five months following the adoption of the Community Strategic Guidelines on Europan Cohesion Policy 2007-2013 on 6 October 2006.</p>
<p>On 29 January 2007, the Commission declared the document admissible. All the services of the Commission have been consulted to assess whether the Commission's comments during previous informal discussions with the Bulgarian authorities had been taken into account.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian authorities also formally submitted within the regulatory deadline all seven Operational Programmes on 5 March 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently negotiating the NSRF and Operational Programmes of Bulgaria. In this context, interruptions in the approval process are not unusual. This is a standard procedure in the negotiations with Member States in all cases when there are still unresolved issues. The approval of NSRF of Bulgaria is foreseen for mid 2007.</p>
<p>In any case, the financial allocation of Bulgaria has been decided in the context of the Financial Perspectives and the financial allocation to Bulgaria (€6.853 million) cannot be reduced in the first year of Bulgaria's full EU membership (2007), or for the whole programming period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>As regards the application of the automatic decommitment rule, the first risk for Bulgaria will not occur before 31 December 2010.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the date of adoption of an Operational Programme does not have an impact on the start of eligibility of expenditure: Article 56 of the Regulation 1083/2006 states that expenditure shall be eligible for a contribution from the Funds if it has actually been paid between the date of submission of the Operational Programmes to the Commission or from 1 January 2007, whichever is earlier. In the case of Bulgaria its eligibility started on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission has already urged the Bulgarian authorities to take pre-contractual steps towards implementation, such as launching calls for proposal, in order not to lose any valuable preparation time. This will also contribute to a speedier implementation of the Structural Funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0273"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission very much shares the Honourable Member’s views on the importance of cross-border co-operation, as evidenced by the significantly increased funding for 2007 to 2013 which is available to support this activity, under the European Union’s Cohesion Policy, the Instrument for Pre-Accession, and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.</p>
<p>The Commission is equally very aware of the need to have a strong legal framework to support cross-border activities, and this is why it proposed the concept of a “European Grouping of Territorial Co-operation” as part of the negotiation on the new Structural Funds regulations. The Commission was particularly pleased when a specific regulation covering these Groupings was adopted as part of the new Cohesion Policy package in 2006.</p>
<p>A European Grouping of Territorial Co-operation will be an optional tool for national, regional and local authorities allowing them to establish a distinct legal entity capable of operating across European Union borders. Such a Grouping will be able to manage co-operation programmes or projects in a unique, integrated way.</p>

<p>(EN) The Regulation governing the Structural Funds (Article 11) stipulates that programming documents must be prepared in partnership between the national, regional and local authorities, socio-economic partners and other bodies (such as Non-Governmental Organisations) in accordance with national rules and practices.</p>
<p>The design of the system for the management and control of programmes co-funded by the European Union in 2007-2013 is the responsibility of the Member States, within the limits set by Council Regulation (EC) 1083/2006<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and Commission Regulation (EC) 1828/2006<a href="#defann_34_2" name="refann_34_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>During the negotiating phase, the Commission pays special attention to the issue of how National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) and Operational Programmes (OPs) have been prepared in each Member State. As part of the analysis of each draft document, the Commission analyses how the partnership principle in line with Article 11 is being implemented. Whereas the Commission is not in the position to harmonise the organisation of partnership principle in each Member State, during the quality analysis of each programming document it looks at aspects such as selection criteria for involvement of partners, appropriate communication means and structure to ensure widest possible partnership among all relevant actors, transparency of partnership. Best practice examples are communicated to relevant authorities. The programming documents may only be adopted if the partnership principle has been respected.</p>
<p>The experience so far shows that most of the Member States improve the implementation of partnership principle and consider involvement of various national, regional or local actors as a natural part of the preparatory process. According to an internal DG REGIO<a href="#defann_34_3" name="refann_34_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> survey (Autumn 2006), there has been a balanced participation of all actors mentioned in Article 11 of the General Regulation in the preparatory process for NSRFs and OPs, mostly via a range of publicity and information events.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 71 of the aforementioned Council Regulation the Member States have to provide the description of the management and control system for each programme before the first application for an interim payment is transmitted to the Commission, or at the latest within twelve months of the approval of each operational programme.</p>
<p>During the analysis of OPs the Commission emphasises that structures and bodies are designated in accordance with Articles 37 and 59 of General Regulation. The documents shall include:</p>
<p>- a clear identification of the authorities and bodies in a non-ambiguous manner;</p>
<p>- a brief description of their role and responsibilities in the management and the control of the OP;</p>
<p>- an explanation of how the principle of separation of functions between and within the authorities and bodies is to be respected.</p>
<p>On the basis of the previous audits, information about weaknesses in current systems exists and they will be used by the Commission in the negotiations to avoid recurrence. As regards Greece, the Greek OPs were submitted in March 2007 and are currently being examined by the Commission.

<p>(EN) The Commission is continuously building a European approach to an integrated border management policy that needs to be dynamic and able to deal with new challenges. The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) is a key component of that policy.</p>
<p>Since the setting up of FRONTEX, numerous border control operations have been successfully coordinated by FRONTEX. The joint operations have proven their added value at European level and will be further complemented by the establishment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABIT). The Council and the Parliament intend to adopt this new Regulation in June 2007. It will amend the existing provisions on joint operations and provide legal certainty to all actors involved i.e. guest officers, border guards, whilst at the same time make the operations more effective.</p>
<p>In 2007, FRONTEX has activated Article 7 of the Regulation establishing the Agency, allowing for pooling at European level of technical equipment that can be put at the disposal of a requesting Member State.</p>
<p>Joint operations are an important tool, but not the only one. Therefore the Commission is supporting FRONTEX to enter into working arrangements with third countries as a means for strengthening the external dimension of border control.</p>
<p>For the year 2007 the financial and human resources of FRONTEX have been increased. It will allow FRONTEX to further develop 'state of the art' operations aiming to combat illegal immigration at a European level. Furthermore the Commission endeavours to improve the coordination of the different services tasked with upholding the security of the external borders at national level, as well as at European level, i.e. between FRONTEX and other bodies such as Europol.</p>
<p>Based on the conclusions of the European Council of December 2006 FRONTEX is, as recommended by the Commission in its Communication of November 2006, taking forward the establishment of a European Coastal Patrol Network. An initial exchange of views with Member States has taken place at the April Justice and Home Affairs Council.</p>
<p>The Commission will return to the question of how FRONTEX can be further reinforced in its upcoming evaluation report of the Agency foreseen by the end of 2007, which should be followed by a political discussion in the European institutions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0181"></a>

<p>(EN) A wide set of harmonised measures are in place at Community level to control avian influenza outbreaks. Rules include restrictions on movements of poultry and poultry products from infected areas.</p>
<p>Hungary conformed with these protection measures when an outbreak of avian influenza was confirmed on 24 January 2007 in a goose farm on its territory.</p>
<p>The legal EU mechanisms give the Commission, assisted by Member States' experts in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health powers to assess the situation and to decide if additional safeguard measures are necessary in the case of an outbreak, taking into account the precautionary principle, as appropriate.</p>
<p>On 26 January 2007, the Commission examined the measures taken by Hungary in the Standing Committee and deemed them appropriate to prevent the spread of avian flu. A ban of intra-community trade of birds from the whole territory of Hungary was not considered necessary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the investigations in the United Kingdom (UK) and Hungary, no elements have emerged to suggest that the adoption of more stringent measures for the Hungarian outbreak would have prevented the outbreak in the UK.</p>
<p>As the intra-Community trade in poultry is an area harmonised under Community law, Member States may only take safeguard measures in accordance with Community legislation (eg. Article 10 of Directive 90/425 or Article 54 of Regulation 178/2002), which should be referred to the Commission without delay for a decision under the comitology procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0190"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission believes that the existing regulatory framework and the procedures in force constitute a solid control environment with a clear definition of the chain of command.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is the Commission that defines its political priorities and that adopts an annual work programme that translates the political strategy and objectives into an operational programme of decisions to be adopted. The work programme lists the legislative initiatives, as well as the implementing acts and other acts that the Commission intends to adopt in order to fulfil these priorities. The President of the Commission presents the Commission work programme to Parliament and to the Council. The Commission services are for their part responsible for implementing this work programme and, in particular, for establishing their annual management plan. This plan is there to ensure that the priorities decided on by the College are implemented more effectively in their respective areas of responsibility.</p>
<p>The rules of procedure of the Commission and the Code of Conduct of Commissioners<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, adopted by the Commission at the start of its mandate, define the relations between the members of the Commission and their services. They are based on loyalty, trust and transparency. The members of the Commission must have information from their own services and the central services in order to exercise their political responsibility and their supervisory role, and it is their responsibility to ensure that the guidelines and political priorities that they themselves have set are implemented coherently with the work programme of the College and with the principle of collegiality. To that end, the College and its members have the option of giving instructions to the respective services.</p>
<p>In accordance with the rules of procedure of the Commission and of the Code of Conduct of Commissioners, work patterns are established between each Commissioner and the Director-Generals under their authority. These rules provide, in particular, for the obligation for the services to report to the member of the Commission any information that is liable to undermine his responsibility or that of the College.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Article 11 of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities stipulates that an official ‘shall carry out the duties assigned to him objectively, impartially and in keeping with his duty of loyalty to the Communities’. In accordance with Article 21 of the Staff Regulations, an official shall assist and tender advice to his superiors and he shall be responsible for the performance of the duties assigned to him.

<p>(EN) There is no Decision by the Commission on the closure of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. The closure of this nuclear power plant was negotiated as part of the conditions of accession of Bulgaria to the European Union and included as such in the Treaty of Accession.</p>
<p>The Commission – in its role of guardian of the Treaties – will oversee the correct implementation of the relevant clauses.</p>
<p>In particular, Article 30 of the Protocol to the Accession Treaty concerning the conditions and arrangements for admission of the Republic of Bulgaria to the European Union, signed on 25 April 2005, states: "Bulgaria, having closed − in line with its commitments −definitively for subsequent decommissioning Unit 1 and Unit 2 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant before the year 2003, commits to the definitive closure of Unit 3 and Unit 4 of this plant in 2006 and to subsequent decommissioning of these units".</p>
<p>Following its own commitments, Bulgaria shut down Units 1 and 2 on 31 December 2002, essentially at the end of their design-life of 30 years. Units 3 and 4, being connected to the grid respectively on 1980 and 1982, have been shut down, on average, only five years before their design-life.</p>
<p>The same Article 30 of the Protocol also describes the financial assistance provided to Bulgaria in support of its efforts to decommission and to address the consequences of the closure and decommissioning of Units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant.</p>
<p>This assistance has provided the means for an extensive modernization of the remaining two Units 5 and 6 at Kozloduy, through the Community pre-accession PHARE assistance and a EURATOM loan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0193"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to thank the Honourable Member for the question on the restriction of freedom of expression in Egypt and the case of the detention of the Internet blogger Karim Sulaiman. The Commission, through its Delegation in Cairo, and together with Member States is following these developments very closely.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member is aware, the Commission is paying much attention to the democratic and human rights situation in Egypt. It is particularly concerned about restrictions on the freedom of expression, including on the Internet. The Commission is using all the means at its disposal to encourage Egyptian authorities to progress in this area. The call for greater political reform and respect of human rights is indeed an intrinsic part of the EU’s partnership with Egypt.</p>
<p>The EU, based notably on the provisions of Article 2 of the Association Agreement, consistently raises the importance of respecting human rights in bilateral contacts, including at the highest level with Egypt. In particular, political developments in Egypt, including human rights, are discussed in the course of the political dialogue at the Association Council.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member knows, the Association Council adopted the EU-Egypt Action Plan under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) on 6 March 2007. This Action Plan marks a new stepping stone in our relations with Egypt as it provides a comprehensive policy framework, based on an agenda of mutual commitments on political, social and economic issues, centered on common values shared by Egypt and the EU. Indeed, one of the key priorities for action is the promotion of the protection of human rights in all its aspects, including freedom of expression and pluralism of the media.</p>
<p>In addition, the Action Plan provides for the establishment of a formal and regular dialogue on human rights and democracy in the context of the sub-committee on political matters: human rights and democracy, international and regional issues, which has been recently created.</p>
<p>The Commission firmly believes that dialogue with Egypt in the framework of the political arrangements set out in the Association Agreement and in the ENP Action Plan, is the most effective way to impress upon the Egyptian Government the EU’s concerns regarding respect for human rights and international law.

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>According to a new report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO (Livestock's Long Shadow – Environmental Issues and Options, 2006), the livestock sector is one of the biggest destroyers of the environment in the world. It is responsible for no less than 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions – actually more than the combined emissions of greenhouse gases from the transport sector. Livestock's digestion and the manure they produce give rise to emissions of the powerful greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. Emissions also occur when forests are felled to create pastureland, releasing carbon dioxide which was previously bound as carbon in trees. The production and transport of livestock, feed and meat also cause significant emissions.</p>
<p>The FAO stresses that it is very important to act vigorously to reduce the environmental impact of the livestock sector, and one way of doing so would be to ensure that the price of food reflects environmental costs. Other economic incentives may also be possible, for example environmental bonuses for plant production. Reducing the EU's agricultural subsidies would be an effective measure. Meat would probably become more expensive, which would halt the growth of meat consumption.</p>
<p>Does the Commission endorse the conclusions of the FAO report on the livestock sector's impact on greenhouse gas emissions? What measures will the Commission take to reduce substantially the adverse impact of the livestock sector on our environment?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission acknowledges that the Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) report raises important issues at global level. It will, however, focus its response on the situation in the EU.</p>
<p>Most economic activities lead to emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). The EU objective is making economic activities more sustainable, also from a climate perspective. Agriculture, including livestock, accounted for 9% of total EU GHG emissions in 2004, of which more than 5% is nitrous oxide and 4% is methane (mainly from livestock).</p>
<p>Emissions of methane decreased by about 14% in the period 1990-2004, primarily as a result of a significant decrease in livestock numbers (by 22%). This trend is mainly due to successive structural changes of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Almost all Member States reduced emissions from livestock, with largest decreases in the new Member States.</p>
<p>The reduction of overall agricultural emissions during 1990-2004 (13%) is considerably higher than the overall emissions reduction of all economic sectors (5%). Agriculture has therefore already made a significant contribution to the achievement of the Kyoto protocol commitment. Furthermore, emissions from agriculture are projected to decrease to a level of 18% below 1990 levels by 2010. The projected decrease of cattle numbers and increase in productivity is likely to contribute to further decline in methane emissions.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees that additional efforts can be made to reduce emissions from the livestock sector. In the latest reforms of the CAP, the Commission has taken important steps to change the way to support livestock sector. The total or partial decoupling of payments from production and cross-compliance are key measures that significantly reduce incentives towards intensive production. Climate change mitigation objectives have also been integrated into the rural development policy for 2007-2013.</p>
<p>Changes in livestock practices and adaptations of land use management, for example through improved diets or improved and integrated manure management, could be used to further reduce emissions of methane and nitrous oxide. Such measures are in line with the conclusions of the FAO report. Member States may well include such measures in their Rural Development Programmes for the period 2007-2013, in line with the EU Strategic Guidelines for Rural Development, which place climate change as one of the three environmental priorities at European level.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the livestock sector, in particular grazing livestock, also provides important environmental services such as the maintenance of pastures and diversity of European landscapes. The livestock sector also significantly contributes to the economies of rural areas. Therefore it is important not to undermine the competitiveness of the European livestock sector, which faces an increasing world competition. Also, it has to be taken into account that, as world demand for animal products (meat, milk, eggs) is not likely to diminish, mitigation measures taken in the EU will not result in a net global reduction of emissions because of reallocation of livestock activities to other countries. The challenge is to reconcile the demand of livestock products and the protection of the environment, as the FAO report recognises.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0200"></a>

<p>(FR) The European arrest warrant laid down by Council Framework Decision 2002/584/RIA<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (hereinafter referred to as ‘the framework decision’) is proving to be a growing success.</p>
<p>The framework decision has been transposed in the 27 Member States, and the volume of European arrest warrants issued each year continues to grow. On the basis of the available statistics, which are not yet complete, some indicative figures may be given. Thus, the number of European arrest warrants issued for 2005 is 6 800, that is, more than double the figure for 2004. Furthermore, no fewer than 1 700 people were arrested in 2005 on the basis of a European arrest warrant, 1 532 of whom were surrendered to the issuing Member State.</p>
<p>More than half of these people were surrendered with their consent, which meant that very short executing deadlines could be adhered to (on average 11 days after the arrest of the requested person). Even working on the assumption that the person does not consent to being extradited, the European arrest warrant is a remarkable advance in terms of speeding up his or her procedure since it takes place in just under five weeks on average, while an extradition procedure used to take one year on average from start to finish. The European arrest warrant has also made it possible for an increasing number of nationals to be extradited. Indeed, more than a fifth of the persons surrendered on the basis of a European arrest warrant were nationals or residents of the Member State that executed the European arrest warrant.</p>
<p>However, the proper functioning of the European arrest warrant is facing certain obstacles put in place by the Member States, obstacles that it still has to overcome.</p>
<p>The major difficulty is the possibility of surrendering a person who is a national of the executing Member State. Furthermore, a number of Member States have refused to submit to the partial abolition of the condition of dual criminality<a href="#defann_46_3" name="refann_46_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, in accordance with the framework decision. A final point that has given rise to many problems during transposition is the list of grounds for optional non-execution laid down in Article 4 of the framework decision. Whereas some Member States have transposed all of the grounds for non-execution, elevating them to the rank of compulsory grounds for non-execution, other Member States have not deemed it necessary to transpose this article.</p>
<p>Thus, under German law, which has transposed Article 4(4) of the framework decision as a compulsory ground for non-execution, the executing judicial authority for Germany may refuse to execute a European arrest warrant, as in the case of Søren Kam, on the grounds that a criminal prosecution or sentence under German law is prescribed when the acts fall within its competence pursuant to the German implementing law even though the acts for which the requested person is being prosecuted could still result in a sentence in the issuing Member State.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission can confirm to the Honourable Member' that no certification scheme currently exists. The Commission is preparing a legislative proposal that would lead to a big increase in consumption of biofuels in the EU, from around 3 million tons in 2005 to more than 30 million tons in 2020, and the Commission has announced that a sustainability scheme for biofuels will indeed form part of the legislative proposal.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently working on the design of this scheme. It aims to include in the scheme measures to deter the conversion of both tropical forest and peatlands for biofuel production, as well as measures to deter the use of production methods that are inefficient in greenhouse gas terms. These measures will apply to domestically produced biofuels as well as imported biofuels.</p>
<p>Clearly, putting such measures in place for raw materials used for the production of biofuels will not prevent the further conversion of tropical forest and peatlands for palm oil production for food and similar uses. However, the Commission hopes that by taking a leading role in this way, the energy sector will contribute to encouraging other users of palm oil to take similar action, building on existing voluntary initiatives such as the Roundtable on sustainable palm oil.</p>
<p>Other vegetable oils (especially rape oil) make better quality biofuel than palm oil. But the supply of these oils is likely to remain limited. Therefore, if the new legislative proposal were not accompanied by a sustainability scheme for biofuels, there would be a risk that it would supplement the pressure caused by growth in palm oil use and would make an additional contribution to the pressure on tropical forests and peatlands in South-East Asia.</p>
<p>Global palm oil production grew by more than 10 million tons (41%) between 2002/2003 and 2006/2007. In addition to food and other uses in a wide range of everyday products, bio-energy demand (not only from Europe) has contributed as well. Biofuels contributed for only a tiny proportion (30,000 tons in 2005). Growth in demand for food and household uses as well as for energy can be expected to continue. No mandatory certification exists at present that will guarantee that tropical rainforests or peatlands in South-East Asia are not destroyed for the production of palm oil, regardless of its use.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0214"></a>

<p>Eurostat's report of September 2006 on the EU's energy consumption notes that the EU is 56% dependent on imports for its energy supplies. (With certain reservations as to how biomass is to be assessed). After refinement and use, oil is classified as imported, whereas the energy generated from uranium after enrichment and use is classified as national production despite the uranium being imported. To obtain an accurate picture of import dependence, uranium should be included, which would increase import dependence to more than two-thirds. The Commission's Communication on energy policy, however, reports nuclear power as totally dependent on imports as a result of the uranium imports shown in the table in Annex 1. Moreover, there is a mistake in the Swedish version, which refers to 'nuclear safety' instead of 'nuclear power'.</p>

<p>(FR) Natural uranium is currently still being produced in two Member States (the Czech Republic and Romania), representing around 2% of the EU’s requirements. All of the other uranium mines in the EU have been closed because they were uncompetitive. Nevertheless, over the last few years, prices have been increasing substantially, which has meant that exploration projects have got under way in several Member States (Slovakia, Hungary, Sweden, Finland and Spain). Together with other internal sources of supply (reprocessing, re-enrichment, etc), import dependence in raw materials meets almost 85% of the EU’s needs.</p>
<p>The entire cost of fuel, this is to say, natural uranium, conversion, enrichment, manufacturing, including the financial reserves built up for the future management of irradiated fuel, currently represents between 25% and 30% of the cost of producing nuclear energy, 5% to 10% of which relates to these raw materials alone.</p>
<p>In financial terms, these imported raw materials therefore currently represent less than 10% of the costs of production. By way of comparison, the supply of gas represents between 75% and 85% of the corresponding cost of energy production.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Union has industrial capacities that are appropriate and competitive for carrying out every other aspect of the industrial cycle of nuclear fuel production – a booming sector – both as an importer and an exporter.</p>
<p>Regarding the accounting principles used in the preparation of the Energy Balance Sheets, the Commission does not intend to change them.</p>
<p>The ‘Energy Balance Sheet’ of a country provides essential information allowing the evaluation of various dimensions of Energy Policy, including security of supply.</p>
<p>The accountancy system used in preparing the Energy balance sheets considers that nuclear energy (in the form of heat generated in a nuclear power station) is of indigenous origin.</p>
<p>The Commission and Member States consider nuclear energy as contributing positively to the energy security of supply in the case of supply disruptions or energy crisis because of the small volume of uranium ore involved and the possibility of storage, and thus not accounted for as imported nuclear energy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0218"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has not undertaken any cost benefit analysis of the financial assistance that it has provided for projects which aim to achieve sustainability in a free market environment.</p>
<p>Fair Trade projects are financed through the intervention of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO). Several NGOs working on Fair Trade have received co-financing in recent years. By far the largest part of the projects is financed from the "Cofinancing with European NGOs" budgetline managed by EuropeAid. There are, however, also a few projects financed from DG Trade's budget. With regard to other sources of funding, this is currently difficult to identify as such as there are no projects focusing on Fair Trade only. For example, there is no specific information about Fair Trade support in “mainstream programmes” such as National and Regional Indicative programmes. There could be some funding in the context of rural development or agriculture. There may be Fair Trade components in larger projects but these are currently not identified separately and cannot hence be retrieved. Work is underway to expand the information system to allow for retrieval of Fair Trade projects.</p>

<p>(EN) Sales of uranium mined in the Community are subject to the provisions of Chapter VI of the Euratom Treaty. All contracts for the sale/purchase of nuclear materials must be concluded, i.e. co-signed by the Euratom Supply Agency (established by Article 52 of the Euratom Treaty) if one of the Parties to the contract is established in the Community.</p>
<p>It was originally foreseen in the Euratom Treaty that producers of nuclear materials in the Community would offer their production to the Euratom Supply Agency, which would then allocate the materials between European consumers of such materials. However, the Euratom Supply Agency’s Rules<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as amended<a href="#defann_54_2" name="refann_54_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> − on how demand is to be balanced against the supply of ores, source materials and special fissile materials − provide that producers and users of nuclear materials may freely negotiate their commercial contracts. Such contracts however must be submitted to the Euratom Supply Agency for co-signature.</p>
<p>The Euratom Supply Agency verifies that the contracts are not in contradiction with the Euratom Treaty, its secondary legislation, the international obligations of the Community or its supply policy. Sales of uranium mined in the Community to a legitimate user based also in the Community would not normally raise concerns, provided that the legal requirements are fulfilled. However, sales of uranium mined in the Community to a user outside the Community requires, according to Art. 59 of the Euratom Treaty, not only the co-signature of the Euratom Supply Agency but also an export authorisation issued by the European Commission. This provision is intended to ensure that in a possible situation of shortage of materials, Community users should have priority with regard to the Community production. In addition to the market situation, the country of destination and the intended use of the materials are taken into account when considering an export authorisation.</p>
<p>In addition, transactions involving nuclear materials must also comply with the safeguards obligations under Chapter VII of the Euratom Treaty, and failure to do so may result in sanctions imposed by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Local authorities in the EU and in developing countries are eligible to the range of EC external instruments, including the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) and the European Development Fund (EDF). It should be noted that the EC does not make a distinction between different layers of sub-national governments and refers to "local authorities" for all sub-national levels of governments - "regions" are therefore included in this term. Caution: the DCI (Art. 24) clearly, and for the first time, makes the distinction between countries, municipalities, provinces, departments and regions.</p>
<p>In this context there are opportunities to establish links between EU regions and their counterparts in developing countries through exchange of best practice and participation of EU regions in the implementation of programmes and projects. A number of initiatives are indeed under way, including for example:</p>
<p>Urb-Al, a regional programme intended for local authorities of Latin America and EU Member States which funded 188 projects and 13 networks. Approximately 500 local authorities participated in the programme. The EC is currently considering the creation in 2008 of a new programme whose themes, management methods and budget have yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Asia Urbs, a regional programme in Asia which financed 58 projects for an amount of €156 million. Asia Urbs was merged with the programme "Asia Wide" to create the programme "Asia Pro Eco" dedicated to urban environment and ecology in the same spirit of cooperation between Asia and EU local authorities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new thematic programme "Non-state actors and local authorities in development" (DCI article 14) aims at capacity building through support to "own" initiatives of eligible actors originating from the EU and from partner countries. In 2007, approximately €30 million has been earmarked for local authorities under the programme. Activities may include support to coordination, communication and exchange of experience between local authorities in Europe and their counterparts in partner countries.</p>
<p>Promoting co-operation between regional and local authorities of the EU and partner countries is an important objective of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Particular attention has been paid in that context to Cross Border Co-operation. The newly adopted European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) includes a vastly improved Cross Border co-operation component. This will allow financing joint projects aimed at fostering sustainable development, addressing common challenges, improving border management and promoting people to people exchanges. Under that component 15 co-operation programmes are established covering the land and maritime borders between EU and neighbouring countries and involving the relevant border regions. The total budget for this component will be € 1.1 billion for 7 years.</p>
<p>In addition, ENPI will also fund a small programme for cooperation between local and regional authorities in the partner countries and the EU, building on the experience of programmes such as the Tacis Institution Building Partnership Programme, Tacis City Twinning and MED-PACT under MEDA<a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This will allow also co-operation among actors which are not located in border regions.</p>
<p>Finally, regional and local authority may also be supported in the context of country and regional programmes where this is relevant for achieving the objectives of the programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the substantial energy saving potential related to household lighting.</p>
<p>Under the Eco-design Directive<a href="#defann_61_2" name="refann_61_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission is examining 20 product groups (including lighting) in order to improve their overall environmental performance, with special attention to their energy efficiency. In this framework, it will be possible to the Commission to set mandatory requirements on products that would exclude the less performing products from the European market. In the case of domestic lighting, requirements on energy efficiency could lead in practice to a phasing out of inefficient incandescent lamps (not necessarily to banning the incandescent lamp technology as a whole).</p>
<p>Most of the studies providing the technical and economic input to set out ecodesign requirements are going to finish in 2007 for 15 product groups, allowing adoption of measures by the Commission from 2008 onwards. First draft measures are expected to be issued for stakeholder consultation before the end of 2007, including on street lighting and office lighting. Studies for further measures will be launched in the next weeks, including one on domestic lighting, and could lead to the adoption of measures as early as 2009, eventually phasing out inefficient incandescent light bulbs, if appropriate.<a href="#defann_61_3" name="refann_61_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>The domestic lighting study will also examine other technologies to determine whether they could be valid alternatives to conventional incandescent light bulbs, such as efficient halogene lights, compact fluorescent lamps and LEDs<a href="#defann_61_4" name="refann_61_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Some measures on efficiency of lighting are already in place. Council and Parliament Directive 2000/55/EC<a href="#defann_61_5" name="refann_61_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> provides for energy efficiency requirements on ballasts for fluorescent lighting. Since 1998, a Commission Directive<a href="#defann_61_6" name="refann_61_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> requires the display of the EU energy label on the packaging of household lamps pointing out incandescent lamps to consumers as particularly bad performers. However, while very effective for other appliances, the label did not succeed in pulling the market towards a major market share for economic lamps. This seems to be related to the high difference in purchase price for consumers, and also to aesthetic and performance considerations.</p>
<p>The Commission conducted research in 2006 on "Residential Lighting Consumption and Saving Potential in the Enlarged EU", including an in-depth review of existing policies and programmes at national level in half of all Member States.<a href="#defann_61_7" name="refann_61_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> The vast majority of Member States have launched actions, mostly consisting of promotional campaigns addressed to consumers and involving different market actors, aimed at spreading the use of energy-saving compact fluorescent lamps replacing conventional incandescent lamps.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Far from encouraging the creation of surpluses, this distillation absorbs 12 million hectolitres of wine per year, over half of it from Spain. Eliminating it would have an extremely harmful effect on those who traditionally buy it for manufacturing brandy and sherry, which account for over 3 million hectolitres of wine alcohol. The rise in costs to producers would be of the order of EUR 50 million per year, which would lead many of them to seek their suppliers in third countries and even relocate their production. This would lead to the immediate creation of a genuine surplus in the market and subsequently lead to the forced abandoning of vineyards in many Spanish regions where there is no alternative crop, a development bringing grave environmental risks in its wake.</p>

<p>(EN) In its Communication on the reform of the wine sector, the Commission indeed suggested that financial support for the distillation of wine into potable alcohol should be abolished. This was done for two main reasons. Firstly, as it is the case for all subsidised distillation measures both the short term market clearance and the income support provided by them favour surplus production in the long term. Secondly, a substantial part of this distillation will take place independently of any subsidies.</p>

<p>Recently in Frankfurt, a court refused to hear the case of a German national of Moroccan origin living in Germany who was suing her Moroccan husband for divorce on grounds of domestic violence (threat to her life). The judge refused to hear the case for possible divorce within a period of less than one year pursuant to Article 1565 of the Civil Code. The judge stated that since the two parties were of Moroccan origin, the relevant Article could not be applied as the behaviour of the husband was not contrary to the practice of the Koran.</p>
<p>What is the Commission's view of such a violation of the fundamental rights of a national of a Member State of the EU and the failure to apply and provide justice pursuant to the relevant national legislation and the Community acquis? Does it agree that this dimension should be examined in greater detail in the context of the dual process of integration of immigrants (respect for the rights of immigrants - respect for the rules and values of the Member States)?</p>

<p>(EN) Gender equality is a fundamental right and a common value of the European Union and jurisprudence or practices that discriminate against women cannot be accepted. The Commission is committed to eliminate any kind of discrimination against women and to promote equality between men and women in all its activities. Gender equality is therefore actively promoted in the various Commissions' policies, including the fight against violence against women and immigration and integration.</p>
<p>The Commission has undertaken many initiatives to combat violence against women from various angles, including human rights, trafficking, migration, crime prevention, gender equality and public health, and by using different policies and financial instruments. One example is the Roadmap for equality between women and men (2006-2010) which identifies the eradication of gender-based violence as one of the six priority areas. The "Daphne" Programme, established in 1997, is another key element of the Commission's commitment to combat violence against women. The Programme supports projects to tackle all forms of gender-based violence from the point of view of prevention, protection, support and rehabilitation. The "Daphne" Programme will be reinforced in the future to allow the Commission to strengthen its combat against violence.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member asks for the Commission's view of a recent court case in which a German judge seems to have interpreted the German law on divorce in the light of certain provisions of the Koran. However, the Commission must inform the Honourable Member that it is not able to intervene in judicial proceedings in the Member States where no Community law is applicable.</p>
<p>This shows the need for clear rules on the question of applicable law to divorce where the current lack of common rules leads to legal uncertainty and the risk of "forum shopping" for the many thousands of "international couples" who divorce each year in the European Union. To remedy these shortcomings, the Commission adopted a proposal on 17 July 2006 which is currently under negotiation. The proposal does not harmonise the national laws on divorce, which remain diverse for cultural and historical reasons, but establishes common rules to determine the applicable law in matters of divorce and legal separation. The main objective of the proposal is to create legal certainty and enable couples to know in advance which law that will apply to their divorce proceeding. It gives the spouses a limited possibility to choose the applicable law subject to certain procedural safeguards to ensure that both spouses are aware of the consequences of their choice. In the absence of choice, the applicable law would be determined on the basis of a common rule based in the first place on the habitual residence of the spouses. A couple living in Germany would consequently be subject to German divorce law unless they have chosen another law. In order to avoid situations such as the one described by the Honourable Member, the Commission has included a so-called public policy clause in its proposal. This rule allows a court to refuse to apply foreign law, partly or entirely, if such application is manifestly contrary to the public policy of the forum State. A court of a Member State could invoke this clause if it considers that the application of the law of a certain law, e.g. a law inspired by sharia law, is against its public policy. The Commission believes that such public policy clauses, which are traditionally used in private international law instruments, are appropriate tools to deal with this type of situations.</p>
<p>In reference to the question of Honourable Member on integration as a two-way process, the Commission wishes to clarify that this concept was put forward in November 2004 by the Council in the context of Common Basic Principles on Integration. The Commission developed this notion in its Common Agenda for Integration published in September 2005. The Common Basic Principle no 1 states that integration is a dynamic, two-way process of mutual accommodation by all immigrants and residents of Member States.</p>
<p>Finally, the Annual Reports on Migration and Integration have been published by the Commission following an invitation by the 2003 Thessaloniki European Council 'to present an Annual Report on Migration and Integration in Europe, in order to map EU-wide migration data, immigration and integration policies and practices'. The Commission issued its first Annual Report in 2004, second one in 2006 and the third Annual Report on Migration and Integration is foreseen for second semester 2007. The forthcoming Report, alike the previous one, will be based to a large extent on replies of Member States to a Commission questionnaire concerning various aspects of integration policies and developments, including equal rights, common values, anti-discrimination, the position of women, etc. This methodology will enable the Commission to take stock of recent developments in integration policies and programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The embargo on exports of Polish foodstuffs, including meat, to the Russian market has been in place for one and a half years now, causing losses amounting to hundreds of millions of euros among Polish food producers. The lack of access to the Russian meat market has also led to a massive fall in the market price for pigs in Poland, which has placed several hundred thousand Polish farmers in financial difficulties.</p>
<p>On 30 March 2007 the Commission forwarded a report to Russia, setting out replies to all of the reservations that Russia has expressed to date with regard to Polish meat exports to the Russian market and stating that, on the basis of the information provided, Russia should lift the embargo. However, after considering the matter for no more than two days, Russia deemed the information provided to be insufficient and is now proposing to the Commission that a further inspection of Polish meat processing plants be carried out.</p>
<p>All the events that have occurred in connection with this matter over the past eighteen or so months have made it increasingly clear that the Russian embargo on Polish foodstuffs is purely political in nature.

<p>(EN) The Commission attaches paramount importance to title lifting of the Russian ban on Polish exports of meat and plant products. The Commissioners in charge of Health and Trade have regularly made this clear to their Russian counterparts. The Commission maintains its position that the Russian bans on Polish exports of meat and plant products were disproportionate and therefore need to be lifted without any further delay.</p>
<p>In the meeting between Commissioner in charge of Health and Mr Gordeyev, the Russian Minister of Agriculture, in January 2007, Russia and the EU committed to a number of actions and thus entered a process of getting the bans lifted. As a part of that process, Russia carried out inspections in Poland in February 2007. The Commission, together with the Polish authorities, accompanied the Russian inspectors on that occasion. They also eventually prepared a comprehensive response to the comments of the Russian side regarding what was inspected. This response was sent to Russia on 29 March 2007. In their reply of 11 April 2007 regarding veterinary issues, the Russian authorities acknowledged actions taken by Poland to address the issues raised as a result of the Russian veterinary inspection. They also posed certain additional questions to which the Commission replied in close cooperation with the Polish authorities. Finally, the Russian authorities offered new joint inspections as a step towards lifting the ban on meat products. The Russian response to phytosanitary issues is still awaited.</p>
<p>The Commission's efforts at the political level are also continuing. Following discussions at the highest level between the Commission, the EU Presidency and Poland on 3 April 2007, Poland gave a positive signal by lifting its reserve on the negotiating directives for the new EU-Russia framework agreement, a move welcomed by the Commission, The Commission then continued its efforts to ensure that this leads to the lifting of the bans and agreement to launch negotiations for the new Agreement.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Commissioner for Health met the Russian Minister of Agriculture, Mr Gordeyev on 21 and 22 April 2007 and entered into a new round negotiation concerning the Polish exports' meat and plant ban. Regrettably, these negotiations did not lead to the desired outcome as the Russian side was not willing to proceed with lifting the import ban on Polish meat and plants. Both sides agreed to continue working together towards a solution.</p>
<p>This issue also forms part of the SPS<a href="#defann_64_1" name="refann_64_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> discussions within Russia's World Trade Organisation (WTO) accession negotiations. Clearly, the absence of a satisfactory solution, or a satisfactory package, on this issue may have an impact on Russia's WTO accession.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission can confirm that an area called Crosswood Bog has been formally proposed by Ireland for protection under Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora<a href="#defann_67_1" name="refann_67_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The site is of European conservation importance because it contains an active raised bog, which is a priority habitat type under this directive.</p>
<p>This site was included in the list of sites of Community importance for the Atlantic biogeographical region, adopted by Commission Decision of 7 December 2004<a href="#defann_67_2" name="refann_67_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It is therefore subject to the protection safeguards defined in Article 6 of Directive 92/43/EEC. As such Ireland is required to take appropriate steps to avoid the deterioration of the raised bog habitat.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the protection and management of Crosswood Bog in the context of obligations under Council Directive 92/43/EEC rests with the Irish authorities, who must establish the necessary conservation measures for the site. A derogation from the protection requirements of the Directive has neither been sought by Ireland nor granted by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission would be concerned if there was uncontrolled turf cutting at this site as peat extraction represents one of the main activities that can cause damage to this habitat. This especially applies to large scale commercial peat extraction which, together with associated drainage works, can cause serious disruption to the hydrological and ecological functioning of the bog.</p>
<p>However, it is for the Irish authorities to make decisions in accordance with the Directive on particular peat extraction proposals and activities so as to ensure the achievement of the overall requirement of avoiding deterioration of the active raised bog at Crosswood Bog.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The reduction in ships' crews, the allocation of multiple tasks to the crew, including taking part in loading and unloading, the increase in daily working time to 12-14 hours under harsh conditions is typical of the hard, unhealthy and dangerous work performed by seafarers. The proposal by the Commission and the governments of the EU to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to issue certificates of proficiency to seafarers performing multiple duties, with a single certificate for those performing the duties of captain, engineer and other specialists - 'Comprehensive Review of the STCW Convention and the STW Code', STW 38/2/4-14/11/2006 - devalues seafarers' training, intensifies their work, multiplies the dangers to their safety and lives and has a negative impact on the environment. The sinking of the 'Sea Diamond' on 5 April 2007 off Santorini, the running aground of the 'Napoli' off the coast of the United Kingdom, the collision between the freighter 'Susan Borchard' and the hydrofoil, the 'Segesta Jet', off Messina in Italy, etc. confirm these views.</p>
<p>What are the Commission's views on increasing the number of crew and the working hours of seafarers on the basis of the actual requirements of ships? Given the opposition of seafarers' unions, will the Commission, together with the governments of the Member States, call for the withdrawal of the above proposal by the IMO? Is it possible to continue applying the dangerous rules governing the construction of passenger boats, coastal and tourist vessels, which cram in thousands of passengers without the necessary facilities for their safe disembarkation in the event of danger or having to abandon ship?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission notes the concerns expressed by the honourable Member regarding the working time of crews, but would like to highlight the fact that, for eight years, the Community has been equipped with specific legislation on the duration of working time of seafarers<a href="#defann_68_1" name="refann_68_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and has introduced specific measures on the monitoring of that legislation in European ports<a href="#defann_68_2" name="refann_68_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The directive on seafarers, for example, stipulates that the standard working time is, in principle, eight hours per day, although a maximum number of working hours (not exceeding 14 hours for every 24 hour period) is possible. The directive also specifies that the determination of ships’ crew must take account of the need to prevent or restrict, as far as possible, an excessive duration of working time. Employers must keep a register of seafarers’ daily working hours, in order to comply with these provisions.</p>
<p>The responsibility for monitoring the stringent application of these rules obviously rests with the Member States.</p>
<p>With regard, more generally, to seafarers’ working conditions, the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the swift ratification and implementation of the ILO Convention<a href="#defann_68_3" name="refann_68_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on maritime labour standards, including, of course, in Europe, and this, by means of an agreement between social partners, an agreement that is currently under negotiation.</p>
<p>On the subject of the revision of the STCW Convention<a href="#defann_68_4" name="refann_68_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> undertaken by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the joint submission made in this context by the Member States and the Commission, it should be clarified that this submission has the sole aim, at this stage of proceedings, of suggesting subjects that could be included in this revision. In this context, subjects that could be examined include the possibility of a better distribution between crew members of actual navigation duties and duties that are more administrative in nature. No position has yet been decided on regarding this subject.</p>
<p>The Commission does not support the honourable Member’s assertion that the current rules governing the construction of passenger boats, established at international level, are dangerous. In any case, the Commission is monitoring very closely the discussions under way at the IMO on the development of these rules.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p> (REACH is item 30, the tobacco declaration starts on page 16).</p>
<p>The Commission fully adheres to the commitments made in this declaration.

<p>As far as REACH is concerned, the declaration underlines the fact that ingredients are covered in the REACH Regulation like any other chemical substances and that some of their effects in burnt form should be covered by any required chemical safety assessments.</p>
<p>Under the REACH Regulation, it is not the role of the Agency as such to carry out tests, whether for chemicals in tobacco smoke or for any other purpose. By contrast, it is the responsibility of the concerned company to do any necessary testing in the context of preparing its registration.

<p>Furthermore, Article 12 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights provides that everyone has the right to freedom of association, in particular in trade unions matters.

<p>(EN) Public health is a key priority in the EU and the Commission is aware of this serious issue in relation to various dangerous materials that were used for (old) means of public transport. The public authorities owning these types of transport equipment and infrastructure should renew them in compliance with appropriate national regulations.</p>
<p>The issues of withdrawing and replacing equipment and infrastructure are, as such, outside the scope of the Construction Product Directive<a href="#defann_72_1" name="refann_72_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Indeed, the objective of this Directive is to ensure correct product information is provided with regard to the nature of the product, the intended use(s) for which the product can be applied, and the characteristics concerning product performance with a view to them being placed on the market. It does not concern the replacement of these products due to their obsoleteness and non compliance with health safety and public health requirements. The Member States remain responsible for ensuring that building and civil engineering works on their territories are designed and executed, and the construction products used are fit for this use, incorporated, assembled, applied or installed, and maintained, in a way that does not compromise safety, health and the environment, and other issues of public interest protection. Member States must bring into force, upgrade and enforce the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to observe this responsibility.</p>
<p>As regards the protection of the health and safety of workers against the risks arising from exposure to asbestos or chemical substances, it should be noted that Framework Directive 89/391/EEC<a href="#defann_72_2" name="refann_72_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, its individual Directives 98/24/EC<a href="#defann_72_3" name="refann_72_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on chemical substances and 2004/37/EC<a href="#defann_72_4" name="refann_72_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> on carcinogens and mutagens and Directive 83/477/EEC<a href="#defann_72_5" name="refann_72_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> on asbestos, are applicable.</p>
<p>In this context, employers shall carry out a proper risk assessment and adopt adequate preventive and protection measures, in particular reduction and replacement of the hazardous and/or carcinogenic substances.</p>
<p>EU Directives have to be transposed in national law and it is up to the competent national authorities to properly enforce the national rules on health and safety of workers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 9 March at the Brussels Summit, European heads of government signed the decision in support of energy policy which describes the construction of the Nabucco pipeline as the Union's most important gas project. From the point of view both of the security of energy supply and of diversification of transit facilities and sources of supply, the construction of the pipeline, with a capacity of 30 billion cubic metres per annum, could represent a huge gain for the European Union, which faces challenges in the field of energy.</p>
<p>As the Nabucco project currently has no real competitor as a way of expanding the EU's sources of natural gas, what form of aid will the Commission provide in order to ensure that the Nubucco gas pipeline is built as soon as possible? What is the Commission's preliminary timetable for the realisation of the project? In comparison with other projects to supply Europe with gas, how does the Commission rate the probability of the construction of the Nabucco pipeline?
