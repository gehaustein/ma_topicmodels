<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and in particular their respective rapporteurs, Mr Nobilia and Mr Purvis, for their open and constructive work on this proposal. The nature and number of proposed amendments indicates that much thought and effort has gone into the examination of the Commission’s proposal. In this respect, I am sure that the public hearing organised in February – in which it was my pleasure to participate – served as a useful introduction to the very technical issues dealt with in the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The aims of the Commission’s proposal can be stated quite briefly. They are accurately summarised in Mr Nobilia’s report. They are as follows: first, to introduce more stringent tests for the biodegradability of surfactants in detergents; second, to expand the scope to include all four types of surfactants instead of covering just two types as at present; and third, to introduce labelling requirements to benefit the consumer and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The first two measures will significantly enhance the protection of the aquatic environment with respect to toxicity, and the third will also benefit the health of consumers with respect to allergies. In addition, the proposal brings all EU detergents legislation together in a single text to make it more user-friendly, so this is a major effort to simplify EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides presenting what is in the proposal, I would also like to say some words on the wider legislative context. I do this to explain why certain things have been left out of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, this proposal supplements, but does not replace, the horizontal legislation on chemicals, in particular the directives on dangerous substances and preparations. Indeed, detergents are not dangerous in the sense of the Dangerous Preparations Directive. We need to supplement the general horizontal legislation, not because detergents are especially hazardous, but because they are released into the aquatic environment in very large amounts. Legislation is justified even for a chemical preparation with a low hazard, if it can pose a risk to the environment through being released in sufficiently large quantities. We need a regulation on detergents to fill this sector-specific limitation in the horizontal legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation on detergents therefore needs to address certain specific issues, principally, of course, the biodegradation of surfactants. It is therefore important to see the proposal not as the final position on detergents, but as an instrument for bringing detergents within the harmonised area of the Internal Market, and as a tool for tackling the associated responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal provides a framework for addressing issues relating to detergents, as and when they arise. It also provides a tool for keeping the legislation up-to-date in response to technical progress and the increased understanding of, and concern for, the environment. Other issues relating to detergents that are not addressed by the proposal will, however, be addressed by horizontal legislation; for example, at the last session we had Mr Lannoye's report on Nonylphenol and the next debate today is on Mrs Schörling's report on CMRs.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important feature of the proposal concerns derogations for those surfactants that pass the old biodegradability tests, but fail the new tests. Derogations will only be granted for surfactants that can demonstrate, by means of a complementary risk assessment, that they will pose no risk to the environment. In no case would such a derogation be granted for use in an ordinary laundry detergent. This will only apply to specialised industrial and institutional uses where the tonnages have been declared and taken into account in the risk assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">The complementary risk assessment has to provide sufficient information to enable the risk to the environment to be properly evaluated. At the same time, unnecessary testing should be avoided. In this respect, toxicity testing will only be required if a Member State specifically requests it in cases where doubts remain. The testing requirements are therefore judged to be the minimum necessary consistent with a reliable evaluation, while at the same time minimising the amount of animal testing, as well as limiting the overall expense of the testing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that its proposal represents an equitable and appropriate balance between the economic, social and environmental pillars of sustainable development. It will provide the high level of protection of the environment and of human health required by the Treaty, and it will do so at a reasonable cost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can only thank them for this, for there is no doubt that, over and above the general intention of introducing one’s own ideas into a report, the ultimate goal is to improve the report itself and its effectiveness in the common, general interest. Likewise, I cannot fail to thank the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups for their sensitivity and for their goodwill in drafting at least eight compromise amendments to take account of concepts, objectives and proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal opinion, therefore, is that the product of the work of the Committee on the Environment, which is now before the House, has much broader backing than might have been expected when the Commission first submitted its proposal to Parliament. As I said before, I am not saying this out of pride but in order to give credit to all the members of the committee who have worked on the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we cannot claim that the report covers all aspects of the issue of detergents. We still have to analyse and express a position on a number of points. We have to decide what line to take on phosphates, for example, what line to take on the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactants, and again, what level to set with regard to the biodegradability of other components of detergents. Incidentally, it therefore appeared necessary to all concerned to set a deadline within which to ask the Commission to express its opinion on the rest of the matter. It can be said, however, that our primary objective in amending the proposal in question was to make the text and related instruments more usable, more functional and more cohesive.</p>
<p class="contents">This, in any case, was the line we followed in our work. I must stress that, as well as seeking to make the rules proposed more usable, functional and cohesive, we took care to pursue two further objectives. The first was to employ practical sensitivity with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, a particularly good example of this being the establishment of the derogation, without – we trust – giving any less consideration to the need to provide ever-increasing protection of the environment, public health and animal welfare. The second, in the context of the – at last binding – labelling system, concerns the goal of increasing the awareness of consumers when they make choices, without in any way detracting from the valuable work of consumer protection organisations but, on the contrary, enhancing it.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I would like to focus briefly on the fact that the regulation in question certainly does not cover all the questions related to detergents, and I am not criticising the Commission’s work here but pointing out two further characteristic aspects of both this and previous provisions on detergents. The first – as I suggested at the start of my speech – is the underlying approach to the issue: the Commission took the approach of phasing in the legislation. The second, which almost justifies the first, is the need for recourse to a third body, in this case to a scientific committee, to implement the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">When amending the regulation in question, we have attempted to assess the tasks entrusted to the committee and bring those considered to be political rather than technical before the House for it to study and vote on. The rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs worked together to achieve this undertaking too. Since, however, there are both technical and political aspects – and there are – and since it is true that the work carried out in the Committee on the Environment has been productive and enjoyed remarkably broad support, then I find it difficult to understand why some of my colleagues, without wishing to undermine everyone’s individual right to do so, have tabled further amendments in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, in this regard, I have to say that I support Amendments Nos 47, 52, 53 and 60, which indisputably make additional important contributions which complement the current provisions. I also have to say that my feelings are essentially neutral as regards Amendments Nos 56 and 61, which merely change the position of points within the regulation itself, whereas I have to express firm rejection of the remaining amendments, certainly not – to conclude – because I disapprove of their content in principle, nor even because they partially belie the consensus expressed in committee, but because, should they be accepted, they would not achieve what is undeniably the desired objective of the text to be issued, namely providing better protection, but would compromise the cohesiveness, functionality and usability which I mentioned earlier, which is consistent with that phasing-in of the legislation that is based on the scientific approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will completely overhaul and modernise legislation concerning detergents. It is an advance for producers and consumers, as well as for the environment. We did, however, in our consideration of it, identify certain shortcomings which, I am glad to say, will be rectified by many of the proposed amendments in Mr Nobilia's report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal does not differentiate between, for example, a laundry product made and marketed by an international company in large quantities for a mass consumer market, and on the other hand a niche product made in small quantities often by SMEs for specialised applications. Examples of the latter are cleaning equipment for dairies, or for operating theatres. The former can readily follow the provisions of the draft directive with its testing processes and derogation procedures, and there are always ample alternatives, but for the smaller specialised product this can be a brick wall which eliminates a useful, even a central, product. I am pleased therefore that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has accepted the gist of our proposal for a tiered derogation procedure which such producers can invoke.</p>
<p class="contents">We also proposed a sunset clause so that the comitology procedure will automatically lapse after eight years and be renewed only if appropriate at that time. This is based on the procedure first introduced in the financial services area in order for Parliament to keep some measure of control over the burgeoning comitology systems which are developing in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy I am pleased to recommend support for Mr Nobilia's report but would suggest that Amendments 5, 15, 20, 33 and 40 unduly overlap with other relevant legislation and should be rejected. Nor can we support the amendments lodged by the Verts/ALE Group at the last minute. Otherwise we can wholeheartedly support Mr Nobilia's report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Florenz (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, I am glad that we have the opportunity today to speak on the subject of this directive – not so much out of any personal attachment to detergent issues, but quite simply because this report also shows that the European Union is moving towards abandoning the end-of-life policy and instead, to an increasing extent, seeking to develop modern and environmentally friendly products that are economically and socially sustainable. That means that we want to motivate industry to move progressively to other products and, at the end of the line, no longer to rely on the catalytic converter or on the waste treatment plant or on big exhaust systems. Instead, right at the start of the process, we want to move on to new products that are sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is a forward step in terms of the internal market, because its consequence will be that many national regulations current in Europe will be harmonised, the objective being to have equal and comparable criteria for approval, and especially to ensure the removal of distortions to competition in this area too. So, Commissioner, I am very glad that you were present at the European People's Party group's hearing, and that collaboration between environmentalists and your department has developed extraordinarily well in the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy will benefit not only consumers, but also the environment, water policy and, above all, the internal market as well, and to that I am especially committed. There is, for example, no doubt that biodegradability must be progressively revalued. Mr Nobilia has come up with a very good proposal, and I cannot do other than endorse it. If I may, very much on the spur of the moment, consider the amendments tabled by the Greens, I do not think that all of them are wrong, but, yet again, their tendency is to enable the big players to perform these services, so that the small ones inevitably go to the wall. That is a classic example of a policy militating against small businesses, because only really big firms will be able to surmount these obstacles. As Mr Purvis has already pointed out, there is the danger that legislation like this will do precisely what we must not do by driving into a corner those whom we are actually trying to encourage to make use of niches. It is these whom we have to protect, and so a degree of tolerance must be built up.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, detergents will not be the end of the story, and we have already declared war on phosphates. Every manufacturer should know that the end is drawing progressively closer, but within a fair timescale rather than overnight, enabling businesses to adjust. That is the vitally important and utterly fundamental strategy that we must pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson I have had to learn is that those of us who sit in this House should not get above ourselves. As a legislator, or co-legislator, I am quite incapable of prescribing from what point the labels on detergents should indicate the presence of scents. Some suggest 50 milligrams, while others propose 500 milligrams. Mr Nobilia has taken the only wise decision in saying that this would be handed over to experts. If they can come to a decision, the European directive will be aiming in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I am shocked to learn from studies that the greatest hazards involving detergents have basically to do with our evident inability to use the right amount of them. The people concerned – and I number myself among them – seem to think that they should always put the same amount of detergent into the washing machine, with the result that, if the size of the wash varies – if, for example, it is less by weight – the amount of detergent used is excessive. There is work for us all to do here. I must admit that I have not all that often filled up a washing machine. I am keen to learn how to do it and want to motivate my wife to show me the ropes.</p>
<p class="contents">So this involves all of us; not just the legislator, not just industry, but the public too. We will be on the right track if we grasp that fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The key aspects of this regulation are health, consumer safety and the protection of and respect for the environment. The amendments retabled on behalf of my group are intended precisely to provide greater guarantees of the achievement of these objectives and of the objectives based on the three principles which are the basis for the work of the Committee on the Environment: the precautionary principle, the ‘polluter pays’ principle and the substitution principle. The fact that the scope of the regulation has been confined to the biodegradability of the surfactants contained in detergents does not limit the application of these principles. Indeed, I believe that anaerobic biodegradation, the biodegradation of principal organic ingredients other than surfactants and the biodegradation of phosphates should be regulated specifically, for this would complement the regulation of detergents.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I agree with the principle that the possibility of introducing legislation on individual products should be provided for, with a view to imposing more stringent requirements in the field of safety, use and environmental protection than those already laid down by horizontal legislation. That is why we are all calling upon the Commission together to present a new legislative proposal seeking to phase out these substances or to limit specific applications within three years of the entry into force of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe that it would be appropriate to provide for a single labelling system for these kinds of products in daily use, for that would allow the consumer to recognise and the producer to promote products which are less harmful to the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Members of the House have been criticised by the European Environment Bureau for being less than ambitious – in particular for not insisting upon a phasing-out of phosphates across the European Union. We have, it is being said, sold out to the detergent manufacturers. Depending on the eye of the beholder a bath of hot water may be half-full or half-empty; I compare the changes proposed by the rapporteur, with cross-party support, as representing very much the half-full option. They represent a significant step forward, tightening up on requirements for the use of specialist detergents, improving on the proposals for labelling of potential allergens, ensuring that consideration is given to the development of non-animal tests and setting the basis for proposals to eliminate phosphates, taking full account of scientific evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals are realistic and cautiously ambitious, they improve to my mind on the Commission's draft proposals. However, I am very conscious of the need to ensure that we secure cross-party support, if the powers of this House to improve environment legislation are to be brought to bear. We can sometimes make gestures at first reading, securing major amendments for radical reform, but they matter not at all if we cannot get agreement at second reading, if we cannot secure that qualified majority; and to make progress we need to take account both of our ambitions for the environment and of legitimate concerns for industry. On the day after we voted for the enlargement of the European Union, I am very conscious that this is going to be more difficult as time passes. We are at serious risk of having to move at the very slowest pace of the slowest Member, unless we can bring the House together at every opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">My biggest concern at the moment is that we have an increasing number of Member States who are simply failing to comply even with the legislation we already have on the statute books. In the United Kingdom there are currently nine environmental directives which should already have been transposed since the Commissioner came to office, not one of which has yet been put into practice. Ministers are going to the Council of Ministers, signing their names to documents agreed after co-decision and then simply not keeping their word. Playing the system, breaking the spirit of the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem therefore is not whether the bath of hot water is half-full or empty, but that too many Member States are not putting the plug into the bath in the first place. That should be the number-one concern, not only of the European Environment Bureau, but also of those who care in this House and in the Commission about ensuring that we move forward together to improve Europe's environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very good to simplify the legislation, from five pieces of legislation to just one. But the Commissioner has also said that this is good for the Internal Market. This is unfortunately not so, because the Internal Market has to contend with very different things. Germany, Italy and a number of other countries have banned phosphates in detergents. In some other countries, such as my own, there is a voluntary ban. In other countries again, in particular the Scandinavian countries, the phosphates are eventually removed in the waste water purification system. In Southern Europe, and unfortunately in Eastern Europe as well, phosphates are permitted. You cannot therefore say that this is good for the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">All the groups have however reached a compromise on eight points and this is one of them. I am very happy about it. We say to the Commission that they must take another good look at the scientific evidence which shows that phosphates do indeed cause a problem, not just in the classical detergents. There are after all sufficient alternatives to them. This was the big problem of 30 years ago, that all those detergents contained far too many phosphates so that soap found its way into the rivers everywhere, causing foam and green algae. That problem has been overcome. Now however we have tablets for the dishwasher, which did not exist 30 years ago and which still contain very many phosphates, even in those countries that have now banned phosphates. This is why I have associated myself with the compromise. Take another good look and give the industry three years to come up with alternatives. It really can be done. It proved possible for the ordinary detergents, so it must also be possible for these dishwasher tablets.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is another problem. It is utterly ridiculous that dangerous substances, carcinogenic substances, are permitted in detergents! I am glad that the majority of this Parliament will very probably shortly be declaring itself in favour of them no longer being allowed in ordinary, everyday consumer products that everyone uses. Of course we are running ahead of the legislation on chemistry that is still to come, but it is not our fault that the Commission has waited so long to table this legislation. Indeed, we still do not have it and we are hoping across the whole Parliament, in all the political parties, that the Commission really will table this new legislation before the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of odours. Substances that cause allergies, not in everyone, but in certain people who cannot resist them, simply have no place in detergents. Okay, that is not what we have decided. What we have decided is that the detergent manufacturers must state very clearly that these substances are present. This gives people the choice of using them or not and will probably in any event lead to the big detergent manufacturers not putting them in any more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In short I approve of the line that the rapporteur has set out. If we wish to assess detergents with a view to trade and use, we must look in particular at their environmental and health effects.</p>
<p class="contents">An exemption for the restrictions to trade and use can be granted if we are considering necessary applications for which no safer alternatives exist. With this provision we must however ensure that the volume of sale and use across the territory of the entire European Union remains at such a low level that there is no threat to the environment and health.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point concerns phosphates. In some Member States they have already been banned. An EU ban is rather premature at the moment as far as I am concerned, but does require serious consideration. If there are other aspects for which Member States have laid down stricter legislation, these Member States should not be forced to amend their legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to express my approval to the rapporteur regarding labelling. For lay people it is indeed often incomprehensible and confusing. Simple texts on products that have been approved following rigorous evaluation must be sufficient. If the curious consumer wishes to know more, they must consult the manufacturer by way of the latter’s web site and by telephone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, this clearly shows the links between these three competences or areas. It is also, however, an issue relating to the internal market, and – as Mr Florenz so clearly described – all the economic consequences of this kind of decision are thus evident. This is therefore an environmental problem since it involves exerting pressure on the various players concerned in order to significantly reduce the use of detergents, which, when excessive, has harmful consequences for water.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a matter of public health. Are we, in fact, really measuring the consequences for human health of water pollution caused by waste rinsing water containing detergents? We all want to significantly reduce the quantities used and the toxicity of the various ingredients in detergents. However, we need to set objectives in this area that are ambitious yet attainable. There, too, consumer policy is concerned, since it is up to consumers, in other words each one of us, to rationalise our use of detergents. This is achieved, in particular, simply by reducing the quantities used and using products more efficiently. In order to do so, consumers must be given access to better information concerning instructions and conditions of use, and genuinely become aware of their great responsibilities in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts have already been made at this level by companies in the sector, by means of codes of good practice or the organisation of campaigns to increase public information and awareness. These actions, however, are undoubtedly still insufficient in relation to the environmental issues at stake here and current results. That is why I support the rapporteur, Mr Nobilia, in this field, as he goes further than the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">While conscious of the need to respect trade secrets, naturally – we sometimes address areas that could be sensitive – we would like to request further information. We would like all possible information to be sent immediately to the medical staff, who could be under obligation to respond and take decisions in this field. Of course, I would point out that the medical staff are also bound by professional secrecy. It is essential to continue research in this sector in order to find substances that are equally effective in terms of hygiene but less harmful to the environment. We need to find products that are more biodegradable.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, with regard to the issue of animal experiments – we have already spoken about this enough in this House, amongst other occasions, when we had to decide on the cosmetics issue – we should encourage the use, wherever possible, of in vitro testing methods and other alternative methods. The various actions taken must, of course, be carried out in full consideration of European legislation, including the legislation we are preparing in the field of chemical substances, in order to adopt coherent policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is time that we did something on detergents as there is a major problem associated with detergents and their impact upon water quality across Europe. Throughout our water systems, our great rivers and even down to the sea we see the effects of these substances being pumped into the environment, on a daily basis. I therefore welcome the proposals extending the testing on biodegradability, making biodegradability regulations stricter generally and requiring clearer labelling and information. All of this is good, as it simplifies and clarifies the administrative procedures in the proposal. Indeed, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs have worked well together to come up with a package that is worthy of the support of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask one question, however. Has enough been done, in particular with regard to the issue of phosphates? Phosphates are the key question buried inside this proposal. Phosphates are the trigger and often the clear cause of eutrification in many different waters across the European Union. We know that detergents are a major source of phosphates. Taking phosphates out of detergents would probably bring down the level of phosphates in our rivers, lakes and oceans to the point where we would not have to be concerned about the problem of eutrification again. This proposal does not fully address that question. We may have to revisit it in future. We cannot leave it for another day. If we do, we will see that as a consequence of development in eastern and central Europe, there will be a continuing problem of eutrification caused by phosphates in rivers across the whole of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is a problem with this proposal as it stands, we have not done enough on phosphates. We must act on that issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like my fellow MEPs, I am of course very pleased that we are obtaining a directive that tightens up the rules on detergents, because this is something that is definitely needed. It might nonetheless be questioned, as it was by the previous speaker, whether it is sufficient. My answer is that a much more stringent statement than the one that has now emerged would of course have been desirable. It is mainly regarding two points that I think the amendments we have tabled may be of great benefit: environmental labelling, covered by Amendment No 48; and the threshold value for biodegradable substances, covered by Amendment No 55. The demand for biodegradability definitely constitutes an important part of this legislation, but the requirement should be for this to be laid down in an actual article rather than in an annex. That would also be appropriate in the light of the codecision procedure and the European Parliament’s influence on legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal states that if a surfactant passes the test for ultimate biodegradability, no further tests shall be required before the substance is released onto the market. I do not believe that that is enough. The fact that a detergent has passed the biodegradability test does not make it impossible for it to have generated <span class="italic">other</span> metabolites that are difficult to break down and that can cause very major problems for the environment. Swedish studies have shown that detergents contain more and more chemicals and other ingredients, such as they have not contained before. It is therefore not enough just to examine biodegradability.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few remarks on labelling, which is something I advocate. Consumers must be able to choose. Sound environmental choices, stoutly defended by the Swedish Association for the Protection of the Environment, have led to our having, I believe, absolutely the safest detergents now being bought and sold in the world. It is consumers who, through their choices, have given impetus to this development. I therefore want you to vote in favour of Amendment No 48. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A regulation, in particular in this field, must not be limited to ensuring the free movement of detergents within the internal market. In a word, Article 95 of the Treaty must not take precedence over prudent and rational use of natural resources. That would be to lose all sense of proportion.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation introduces many benefits. I shall only mention two. The improvement in labelling that guarantees consumers the most specific information possible due to clear, readable labels. The restriction of the use of dangerous substances known as surfactants, which are harmful to the environment as they are hardly biodegradable at all and are dangerous in terms of public health for those who handle these detergents on a daily basis. I am thinking in particular of carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic substances that are known to be harmful.</p>
<p class="contents">This report also raises the question of banning animal testing. My position on the subject remains unaltered. I am in favour of banning animal testing, provided, of course, that reliable alternative tests are available, in particular with regard to metabolites. We must avoid repeating the mistake made in revising the directive on cosmetic products, which banned such tests without ensuring that reliable alternative methods exist.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to derogations, the Member States alone must control marketing authorisations. On this point I agree with the rapporteur’s approach. We must also take care not to wrong small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in a detergent market dominated by four or five heavyweights, for which this new legislation will not cause any particular problems. On the other hand, SMEs that produce small quantities of specialised detergents, known as industrial and commercial products, operate in a niche market. It will be extremely difficult for these companies to comply with the standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal is also intended to contribute to the free movement of detergent products on the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Nobilia on the report he has presented to us, which I fully support. Like Mr Purvis, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, whom I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate, I believe that this regulation represents progress for both producers and consumers of detergents. I wish, however, to make a few comments on two issues that I consider to be extremely important and on which I tabled proposals for amendments in the Committee on Industry.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I welcome the fact that the preamble to the regulation expressly acknowledges the need to undertake an evaluation of issues concerning phosphate content and the biodegradability of detergents and establishes the Commission’s duty to inform Parliament and the Council, within three years, of the results of this evaluation. We will consequently be in a position to assess the future need for regulation in this field. The second issue, which was unfortunately not adopted in committee, concerns the obligation on manufacturers to provide any health care professional with a datasheet listing all the ingredients of a detergent.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area, I think it is crucial to allow Member States, on the one hand, to appoint the body or bodies responsible for receiving this information and, on the other, to take the necessary measures to ensure that the bodies and health care professionals charged with receiving this information provide the necessary guarantees of confidentiality. This information can only be used when there is a medical need to take preventive and curative action, in particular, in cases of emergency, with the Member States being responsible for ensuring that this information is not used for other purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Information on preparations is extremely sensitive and can only be passed on to bodies or health care professionals bound by the duty of confidentiality. Furthermore, such information must be used exclusively for the purpose of treating sick people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for us to guarantee free movement for detergents, but I think it is still more important that the detergents we put on the market should damage neither the environment nor people’s health and that, as consumers, we should always know the nature of the everyday items we buy in the shops. I am able to support the proposals concerning bans on the use of carcinogenic and other poisonous substances in detergents, and I am also able to support the supplementary proposal to the effect that the ban should include those chemicals that are difficult to break down, together with hormone-disturbing chemicals.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that those Member States that have implemented restrictive rules governing the use of phosphates in detergents must be able to uphold these rules, and I think it is important for us now, at EU level too, to address the issue of phosphates.</p>
<p class="contents">Where labelling is concerned, it is naturally important for us, as consumers, to be provided with information about the characteristics of substances included in detergents, including substances that cause allergies. With regard to the system of EC environmental labelling, I would point out that these substances are covered by this system, but apparently not all manufacturers think it worthwhile participating in it. To a large extent, they use their own labels, and I am therefore able to support Amendment No 48, based on the idea that, if other environmental labels are used, it must be stated in what way they differ from the EC’s official environmental label.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say, on the subject of animal experiments, that I am fully able to support the amendments designed to restrict animal experiments. To the extent that there are any alternative methods at all, we must naturally try to use these and, ultimately, I also think we should put pressure on industry and manufacturers to develop alternative methods in those cases in which these still do not exist, so preventing as many animal experiments as is humanly possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is actually high time that carcinogenic substances were done away with. The removal of phosphates is in fact a necessity, and it is a tragedy that we have not succeeded in bringing it about. Moreover, when it comes to phasing out, the Regulation lags far behind other provisions, such as, for example, the water framework directives. Labelling is only an initial step. Although the highest priority must of course be given to freedom of choice, my criticism is that too little attention has been paid in this debate to examining the causal links between allergies, sensitivity to chemicals, and exposure to chemical substances. This Regulation does too much about the effects on water and far too little – hardly anything at all, in fact – about any exposure assessment covering consumers and those who work in the production process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude, Commissioner, by putting a request to you. We were too late in submitting an amendment, but I ask you to consider it all the same. We know that a number of companies are already adding bitter constituents to washing-up liquid in order to prevent children accidentally drinking them. There are still far too many deaths as a result of children drinking washing-up liquids or cleaning fluids. I ask you to give consideration to this, even without an amendment on the subject, and to look into the possibility of asking firms to add bitter constituents in order thereby to reduce the number of child deaths. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself have been happy to follow the line taken by my own group’s shadow rapporteur, my colleague Karl-Heinz Florenz. Good work from a man who has admitted he has only used a washing machine twice in his life. Quite a good, balanced report is thus taking shape. This might perhaps sounds unnecessarily solemn, considering that we are talking about washing detergents, but when you think about the effects on the environment, this everyday matter is important.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now making reasonable technical progress so that the use of detergents might constitute as small a burden on the environment as possible. Less attention, however, has been given to the role of the user of detergents. I believe consumer behaviour in the future will have the most significant impact on the environmental load caused by detergents. It is not enough to choose a packet with an environmental label off the shelf: people also have to be able to use the product correctly. That is not as easy as it sounds, though.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, how much to use depends on the hardness of the water. This may differ many times over between the hardest and the softest water areas. Of course, though, it would be very frustrating to produce many different kinds of package according to how hard the water is. The amount of laundry and how soiled it is also affects dosage. What is now given in Annex VIII, although improved by the Committee’s amendment, is still too approximate in this regard. Averages are not an adequate solution when just the right amount is crucial from the point of view of the consumer and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Another factor that makes the problem of correct dosage harder is the growing market in concentrates. It is more difficult to decide on dosages for concentrates if you are used to using greater amounts. There would be many advantages to the environment and the consumer, however, in using concentrates: there would be fewer packages in existence and significant sums would be saved in transportation costs. For this reason we should indeed support the switch-over to concentrates, but only if the consumer knows how to use them correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the directive on advice to consumers is only half complete, I think that detergent manufacturers could voluntarily increase consumer awareness and so also reduce the burden on the environment. The national consumer authorities could likewise run campaigns giving guidance to users of washing detergents. I hope that will happen. They literally cannot wash their hands of this matter now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Things can be cleaner and we must show the political will for this today. I should first like to extend my sincere thanks to Mr Nobilia and the shadow rapporteurs. They have done good work in improving the Commission’s proposal. As far as phosphates are concerned however there is still much to be done. There are four points I should like to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must provide for valid and adequate research to close the knowledge gap. Toxicity tests are desirable and cannot be skipped. Amendments to this effect are in keeping with the policy to eliminate the lack of knowledge about chemical substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the criteria must be clear. A degradability of 60% in itself is not enough. It is of course a matter of what the remainder contains. This remainder must not in any event contain any highly persistent or hormone disrupting substances. Amendment No 49 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very clear in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it must be clear that exceptions are only permitted under very strict conditions. It must of course be a question of industrial use and total sales must not constitute a threat to the environment or public health. The environmental benefit must also be demonstrated. Exceptions can only be made if the environment and of course public health are served. It must also be clear that under no circumstances may economic criteria come into play. Amendment No 47 is therefore far clearer than the other texts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there must be clear, honest and transparent information available. No misleading green labels, but honest information. The manufacturers must as far as possible associate themselves with the European environment mark. The European environment mark must in any event be a benchmark. That is the only way to create clarity for consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a moment I thought that this was some new ingredient that was being demonstrated in the detergents which had been used to clean the Chamber overnight. I suspect it is more to do with compliance with the parliamentary clean air directive, as opposed to the parliamentary hot air directive which very often informs our debates.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is detergents we are discussing this morning and we should remember, as Mr Florenz reminded us, what that industry is made up of: in particular, in the specialist area – the non-domestic area – some two-thirds of that area is produced by small firms employing some 20 000 people throughout the European Union. That is why everyone is right to congratulate Mr Nobilia, our rapporteur, on the skilful way in which he has struck a balance between environmental concerns, consumer choice and information and the industry's interests, so as to come up with a proposal that we can unite behind here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate him on the skill with which he has negotiated the eight compromise amendments that were passed in committee. These address a number of areas, including the complementary risk-assessments for surfactants that fail the ultimate biodegradability tests, so that a tiered approach can take into account exposure and risk. He was also right to tighten the Commission's wording regarding access to detailed ingredient lists for medical staff, ensuring not only access for medical professionals, but also confidentiality of data. He was right to bolster consumer access to information, ensuring that full lists of substances added to detergents are readily accessible to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we had the compromise on phosphates. I am incorporating a number of our amendments, including my own. I am sure he was right that we should ask the Commission to examine the arguments and come back with a proposal within three years. The arguments deserve careful attention, but we must also be aware of the benefits of phosphates. We know from our Scandinavian colleagues that, provided there is good water and sewage treatment, phosphates can result in lower volumes of detergents being used and also lower water temperatures being necessary. I do not know, Madam President, whether you are one of the many who now use the tablet form in washing machines, but there has been a movement towards tablets containing phosphate, which can improve the efficiency of use.</p>
<p class="contents">One should recall the research from both Sweden and the Netherlands. The Stockholm water authority found that with phosphate substitutes there were on average ten times more suspended solids in their effluent, leading to a substantial increase in sludge; whereas phosphate products were found to be less damaging in terms of eco-toxicity towards micro-organisms. Research by the Dutch Institute of Environmental Sciences showed that use of phosphate-free detergents resulted in no improvement in surface water quality and led to eutrification worse, in many cases, than that experienced when phosphate-based detergents are used. The reason for that is that the alternatives were found to be so toxic that they killed the vital zooplankton that feed on algae and phytoplankton in naturally balanced fresh water.</p>
<p class="contents">We have here a sensible proposal. I do not accept the amendments tabled by the Green Group, which go too far, not least on the somewhat absurd eco-labelling proposals. This is a measure we could have taken through in one reading. I wish it well and again congratulate our rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also believe that Mr Nobilia – whom I congratulate – has done an efficient job, as Mr Bowis, who spoke before me, has said, displaying great sensitivity, and that the result is positive for all the parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is extremely important that we realise – and of this I am absolutely convinced – that much more still remains to be done on environmental issues. I know that the European Union is the driving force in this matter, although phosphates, for example, have already been banned in a number of countries for some time. Italy is one of these countries, and while I was a member of the Italian parliament, when I was actually on the committee responsible, I helped to draw up legislative texts to that effect. I believe that the other countries, who have not yet adopted legislation to this effect, should align themselves as fast as possible, not just in order to employ and display greater sensitivity but so as to ensure that there is greater focus on environmental requirements and, moreover, to provide the consumer with more information.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with some of the objections raised in the House, including those raised by a Member from the Green Group, which, as usual, whenever it is not the instigator of proposals, sees only the negative points – a half-empty glass, so to speak – and not the positive points. I, however, feel that this regulation contains ever so many positive points, indeed where all parties are concerned, and, in my opinion, the question of toxicity tests is already addressed in the directive on hazardous substances, and so it is not necessary for those provisions to be duplicated in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to a question that has recently been raised by a number of experts and scientists: the increase of hormonal substances in our waters and the significant effects on the aquatic fauna, with fish changing sex and finding it difficult to reproduce. I believe this is a matter which warrants more attention in the future. Lastly, I feel that knowledge in a range of areas is necessary in order to be qualified to give an opinion on these matters. Just knowing how to use the washing machine is not enough. They affect all consumers, and, even though this regulation is somewhat technical in nature, it ultimately concerns all consumers, in other words all the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I have listened with great interest to the debate and taken note of the different concerns expressed. Perhaps I could group the questions around six groups of amendments on which I can comment one by one.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a number of the amendments seek to improve the wording of the Commission's text and can be accepted. I will enumerate them later.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a number of amendments have a link to other legislation. As regards animal testing, the aims of the Commission and the Parliament are the same. It is on how such aims are to be reflected in the legislation that we differ. The Commission cannot accept amendments that introduce policy statements that go beyond the scope of this proposal. Many substances and preparations are already adequately regulated by the horizontal chemicals legislation. It is unnecessary and undesirable to refer to them again in the detergents legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there seems to be a desire to bring forward measures on phosphates, anaerobic biodegradability and organic ingredients other than surfactants. The Commission is of the opinion that these are matters where the urgency for action is not so great as to preclude the establishment of a firm scientific base for legislation. The extension of biodegradability testing to all substances and preparations at this stage would be a disproportionate and unjustifiable measure. I will come back to phosphates later.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, on labelling – detergents legislation is supplementary to the horizontal chemicals legislation and must therefore be compatible with it. Cosmetics and detergents need to be, and are, separately legislated for. The comparison between a washing-up liquid, which is a detergent, and a chemically similar shampoo, a cosmetic, is a tempting one to make, but it is an exceptional case. No surfactant in an industrial detergent would ever be used in a cosmetic and no cosmetic surfactant would be of any use in a laundry detergent, let alone in an industrial detergent.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the ingredients data sheet is to provide information to those who need it, e.g. doctors who treat patients suffering from allergies. Manufacturers have a legitimate interest in ensuring that confidentiality is maintained. Member States also have the right to request ingredient information from manufacturers for use by their poison centres.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, on derogations. The introduction of a lifetime limit for manufacturers for submitting the additional data requested by the Member States is a good idea. According to our legal experts the criteria for refusing derogations must be explicitly stated in the text, otherwise a decision to refuse a derogation may not be enforceable in court. A minimum data set is necessary to evaluate the request for derogation; this is what we have specified in annex IV; if, in addition, further data is required by a Member State for an evaluation, it can request as much or as little as is needed. In this way we provide for a tiered approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally on phosphates. The Commission has promised in Recital 31 to take action on phosphates if there is a solid scientific basis for doing so. The Commission's priority in this matter is to establish a sound scientific basis for action at Community level. There is no urgent need at EU level on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Those Member States that feel particularly vulnerable to the environmental effects of phosphates have already taken national measures. In some cases this was done many years ago and the situation in those countries has stabilised. Any action at EU level needs to demonstrate clearly the added value of the present situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope to have a definitive opinion from the Scientific Committee on Toxicology, Eco-Toxicology and Environment on phosphates in detergents before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that the Commission can accept in whole or in part amendments 2, 4, 8, 17 to 19, 22 (partly), 27 (partly), 34 to 37 – but only a part of amendment 37 – and 53. The Commission can accept in principle amendments 3, 21, 31, 45, 46 and 52. The other amendments are not acceptable to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schörling (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span>  <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this draft Directive seeks to amend for the twenty-fifth time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations. Existing chemicals legislation states that, as soon as a substance or preparation has been classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, it must be included in this annex and not released onto the market. This proposal applies to 44 new substances which must be added to this list. I believe we are all agreed that that is a very good thing that this be done and that we must of course adopt the proposal to add these substances.</p>
<p class="contents">When Parliament debated this matter for the first time, we considered that there were two deficiencies in existing legislation that we very much wanted to remedy. We believed that we did not need to wait for the new chemicals legislation and wanted, for the sake of public health, to make amendments more promptly.</p>
<p class="contents">The first deficiency was that the use in consumer articles of CMR substances – carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction – was not prohibited. Articles of this kind include flooring, toys and textiles such as we come into contact with every day as consumers and which cause us genuinely to become exposed to these chemical compounds. We therefore wanted a ban. The second deficiency led to our naturally wanting a ban on the use of CMR products in cosmetics.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has since rejected Parliament’s amendments. Where cosmetic products are concerned, our proposal has however been accepted. At a conciliation, it was agreed to ban category 1 and category 2 CMR substances in the cosmetics directive when the seventh amendment was made. It can therefore be stated that Parliament’s proposal concerning cosmetic products has been accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">When it came to consumer articles, there were three main reasons why the Council wanted to reject Parliament’s amendments. Firstly, it believed that there were no relevant scientific evaluations or risk assessments. In fact, risk assessments have actually been carried out. There has also been a proposal from the Commission to the effect that, since the use of chemicals by consumers cannot be controlled, safety can only be ensured by prohibiting the general use of substances and preparations that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction.</p>
<p class="contents">In the committee’s and my own view, there is no reason not to make the same assessment in connection with the use of consumer articles. The argument does not, then, hang together in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Council referred to the fact that we are concerned here with a very large and unspecified number of products. As I see it, that is a completely baffling argument. It should be exactly the other way around. If there are now so many products containing, for example, carcinogenic substances, there is surely genuine reason to take action instead of merely saying that, because there are such a lot of products, nothing can be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Council stated that this issue will be addressed in the context of developing the new chemicals policy. That is very commendable, and I am really pleased about it. I believe that the proposal it may be possible to put before Parliament some time in June concerning the new chemicals legislation will also take these products into account. It will, however, take a very long time before that legislation comes into force, so it would have been helpful to have obtained this amendment at the present stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, at second reading, it might have been imagined that we should have tabled the same amendment. I have chosen, however, not to do so, and my colleagues in the committee were of the same view. We brought debate of this matter to a head when the twenty-third amendment was adopted following Mr Nisticò’s report. The same debate was conducted then, and it did not actually lead to anything. I have therefore chosen to recommend to Parliament that, on the grounds that we have had our proposals concerning cosmetic products accepted, it adopt this second-reading recommendation concerning the Council’s common position. We have come to the end of the road where the proposals relating to the second type of product are concerned. We must accept matters as they stand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aims of the proposed directive are to guarantee the free movement of chemical substances and preparations and to improve health protection and consumer safety by prohibiting the placing of CMR substances on the market for use by the general public. The proposed directive will accordingly introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">On 12 February 2002 the Commission proposed a directive which would update the existing list of CMR substances banned for consumer use by adding 44 further substances. By covering substances and preparations (such as glues, household cleaning products and paints) the Commission's proposal addresses the situations most likely to lead to exposure of consumers. This is the fifth time that the Commission has proposed such an update of the list of CMR substances. If risks of CMR substances in articles are identified, such uses are restricted separately on a case-by-case basis founded on risk assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Commission believes that its proposal not only provides for the protection of consumers' health, but also preserves the internal market by the introduction of harmonised rules. I would therefore ask for your support for the adoption of this important measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a step forward that 44 new substances recognised as CMRs have been added to the list of banned substances and are going to be removed from products and other uses within the Union. It is certainly a step forward in the protection of human health.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of cosmetics now appears to have been resolved and we can express ourselves satisfied with that agreement. Again, that is a significant step forward for the health of cosmetics users.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question of chemicals in products, I accept the view expressed in Parliament's report that we should start to look very closely at this issue. However, I agree with the Commission that this issue has much wider implications than simply controlling 44 chemicals in our existing proposal and their potential dangers. It is now clear that this issue is going to be addressed in the new forthcoming chemicals policy. We can therefore express ourselves satisfied that we have made good progress on this proposal and we can look to pick up the issue of chemicals in products, and a range of other issues, when we address the chemicals policy proposal that we understand the Commission will be publishing for wider consultation on 7 May. I expect we can start work on that in the autumn of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I commend this proposal and its results to the House and look forward to continuing our constructive dialogue and work with the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have received proposals from Member States and NGOs for action to deal with this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We are currently supporting initiatives in the context of the International Coffee Organisation, the platform for dialogue between the coffee-exporting and -importing countries, in both the public and the private sectors. We are supporting the ICO coffee resolution 407 and requested the European Coffee Federation to conduct independent monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also taken up the issue of ICO membership with the United States. As proposed by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 19 November 2002, we have requested the ICO to undertake a worldwide comparative analysis of coffee growing areas. In the ICO, this initiative is greatly supported by the coffee producing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact the problem is not just coffee. It concerns many other commodities and commodity-dependent countries. We should therefore not look at coffee as a stand-alone issue. We are in favour of a long-term and coherent strategy to address the problems of commodity-dependent countries, building on extensive ongoing efforts. Falling and volatile prices are indeed a major threat to the sustainable development of some of the poorest countries in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The long-term solution is twofold: since traditional commodities remain the major source of employment, income and foreign exchange for many developing countries, efforts must include making the traditional commodity sectors more competitive. On the other hand, alternative non-traditional product chains must also be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Two recent communications from the Commission, on rural development and on trade and development, provide a clear policy framework to address the problem of commodity dependence. In view of this we are not yet convinced that there is a need for a separate communication on the issue, as some have been suggesting. We are currently finalising an analytical working document on the major challenges relating to commodities. Several of the issues in the European Parliament resolution are being analysed. Following discussions on this analytical working document, we will judge the need for a separate communication.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been calls for action on trade policy. However, there is limited room for manoeuvre. Most coffee-dependent countries are least developed countries or part of the ACP group. With the Everything But Arms initiative, the Community has opened up all markets to the least developed countries, and we will seek to get other countries – developed and developing – to follow our example. ACP countries also have very high levels of access to the EU market under existing agreements, and access will increase under the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, market access alone is not enough. To improve the competitiveness of the coffee sector and broaden the export base in developing countries, we also need to support the full integration of commodity issues into the long-term development strategies of the developing countries. As mentioned in the EP resolution, efforts should include support to producer efforts in diversification, organisational strengthening and tapping into niche markets. Future economic partnership agreements with the ACP, as well as comprehensive and coherent development assistance, would be very helpful in supporting the implementation of the strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Direct intervention in commodity markets through price support or stock destruction does not offer a sustainable solution. Furthermore, the Cotonou Agreement includes a facility which can be used to mitigate the adverse effects of fluctuations of ACP countries' export earnings – the FLEX system. Countries whose export earnings are being hit by falling prices of coffee or other commodities can apply for compensatory financing under this measure, and some have already done so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains open to proposals for action from all actors. We will attend the forthcoming ICO/World Bank round table and the subsequent ICO/Council meeting in London, and look forward to a positive and constructive discussion that will improve the situation of coffee farmers and labourers in developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wijkman (PPE-DE).</span></span>    <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Liikanen for his introductory speech. Just as he says, the price of coffee has fallen dramatically in recent years. We now have the lowest real price in decades, and it does not seem especially likely that prices will increase in the foreseeable future. The price of the raw material itself is at present approximately just one per cent of the price on the market. An ordinary coffee planter in Tanzania or Kenya earns at best a few euros per week. That means that he or she – it is often women, by the way, who work on the coffee plantations – would have to labour for a week or more in order to afford a single cup of coffee in a bar here in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Until the end of the Cold War, prices were reassuringly maintained. You could survive on planting coffee. Developments in recent years have, however, been devastating. Competition has become tougher. Just one of many reasons for this is that the World Bank has helped new countries outside Africa to organise large-scale coffee planting. As so often, subsidies – however important they may appear in individual cases – have dealt a blow to prices and, in that way, damaged the prospects of survival for millions of small coffee planters, especially in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The collapse in coffee prices has led to a major crisis for tens of millions of coffee planters in dozens of developing countries, where coffee is not only an important source of jobs and income in the countryside, but also of currency income.</p>
<p class="contents">One problem in this connection – also addressed by Mr Liikanen – is that cultivation is too often unbalanced, and this naturally exacerbates the consequences of the crisis. As long as small coffee planters are dependent upon just a single crop, their economic situation is, and will remain, incredibly precarious. It would therefore seem incredibly important to diversify production, and there are opportunities for doing this that have not been made use of. This presupposes, however, the adoption of a comprehensive approach to the system of cultivation. I shall not attempt a more detailed scientific analysis, but allow me to give an example. The coffee bush cannot at present be used for animal feed. It contains caffeine, which animals cannot tolerate. What is interesting, however, is that it is possible to cultivate excellent, nutritious mushrooms from the remnants of the coffee bush. These mushrooms, for example shitaki mushrooms, are of high nutritional value and produce a much higher price per kilo on the market than coffee does. Once the mushrooms have done their job and soaked up the caffeine, the remnants may be used as animal feed. Suddenly, the indigent coffee planter has several different sources of income and more work opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Worthwhile projects are under way at present, for example in Colombia, to promote a broader view of the cultivation system. As everyone without exception will surely appreciate, this presupposes, however, knowledge derived from a variety of research disciplines and not a one-sided focus upon a single crop.</p>
<p class="contents">In common with Commissioner Liikanen, I too do not believe there are quick and simple solutions. The issue must nonetheless be addressed, and this must happen immediately within the framework of the whole Doha process and, above all, within the framework of our continued cooperation with those countries within our immediate purview.</p>
<p class="contents">As our resolution intimates, a long list of measures may be taken in the short term, especially to help those coffee planters who have ended up in this very problematic situation. It should be possible to make use of the major surpluses within the European Development Fund to step up our efforts in the field of rural development – rural development that would then become more diversified in form than it would by focusing solely upon individual crops. Through dialogue with the big coffee producers and retailers, it should also be possible to ensure that better wagers are paid to the indigent coffee planters.</p>
<p class="contents">I have only had time to touch upon just a few aspects of this issue. I would thank Mr Liikanen for his contribution, and I look forward to continued dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock, Glenys (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, last week in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly we unanimously adopted a resolution on coffee. We called for urgent measures to alleviate the impact of commodity price instability in ACP countries. We have joined a chorus of voices from the Spanish parliament, the US Senate and the House of Representatives that are demanding change.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty-seven ACP countries are dependent on coffee. It is that background knowledge, which the Commissioner outlined, that explains why it is so serious that world coffee prices have crashed by more than 60% in the last decade. Today, Parliament, in its resolution, calls for action. The international community, including the EU, has a responsibility now to address the collapse of world coffee prices and to alleviate that terrible suffering which Mr Wijkman talked about – 25 million coffee-dependent poor farmers and the communities in which they live.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU boasts about having a trade and aid approach to international solidarity. Indeed that is something we aim to do and we also have the necessary policy instruments. The EU Member States make up 15 of the 21 importing country members of the International Coffee Organisation. That makes us a key player in the market and with key responsibilities to the coffee-producing countries. We welcome the fact that in November the Council gave serious consideration to this issue of coffee dependency. However, since then very little has happened, in spite of the fact that the Commission has joined and echoed that support for an ICO quality programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner mentioned the communication, which clearly is not now going to be on the table in time for the ICO and world high-level round-table meeting in London. We called for that in our resolution and we regret that it clearly is not going to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, despite the state of the market, the coffee companies are doing very well, thank you. In the free market their global reach gives them unprecedented options. Ten years ago coffee-producing countries received around one-third of every dollar spent on coffee. Now it is less than eight cents. Last year in Uganda I met a farmer who was selling a kilogram of her coffee beans for 150 Ugandan shillings. Later on I paid <span class="italic">1 000</span> Ugandan shillings in the Sheraton Hotel for just one cup of coffee! The four big companies together buy almost half the coffee beans produced around the world. The roaster companies must take greater responsibility for paying farmers a fair price for what they grow, to enable them to send their children to school, pay for health care and just put food on the table. There is terrible human suffering at the heart of the coffee business and we must put pressure on the companies to do more and care more. The EU has real authority in the ICO and we have a responsibility in the round-table meeting to hammer out policies which will give the farmers an opportunity to live their lives with dignity and financial security.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to know whether the Commission is preparing a specific action plan for this meeting, because just turning up simply will not be enough. We want a statement and an action plan. I also want to know – and that again is in our resolution – whether we will be sending a high-level representative. Is the Commissioner going? Is the Director-General going? At what level will the European Union be represented in order that we can have a clear and ambitious action plan? Then we can all continue to enjoy an excellent cup of the world's most popular drink – coffee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rod (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the coffee market is currently undergoing a serious crisis. Coffee sector workers are no longer able to make a living from production. Market prices, set by the four main multinationals, which make indecent profits, are too low to allow farmers to make the profits they need in order to continue their activity. Furthermore, as the coffee is being produced at too high a yield, its very quality is declining.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the absence of an international system to stabilise coffee prices and prices of raw materials in general, the situation of coffee farmers is not viable. We must put an end to this spiral of productivism, which, in defiance of any social or environmental legislation, is leading to poverty for millions of farmers in poor countries. Some might say it is simply a coincidence that this crisis is taking place now that the Stabex system has disappeared from the Cotonou agreement. The new rapid payment system, furthermore, makes it impossible to help coffee-producing countries. As the main importer of coffee, the European Union bears the main responsibility in resolving this crisis. The European Union must set up an urgent programme, financed with the funds remaining from previous EDFs, in order to make up the shortfall in revenue of the people and countries concerned. We call on the Commission to produce a communication on basic products as a matter of urgency. Similarly, the Commission must support the International Coffee Organisation’s quality-improvement programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In the longer term, the European Union must implement, for example within the framework of national and regional development plans, a range of measures designed to combat the volatility of coffee prices and prices of other basic products. The European Union must support diversification in Southern farmers’ production and high-quality agriculture, and contribute to increasing the power of coffee farmers against the agri-foods industries. In particular, the Commission must support the establishment of fair trade structures and facilitate market access for fair trade products. A Commission communication on this matter is becoming increasingly necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter of stabilising prices for raw materials, upon which the majority of the least developed countries depend, must be approached in the context of multilateral trade negotiations. The ‘development round’ instigated at Doha seems particularly appropriate, if we want developing countries to benefit genuinely from world trade, which is currently more to their disadvantage. The customs tariffs that are still in force for coffee products must therefore be removed. The European Union must use all its power at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun to ensure that trade with developing countries becomes fairer. Furthermore, we welcome the French proposal to add the matter of raw materials to the agenda for the next G8 summit.</p>
<p class="contents">As major coffee companies, Nestlé, Kraft, Sara Lee and Procter and Gamble cannot continue to get away with lining their pockets. They must agree to adopt codes of ethical practice in agreement with the ILO and the UN and pay a fair price for raw materials, a price that reflects the social and environmental costs of coffee–growing and production. If farmers and workers in the coffee sector are to receive fair remuneration, fair trade is not just another option but the only sustainable global solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the contrary, it is those who are putting such pressure on prices that farmers are scarcely earning anything from the coffee they produce.</p>
<p class="contents">How can they get away with it? At a meeting in the European Parliament to debate the coffee crisis, Louis Belinda from Uganda gave the following answer. ‘We have no alternative to coffee growing,’ he said. ‘We have given fisheries a try, but EU regulations prevented that. We have experimented with traditional agriculture, but EU exports of meat and milk at dumping prices mean that we cannot even sell our goods to other African countries. We have had a go with sugar, but the EU’s export subsidy did not give us a chance.’</p>
<p class="contents">It is, then, not true, Commissioner Liikanen, that everything but arms solves the problem, for the EU’s agricultural policy destroys coffee growers’ ability to diversify into other forms of work. The EU is therefore largely responsible for the fact that 25 million coffee growers are now threatened with extreme poverty, all the more so because the EU itself gave the developing countries the fatal advice to pin their hopes on coffee production. The EU must and shall fulfil its responsibilities in this area. The Development Fund has a surplus of DKK 7 500 million, so why does the EU hesitate to act while the coffee growers go hungry?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wijkman had a solution involving mushrooms. I think that idea sounded very interesting, and I hope the Commission will look into it.</p>
<p class="contents">The coffee growers must, however, be guaranteed a minimum income here and now. That could happen by subsidising institutions such as the Max Havelaar one, but the EU should also, as quickly as possible, increase the coffee producers’ own influence on the market by strengthening their negotiating capacity – through supporting the development of cooperatives – and by giving them the opportunity to come up with better products and to be given access to credits.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite immoral that the international coffee giants can be allowed to exploit the crisis in order further to increase their surpluses, which are already too high.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like some answers to the questions put by Mrs Kinnock. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coffee is one of the basic products that constitute exports, and for many poor, heavily indebted countries, it is the main source of income. Countries such as Burundi, Ethiopia and Uganda rely on coffee exports for more than 50% of their income.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of the world coffee market, therefore, is not a secondary, minor issue. It is at the very heart of world injustice, which condemns millions of people to poverty and distress. In this regard, the coffee crisis is clear proof of the failure of the world policy of aggravated liberalisation and prioritising market forces. In fact, it is the international institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF and the WTO that encourage these countries to follow an economic policy oriented towards the external market. Suffocated by debt and subject to the orders of the IMF, which can sometimes act as the world moneylender, these countries throw themselves wholeheartedly into production in sectors in which they possess a relative advantage in relation to the developed countries. In the case of coffee, this advantage is favourable climatic conditions. The WTO then promises them free access to the world market. Due to the law of supply and demand, however, market value is unstable and, when prices fall, the multinationals that control the market take steps to preserve their profit margins. The entire drop in the market value is therefore passed on to small farmers and plantation workers, so much so that consumers in developed countries do not even see a drop in the price of their cup of coffee. Not to mention working conditions for women and child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">This has been proven. An end to world injustice cannot be achieved by greater liberalisation, more free trade or increased deregulation – quite the opposite. What coffee farmers need is an international coffee market that is regulated to a greater degree, to prevent overproduction taking hold, so that the quality of products is guaranteed and controlled, so that profits in this sector are divided fairly and so that decent working conditions are guaranteed. Let us hope that we remember this lesson at the next round table of the International Coffee Organisation, at the next G8 summit and, most importantly, at the next WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun in September. We shall continue to be extremely vigilant, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How could we fail to be aware of this since these prices are the lowest in real terms that have been recorded for the past century? All the political groupings are aware of the disastrous impact that this fall in coffee prices will have on the economy of a number of the poorest countries in the world. At the same time, however, we are all raising our hands to the heavens as a sign of impotence and proposing that a particular international summit should add the issue to the agenda, and giving good advice on retraining or diversification, and proposing lessons in popularisation for the peasants we are suffocating, and we are calling for a little something to be released to help the worst affected countries.</p>
<p class="contents">However, four international trusts, – Nestlé, Kraft, Sara Lee and Procter and Gamble – control half of all world coffee sales. In other words, this means that prices are established by these four trusts. They are the ones that reduce the price paid to farmers in order to make ever-increasing profits. In order to pay greater dividends to their shareholders, they bring hardship to dozens of poor countries and therefore to tens of millions of peasants and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">I have observed that the European Parliament and the Heads of State are powerless to stop these four trusts and, instead, merely call for charity. The common resolution, however, dares to recommend an increase in the power of coffee farmers on the market. As if poor peasants in Rwanda, Ethiopia or Haiti could oppose Nestlé and its counterparts, when the European Parliament does not dare to do so! If that is not hypocritical, I do not know what it is. The simple fact that the common resolution mentions the four coffee trusts responsible for price reductions makes the representatives of the ELDR group’s skin crawl, so much so that they are calling for the paragraph that mentions the trusts to be deleted. Go ahead and conceal the names of these trusts, since I cannot bear to look at them! Parliament is full of hypocrites!</p>
<p class="contents">What is true for coffee is also true for the other raw materials, particularly oil. Those who have bombed Iraq, killing civilians, women and children claim they are doing so in order to free Iraq from its dictator. Saddam Hussein, however, who butchered his own people, was their henchman for years. They are the ones who provided him with weapons and encouraged him in the war against Iran. They are the ones who sold him weapons to massacre and gas the Kurds, and people have the gall to present the invading troops as liberators when all they are doing is carrying out the dirty work of the oil and weapons trusts.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to put an end to this pillaging of the planet to increase the wealth of a few trusts, in order to put an end to the flagrant inequality between the wealthy in wealthy countries and the poor in poor countries, and in order to prevent the poor being starved to death or being massacred in wars designed to preserve this situation, we have absolutely no other option but to put an end to the international economic system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Speaking towards the end of this debate it is inevitable that I will repeat many of the themes that my colleagues have already raised here this morning. However, that demonstrates the strength and the unity of concern in this Parliament about this issue and our serious determination to do something more about it. The current situation where coffee prices are the lowest in real terms for at least 100 years, leaves, as others have said, more than 25 million poor families facing ruin, unable to put enough food on the table, unable to send their children to school, unable to buy the most basic medicines. At the same time four companies control over half of world coffee sales and their revenues have been spiralling upwards to over USD 100 billion a year, at the same time as some of the poorest families in the world have seen their incomes disappear into nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House often face disasters with feelings of hopelessness, of powerlessness; we wonder what can we do about this and we cannot necessarily think of anything. However, on this occasion it is very different: there is plenty the European Union could and should be doing to address this particular issue. The EU has the resources and the policies to make a positive difference to these families, as well as the responsibility to do so. EU Member States account for 15 of the 21 importing country members of the International Coffee Organisation. We account for almost half of all the world's coffee imports. That gives us enormous potential leverage, and we should be using it. All that seems to be lacking right now is the political will, and the Commission should be demonstrating an awareness of greater urgency and more obvious commitment to do something about it as the crisis in the world coffee market escalates into an international disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">So we look forward to this communication on commodities which the Commission has promised. We also want to see some more immediate measures. We welcome Commissioner Nielson's commitment, in November of last year, to examine the possibilities of freeing up and reallocating old EDF money. We have EUR 11 billion in unspent commitments from the sixth, seventh and eighth EDFs. This gives us the resources to make a real difference, and we should focus on quick-dispersing initiatives which are designed to provide decentralised budget support to coffee-growing areas, to ameliorate the effects of the coffee crisis on access to health care and education. We need to provide additional financial support to ACP governments, commensurate to the revenue that they are losing from the current coffee crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also needs to give greater support to fair-traded coffee and better access for such coffee to EU markets. Equally significantly, the issue of coffee illustrates the wider issues of commodities prices and the collapse of those prices. Why is that issue not on the WTO agenda? Many people criticise the WTO as having an agenda that is focussed towards the North and not the South. The fact that commodity prices are not on the agenda underlines that perception. I would like to ask the Commissioner this: will the Commission support the proposal of East Africa to place commodities on the next WTO agenda in Cancun, so that we can demonstrate that this so-called Doha development round is more than just rhetoric, it is action as well? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The North exploits monocultures and, in order to put itself at an advantage, helps itself to the raw materials they produce, at minimum prices, under the most adverse conditions, and in a poverty-stricken environment. Consumers' spending habits and consumer policy within the European Union also have to be borne in mind here.</p>
<p class="contents">Policies support the consumers' desire for raw materials from developing countries at the lowest possible prices, whilst our own agricultural policies are defended with extraordinary vigour and – I am still being polite – we concentrate on keeping prices stable. It is inevitable that such an incongruity must come to an end, and this must form part of an action plan on the part of the European Union. In essence, economic relations are limited to the exploitation of raw materials, coffee being only one example of this, whilst these materials are processed and utilised, thus acquiring added value through the production process, within the industrialised countries. For as long as this incongruity persists, the economic relationship between the countries of the North and of the South will be beset by constant problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk about diversification, and rightly too, for this is an important requirement, but it must also be given substance. It is not enough to consider this concept in isolation and see it as the cure for all ills. We must also ask what shape this diversification is to take, and let me make clear that this will involve the possibility of raw materials being processed in the developing country in which they were produced, where, at the very least, semi-manufactured goods should also be produced, for these are the means by which added value is created. This will also involve willingness on our part to pay a proper price for them. Where, for example, in the European Union's institutions, can you find fairly traded coffee?</p>
<p class="contents">Where, too, in the political institutions of our Member States? In which of this Parliament's bars and restaurants is fairly traded coffee served? I could give any number of examples.</p>
<p class="contents">Any action plan by the Commission must of necessity include a proposal as to how goods can be fairly traded under present conditions. I cannot see that there is a conclusive concept for this, one that would right now allow the farmers a truly fair share in their products if the existing fair trade infrastructure were to be put to use and extended. In this area, we owe a debt to the developing countries. I very much hope that this will meet with a response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will, however, make a few comments.</p>
<p class="contents">You must remember that the real problem with the coffee sector is the lack of demand. The supply is essentially about the demand, and for that reason trade negotiations are not the only solution. It is very important that discussions in the World Bank/ICO context, or in ICO itself, lead to solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's problem is that the United States, which is the second biggest coffee consumer, is outside the ICO. Unless the US is ready to reconsider its position in the context of ICO, then the measures will not have the same international impact.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the proposal for an action plan before the next meeting and the level of Commission participation are concerned, I will pass Mrs Kinnock's questions to Mr Lamy and Mr Nielson. I am sure they will reply accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If nobody in the European Parliament wishes to defend human cloning, we cannot resolve this issue by the back door, in other words by the roundabout means of a recital or article referring to another subject. In particular, we cannot erect Community barriers to research into embryonic stem cells. If some States wish to ban this kind of research at national level, they are free to do so and do not require an authorisation from the European Parliament.

Even scientific research to this end was to be banned. This position was rejected by the United Left, the Social Democrats and the Liberals. It nonetheless secured a majority because the Greens supported the Christian Democrats. My party too, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, is not in the least enthusiastic about the therapeutic cloning of people. Commercial and industrial cloning or cloning to create people with certain characteristics are also unacceptable to us. But a solution must be found for people who need a new heart, kidney or liver and also for Parkinson’s disease sufferers. This time Mr Liese has steered a slightly more middle course and made agreements with the Social Democrats. Although this compromise can now secure a broad majority, I do not support it. It is now above all a question of centralising all the decisions at EU level, and making them uniform, at the expense of the freedom of the Member States. This proposal provides too few solutions and too many prohibitions. This will prevent Member States from adopting a vanguard position in the difficult search for solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am talking about the voluntary and unpaid donation of stem cells removed from human embryos and the use of these cells. On the first issue, I believe that, in order to prevent the commercialisation of the human body, we must do more than simply recommend to the Member States that they promote voluntary and unpaid donation. The directive must state, quite unequivocally, that the donation of tissue or cells can only be done out of the donor's free will and always without payment, except possibly for compensation to reimburse travel expenses or light refreshments. On the second issue, – embryonic stem cells – I believe the directive must be cautious, on the one hand obliging Member States to ban both reproductive and therapeutic cloning, but must allow Member States, on the other, to take the decision on whether or not to permit research into supernumerary embryos, that is, embryos created for the purposes of <span class="italic">in vitro</span> fertilisation but which can no longer be implanted into the genetic parents and are therefore frozen and condemned to be destroyed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not say a word about the fact that collective expulsions are prohibited by the European Convention on Human Rights and by the Charter on Fundamental Rights, thus assuming that the national police services respect the individual rights of immigrants.

Furthermore, the way in which it is addressing this so-called ‘coexistence’ between the two forms of crop owes more to economic factors than to anything else. This contamination is uncontrollable. Look at the experience of the USA or Canada and of the countries that are obliged to introduce GMOs, through food aid, making States’ food policies and farmers dependent on the huge food-producing multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">This report addresses the issue of seeds, which underpin all agricultural production. Their contamination involves upstream contamination, thereby eventually preventing any mix of organic and conventional farming. This report represents ‘the lesser evil’, given that the rapporteur’s amendments are concerned with the contamination of seeds by GMOs and with setting the minimum technically detectible quantity as a threshold for the adventitious presence of GMOs. Although this is a step backwards, it is a way of facing up to the pressures of the multinationals and to the Commission’s attempts to increase these thresholds, which would make the presence of GMOs more widespread, which would be incompatible with the precautionary principle and with ensuring that consumers have food that is genuinely ‘free’ of GMOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, this proposal for a recommendation is a consequence of the rejection of the Danish and Greek initiatives and is the corollary to the purely imaginary exercise and the game of make-believe that both rapporteurs have been peddling. It is worth pointing out why they considered these initiatives to be misguided, and this is because, for example, they think it would be a mistake to adopt amendments to the Europol Convention ‘prior to the ratification of the European Constitution’! They are consequently now proposing that this area, which falls under the second pillar, should be transferred to the sphere of Community competence, or the first pillar, thereby ‘communitarising’ it.

It requests the reform of the United Nations Conventions on drugs and other narcotics, as they are considered to be too severe and repressive, in particular for cannabis users. The desired objective is a free, liberalised drug market and decriminalised drug use. How can we fail to be shocked and horrified by such suggestions? How can we fail to realise that the damage caused by drug consumption and consumption of other psychotropic substances is increasingly significant in terms of crime, trafficking and death? How can we fail to accept the fact that drug consumption increases exponentially with tolerance? In this regard, I would like to congratulate my Finnish colleague, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström, who has bravely taken a stance in favour of a zero tolerance policy with regard to drugs. This is clearly the only responsible attitude to adopt on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not touch the international conventions that lay down rules and principles relating to the fight against drugs. Policy on combating drug consumption and trafficking must remain the responsibility of the Member States. In particular, it is not Europe’s role to decree, on the basis of scientific studies, which are only of value until the next studies that contradict them, that smoking cannabis is a good thing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would therefore be wonderful if drugs did not exist or if no one had any need of them. The reality is unfortunately different. International agreements that oblige states to apply zero tolerance are not going to produce a drugs-free world. Many young people experience the use of soft drugs as an inalienable freedom and there are also profiteers who happily make people dependent on the use of expensive hard drugs. A ban on soft drugs simply leads to young people rebelling and eases their move onto the use of hard drugs. I defend the Dutch system not because I am seeking a high point of individual freedom, but because it helps prevent insoluble problems. My Group of the European United Left has introduced two extremes to this debate. Mrs Schröder is making herself the mouthpiece of rebellious youth and defending total freedom without any regulation by government. Mr Alyssandrakis as a traditional Communist can see only dangerous drugs barons who must be mercilessly eliminated. Both are telling part of the truth, but saying nothing about the rest. Mrs Buitenweg’s report proposes a good middle way, one with which we in the Netherlands have acquired good experience. I have supported this way thus far and will continue to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One only has to recall that 50% of Europeans is ignorant of, or indifferent to, the Union and that the rate of turnout in elections to the European Parliament fell from 63% in 1979 to 49% in 1999. This information deficit contributes to creating a veritable gulf between European citizens and Community Institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the context that forms the backdrop to the European Commission’s strategy for information and communication in the EU. Access to information is crucial to the full exercise of European citizenship. For this reason, effective information policy must be based on the ‘assertion of its common values’ such as democracy, pluralism, cultural diversity, cohesion and solidarity. More important still is to show, by giving practical examples, the everyday advantages gained from joining the EU, such as the euro, citizenship and freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to improve the effectiveness of EU information campaigns, every message must be clear, impartial, accessible and available in every citizen’s own language.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, information campaigns must be coordinated at Community level, by the European institutions, thereby better enabling needs to be identified. At the same time, however, such campaigns must be decentralised to national and regional level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Impartiality and doctrinal pluralism are the main victims of this propagandist form of ‘information’, which is clearly discriminatory, frequently confusing electoral propaganda with information about the institutions. The fact that the citizens have little knowledge of the EU and feel relatively uninvolved with it (according to Eurobarometer) clearly demonstrates the failure of this strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the Euro campaign, by way of contrast, proves that it is practical issues, consistent actions and the dissemination of tangible instruments that promote European integration – not the demand for ‘a common cultural basis’ or the artificial injection of ‘a sense of belonging’. Along the same practical and effective lines, the report urges the Council to open to the public meetings in which it exercises legislative powers and regrets the fact that the Commission is still not setting an example for respecting linguistic diversity on many websites ...</p>

In federations many powers are in the hands of the individual states, but only the federation decides on foreign policy and defence. On the other hand the EU Member States have so far retained their own ministers of Foreign Affairs, their own embassies, their separate seats at the United Nations and their armies. This contrast is causing some Members of this Parliament to start working towards a single EU representative on the Security Council and a single European army, with a view to becoming the second world superpower alongside the United States of America. Not a superpower opposed to the US, but an ally of equal standing that can intervene in the rest of the world together with the US. My party, the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, considers this a mistaken development. The EU will do better to concern itself with the resolution of cross-border problems within Europe and keeping control of large international concerns that take no account of the interests and the democratic rights of the vast majority of people. In a military context Europe should confine itself to the defence of its own territory, purely humanitarian aid outside Europe and if necessary peacekeeping assistance at the request of all the parties concerned in candidate countries, as is happening now in Macedonia. Anything that goes beyond this I reject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should also remember Parliament’s silence on the tripartite summit between France, Germany and Russia, which begins tomorrow in St Petersburg with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Is this silence because the summit concerns an intergovernmental initiative and is therefore ideologically unsound? If Parliament was genuinely concerned, however, as it claims, about seeing Europe exert its own substantial diplomatic influence in the period following the war, it would have to attach greater importance to the St Petersburg Summit than to the next European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we should remember doubling financial aid to Turkey, probably in order to thank Ankara for its refusal to end the occupation of Cyprus by its troops. Aid should not be linked to accession, as Parliament has done, but to a constructive attitude on Turkey’s part making it possible to achieve a reunited Cyprus before the entry of Nicosia into the Union. If we had done this, we would have made a practical contribution towards European security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very glad that this issue is on today's agenda. I worked, for a time, as a doctor in Guatemala, and myself became familiar with the situation in that country. The greatest problem in Guatemala was then – and still is – the extreme disparity between wealth and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Being a Christian Democrat, I certainly am not among those who leap to the defence of tax increases. In Europe and in my own country too, taxes are certainly too high, but the situation in Guatemala is that the rich simply do not see themselves as being under any obligation to contribute to the country's development. That is why we have incorporated into the Joint Resolution a passage intended to ensure that the necessary adjustments are made, as it is necessary also to draw upon the financial resources of the wealthy in a given country for such purposes as the improvement of its educational systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of land and of the way in which it is shared out is without doubt a key to future development in Guatemala and in its neighbouring countries, and, at the end of 2002, MEPs belonging to different groups organised a conference on the subject. What I learned from this conference was that it is possible to reach the same objective without resorting to inflammatory language, and for that reason, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has not used the term ‘agricultural reform’, opting instead for an expression that, although rather more unwieldy, has found its way into the Joint Resolution, simply in order to avoid provoking counter-reactions that would then get us no nearer our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that is very important – and I am glad that it has been incorporated into the Joint Resolution – is that any policy must have education and training as one of its basic components. It is no use simply giving people a plot of land; they also have to know how to cultivate it. Taken as a whole, the Joint Resolution is an even-handed compromise, and it is out of conviction that we support it.</p>

We are after all convinced that the extreme poverty of the rural population that has to make a living from survival agriculture makes this the poorest population in the world. The rural population, which in Guatemala largely consists of the indigenous population, is unfortunately no exception to this. That is why it is of the utmost importance that each of the sentences in this resolution is considered very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have the time to go into each of these aspects in depth, but it is clear that in these circumstances land reform is necessary, even if that word is taboo. It is the indigenous population that is clearly suffering most and that has no access to healthy food, that has no access to a good education and that has no access to land. The women are the biggest victims of all because they simply do not count, although in many cases it is they who have to provide alone for very large, extended families.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a wave of human rights violations at the moment and people in the country are acting with complete impunity. In these circumstances there are good reasons to recall the ratification of membership of the International Criminal Court and we would also like to insist on the abolition of the death penalty. All this to underline that just one of the countries for which we had some hope a few years ago is threatening to slip back into a state of impunity again, the agreements of 1996 remaining a dead letter.</p>
<p class="contents">We donate quite a lot of money to cooperation with these countries in Latin America. Let us ensure that our international agreements, which come down to our aid and our cooperation having first to be for the benefit of the poorest, actually make this possible and that the government is obliged to lend its assistance in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, MINUGUA, the United Nations Mission to Guatemala admits the agreements are stalled. Regression has even been noted in some cases.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Liese rightly pointed out, the House has been addressed by small farmers from Guatemala and by representatives of the institutions in that country. It was stated clearly that some of this regression involved the murder of small farmers or threats against them. The rights of the indigenous people are again being violated. The judiciary lacks the means to administer justice. Even the National Coordinator for indigenous peoples and small farmers has denounced the lack of security regarding land.</p>
<p class="contents">We were therefore requested to ensure that the peace agreements are put firmly back on track when the next advisory group meeting is held in May of this year. Renewed effort is called for on the part of the European Commission to promote the peace agreements. This is especially urgent in certain basic areas such as the fight against impunity, appropriate fiscal reform and the fight against poverty. More work is also needed on land distribution, together with a law on registration and land registry information. These were the main points agreed during the seminar Mr Liese mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recent history shows us that, ever since the murder, in the seventies, of the German ambassador Graf Spreti, who was a diplomat and politician of note, this region of Central America has repeatedly found itself under the spotlight of European and German public opinion and was battered by one crisis after another, to which any response came too late. We were always too late in responding to the bloody acts of violence, to the revolutions, and to the terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">So I thank Mr Liese and all the others who have taken the initiative in putting forward this masterpiece of pre-emptive diplomacy, a brief resolution which, for the first time, is not a reaction to a crisis of the sort with which we are familiar in our debates on topical and urgent matters – although there is of course an acute crisis going on. Primarily, though, this is about prevention, and, moreover, prevention through action rather than through words.</p>
<p class="contents">It gets right to the core issues, these being the whole area of agriculture and the reforms that it needs. Secondly, it turns to economic reform and the area of fiscal legislation, which really is bizarre. The crucial thing is that it also embeds the peace process, to which the European Union can make a substantial contribution by supporting and setting up dialogue, as well, of course, as in the field of economic cooperation and development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful for this initiative. It is my belief that the real task of this House is not always to merely condemn, but to actively endeavour to devise strategies for minimising disasters, or averting them completely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission is monitoring very closely the situation in Guatemala, where, as a number of speakers have said this afternoon, mounting infringements of the rule of law and human rights, as well as the deepening polarisation within Guatemalan society, are causing increasing political and social tension on the eve of the 2003 elections.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, difficult access to food, extreme poverty and social protest are increasingly alarming issues. Within this unfortunate and unhappy scenario, in line with the resolution on Guatemala that the European Parliament issued in April 2002, the Commission is reinforcing the political dialogue and cooperation initiatives. Our objective is to encourage the Guatemalan institutions and society to relaunch a national agenda based on the peace accords, good governance and the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the political dialogue, the Commission and the Member States constantly remind the Guatemalan public institutions of the importance of respecting the dignity and securing the wellbeing of all Guatemalan people on the basis of the principles of democracy, equality, non-discrimination and social justice. During the last months, the Commission has also participated in various EU actions to transmit to the Supreme Court of Justice and the local authorities our preoccupation about the increasing wave of threats, attacks and violence in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">In May 2002 the Commission adopted a strategy for cooperation with Guatemala during the period 2002 to 2006. That strategy is aimed at sustaining the peace accords and breaking the cycle of poverty and exclusion that affects the country. The strategy was established with the large-scale participation of the Guatemalan Government, Member States and local and European civil society. It will focus on three main areas: first, consolidation of the rule of law and protection of human rights; secondly, local and rural development based on participation, inclusion and equity; and thirdly, equitable economic growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">The indicative financial resources are EUR 93 million for the period 2002 to 2006. It is also worth mentioning that Guatemala is a priority country under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of Parliament will know, there will be a further Consultative Group meeting scheduled in Guatemala City for 13 and 14 May 2003. At that meeting the Commission and Member States will urge the Guatemalan authorities and society to renew efforts to accelerate the implementation of the Peace Agenda signed in 1996, especially in those areas where unsatisfactory results have been registered so far, such as the justice system, rural development, and the situation of the indigenous people. We shall also ask for the allocation of adequate budgetary resources for social expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission stands ready to support Guatemala in monitoring the next electoral process and guaranteeing a transparent and democratic transfer of power – as it did for the last elections in 1999. During his visit to Brussels in January 2003 Minister Gutiérrez, asked for the support of the European Union. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal has also asked for our support. The Commission and Member States will decide whether to prepare an EU electoral observation mission on the basis of an exploratory mission that will be sent in May 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He also stated that hundreds of his fellow citizens had been imprisoned for claiming and defending those rights. The situation in Cuba remains unchanged. Amongst those arrested and sentenced in the last wave of repression are human rights defenders and peaceful dissidents. Many of them were members of the Christian Liberation Movement, and involved in the Varela Project. Independent journalists such as Raúl Rivero were also targeted. This gentleman is 57 years of age and received a 20-year prison sentence. Others sentenced include Omar Rodríguez, a photographer, who received a 27-year sentence and another journalist, Víctor Rolando Arroyo, sentenced to 26 years in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is no accident that Cuba is the only Latin American country not linked to the European Union by virtue of an association or cooperation agreement. These regrettable events illustrate why this is so. Sadly, the events took place just as the European Commission opened a representation in Havana, and when our institutions and many Members of this House were favourably disposed towards extending participation in the Cotonou Agreement to include Cuba. I urge the Commissioner to condemn these events and further, to state the conclusions the Commission intends to draw from them.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, Mr President, I believe Parliament must first reject and strongly condemn these events, as provided for by the joint resolution. Parliament has to stand firm and continue to insist on freedom as a prerequisite. Secondly, Parliament must express its solidarity with all those fighting for their freedom and dignity inside Cuba. To paraphrase Oswaldo Payá, they feel no hate in their hearts as they fight, but no fear of their oppressors either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Which is why he is scared to death of democratic reforms and is eliminating opponents. In the shadow of Iraq, Fidel now sees his opportunity to put more than 75 dissidents and independent journalists behind bars for a villainously long time. Their only crime is that they disagree with the regime, are open about it and are possibly supported by the Americans.</p>
<p class="contents">On my visit to Cuba in December it became clear to me that Cuba wants better relations with the European Union and is keen to accede to the Cotonou Agreement. To this end the Commission office was recently opened in Havana. Four days later came the arrests. What a slap in the face of the European Union! If the political detainees are not released, the question arises as to what the point is of a political dialogue and of a European Union office. Nor do any negotiations need to be conducted with regard to the Cotonou Agreement. I would like to hear what Commissioner Bolkestein has to say on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">As human rights rapporteur I have spoken to many Cuban authorities, including the Vice President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Unfortunately, I have to say now that they wrong-footed me with their evasive answers. Political processes behind closed doors are old Soviet practices for which there is no longer a place in a civilised world. The American boycott is ill-advised. Cuba is crazy about dollars. That is why a new invasion is needed. Not of soldiers but of peaceful visitors from America and Cuba. Democrats of the world unite ... in Cuba and give Castro a fright, by opening not only your wallet but also your mouth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Socialist Group protests with great indignation at the monstrous wave of repression that has crashed down on anyone who dares to dissent, disagree, think differently or create freely in Cuba. This incredible wave of repression reveals, to anyone still harbouring doubts or illusions, the true nature of the Cuban political regime. This is a totalitarian regime that could be called Orwellian, in other words, of the type imagined by George Orwell in his masterpiece entitled ‘nineteen eighty-four’. Once Cuban music, symbolised by Compay Segundo, Ibrahim Ferrer and their Buena Vista Social Club, was liberated we thought that we would also see the liberation of the spoken word – poetry –embodied by Raúl Rivero, a great poet who has been sentenced to twenty years in prison. And the liberation of political speech, personified by Elizardo Sanchez and Osvaldo Payá, to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not, however, what has happened. We were deceived. The Cuban dictator has had intellectuals, journalists, political dissidents and members of the Varela project arrested and brutally repressed, using the usual pretexts and means employed by any common or garden dictatorship: spying on its citizens, arbitrary imprisonment, court-room farces and absurd sentences.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no good or bad dictatorships, Mr President. All dictatorships are intrinsically evil. There is no point in grading them on a scale of evilness and calling Fidel Castro’s dictatorship ‘benign’. It makes no sense for the left to call Fidel Castro’s dictatorship a ‘respectable’ dictatorship. I personally wish to protest against this!</p>
<p class="contents">The cynical, barefaced and shameless breach of fundamental freedoms and human rights now represents a challenge and a provocation thrown down by Fidel Castro to all citizens and democratic countries. We must unite our efforts to isolate Cuba politically. I am not talking about economic isolation, because in fact the US economic embargo has provided the greatest excuse for the Cuban dictatorship. I am talking about moral and political isolation. We must support the dissident Cuban socialist Elizardo Sanchez, who has spent eight years in Fidel’s prisons and heads the Committee on Human Rights and National Reconciliation, when he demonstrates exemplary courage by stating in an interview with a French newspaper on the subject of this wave of repression, that what is being called into question in Cuba – these are his words – ‘is the totalitarian model’, which has failed there as elsewhere, and calls it an obscene model, adding that the Cuban regime is in its final throes. These are troubled times for dictatorships, Mr President. I fervently hope that democracy will triumph in Cuba and that the admirable Cuban people will regain the freedom of assembly, the freedom of association, the freedom to demonstrate, the freedom of speech, and the freedom to travel beyond their island. In short, I pray that the Cuban people recover the dreams which underpinned a revolution that I have always supported, but whose most important ideas have been betrayed and negated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Cuban dictator Fidel Castro has carried out this action with shocking cynicism and brutality, taking advantage of the international crisis, in the belief that since the world’s attentions are currently focused on another part of the globe – Iraq – international attention would be shifted and would therefore allow him to unleash all his rage and fury on those citizens who disagree with him.</p>
<p class="contents">Were this situation not so tragic, we might say, given this proof of Fidel Castro’s regime once again showing its true colours; that communism and Stalinism are like riding a bicycle: once you have learned how, you never forget. We in the UEN Group support the joint motion for a resolution, the compromise resolution that has been tabled and that will certainly be adopted. I wish, however, to say something further about the action that we feel should be taken. We believe that we in the European Parliament have a particular responsibility at the moment because last December we awarded the Sakharov Prize to Oswaldo Payá. We cannot abandon our Cuban brothers and sisters to their fate and we must show that awarding the Sakharov Prize serves some purpose. A European Parliament delegation must go to Cuba without delay to meet these detainees and particularly Oswaldo Payá. We must once again express our solidarity and once again invite Oswaldo Payá to come to Strasbourg for the May part-session. If he cannot come in May, then in June and if he cannot come in June, then in July, to tell us what is happening in Cuba. We must act rapidly, to show our solidarity with our Cuban brothers and sisters.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the European Union has already expressed its condemnation. This is important and is to be welcomed but it is not enough. We must do more; we must send a clear message to the Cuban dictator that we do not accept this, and that we shall not concede on this matter. We must put Cuba’s application for Cotonou membership on hold, and we must show quite clearly that we are prepared to support the Cuban situation changing to become a regime of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, but also that we shall not give in to any backsliding and particularly to any renewal of this Stalinist brutality. Let us call for the immediate release of all detainees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the severest wave of repression for ten years the dictator wants to rid himself of dissidents who are disagreeable to him. Sudden, mass arrests of critics of his regime are followed by quick show trials. The first so-called ‘traitors’ were picked up in mid-March. Last Monday the first draconian punishments had already been fixed in a judicial process that rode roughshod over international legal standards. Cubans who did nothing other than exercise their right to free speech were charged with subversive activities. This serious charge gives Castro the chance to impose excessively severe punishments under Law 88. This violation of the international legal order is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely now that the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which has been extremely critical of Cuba, is meeting in Geneva. It is precisely now that the European Union has opened official representation in Havana. It is precisely now that Castro is attempting to seize his chance in the shadow of the liberation of Iraq. We must put a stop to this. In the resolution we argue for the immediate release of all detainees and an end to these dubious detentions. Only then can the European Union consider the continuation of the political dialogue with Cuba and the accession of that island to the Cotonou Agreement. To which I would add the Cuban request to accede to the ACP countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, our group has strongly criticised what we consider the unduly harsh sentences handed down to the Cuban dissidents referred to earlier in the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we state clearly that freedom of expression and assembly must be respected as the fundamental rights they are. It is important however to take account of the context in which these sentences came about. Firstly, the embargo or blockade, call it what you will, which has had drastic social and economic consequences for Cuba over the last 40 years, and which the international community has condemned at the United Nations year after year. Secondly, the constant harassment by the representative of the United States in Havana for the last six months. That individual, Mr James Cason, has drawn on substantial financial resources to destabilise Cuban institutions. The sum of USD 20 million has been mentioned. Thirdly, the incredible leniency shown by the United States to those who hijacked two aircraft and a vessel during the last month, putting hundreds of lives at risk. Fourthly, the imprisonment of five Cuban citizens sentenced in the United States without guarantees. This was simply for attempting to prevent the terrorist attacks that took place a few months ago in tourist establishments. They caused serious damage, injury, and the death of an Italian holidaymaker. It was because the situation on the island had not been taken into account that we decided not to sign this joint resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to conclude by expressing a personal view. I believe it is regrettable that the majority of Members who are being so severe on Cuba today should have voted last year against the resolution calling for diplomatic relations with Israel to be broken. This was because of the repeated killing of Palestinians, many of whom were children. Thirty-four Palestinians have been murdered over the last three days. I also believe the vote against any proposal or amendment to condemn or stop the illegal, immoral and unjust war against Iraq during the last mini-session was most regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I do not know what to make of these double standards. Such an attitude is unfair above all to the victims. These run into the hundreds in Palestine. We may never know the number of victims in Iraq, as history tends to be written by the victors.</p>

All these individuals had done was to attempt to exercise their right to rights, as Oswaldo Payá explained in his address to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">This amounts to a flagrant violation of fundamental rights and freedoms. In a sense too, it is a response to the Varela Project. The House is honour bound to respond with strong condemnation of the actions of the Castro regime and that caricature of justice subservient to the dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">The House must call for all those imprisoned to be released. It must also speak out against what Oswaldo Payá described as the fallacy or myth that Cubans have to live without rights to sustain the independence and sovereignty of their country. Fundamental rights are not negotiable and their infringement can never be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">We are called on to assure those fighting for the rights of all Cubans that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them and that their fight is our fight also. Indeed, it is our moral and political duty to do so. We should also assure those who have found the courage to support the Varela Project that we support their efforts to re-empower the people of Cuba by constitutional means.</p>
<p class="contents">We must do more than simply condemn, however. I therefore call on the Commissioner to reject Cuba’s request to participate in the Cotonou Agreement if by the time the request comes up for consideration repression still persists and those detained have not been released. I would call on the Council to act in this way too, if the Council were represented here today. Article 9(2) of the aforementioned agreement requires Cuba to make a commitment to human rights. In no way can such a commitment be compatible with the repression currently endured by so many Cuban citizens merely because of their love of freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not make the mistake of failing to understand the tragedy of this people and we – including the Commission – must strive to intervene in the Cuban situation in such a way as to isolate the Cuban regime while upholding the fundamental and economic rights of the Cuban people.</p>
<p class="contents">I was one of those who – while realising that these few minutes will not allow an in-depth analysis of the situation in Cuba – upheld the need for a resolution to be adopted now on the arrests and, in particular, on the sentences, which are not just excessive but groundless. The incredible thing is that we are talking about detentions and even death sentences. The incredible thing is that the regime is actually in earnest, given that sentences as long as 26 years have already been inflicted. I would also like to point out to the Members that political persuasion is no guarantee of safety here, for countless Social Democrats have seen the inside of Fidel Castro’s prisons.</p>

I see the arrests made in recent weeks as a thank you for our support for Cuba’s entry into the ACP, a thank you for Commissioner Nielson’s visit two or three weeks ago and for the opening of a Commission office in Cuba. The dictator, Fidel Castro, has shown us his appreciation. This resolution, which expresses clear condemnation, does not, however, say what we should do – and Mr Ribeiro e Castro mentioned this – it does not say what the European Union ought to do to put an end to this dictatorship. It does not suggest suspending the aid provided by the Member States as well as that provided by the Commission or suspending any negotiations on the Cotonou agreements: no specific measure is proposed for putting pressure on the Cuban Government. It follows that, should the dictator, Fidel Castro, release a prisoner in the coming weeks, it might well be appropriate to produce a resolution to show our appreciation. In my opinion, we are playing the dictator’s game, albeit unintentionally, I realise. The regime is on its way out, and the large number of detentions is a sign that Fidel Castro has lost control of the situation. The time has come to give him a shove to help him on his way, proposing to this vile character – for he is truly vile – that he go into exile, so that the country can, at last, be governed by those fighting for democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In reality hundreds of people died in Cuban prisons in the early years of the revolution, and many more have been imprisoned or had their lives ruined for daring to speak the truth. Certainly the revolution has had achievements, but the economic, as well as the political, costs have been very high. The Cuban economy is bankrupt, not because of American sanctions, but because of communism. What is the advantage of good doctors if there are inadequate medical facilities and resources?</p>
<p class="contents">Fidel Castro has failed to understand that the world has changed, and few of us were prepared for the recent crackdown on 33 dissidents, the rushed secret trials and the outrageous call for the death penalty for a Christian Democratic leader.</p>

We certainly condemn them. Nonetheless, we feel it is wrong to take these events out of the current context within that country. It is unfair and often perverse to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Cuba is the victim of aggression by the United States. This aggression has been condemned by the international community more times than any other. The blockade has recently acquired a new dimension in the context of President Bush’s foreign policy. The Cuban authorities could well be justified in anticipating the danger of a qualitative change in the aggression they have been subjected to. Given the philosophy of pre-emptive wars which is now the official doctrine of the White House, a military invasion could take place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore understandable that the Cuban Government and of course a large part of the Cuban population should respond with defence mechanisms appropriate to a war situation. We are not surprised these responses are sometimes disproportionate or unjust. We are however saddened by them.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be difficult to convince Cubans that they are not justified in acting as they do. The virtual state of war Cuba has been in for years has suddenly become all too real. It is every bit as real as the Iraq war. It will be even more difficult to convince Cubans to change if the increasing provocation instigated by Mr Cason, who is in charge of the interests of the United States in Cuba, is not condemned whilst Cubans are criticised. Piracy and terrorism must be condemned too. I refer to the recent hijacking of two aircraft and a passenger vessel.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider ourselves friends of the Cuban people. We understand them and are in solidarity with them. We therefore feel we are in a position to appeal to them for moderation and generosity. At the same time we would denounce the situation outlined earlier, and commit the European Union to developing cooperation with Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the resolution before us, I agree in general with the little it does say. Nonetheless, I disagree with all it does not say. I also believe it contains serious untruths. These detract from its credibility. For instance, there are statements concerning requests for the death penalty. In my view, this is a text ridden with errors and omissions. It is unbalanced and therefore not useful. These are the reasons why I shall not vote in its favour, Mr President.</p>

<p class="contents">The European Union has made a declaration strongly condemning those measures. That was followed by a <span class="italic">démarche</span> of the troika in Havana on 26 March 2003 in which the Commission participated.</p>
<p class="contents">The grave concern which was felt was highlighted in the European Union’s statement on human rights in the world at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva last week. The statement called for the prompt release of those whom the Union considers to be prisoners of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights situation is and will remain an important aspect of our relationship with Cuba. The European Commission believes that a policy of dialogue is the most effective way to help bring about a positive evolution in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to facilitate a peaceful transition, the European Union follows, under the common position, a policy of 'constructive engagement' with Cuba. The EU common position distances itself from the use of coercive measures which might increase the hardship of the people of Cuba. Instead, it gives priority to a constructive dialogue with the Cuban authorities and civil society. In a nutshell: the European Union is of the firm conviction that a policy of constructive dialogue has more chance of success than one of isolation and embargoes.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Cuba’s request for accession to the Cotonou Agreement is concerned, that could provide a good framework to continue and deepen a meaningful dialogue with the Cuban authorities, in particular in the field of human rights. Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law are essential elements of that agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore preparing a communication on that subject, in which it will present a full assessment of the situation, including an assessment of the most propitious timing for Cuban accession to the Cotonou Agreement. This is my response on behalf of the Commission, and, in particular, of my colleague Mr Nielson. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the dictator Fidel Castro has betrayed this! He has actually changed the situation and this policy must therefore be changed.

As far as the Commission is concerned, it would be difficult to square participation in the Cotonou Agreement with a continuation of the present situation in Cuba.

They were part of a group of 52 homosexuals arrested in Cairo last year. On 16 January of this year Wissam Toufic Abyad was arrested and later sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment for ‘repeated licentious behaviour’.</p>
<p class="contents">These events are no isolated incidents. They are part of a growing and above all alarming trend that is characterised by an increase in reports of discrimination, arrests, mistreatment and wrongful convictions of homosexuals. This trend is all the more disturbing because homosexuality is not illegal in Egypt. At the same time the Euro-Mediterranean Treaty between the European Union and Egypt is on the point of ratification by both parties. Article 2 of this treaty requires respect for human rights and democratic principles. Everything suggests that Egypt is not respecting these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">My group in the Parliament has always argued for the promotion of tolerance in the Mediterranean Sea area. We also recognise the importance of good relations between Egypt and the European Union for the stability and the development of this area. I therefore very much regret that these relations are coming under pressure because of the repeated violations of human rights by the Egyptian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am however delighted by the release of human rights activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim, but wish to add immediately that things cannot stop at this individual case. The Egyptian authorities must keep working on greater respect for human rights in their country, the persecution of homosexuals because of their sexual inclination must come to an end and their individual freedoms must be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council and the Commission to develop programmes in the framework of the European initiative for democracy and human rights that are aimed at strengthening democracy in Egypt. I urge our fellow MEPs in the Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries to broach the human rights issue in Egypt at their next meeting with Egyptian parliamentarians and also to involve representatives of the social midfield in this process. Should these steps prove to be of no avail, Mr President, then I would plead for a postponement of the ratification of the Euro-Mediterranean Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want clear replies from the governments who are actually indicted in these resolutions before this House this afternoon. If these governments, including the Egyptian Government, do not take human rights seriously then we must take further action, if necessary suspending any agreements that we have with them.</p>
<p class="contents">The appalling onslaught against minorities in Egypt is terrifying to behold. People are being entrapped on the Internet because of their homosexuality. Let me refer to one individual, because this is what human rights are about: the rights of individuals. We in this House standing here, talking, debating, take everything for granted, yet these people, because of their difference, have everything robbed from them. Do we listen? No. Some of us talk on, whilst others call for tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">A young man, Wissam Abyad, was entrapped on the Internet. He went with a friend to meet a supposed gay man. He was arrested, along with his friend. He is now in prison. He is awaiting appeal. I call for his sentence to be suspended immediately, because that is this man's only way out.</p>
<p class="contents">The cases of two more men out of the 52 who were arrested over a year ago were not reviewed. They are undergoing not forced labour, but hard labour. As to the three British men awaiting trial in Egypt and the allegations of torture that they have made, have their cases been independently investigated? Of course not.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this to Egypt, and I say it as a friend: the litmus test of any civilised society is how it treats its minorities. It is for Egypt to show us here in this House, that it takes the rights of their minorities seriously, to call for an end to discrimination against those minorities and to release from prison and end immediately the investigations and the arrests of gay men throughout Egypt which worry us here in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like previous speakers, we wish to emphasise respect for human rights, especially freedom of information, expression and association. These are fundamental values included in the association agreement between the EU and Egypt. What is happening in Egypt at present is therefore beyond the pale.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is time to stop persecuting people because of their sexual orientation. People must, moreover, be able freely to express their opinions and values in demonstrations. We are also concerned here with the status of religious freedom in a country in which 12% to 15% of the population belongs to the Christian Coptic minority. The common resolution from all our political groups demands that the minority Coptic Christian group be fully respected and represented in Egyptian society. Allow me to quote some examples of the ways in which they are not so respected and represented. Different regulations apply to restoring and constructing churches as distinct from mosques. The regulations governing churches are very complicated and long-winded. Coptic Christians are not represented at all within the police, higher education and the security service. School books still use terms such as ‘unbelievers’ to describe both Jews and Christians.</p>
<p class="contents">Other examples are the murders of two Christians in 1998 in the El-Kosheh community – crimes which the local Christian population does not consider to have been solved equitably.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations with Egypt are fundamental to the Mediterranean region and the EU, but they must be based upon respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Egypt is a densely populated and important country in the Arab world and we want to conclude an association agreement with Egypt. Yet Article 2 of that association agreement expressly includes a clause requiring the observance of human rights and democratic principles. We ought to develop tools that can be used to promote the implementation of this Article in practice. After all, there is an atmosphere of all or nothing prevailing here and that is not of course the right way to promote a good dialogue. Let us not forget that Charles Dickens too was imprisoned for homosexuality in nineteenth-century England. Evolution is possible therefore. But here we clearly have a case of three kinds of human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to associate myself with the protest against the human rights violations in respect of homosexuals, because the free consent of adults in their sexual relations with one another cannot be prosecuted in any civilised country and is even permitted by the Egyptians by law. Why should these drastic charges be brought over and over again? Making intimidation attempts with the use of private information by way of telephone, Internet, etc.?</p>
<p class="contents">A second series of violations concerns those in respect of the Coptic church, one of the oldest cultural communities and a minority in Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">And thirdly I would like to underline that we have all been witness to the serious violations of human rights during the marches for peace in Iraq. We were amazed at the violent way in which the police opposed them. I therefore ask the European Commission to consider carefully how use can be made of that Article 2 on the signing of the association agreement not only to denounce the practices condemned here, but also to bring about their cessation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Relationships may be of whatever kind they deem appropriate. We are therefore distressed that fifteen homosexuals have received three-year prison sentences in Egypt. Another 29 individuals were effectively cleared, however. In addition, under the provisions of the state of emergency, many people have been arrested recently in connection with anti-war demonstrations.</p>

There is one piece of good news, however. This is the decision by the Egyptian Appeal Court to annul the judgment on Saad Eddin Ibrahim and exonerate him. We had already referred to this individual in the House. He is a human rights defender.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in view of the Association Agreement with Egypt, I believe the European Commission and the European Union should bring pressure to bear to ensure there is no repetition of such incidents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no smile on the faces of those anti-war demonstrators who were arrested on 20 March in Cairo and reportedly tortured. There is no smile, as we have heard, on the members of Coptic Church in Egypt persecuted for their faith. Egypt has contributed so much to our civilisation, we must urge it now to follow a civilised path on these issues.</p>

Do you think that this time our voice will reach the ears of its rulers? Because so far they have made a point of ignoring us.</p>
<p class="contents">The second trial of 50 men accused of homosexuality on 15 March and the sentencing of 21 of them to even harsher punishment demonstrates in the most dramatic fashion that this country has absolutely no respect for fundamental freedoms, for human rights or for privacy. The prisoners include a Greek citizen, Kostas Kastanias, who has serious health problems. Unfortunately, the Egyptian Government is refusing to move him to Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Egypt has no respect either for international conventions or for agreements with the European Union or even for its own laws, under which homosexuality is not a crime. It makes one wonder who is ruling Egypt? Does the rule of law exist or is the unofficial Islamic fundamentalist government in charge? Who does the European Union ultimately conclude agreements with, Commissioner? Do you have plans to finally do something about these matters? How do you intend to use the force and influence of the European Union to make Egypt respect fundamental freedoms and immediately release these people who have been wrongly imprisoned? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks precisely to the intervention of the European Commission, this goal has been achieved. We hope that the same patience and drive will be invested in the resolution of this case too.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost everything has already been said, but perhaps there is something we have overlooked: it is completely unacceptable for the democratic clause laid down in the various agreements with third countries not to be observed to the letter. I would like to make it clear to the House and to the Commission that the increasing use of European taxpayers’ money to serve the interests of dictatorships and finance violations of human rights, at the same time erasing any hope these countries might have of freedom and democracy, is totally unacceptable.

<p class="contents">The draft resolutions to be discussed today seem largely prompted by the recent reconviction of 21 Egyptian men for ‘debauchery’. It is therefore with this issue that I shall start.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has followed the 'Queen Boat' affair since the arrest in May 2001 of 52 men under laws to control prostitution. We were concerned by the nature of the charges; the use of security courts and national security legislation; the allegations of police harassment and entrapment; and the severe sentences that were meted out. The inflammatory language at the trial and in the media undermine Egyptian claims that the men were not charged for their sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">We were encouraged when President Mubarak subsequently ruled that the case should be retried in a misdemeanour court. But the conduct and outcome of the second trial were unexpected since the 21 men previously sentenced were re-sentenced to the maximum sentence of 3 years. The 21 men have appealed and an appeal verdict is provisionally expected on 4 June.</p>
<p class="contents">Homosexuality remains a sensitive issue for Egyptian society. But that does not mean that the Commission will condone the harassment and prosecution of people for their sexual orientation, or any measures that deprive them of their normal rights. The Commission will continue to monitor this and other similar prosecutions and has frequently communicated its concerns to the Egyptian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now pass to other issues raised. We welcome the release of democracy activist Saad Ibrahim and share the satisfaction of all true friends of Egypt that this long-running saga is over. Justice in the best Egyptian judicial traditions has now been done, and has been seen to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">We note allegations of excessive force used against Egyptian anti-Iraq war demonstrators, but emotions and tempers at such events run high and the Egyptian Government has a legitimate concern to preserve public order at such a sensitive time. It is a rapidly evolving situation. But public order should not be maintained at the expense of freedom of expression or of peaceful assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has expressed concern for the Egyptian Copts on several occasions and will know that the Commission continues to monitor the judicial aftermath of the events in el Khosheh in 1998 and in 1999/2000.</p>
<p class="contents">Many commentators regret the recent extension of the state of emergency that has been in continuous effect since the early 1980s. The European Union is concerned at its use at times, and for cases that are difficult to justify. But we are encouraged that the ruling NDP party has recently proposed radically to limit the scope of the state of emergency and the system of state security courts associated with it.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several provisions in the Association Agreement for fundamental breaches by either side of essential elements, one of which is respect for democratic principles and human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (Article 2). More importantly, the Association Agreement provides for constructive political dialogue on human rights and related issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I should like to say to Parliament that Commissioner Patten told the European Parliament at the debate on the EU-Egypt Association Agreement that the Commission shares the European Parliament’s concerns but also notes encouraging developments notably: new social legislation on the rights of women; the supervision of elections by the courts; ruling party proposals for ending the state security court system, and rulings by the courts on the constitutionality of contentious legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continuously monitors Egypt’s respect for human rights. When the Association Agreement comes into force any human rights issue may be raised, and hopefully resolved, by either side at the appropriate Association Council or committee. The Agreement, ratified here first and ratified on Monday by the Egyptian People’s Assembly, will provide both sides with important safeguards and an additional forum to extend human and democratic rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual cases, such as the ‘Queen Boat’ case, are considered on a case-by-case basis and in close collaboration with Member States. The Commission does not hesitate to make its views known to the Egyptian authorities through normal channels or public statements as appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>Sectoral graduation is a feature of the European Union's Scheme of Generalised Tariff Preferences. Such graduation is meant to target preferences on those countries other than those which turn out to be able to face international competition without preferential market access.

<p>(EL) In February, the European Council unambiguously expressed its concern about the situation in Iraq and about weapons of mass destruction. It urged the Iraqi authorities to cooperate fully and actively with the UN. The Council regrets that, in the end, it was not possible to resolve the situation peacefully.</p>
<p>The Union’s position on the military conflict in Iraq is clearly set out in the European Council Statement on 20 March. On that occasion, the Union decided to intensify work for a comprehensive, coherent and effective multilateral policy of the international community to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. As to the Iraqi conflict, the European Council hoped that it would end with the minimum loss of human life and suffering. The honourable Member is certainly well aware that the Council has not taken a position on the question of the legality of the war with Iraq.</p>
<p>The immediate priority must be the welfare of all the Iraqi people. That is why the Council has supported that the UN’s ‘Oil for Food Programme’ be resumed so that humanitarian and medical assistance can continue to be met through that programme. It welcomed very much that the Security Council has unanimously adopted a resolution to that end on 28 March. About 60 % of the Iraqi population depend on the ‘Oil-for-Food’ programme, so it is important that it is not interrupted for a long time.</p>
<p>On the UN’s role in general, the Council remains firmly of the view that the UN must play a central role during and after the conflict, and that the UN system has a unique capacity in coordinating assistance in post-conflict States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0207"></a>

<p>(EN) To the Council's best knowledge no EU Member State has recently refused an entry Visa for the Taiwanese Prime Minister, and no such request has recently been made by the Taiwanese side.</p>
<p>The question of issuing or not a Visa to any particular individual or political personality remains in the exclusive competence of Member States, unless a CFSP Common Position establishes an EU-wide visa ban as a part of targeted sanctions against the regime concerned. There is currently no CFSP Common Position including a Visa ban against Taiwan.</p>
<p>As far as President Mugabe's attendance at the France-Africa Summit is concerned, the Council has already informed the European Parliament that France had notified its intention to issue a visa to President Mugabe to attend this Summit in accordance with the procedure set out in Common Position 2002/145/CFSP, and that Coreper on 14 February 2003 had noted the absence of obstacles to this participation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0193"></a>

<p>(EN) According to the Seville European Council conclusions and following the Road Map established by the Council, the Commission, the Council and the Member States have carried or are carrying out the actions provided for.</p>
<p>As regards the execution of the initiatives conferred upon the Commission, the Commission wishes to inform the honourable Member that either they have been achieved or they are in progress. They will be completed according to the timing provided for by the road map established by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, following the Council's Plan of 28 February to combat illegal immigration and trafficking of human beings in the Union and the Council's Plan of 13 June 2002 for the management of the external borders of the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p>For example, the review of the list of third countries, whose nationals require visa or are exempt from that requirement has been carried out through the amending Council Regulation EC n°453/2003, adopted by the Council 6 March 2003<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>And the feasibility study on a common identification system for visa data is almost finalised and the report will be ready soon.</p>
<p>As regards the feasibility of establishing a European Corps of Border Guards, this is a very sensitive, political issue.</p>
<p>The Commission has envisaged the possible creation of such a body as the final target of a dynamic process aimed at developing in stages an integrated management of the external borders.</p>
<p>The Council's Plan, adopted on 13 June 2002, retained this approach and structured it in providing a series of measures and actions to be performed with a tight calendar.</p>
<p>The Council has placed ‘a possible decision on the setting up of a European Corps of Border Guards, composed of joint teams’ of Member States guards and with the sole function of supporting the national services’ at the end of a long process.</p>
<p>The development of joint operations and projects carried out by the Member States would constitute indispensable progress towards the integrated management.</p>
<p>Only after these experiences and an in-depth evaluation of their impact, such an important step might be considered.</p>
<p>The Commission shares this point of view. The Commission is confident of the positive impact of the numerous common activities, such as pilot projects and joint operations, which the Member States are carrying out in order to develop common practices at the external borders and to adopt a common model for the risk analysis and a core curriculum for the border guards training.</p>
<p>The European Council of Thessaloniki of June 2003 will examine various reports in the field of migration and the management of external borders and will provide the Commission with its appreciation of these experiences.</p>
<p>The Commission is sure that its efforts to build up a common integrated policy for the management of the external borders will receive the necessary political support.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its answer to my Written Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2003-0159_EN.html">E-0159/03</a> the Commission writes that it supports the inclusion of the principle of non-discrimination in the future Constitution of the European Union in the framework of the work of the Convention.

<p>(FR) First of all, it should be pointed out that the Commission does not have the right of initiative for the Convention, as it does for Community legislation. It takes part in the debate through two members of the Convention, Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino, and their two alternates. This low numerical representation should be compared to that of Parliament, which has 16 members in the Convention. It is, however, true that both the Commission and the European Parliament have two representatives in the Praesidium of the Convention (which has 12 members) which produces the initial drafts of articles.</p>
<p>Regarding the subject with which the honourable Member is concerned, the Commission has already made its view known in the answer to written question no. <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2003-0159_EN.html">E-0159/03</a>. The Commission in no way considers the issue of discrimination to be a secondary one.</p>
<p>The Commission:</p>
<p>- supports the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitution, which will make the Charter legally binding so that it can be directly invoked by citizens. Article 21 of the Charter forbids any type of discrimination, expressly citing discrimination on grounds of language or membership of a minority;</p>
<p>- also supports the inclusion of an additional provision generally forbidding discrimination, in addition to discrimination on grounds of nationality. Including this type of provision in the Constitution is necessary in order to create a legal basis to enable the Union to combat discrimination, insofar as it has been recognised that even if the Charter is incorporated into the Constitution that does not create new powers for the Union.</p>
<p>These opinions have been expressed both within the Praesidium and at the plenary sessions on the first articles of the Constitution on 27 February by Mr Barnier. At that plenary session, Mr Barnier supported the full incorporation of the Charter into the Constitution, covering all types of discrimination. He also suggested that the Constitution should contain a specific provision banning all types of discrimination.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0202"></a>

<p>(EN) The press statement quoted by the honourable Member refers to the debate on the Commission proposal for a Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>When the Parliament discussed Ms Cusi´s report on this proposal<a href="#defann_12_2" name="refann_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on 11 February 2003, the Commission made it clear that it does not intend to decide by directive the numbers of immigrants that Union economies and societies are prepared to absorb. The proposed directive leaves that decision with the Member States; only they, together with their civil societies and local authorities know how much their societies are capable of integrating.</p>
<p>Article 26 of this proposal explicitly acknowledges this fact and provides an option for Member States to adopt horizontal measures (e.g. national ceilings, temporary suspension of issuance of residence permits) in order to limit the admission of third country workers, if Member States consider this necessary, taking into account the overall capacity to receive and to integrate third country nationals on their territory or in specific regions thereof.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that immigration for the purpose of exercising employed or self-employed economic activities is a cornerstone of immigration policy. This is presently enshrined in Article 63 of the EC Treaty, and is also reflected in the draft Treaty text under discussion in the Convention, which would provide for the adoption of measures on the conditions of entry and stay of third country nationals.</p>
<p>The two other Directives, to which the honourable Member refers, deal with asylum policy, not with economic migration:</p>
<p>- Council Directive 2003/9/EC of 27 January 2003 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers<a href="#defann_12_3" name="refann_12_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> lays down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in Member States. Regarding admission to work, its Article 11 provides that ‘Member States shall determine a period of time, starting from the date on which an application for asylum was lodged, during which an applicant shall not have access to the labour market. If a decision at first instance has not been taken within one year of the presentation of an application for asylum and this delay cannot be attributed to the applicant, Member States shall decide the conditions for granting access to the labour market for the applicant. Access to the labour market shall not be withdrawn during appeals procedures, where an appeal against a negative decision in a regular procedure has suspensive effect, until such time as a negative decision on the appeal is notified. For reasons of labour market policies, Member States may give priority to Union citizens and nationals of States parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and also to legally resident third-country nationals.’</p>
<p>- Directive 2001/55 of 20 July 2001 on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures promoting a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof<a href="#defann_12_4" name="refann_12_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> establishes minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons from third countries who are unable to return to their country of origin. Regarding admission to work, its Article 12 provides that ‘The Member States shall authorise, for a period not exceeding that of temporary protection, persons enjoying temporary protection to engage in employed or self-employed activities, subject to rules applicable to the profession, as well as in activities such as educational opportunities for adults, vocational training and practical workplace experience. For reasons of labour market policies, Member States may give priority to Union citizens and citizens of States bound by the Agreement on the European Economic Area and also to legally resident third-country nationals who receive unemployment benefit. The general law in force in the Member States applicable to remuneration, access to social security systems relating to employed or self-employed activities and other conditions of employment shall apply.’</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Article 5(2)b of Directive 2001/29/EC enables Member States to provide for exceptions or limitations to the exclusive right to reproduction established in Article 2 of the Directive and granted to authors for their work and performers, record producers and film producers for the other items protected. The exception established in Article 5(2)b allows private copying, for which the legal provisions are not harmonised at Community level. This is permitted on the condition that the rightholders receive ‘fair compensation’. It is the job of the Member States to ensure that the fair compensation is effectively distributed to the different rightholders. The form, arrangements and level for that fair compensation are given in Recital 35 of the Directive, which points out the quite broad degree of evaluation reserved for the Member States in order to determine it according to ‘the particular circumstances of each case’. However, the system of exceptions must comply with the three-stage test established in Article 5(5) of the Directive: the exception must apply to certain special cases, must not conflict with normal exploitation of the work or other protected items and must not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rightholder. The Member States are currently transposing this Directive and the Commission is actively ensuring that this complies fully with the text of the Directive. The Commission also wishes to point out that the compensation should not be paid to one of the rightholders, such as the record producers, it should be paid to the others (the authors for example).</p>
<p>The price of pre-recorded audio and video products, which does not include the charge for private copying, is freely determined by the market. The Commission’s policies can only have an indirect impact on those prices, in particular by applying competition or internal market regulations. Also, and in general, the price of media which enable private copying does not essentially depend on the charge for private copying.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Commission does not, therefore, envisage taking further initiatives to protect dry-stone walls in the Cyclades.</p>
<p>With regard to the other regions in the European Union (Spain, France and Italy) facing similar problems, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>In Spain, as part of the horizontal programme for accompanying measures, there is an agri-environmental measure to protect the countryside on maintaining elements of particular value to the countryside, more specifically concerning the maintenance and conservation of traditional walls and fences;</p>
<p>For France, there are no specific provisions on this subject. However, there is funding in place for this type of problem. Agri-environmental measures have been planned for many years in certain regions of the South of France to restore and maintain this type of heritage;</p>
<p>In Italy, funding for the maintenance and even reconstruction of walls and other characteristic elements of the countryside is provided as part of agri-environmental measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0140"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission proposal addresses the acknowledged need for urgent reinforcement of the current rules for the identification and registration of sheep and goats, in particular in view of the experience acquired from the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) crisis.</p>
<p>In its Resolution of December 2002 on measures to control foot and mouth disease, the Parliament stated that the Commission should as quickly as possible submit a proposal to amend Directive 92/102/EEC so as to improve the identification of pigs, sheep and goats.</p>
<p>Individual identification is essential for the effective tracing of animals for veterinary purposes, which is of crucial importance for the control of contagious diseases.</p>
<p>Individual identification is also a key element in the framework of the programmes for eradication of brucellosis of sheep and goats, which are co-financed by the Community. These programmes cover 1/3 of the sheep and goat population above 12 months of age in the Community.</p>
<p>With regard to electronic identification, the Commission launched a large scale pilot project – the IDEA Project – in1998. The final report of this project, which included sheep and goats as well as bovine animals, was completed in 2002.</p>
<p>The technology of electronic identification for sheep and goats has progressed to such a stage that it can now be applied. However, the implementing measures required for the proper introduction of the system of electronic identification on a Community scale have yet to be fully developed.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal provides for further guidelines and procedures to be adopted through the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes individual identification by means of two eartags - to ensure that the identity is retained where one eartag is lost - with possible authorisation of the use of an electronic identifier replacing the second eartag.</p>
<p>The reinforced system of identification and registration is proposed to enter into force on 1 July 2003, from which date all animals born on the holding or intended for intra-Community trade would be individually identified.</p>
<p>The proposal foresees the introduction of compulsory electronic identification by 1 July 2006 – taking into account the practical experience gained with regard to implementation.</p>
<p>To take into account the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States the proposal includes options, which Member States may decide to apply under certain circumstances. The options decided upon will influence the likely costs of the farmers to introduce the new system.</p>
<p>The introduction of the reinforced system will have a positive impact in case of outbreaks of major animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease allowing the rapid identification of the source of infection and limiting the further spread of disease. Furthermore the benefits of accurate tracing of animals will be achieved in the framework of the animal disease eradication programmes financed by the Community.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises that this proposal will require significant efforts by both operators and authorities. But these efforts are both worthwhile and necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0150"></a>

<p>(FR) Freedom of establishment is a fundamental freedom that every Community national enjoys. That freedom is contained in and protected by Article 43 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits all measures restricting the freedom of establishment.</p>

<p>(EN) The Communication from the Commission to the Council and the Parliament –'Update on the EC Programme for Action – Accelerated action on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria and tuberculosis in the context of poverty reduction – Outstanding policy issues and future challenges’, was adopted by the Commission on 26 February 2003 and was forwarded to the Parliament through the usual procedure.</p>
<p>The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) initiative has made very good progress. During the plenary of 27 March, the Parliament adopted, with unanimity 35 compromise amendments resulting from the agreement reached between the three institutions with a view to avoid a second reading. The ‘common structure’ of the EDCTP programme, set out as a European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG), will be the executive structure and manage the programme through its secretariat. The EDCTP-EEIG comprises two main components: the ‘EEIG Assembly’ (composed of national representatives nominated by their governments) and the ‘EEIG Secretariat’ providing administrative support for the work of the Partnership Board and the EEIG Assembly. The nominated members of the EEIG Assembly elected The Hague (NL) as the future host site of the EDCTP European Office on 4 March. It is expected that preliminary identification of tests sites in Africa could start in July/August 2003 and that the first clinical trials in Africa could take place by the end of 2003. Participating Member States have agreed to coordinate and implement jointly activities to the EDCTP Programme foreseen for a period of five years. The overall value of their national participation is estimated at € 200 million.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0158"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission acknowledge receipt of the oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0158_EN.html">H-0158/03</a>, on the outcome of an attack on Iraq in migration and refugee terms.</p>
<p>There has been some estimations made by the main humanitarian organisation before the conflict in their contingency plans. United Nations High Committee for Refugees (UNHCR) has planned for up to 600.000 refugees and/or asylum seekers stranded at border areas. UNHCR and International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) are today ready to provide emergency relief to more than 550.000 people within Iraq at the border and/or in Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey.</p>
<p>To date, refugee movements have been very limited, and no considerable movements of civilian populations have been registered towards Iraq's international borders. The situation is now the following:</p>
<p>-	About 22.000 people moved towards Iran but finally they remained in Iraq.</p>
<p>-	About 300.000 Internal Displaced People moved to Iraqi Kurdistan, with 90% hosted in families and only 5% receiving humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>-	1048 Third Nationals were in transit through Jordan, with only 190 still hosted in the camp.</p>
<p>-	According to UNHCR report, less than 30 Iraqi refugees arrived to Syria (as of 28 March 2003).</p>
<p>Situation can change following the future developments of the conflict; however the Commission can not make reliable estimations at this stage.</p>
<p>If need will be, as announced by the Member of the Commission in charge of Development and Humanitarian aid on 20 March 2003, European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) stands ready to adopt a primary emergency decision worth € 3 million to provide UNHCR and ICRC with the financing of pre-positioned non-food emergency relief items for up to 120.000 refugees and/or asylum seekers stranded at border areas within Iraq.</p>
<p>As for migration, there are not particular indications about possible flows of refugees toward other countries, included Member States. At the moment the Commission is not aware of particular movements of refugees due to the current events outside the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0159"></a>

<p>Within the European Union, each Member State goes beyond the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic and uses its own system of road signing, road marking and traffic lights. In many instances, the same or similar sign in different Member States is unknown or conveys a different, sometimes even the opposite meaning to drivers or pedestrians. Obviously, this situation causes confusion and frequently gives rise to serious danger.</p>
<p>Can the Commission say what measures it has taken or intends to take towards the prompt adoption of a single system of road signing, road marking and traffic lights in the EU so as to put an end to the current unacceptable situation and make European citizens feel when travelling that they live in a unified area?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Vienna Convention on traffic signs and the protocol on road markings are the international guidelines for harmonisation in this domain. Their correct application should guarantee a good level of harmonisation. As far as directional signing is concerned, the European ‘Rightway’ project, supported by the Commission, concluded that safety benefits of harmonising colours of directional signs on motorways are minor, while the risks involved in a transition towards harmonised colours could easily outweigh these benefits. The Commission is also aware that obtrusion of the visibility as well as degradation and damage often pose the more serious safety problems. In terms of new roads, road safety audits allow to identify problems of inconsistent design features (alignment, signing, speed limits, lane widths etc.) before they are cast in concrete.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Commission has taken the following actions:</p>
<p>-	At the end of 2002 a proposal for a directive on tunnel safety was submitted to Parliament and Council, which, amongst others, aims to harmonise tunnel related signs;</p>
<p>-	The project Rightway identified existing differences in the application of the designs and colours of signs as set out in the Vienna Convention as well as of directional signs on motorways. Also, a harmonised system for indicating destinations was developed. Results have been widely made available;</p>
<p>-	Road signing was made part of the currently open first call for proposals of the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework programme. A future project should make suggestions for specific needs to harmonise signs;</p>
<p>-	In the Commission's work programme for 2003 was announced a proposal for a directive on common requirements for black spot management and road safety audits to address some of the aspects mentioned;</p>
<p>-	The High Level Group for Road Safety will receive towards the end of the year two reports on infrastructure safety including, among others, needs for harmonisation of signs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0161"></a>

<p>(EN) The refugee issue is at the core of the conflict in the Middle East. It is the Union's position that ‘a just, viable and agreed solution to the problem of the Palestinian refugees’ should be found (Declaration by the European Union on the Middle East, Seville European Council, 21-22 June 2002).</p>
<p>The continuing support of the Community for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is a key element in the Community's strategy of contributing actively to reducing tension and providing a minimum of stability in the Middle East, which would allow the parties to pursue their quest for peace. It also contributes to facilitating access to basic social services, reduction of poverty and an improvement of the refugees' living standard.</p>
<p>Community support under the current four-year Community-UNRWA funding convention is a contribution towards the financing of UNRWA's regular programmes for around 3.9 million Palestine refugees in five fields of operation: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The regular programmes financed under the General Fund include UNRWA's education programme, health programme, and relief and social services programme.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting UNRWA's General Fund the Commission provides food aid at the rate of € 15 million per year. From time to time the Commission also funds infrastructure projects aiming at the improvement of socio-economic conditions in refugee camps (e.g. water and sanitation projects in Gaza, Syria and Lebanon; support to community-based activities in Syria; rehabilitation of refugee camps in Lebanon), and provides humanitarian support in response to UNRWA's emergency appeals. Since the beginning of the second Intifada in September 2000 the Commission Humanitarian Office provided financial support to UNRWA for the implementation of humanitarian operations worth € 45 million.</p>
<p>The current funding convention takes into consideration the support UNRWA is receiving from the international community, including Member States (see attached table).</p>

<p>(FR) The Euratom Treaty has, since 1957, been a useful instrument for the management in Europe of the use of nuclear power, which provides over a third of the electricity consumed in the European Union.</p>
<p>As a result of the Euratom Treaty:</p>
<p>- Member States have transferred to the Community extensive powers for monitoring the use of fissile materials. A complement of nearly 300 inspectors ensures there is no diversion of nuclear materials and enforces the rules on radiation protection;</p>
<p>- the agreements signed by Euratom with third countries and international organisations have given the Community responsibilities in the area of non-proliferation;</p>
<p>- the Euratom Treaty organises and coordinates research, particularly in the field of nuclear waste, which has enabled European research centres to be established (e.g. the JRC’s internationally reputed Karlsruhe Institute and, in the field of fusion, the Joint European Torus (JET) at Culham);</p>
<p>- lastly, the negotiations conducted in connection with the forthcoming enlargement have shown that nuclear power is still a current issue. The accession treaties will consequently contain special clauses on nuclear safety and on the commitment to shut down eight reactors currently being operated in three of the candidate countries (Lithuania, Slovenia and Bulgaria).</p>
<p>The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, will therefore endeavour in the context of the Convention to preserve this fundamental acquis which has enabled the Union to equip itself with one of the best nuclear energy control systems anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The Commission would also point out that two proposals for directives adopted on 30 January 2003<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> will shortly extend this control to the cover the safety of nuclear installations and the management of radioactive waste.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The advantages of the Community Patent will make the patent system as a whole more accessible and relevant to innovators' needs, and should accordingly lead to increased numbers of applications for patents. While these advantages will be of benefit to all users, they will be felt most keenly by smaller companies with tight budgets, who up to now might not have been in a position to seek broad protection for their innovations.</p>
<p>However, the patent system is only one component of the overall environment in which innovation is nurtured and rewarded. The Community may have an excellent patent system, but it will not be used by its enterprises if they are not innovating. The overall improvement of research and innovation will contribute to the ‘Lisbon strategy’ endorsed in March 2000 at the Lisbon European Council, which aims to make the Union the world’s most dynamic and competitive economy.</p>
<p>More specifically, at the 2002 Barcelona European Council, the heads of State and Government agreed that research and technological development investment in the Union must be increased with the aim of approaching 3% of gross domestic product by 2010, up from 1.9% in 2000. About two-thirds of the total should be funded by business.</p>
<p>An action plan for reaching this ‘3%’ objective will be published shortly by the Commission, including recommendations in a number of areas, one of which being intellectual property. In particular, intellectual property rights awareness and training issues will be important. Indeed, for a successful Community patent for all users – including small and medium-sized enterprises and public research organisations – it is also important that they be able to make optimal use of it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0168"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) was established on 11 November 2002 by Council Regulation 2012/2002<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. On 11 December 2002 the Commission adopted four decisions granting EUSF-aid to Germany (€ 444 million), Austria (€ 134 million), the Czech Republic (€ 129 million) and France (€ 21 million). Implementation agreements with these four countries were concluded and the grants paid out in full before the end of the year. In accordance with the Regulation the beneficiary countries are now in the process of implementing the aid within the twelve month period provided for. The Commission will monitor implementation.</p>
<p>For the current year, four requests to mobilise the EUSF were addressed to the Commission in January 2003 by the Italian authorities (for the disasters following the eruption of Mount Etna, the earthquake in Molise and the flooding in northern Italy) and by Spain (for the Prestige tanker accident). These requests are in the process of being assessed by the Commission. If one or more are found on analysis to meet the criteria of the regulation, it is for the Commission to propose to the budgetary authority to make available the appropriate amount from the Community budget. A fifth request to mobilise the EUSF has been announced by the Greek authorities (adverse weather conditions causing damage, in different parts of the country) but has not been received as yet.</p>
<p>In the case of the accident involving the oil-tanker ‘Prestige’, it is evident that disasters of this nature do not fit easily within the scope of the provisions of the existing EUSF-Regulation as adopted by the Council.</p>
<p>The Commission, in the ‘Report to the European Council on action to deal with the effects of the Prestige disaster’<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> has concluded that a satisfactory solution to this type of disaster requires an amendment to the Regulation, returning in effect, to an original proposal submitted in September 2002. This would allow the Solidarity Fund to cover disasters of a technological or environmental nature, while lowering the threshold that triggers intervention (currently € 3 billion or 0.6% of the gross national product of the State concerned) and extending the eligible actions defined in Article 3 of the Regulation to include preventative action intended to minimise the damaging effects of an ongoing or imminent disaster.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Eligibility for assistance is established at level 2 of the NUTS classification<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> in the case of regions eligible for Objective 1 and level 3 of the NUTS classification for regions eligible for Objective 2. Therefore, these are the geographical levels at which data is available on the implementation of Objective 1 and Objective 2 assistance. Eligibility for Objective 3 is not established on a regional basis.</p>
<p>It follows that, except in cases where the constituencies established for elections to the Parliament might be the same as the regions eligible for Objective 1 or Objective 2 – which is not the case in Ireland – the requested breakdown by constituency cannot be made available by the Commission.</p>
<p>However, the Member States are free to produce more detailed information on their own initiative. In the case of Ireland, lists of projects by programme and beneficiary have recently been made available at county level (NUTS 4) on the website of the National Development Plan<a href="#defann_29_3" name="refann_29_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Such data could be aggregated to give information on the situation in the euro-constituencies which normally consist of groups of counties.</p>
<p>As regards research and technological development (RTD) activities, the Commission sends, each year, a report to the Parliament and Council, which provides information, at national level only, on the total number of Framework Programme RTD contracts signed and on the corresponding Community contribution. During the period 1999-2002, there was a total of 123 Connacht/Ulster participation in activities funded by the Fifth Framework Programme for research and technological development with a total of € 13.090.741 of Community contribution.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The CAP reform is addressed to active farmers. No provisions are established to ensure payment entitlements for landowners who have retired during the reference period and consequently whose land has been leased. The payment entitlements will be given to the tenants who exercised an agricultural activity in the reference period on the land in question.</p>
<p>There is no intention ‘to disqualify such farm families from future payment entitlements’. They can produce without entitlements or, but they are not obliged to, buy entitlements on the market and, of course, they can continue to lease the land to farmers who have entitlements but not enough land. If the question concerns the members of the family who take over the holding in the reference period, a provision is made to attribute them the same rights as the person who retired under the condition that the holding or part of the holding has been transferred by actual or anticipated inheritance.</p>
<p>The third question concerns ‘who will be eligible to claim the payment entitlement on land for which payment entitlement has been established during the years 2000, 2001, 2002 but which has subsequently been sold since 1 January 2003: (a) the owner from 2000 - 2002, (b) the subsequent purchaser (an active farmer), (c) neither?’ First of all it should be noted that no entitlement is established for land but, on the contrary, the entitlements are established for active farmers in the reference period. Therefore the entitlements will be established or for the owner from 2000-2002 or for the tenant if the land was rented in the reference period. In both cases, the farmer who claim the payment needs to have an equivalent number of hectares in order to activate them and get the corresponding amount of aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0183"></a>

<p>(FR) In each country the Commission delegations are in direct contact with the Member States and are linked to one of their embassies for crisis management.</p>
<p>In the event of serious tension in a third country, the Commission conforms to the decisions taken by the Member States and follows their recommendations.</p>
<p>In the majority of third countries, statutory staff in the Commission delegations and their families are part of the same, single evacuation plan for a Community embassy. The other categories of expatriate staff are part of the evacuation plans of their respective embassies.</p>
<p>The headquarters authorises the purchase of emergency travel tickets for statutory staff and their families posted to difficult locations.</p>
<p>Depending on the risk or degree of threat in the location, the headquarters may decide on preventive evacuation of families (crisis level 1) and/or non-essential statutory staff (crisis level 2) and if the local situation requires it the evacuation of all statutory staff and subsequently the temporary closure of the delegation.</p>
<p>For the purposes of information, currently the delegations at crisis level 1 are Central Africa, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Syria, Yugoslavia (Pristina) and the delegations at crisis level 2 are Afghanistan, West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel, Jordan and Liberia.</p>
<p>Each delegation regularly fills in a security questionnaire which it returns to the headquarters indicating the exact composition of the statutory and non-statutory staff and the composition of each of their families, which enables us to have an accurate list of persons present to be evacuated if the need arises. These lists are obviously submitted to the embassy, which includes the delegation in its evacuation plan.</p>
<p>These evacuation plans cover statutory staff, i.e: officials, young experts in the delegation, seconded national officials, individual experts (AIDCO and/or ECHO) and their families.</p>
<p>Following the example of the Member States, they do not cover employees under local contracts (Local staff, Local Technical Assistance Staff), or technical assistants that are directly under consultancies, who have to be registered with their respective embassies according to their nationality and follow their instructions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0184"></a>

<p>In 1999, Corsica lost its eligibility for aid from the Structural Funds as an Objective 1 region. Now, however, the French national statistical office (INSEE) has admitted that the figures which it used as the basis for the relevant calculations were incorrect. Eurostat recently published the true figure for Corsica for 2000 which shows that it had 75% of average Community GNP and not 82%, as the French authorities had claimed hitherto.</p>
<p>Given that Objective 1 concentrates the bulk of European structural aid on the least-developed regions, the error affecting Corsica has cost the island’s economy a significant amount in loss of revenue. Can the Commission put a figure on that loss? Does the Commission intend to seek an explanation from the French authorities for the discrepancy? If the Commission were to establish that an error had indeed been made, could a claim for compensation be lodged?

<p>(FR) The Commission confirms that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per inhabitant in Corsica was 82% of the Community average in 1994, on the basis of the system of national accounts (version ESA<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 1979). Article 3 of Regulation 1260/99 of 21 June 1999<a href="#defann_35_2" name="refann_35_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> establishes that ‘The regions covered by Objective 1 shall be regions corresponding to level II of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units (NUTS level II) whose per capita GDP, measured in purchasing power parities and calculated on the basis of Community figures for the last three years available on 26 March 1999, is less than 75% of the Community average.’</p>
<p>This percentage for Corsica rose to 84% in 1995 and 82% in 1996, still on the basis of the ESA 1979 system of national accounts. In all of the three years taken into consideration for eligibility in 1999, Corsica was therefore below the threshold of 75% of the Community average. It was not, therefore, eligible for Objective 1.</p>
<p>In 1995, the system of national accounts was changed. From 2001, regional GDP statistics were published on this new basis of national accounts, ESA 1995. For the most recent years available (1999-2000), Corsica is at 76% of the Community average, according to the new system of national accounts.</p>
<p>In future, the situation of Corsica, and of all other regions in the Union, will be analysed according to the statistics available for the years to be taken into consideration for the new planning period for the Structural Funds, i.e. initially 2001 to 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Morocco does not appear particularly keen to enter into a new agricultural agreement with the European Union.

How will the European Union avert such tensions? In the light of Morocco’s intention to establish a free trade area with the United States, does the Commission not think that Rabat might be trying to buy time so that later on, once the negotiations with the United States bear fruit, it has an extra lever with which to extract more substantial concessions from the EU, to the detriment of the regions of southern Europe geared to market gardening and adversely affected by this context of uncertainty and barely controlled competition?

<p>(FR) The agricultural renegotiations of the association agreement between Morocco and the Community are not progressing as the Commission would like. The difficulties that Morocco is having in granting preferential access to the Community under the terms laid down in the Barcelona declaration of 1995 are among the main reasons for this impasse.</p>
<p>That declaration, which Morocco signed up to, establishes a greater liberalisation of agricultural trade and includes progressive liberalisation of trade on the basis of traditional trade at zero duty.</p>
<p>Currently, the Community imports around 95% of the agricultural products from Morocco (including tomatoes) at zero duty, either unlimited, or on the basis of tariff timetables and/or quotas set at a level that is at least equal to or higher than traditional imports, while Moroccan imports at zero duty from the Community are non-existent.</p>
<p>Despite the difficulties encountered, the Commission, in close coordination with the Member States, is trying to complete the negotiations as quickly as possible. Regardless of other negotiations, this objective is shared by Morocco, especially given that it is seeking to obtain a lasting and indisputable legal concession from the Community for its exports of tomatoes before the forthcoming trading season.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0190"></a>

<p>The weedkiller Paraquat is made from a persistent, acutely toxic chemical for which there is no antidote. Paraquat is dangerous both to people and to the environment, and is banned in a variety of countries including Sweden, Denmark and Austria.</p>

The Commission itself has proposed that it be included. How does the Commission justify the proposal to include Paraquat in Annex 1 to Council Directive 91/414/EEC, in the light firstly of the well-known harmful effects this weedkiller causes, and secondly of the fact that several EU Member States have already banned its use?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission can confirm that the evaluation of paraquat under Council Directive 91/414/EEC is now almost complete and that the scientific risk assessments undertaken have demonstrated that there are some uses which meet the safety requirements of the Directive. This has also been confirmed by the independent Scientific Committee on Plants. Therefore the Commission, acting as legislator and risk manager has to decide on whether and under which conditions the substance may be included in Annex I to the Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently reflecting, with the Member States, on the various options available for managing the risks associated with the use of this substance. And let the Commission be clear on this - there are risks to be managed for paraquat and where these are unacceptable, restrictions will need to be imposed.</p>
<p>The Commission also needs to be clear about what inclusion of a substance in Annex I means. It does not necessarily mean that the substance is safe under all conditions - it means that it can be used safely. The world around us is full of unsafe everyday substances ranging from medicines, to the petrol put in cars, to bleaches used around the house and so on. The Directive stipulates that substances can only be put in Annex I by the Commission and products containing them be authorised by Member States if they can be used safely. One of the tasks of the Commission and the Member States in the coming months will be to decide on how this may be assured for paraquat.</p>
<p>The Commission has also been asked to comment on the proposal for inclusion in the light that paraquat is banned in several Member States. It actually has two comments on this aspect.</p>
<p>Firstly, the fact that a substance is at present banned in a Member State is not pertinent to the question of its inclusion in Annex I to the Directive. 97% of the substances covered by the Directive are banned in at least one Member State - for various reasons and not always related to safety. European agriculture - in fact even the agriculture of any one Member State - could not survive with only the remaining 3% of substances. Of course when the Commission evaluates substances it relies on a risk assessment that addresses all safety concerns, including those that have led to the substances being banned in a Member State. If substances are banned for other reasons, then the Commission should recall that one of the objectives of the Directive is to remove unjustified barriers to trade.</p>
<p>Secondly, the principle of subsidiarity enters into play here. Putting a substance in Annex I means that Member States may consider authorising products containing that substance. However, it does not oblige them to do so. If they receive requests to authorise products for which they have safety concerns they can refuse to grant authorisations. All the Directive does is ensure that such refusals are not arbitrary. It seems clear to me that any products that cannot be used safely will simply not be put on the market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is seriously concerned about the recent detentions of journalists and opposition supporters by the Cuban authorities. On 26 March, the Union adopted a declaration strongly condemning this incident. This was followed by a troika demarche in Havana. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation through our recently opened delegation in Havana.</p>
<p>As it was said in the Union statement on ‘human rights in the world’ at the Commission on Human Rights given Tuesday last week (1st April),</p>
<p>‘The human rights situation in Cuba remains a cause of grave concern for the Union, despite certain positive developments, such as greater religious freedom, the fact the death penalty has not been applied for three years and the recent opening of a Commission Office in Havana. There are continuing violations of civil and political rights, including arbitrary detention, intimidation of political opponents and imprisonment on political grounds. In this connection, the Union condemns the recent arrest of more than 80 dissidents in Cuba since 18 March and calls for the prompt release of such persons considered to be prisoners of opinion. No democratic reforms have taken place in the country. Leading dissident Paya received the Union Sakharov prize for freedom of thought for his work on the Varela project; but the Cuban government has yet to react publicly to the project. The Union deplores the recent rejection by the Cuban government of a visit by the personal representative of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It calls upon the government to cooperate with United Nations human rights mechanisms.’</p>
<p>The internal human rights situation is and will remain an important aspect of the Union relationship with Cuba. The Commission believes that a policy of engagement and dialogue is the most likely to help bringing about a positive evolution in this respect.</p>
<p>As far as the Cuba’s request for accession to the Cotonou Agreement is concerned, the Commission believes that it would be a better framework to continue the dialogue with the Cuban authorities and accompany progress on all fronts, including human rights. As article 9 states, the respect of human rights, democracy and rule of law are essential elements of this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission further considers that with its application, Cuba has signalled its willingness to comply with all issues of that Agreement, including human rights, without preconditions and in a mutually agreed framework. This means that Cuban membership of Cotonou - far from letting Cuba off the hook on human rights and democratisation - would be a platform for strengthening a real Union-Cuban dialogue on these issues.</p>
<p>This view was shared by many representations of the Cuban opposition met by the Member of the Commission in charge of Development and Humanitarian aid to Cuba.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0201"></a>

<p>(EN) The United Kingdom Communications Bill, as currently drafted, provides for the introduction of ‘Recognised Spectrum Access’ (RSA), which would be available for transmissions in particular from outside the United Kingdom (UK) intended for reception in the UK. RSA would confer the benefit that OFCOM would aim to ensure that interference from other sources should not exceed a certain level. The exact scope of RSA is not specified further in the Communications Bill. However, in the consultation document on RSA issued by the UK authorities in July 2002, it is mentioned that the objective of RSA is to optimise use of spectrum in the UK, and that RSA would be introduced selectively, for example in spectrum used by satellite services where such use constrains the development of terrestrial radio systems. The consultation document states that RSA would not be mandatory, but an interested party which did not apply for RSA could not avail itself of its benefits.</p>

<p>(EN) Recognising the importance of the water challenge, and in particular of providing access to safe water as a basic need, the Union launched the Community Water Initiative during the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>The Community Water Initiative builds on the policy defined in a Communication from the Commission and the resulting Resolution adopted by the Council in May 2002. Within the over-arching framework of ‘Integrated Water Resources Management’, based on a river basin approach, a first priority of Community action is to ensure a supply of sufficient, good quality drinking water, adequate sanitation and hygiene to every human being, especially the poorest and with a clear focus on the needs of women and children, with the general objective of reducing poverty and improving people's health, quality of life and livelihood opportunities.</p>
<p>In order to achieve these goals, good governance, political and sectoral reforms are necessary. Awareness raising, institutional strengthening and capacity building activities must be supported, while ensuring participation of all stakeholders and ownership of policies and strategies. Partnerships between public, private and civil society actors have to be promoted, ensuring that those partnerships remain equitable and transparent, allowing free and reversible choice on water services management, safeguarding consumers' and investors' interests and maintaining high standards of environmental protection. Pricing of water services is important in ensuring financial sustainability, although meeting the basic needs of poor and vulnerable groups requires the design of appropriate tariff structures and collection systems.</p>
<p>The question of private sector involvement refers to a larger one, that of the reform of state-owned enterprises. While recognising that public companies needs to strengthen its commitment and re-focus its resources, there is a growing awareness that an adequate contribution is needed for supporting the Community Global Water Initiative. However, before deciding on a particular solution (including those involving the private sector), there is a need to objectively examine all the options in order to select the most appropriate one. There is a clear need to keep an open mind on these reform issues, by putting in place adequate regulatory frameworks and establishing monitoring mechanisms to ensure the protection of public interest.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0205"></a>

<p>(EN) 1. Member States have to transpose Council Directive 2000/43/EC establishing the principle of equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin into national law by 19 July 2003. Council Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation has to be transposed by 2 December 2003 (with the possibility of an additional three years to transpose the provisions on age and disability discrimination).</p>
<p>2. The Commission is in regular contact with the authorities of the Member States to support the process of transposition. Under the Community Action Programme to Combat Discrimination, a Legal Working Group has been established, made up of representatives of Member States in charge of the transposition of both directives. This Group provides Member States with the opportunity to exchange information and good practice regarding the transposition of the two directives.</p>
<p>The Commission has also set up groups of independent experts on racial discrimination (recently extended to cover discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief), disability and sexual orientation to provide additional information on the transposition of the Directives.</p>
<p>3. To date, Greece has not notified the Commission of its transposition of the directives. According to the information which has been given, it appears that Greece is at the early stages of transposition. The Commission is aware that the Greek Ministry of Justice set up a special preparatory legislative committee in September 2002, to provide recommendations to the Government on the transposition of Directive 2000/43/EC. The work of the Committee appears to be in its initial stages. No consultation process at national level has been initiated by the Greek Government so far.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Labour has organised a working group on the transposition of Directive 2000/78/EC.</p>
<p>Greece has not yet established a body for the promotion of equal treatment as required by Article 13 of Directive 2000/43/EC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The latest report from the Commission on car prices within the EU shows that some convergence in price differentials is taking place, particularly within the eurozone, although significant price disparities still persist. However, in Ireland, car prices are massively increased by the imposition of the Vehicle Registration Tax which totally undermines any price convergence that is occurring across the EU.

<p>The Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that, according to the Commission's latest report of 27 February 2003 on car price differentials within the European Union on 1 November 2002, Ireland is the fifth cheapest market in the Euro-zone as regards car pre-tax prices.</p>
<p>As far as retail prices for passenger cars are concerned, it is true that these prices are substantially affected by both the level of pre-tax prices and the existing taxes on passenger cars, which are very diversified throughout the Community in terms of structure and levels. So far there is little Community legislation or harmonisation of national fiscal provisions applied by the Member States. Approximation of vehicle taxation levels proved very difficult to achieve, due to the unanimity rule needed for decisions on fiscal matters.</p>
<p>The Commission presented in 2002 a Communication on taxation of passenger cars in the European Union<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which intended to launch a discussion with the Council, the Parliament, and main stakeholders on future options for action at Community and national levels. This Communication is currently under discussion within the Parliament, and hopefully, the Greek Presidency will bring it for discussion to the Council.</p>
<p>One of the main policy recommendations in this Communication is that Registration tax levels should be gradually reduced, with a view of Registration Tax stabilisation at low levels, and preferably with a view to its total abolition. To ensure the feasibility of this recommendation, the Commission suggested that the reduction of Registration Tax should take place in parallel with a gradual transfer of revenue from Registration Tax to Annual Circulation Tax, and to some extent to fuel taxes, over a transition period of five to ten years.</p>
<p>The Commission, based on the principles of the Communication, and in the light of the results of the consultation process, will consider submitting proposals for Community legislation, which would, inter alia, establish a Registration Tax refund system and general rules with regard to the method of calculation of Registration Tax on used cars, which are transferred between Member States.</p>
<p>These measures would, if adopted by the Council, on one hand provide definitive solutions to problems relating to double payment, or to disproportionate payment of Registration Tax, and on the other hand, would contribute to a considerable convergence in retail prices, both for new and second hand passenger cars.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission takes note of the reference to programmes concerning human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Uganda and Zambia and would welcome further information and evidence based results on these particular programmes before commenting further.</p>
<p>The Programme for Action adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994 lays down clear principles regarding sexual and reproductive health and rights. The Commission’s actions and policies in reproductive and sexual health are firmly rooted in the Programme for Action which states in paragraph 8.31 that:</p>
<p>‘Programmes to reduce the spread of HIV infection should give high priority to information, education and communication campaigns to raise awareness and emphasise behavioural change. Sex education and information should be provided to both those infected and those not infected, and especially to adolescents. Health providers, including family-planning providers, need training in counselling on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV infection, including the assessment and identification of high-risk behaviours needing special attention and services; training in the promotion of safe and responsible sexual behaviour, including voluntary abstinence, and condom use’.</p>
<p>The Commission supports this approach and emphasises the need to provide information that is clear, objective and which presents all the choices available.</p>
<p>Education is an important component of comprehensive programmes for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and improving reproductive and sexual health. A recent Union statement delivered at the United Nations Commission on Population and Development on 1 April 2003 endorses the need for good quality sex education that informs and enables young people to make responsible choices.</p>
<p>The values within the Programme for Action are about ensuring rights and promoting choices to make private decisions about one’s lifestyle and sexuality. It is not Commission policy to advocate one lifestyle choice over another.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
