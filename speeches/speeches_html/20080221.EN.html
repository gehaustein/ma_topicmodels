<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ambroise Guellec, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we are discussing two parliamentary initiative reports, but I feel both of them are extremely important for a number of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we are considering the Commission’s Fourth Report on Social and Economic Cohesion. This is a truly remarkable document, much better than the previous versions, and it constitutes a firm basis for all manner of reflections on the future of cohesion within Europe. It is also important because the brand new Lisbon Treaty establishes territorial cohesion as one of the EU’s main objectives. As we know, new and formidable challenges are now looming together with those we are already aware of, and cohesion policy must make a major worthwhile contribution to their consideration, to allow us to move forward to the Europe we want to see: that is, an effective, solidarity-conscious Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the Fourth Report show us? That social and economic convergence between the Member States is moving in the right direction, with a definite reduction in discrepancies in terms of income and jobs over the last decade, but also that there are still considerable disparities between regions, and occasionally within regions, with a frequent tendency to become more acute. Development is real enough, but is plagued by far too many imbalances. It is here that the new concept of territorial cohesion comes into its own, and this is where it must take centre stage in the continuation of regional development throughout the EU alongside economic and social cohesion. Implementing this will require an integrated approach among sectorial policies, and genuine multi-level governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we await with interest, and I must say with some impatience, the Commission’s Green Paper in September. There is an obvious need for a common language on this issue, as emerged from our discussions in the Committee on Regional Development.</p>
<p class="contents">The teachings of the Fourth Report project our thoughts to after 2013, since operational programmes for 2007-2013 are now in place at almost all locations. One of their main features is a credit earmarking system to channel the basic essentials of resources towards the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda. While we wish to stress the close relationship of priorities between the Lisbon Strategy and cohesion policy, we feel the latter must forge beyond this sphere and take up a position within a broader perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report firmly states that convergence on different levels is a prior condition for long-term competitiveness in the regions, and that in years to come complementarity of the two policies will be necessary to reconcile effectiveness and solidarity. Periodic assessment over the 2007-2013 period, which we are calling for, must allow us to confirm the appropriateness of the process, or to implement any adjustments that may be necessary in a properly informed fashion. Questions must also be asked as to the dissociation implemented over the current scheduling period between rural development and regional policy. Its relevance does not appear to be well established on the ground, and we feel that maintaining this separation after 2013 may pose a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report emphasises the new challenges to be faced by the EU and their substantial territorial impact. There are problems such as population ageing, climate change, energy, urban concentration etc. We feel that necessary and urgent convergence and an appropriate territorial approach for these challenges call for enhanced political and financial cohesion policies after 2013. In this perspective, Parliament will staunchly oppose, as it has always done, any attempt to renationalise the policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to finish, Madam President, by thanking the shadow rapporteurs, who were of great assistance to me in this task, for the large number of compromises we were able to achieve. I also wish to emphasise coherence with Mrs Kallenbach’s report. I think it would be good if a fully coherent whole were presented in the House today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Equally, I would like to thank the committee and group staff and Members' assistants. The stronger the community, the better the product!</p>
<p class="contents">I greatly welcome the fact that we are discussing the report by Mr Guellec and my own report jointly today. When it comes to the aim of achieving genuinely sustainable development in Europe, these two reports form a complementary whole. Cohesion policy is the hardware, as it were, with the Leipzig Charter and the Territorial Agenda being the software. These instruments can only work in tandem. The EU is equipped with the legal and financial competences through its cohesion policy. We do not have any real responsibility for regional development, urban and spatial planning. That is why a coherent policy – at local and regional level, the level of the national ministers and the EU level – is the prerequisite for sustainable European cities and regions. This is the only way to generate European value-added. The cities are the focus of opportunities and problems. They impact on rural regions and the immediate periphery. That is why we are relying on balanced development of the territory as a whole, on solutions which proceed from a holistic perspective and which at the same time are adapted to the specific situation. There can be no single solution, but there can be common principles such as the integrated approach, the partnership principle, horizontal and vertical, between the cities and the periphery, but also with the various actors who are directly concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We have achieved a great deal of progress at European level. Besides the Leipzig Charter and the Territorial Agenda, the First Action Programme under the Portuguese Presidency, territorial cohesion was included as a Community objective in the Reform Treaty. This strengthens Parliament's weight through shared competence and the codecision procedure. With today's debate, we wanted to deliver a statement from Parliament in advance of the Council's Spring Summit so that territorial and urban issues can be included as clear components in the Lisbon and Göteborg strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also the joint wish of the Informal Council of Ministers in Leipzig that the Slovenian Presidency should put the Territorial Agenda on the agenda for this year's Spring Summit in order to achieve greater political recognition of the territorial framework for the development of regions and cities and new forms of participation in the EU's political decisions. This was clearly reiterated at the meeting in the Azores in November. So far, I have no real information available about progress here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore have greatly welcomed the presence of a Council representative here today, so that we could have obtained this information about the status of the preparations. Regrettably, I have heard that there is apparently no consensus in the Council to comply with the Ministers' request. I would have liked to hear from the Council whether, and in which form, the Territorial Agenda is to be discussed at the Spring Summit. I would also be interested to hear whether it is true that in the current draft of the Council's Conclusions, no mention is made of territorial issues and nor are relevant amendments envisaged in the Treaty of Lisbon. However, that is the only way to turn our many fine words into real action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission fully shares your views that European cohesion policy has played a major role in narrowing disparities across the European Union and thus fostering European integration, and also getting the Union closer to its people. Therefore, the Commission firmly rejects attempts to renationalise this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also share your view that adequate financial resources for cohesion policy must be guaranteed in the future in order to deal with the anticipated new challenges which will affect all European territories. We have also to keep in mind that, at the same time, cohesion policy will have to continue to cope with regional disparities resulting from the most recent, and forthcoming, enlargements.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me reassure you that, in the context of the ‘Lisbonisation’ of our policy, the main priority of European cohesion policy is, and will remain after 2013, the objective of narrowing disparities, as it is enshrined in the Reform Treaty. The solidarity dimension of the policy is central to this policy and the allocation of resources will certainly follow an inverse relation with the prosperity of countries and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">This view is also shared by an impressive majority of stakeholders across the Union. What is also shared is that European cohesion policy is much more than just a distributive mechanism of resources between Member States and regions; this policy is first and foremost a development policy whose objective is to foster the endogenous development of all European regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also shares your concern about the need for more coherence between European cohesion policy and other Community sectoral policies, especially rural development, research or competition. I would add here that the need for coherence between the different development policies also applies to the coordination between European cohesion policy and national polices. I am convinced that this is a key issue for the future of European cohesion, also in its territorial dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully share your view that the success of the territorial agenda and the Leipzig Charter depends on two conditions. First, we need to put in practice an integrated approach to the territorial development in order to avoid a piecemeal approach to our territories. A classic example here is thinking in categories of purely rural or urban strategies, which misses the key importance of the true economic regions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the integrated approach means also the need for integrating different sectoral policies both at the EU and Member State level, which affect the development of all our territories.</p>
<p class="contents">The second condition, as you rightly point out, is the need for the Commission to monitor and to assess regularly the progress in the implementation of actions agreed under the territorial agenda, and here we need to know more about the effects of these actions in the Member States so that the Commission can offer them adequate assistance. For example, on the basis of better monitoring, the Commission can further progress in the area of defining indicators of territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly the Commission sees as good news – as does your report – the introduction of the notion of the territorial dimension of cohesion in the Lisbon Treaty, and now we have to make the most of this new dimension of cohesion policy and the avenues it opens up such as, for example, the new definition of subsidiarity giving more weight to local and regional authorities. That is why the Commission included the Green Paper on territorial cohesion in our legislative and work programme for 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if there is no standard definition of the concept yet, territorial cohesion synthesises the legal objectives of the Union to achieve a sustainable balance and harmonious development of its territory and also to provide equity of access to services of general interest. We are all aware today that there are a number of aspects of territorial balance in the Union which threaten the harmonious development of the Union economy and society in the years to come. They are at EU, national and regional level and also in some specific areas and with regard to outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to confirm that the key recommendations made in Ms Kallenbach’s report, as regards the definition of the concept of territorial cohesion and the implementation of an integrated approach to territorial development, and also the improvement of the synergies between Community policies, are all taken on board in the preparation of our Green Paper that will be adopted by the college next September.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also use this opportunity to inform you that we are progressing with the Member States in our common understanding of territorial cohesion and its key components. We are currently working on the responses to the questionnaire which we have sent to 25 Member States on territorial cohesion, thus clearly making progress possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also established in the Commission an inter-service group which is giving us a framework to work in-house on territorial cohesion, and we have already completed the first part of this exercise: the identification of the territorial dimension of key EU policies. We have now embarked on the process, specifically on the process of developing some tools which also match your request. As you probably know, investigating territorial impact assessment of policies and also developing territorial cohesion indicators are among the priorities of the new strengthened ESPON programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards urban affairs, in March we will have the next Urban audit which is currently finalised and the second report on the state of European cities is due for June 2009. URBACT II has now been upgraded to a strategic instrument for networking and for exchanges in urban development.</p>
<p class="contents">My feeling is that we have, in the case of both reports, a high coherence of your views and of those of the Commission, and I now look forward to the debate for a better understanding of your concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As permanent rapporteur on the structural funds for the Committee on Budgets, I also wish to elaborate very briefly on budgetary issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy is now one of the most significant policies for solidarity between the peoples of Europe in budgetary terms. Today, as we have already heard this morning, the major issue is increasingly optimising the efficiency of cohesion policies. The Committee on Budgets wished to draw Parliament’s attention to a number of disturbing signs such as completion delays and commitments outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise what I feel are a number of salient points within this problem. The EU must urgently make it a point of honour to simplify procedures, such as implementation of technical assistance, with a view to preparation and execution of many projects our countries need.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also proceed with a clear distribution of responsibilities between the EU and the Member States to ensure better shared management, and I welcome the Commissioner’s words in relation to Tuesday’s decision to adopt an action plan on audit strategy for structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Something I have been pointing out for a long time now, which I am also glad the Commissioner has just mentioned, is the need to provide both qualitative and quantitative performance indicators common to all the Member States, in order to assess budget needs and help define the next legislative framework for the post-2013 multi-annual period and, in a word, to improve the clarity of Europe’s presence in relation to EU policies and European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also regret that the financing for the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), in a Union with 27 members, does not differ significantly from the budget of the FIFG (Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance) in a Union with 15 members.

I would like at this point to thank Ms Kallenbach and Mr Guellec for their excellent work and their open-minded approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The two reports, as both rapporteurs mentioned, are complementary and should be considered together. Territorial cohesion, by virtue of its inclusion in the Lisbon Treaty, has become as important a concept as economic and social cohesion. But territorial cohesion as a concept is the least researched and the least understood. Territorial cohesion so far even lacks a clear definition. The general aim of cohesion is to even out differences, but these differences still persist and they are most pronounced in the border areas between the former Eastern block and the democratic West. Territorial cohesion, in my view, also includes cohesion of towns and country. It is indisputable that towns are the engines generating growth in the individual countries and therefore it is right to include the question of urban development in our motion for a resolution and at the same time call for strengthening of the integrated approach. However, in the future it will be necessary in this regard to improve and simplify access of urban areas to structural funds and foster better links between municipal authorities and developers when financing projects of urban development from private funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adopted the Leipzig Charter and now we must gradually start putting it into practice. At the same time we must create the right conditions for life in the future, for the development of our countryside. I am convinced that we should analyse very carefully whether it is best to include rural policy in the common agricultural policy or whether we should be considering a different solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, just one closing remark. The debate on cohesion policy is above all a debate on the allocation of funds. It is evident and it is right that cohesion policy is getting stronger and is beginning to show in the European budget. Cohesion policy will have to deal with new phenomena, such as the aging and dying out of the European population, the instability of energy supplies and the deterioration of the environment. It is therefore necessary to modify the policy accordingly and ensure sufficient funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have used these two reports in order to address this as an issue. In fact, we have drawn together everything that we think is important in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you, however, that we should be mindful of the strategic objectives of European cohesion policy, namely narrowing disparities in living conditions between the European Union's regions and supporting the Lisbon and Göteborg strategies. If the European Parliament wishes to play a role in shaping the future cohesion policy, it must, in my view, concentrate on key strategies rather than reverting to the 'watering-can' principle. We must face up to the new challenges arising in the context of cohesion policy. Let me give you just a few examples: demographic change, climate protection, regional depopulation, and also, indeed, a modern European urban policy.</p>
<p class="contents">From my perspective, the 'equal opportunities for people and regions' approach is essential for solutions in this area. I believe that more investment in education, research and innovation and their infrastructures is important, and increasingly so, and is genuinely sustainable, in my view. However, this can only work if, in future, we involve European citizens more effectively in the development of programmes and projects, as the European Parliament has demanded for a long time and does again in these reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to appeal to the Member States – I think it is regrettable that no Council representative is here – and point out that we are giving them some homework to do. If we are to fund additional tasks in the framework of cohesion policy, the financial resources that are needed for this purpose must also be made available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They also note the growth in countries that were formerly lagging behind, for example Greece and Portugal. At the same time, however, they confirm the marked failure of this policy as regards approximating the level of development between regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States unfortunately condone undue concentration of investment and other elements of development in national capitals. A similar situation is true of the regions, where investment also tends to be concentrated in central areas, thus preventing the whole region from developing at an even pace. The differences within and between regions of the European Union are significantly greater than in the United States or in Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything points to the need to introduce a mechanism that would stimulate decentralisation within the Member States. A long-lasting but dynamic regional policy for the next Financial Perspective is needed. The report by Mr Guellec points in a considered way to the need to forge appropriate links between the Lisbon Strategy and cohesion policy. The latter must not become simply an instrument of the former. Cohesion policy aims at sustainable and harmonious development, and is an important end in itself. It is the cheapest way of preventing what can later prove to be very costly situations from arising. I have in mind conflicts, mass emigration and immigration, relocation of companies and similar events, which all represent an upheaval for local populations.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Lisbon Treaty, the report adopted today emphasises the importance of the territorial dimension. There is an urgent need to clarify this concept, however, and establish an unambiguous definition of what the territorial dimension involves. At present we are using this term somewhat blindly, and it can be understood as meaning many things. There are parts of Mr Guellec’s report where this notion takes precedence over the policy of economic and social cohesion, whereas in others it is presented as complementary. In certain instances it concerns equal access to services, and in others it involves the balanced distribution of research centres, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is unfortunate that the debate on the Green Paper on the territorial cohesion is planned for the autumn, after the report on cohesion policy. The Green Paper should be debated much earlier. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The term cohesion has acquired special significance within the Union. References to the need to reduce differences between the various regions in order to unite national economies and support their harmonious development date back to the Treaty of Rome.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fourth Report covers the years 2000-2006. It is the subject of the Guellec report, which contains many valuable findings. This report presents a summary of the situation in all the Member States. It also highlights the areas where disparities are greatest. Narrowing disparities in those regions must be perceived as a long-term undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">The report tabled by the Commission contains many comparative parameters that were lacking in earlier documents. The suggestion of using indicators supplementing basic GDP per capita in relation to different NUTS levels remains, however.</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion policy is the foundation of integration and makes a valuable contribution to the harmonious development of the Union. Its regional, local and environmental aspects are important in this context, as Mrs Staniszewska has already mentioned. We should also recognise its impact on the Union’s innovation and competitiveness, and therefore on implementation of the Lisbon Strategy. Demographic issues are important too, as certain areas are threatened with depopulation.</p>
<p class="contents">When we refer to cohesion we perceive it as economic and social. A sound definition of the term territorial cohesion is urgently required. Cohesion should be understood as ensuring that, regardless of where they reside, Union citizens enjoy equal opportunities for access to health services, education, culture, the Internet and transport, for example. Cohesion policy should be strengthened and improved with adequate Union resources. The urban aspect is particularly important, as Mrs Kallenbach pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">The question as to how to choose between cohesion or competitiveness, equality or efficiency has recently arisen. My brief answer is to choose both, in due measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The hope that the problems existing in the European Union could be resolved with the development concepts of the internal market, which were geared solely towards economic growth, remained unfulfilled, however.</p>
<p class="contents">The European internal market focussed the growth of economic activity on the centres of gravity which pulled in additional activity, at the expense of disadvantaged regions and the natural environment. And even in these centres, not everyone was able to share in the benefits; instead, poverty increased, triggering tensions and unrest.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the Commission is making the same mistake. It is subordinating cohesion policy to the Lisbon strategy. Instead of genuinely prioritising the problems of the particularly disadvantaged regions and only promoting sustainable development projects, it is investing in outdated infrastructural concepts and, in consequence, only in the economic centres. The municipalities and regions will become dependent on the major European banks for generations. In my view, this is a massive problem, because ultimately, it is the next generation who will then pay the price of failed development policies. And that in turn will trigger migratory movements – my colleague Mrs Krehl has already indicated as much – and it will also trigger an anti-European mood because some sections of the population will not share in the benefits. These are dead-end strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we must be very careful not to put the European Union's internal cohesion at risk. Economic and social cohesion must genuinely remain a separate policy area and the benefits must be available to all the regions and people in Europe. This can only happen if cohesion policy is genuinely underpinned by a social model based on solidarity and on sustainable development models which are not pursued at the expense of the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, regional policy is a key instrument for promoting the highly cherished economic and social cohesion. It is a structural policy which must have as its primary and principal objectives, as has already been stated, the reduction of disparities between the levels of development of the various regions, the encouragement of the least-favoured regions that are lagging behind, the promotion of real convergence and the stimulation of growth and employment. It must therefore serve as a factor of redistribution and compensation, as regards the increased costs of the single market, Economic and Monetary Union and the liberalisation of international trade, for the less-developed countries and regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the cohesion policy and its associated financial resources must be used to promote projects for economic, social, environmental and regional development. As a result, these projects must not be subject to a policy which has, as its priority and dogma, the competition, deregulation or so-called adaptability and entrepreneurship which are priorities of the Lisbon Strategy. In other words, we believe that competitiveness must not be a substitute for convergence in the Member States and regions which are lagging behind in their socioeconomic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the current Community financial resources for the cohesion policy are insufficient to meet the needs of real convergence, regional disparities, high levels of unemployment, inequalities in income and poverty in the European Union. We therefore reiterate the need to increase the Community budget, making the promotion of economic and social cohesion in the European Union the central and primordial objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The cohesion of European countries remains a fascinating theme. The integration of internal policy and cooperation between EU Member States and regions is increasingly taking shape. That such a strategy produces results is clearly shown in the cohesion report. Cohesion between the Member States has increased.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time it shows that cohesion between regions within Member States is decreasing, particularly between urban and non-urban regions. In my view, it is right in such situations for national, regional and local authorities to play an important role. I do not understand, therefore, why the option for Member States independently to increase their contributions to regional development has been rejected in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is too early to ascertain how long the current policy should be continued. That it presents some specific challenges is clear. But let us also examine whether it is able to solve the so-called divergence, i.e. not only cohesion at Member State level but also at a regional level, between and within Member States. As that will probably not be the case, a different approach with a larger role for Member States is desirable. No-one knows the national and regional situation better than the individual Member States. They can introduce solutions which will make the goals of cohesion at subnational level achievable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A Green Paper is also in the offing because, in Brussels, whenever a problem arises a paper has to be written on it. There certainly is a problem of cohesion between western Europe and eastern Europe, the Europe of villages and the Europe of cities, or the Europe of the upmarket districts and the Europe of working-class neighbourhoods.</p>
<p class="contents">But whose fault is it? Who depopulated villages where they tended vines and reared cattle, Madam President, in Greece, where they produced tobacco, cotton and olive oil? Who, and which policies, took away thousands of post offices in Sweden, Germany and France? Who closed down rural train stations, railways and maternity homes? In ports, is it the wind destroying fishing craft, fishermen’s livelihoods, small businesses and shipyards? Is it the wolves in the Pyrenees or the Alps that are eating up the shepherds, or lamb imported from New Zealand?</p>
<p class="contents">We all know the answer: it was the international trade policy conducted by the Commission through GATT agreement and the WTO that has been leading to the closure of 90 farms a day in Spain and France for the last 20 years. It was the dogmatic removal of customs protection that destroyed industrial balances beneath a wave of imports.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, in order to establish cohesion, first we have to establish coherence between policies. We cannot have one policy in Cotonou for the ACP states and then destroy this policy in Geneva over the banana trade. We cannot have a Community preference for rural produce between 1962 and 1986 and then destroy all this with free trade at the Uruguay or Doha Rounds.</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion therefore requires a certain amount of coherence between choices. Commissioner, either we build Europe or we build the world. Either we focus on social tasks, or we focus on the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It covers globalisation and its effects, it covers climate change, it covers the problems of energy and demographic challenges. It is good that we are doing this now, particularly in preparation for the spring recess this March. Mr Guellec has done everything very well. He has stated that the cohesion policy should not change in its essentials – which is specifically reconfirmed in the new Treaty – but that the content of the regional commitments and the programmes should change.</p>
<p class="contents">This week we have also looked at the Lisbon Strategy, and what strikes me is that we should continue strongly and make an express contribution, earmarking 60 – 65% of the cohesion budget to be committed to this end. This will show to what extent the core of the cohesion policy stands to meet the challenge of new circumstances. What is stated in the Kallenbach report is also important, that we consider territorial cohesion as a core function of the European Union. Globalisation focuses on a number of key regions, metropolitan areas, and Europe’s answer is that it is imperative that knowledge is shared and the conditions created for entrepreneurship in all regions, including rural areas. That is the new agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE finally resisted using renationalisation as an answer to the 2013 debate. This leads to the achievement of a new consistency between R&amp;D, innovation policy, the internal market and the nuts and bolts of the Union, coupling a knowledge-based economy – which will be implicated here in the long term – with high employment and prosperity in our regions.</p>

<p class="contents">European cohesion policy has been an example of a successful EU policy, which has abided by the principles on which it is based, and which has helped to remove inequalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Countries such as Spain have achieved indisputable results in terms of convergence thanks to the cohesion policy. We would therefore reaffirm its role in enhancing the potential of Member States for development and job creation through progress in training human capital.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we must also admit that territorial inequalities still exist, and therefore we must give a firm response if we are to move forward with a policy that has to tackle new challenges such as ageing or depopulation processes in certain areas, especially rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We must deal with the remaining challenges in order to reduce regional and interregional disparities and secure economic and technological growth, and this means that our focus on compliance with the Lisbon Strategy must be a priority issue, while not neglecting other matters such as demographic change.</p>
<p class="contents">If EU regional policy is to secure balanced sustainable development, it must be carried out in close cooperation with regional players and in coordination with other policies. We are likewise aware of the need to push forward specific measures in order to reduce disparities between accessible regions and those with structural disadvantages: mountainous areas, islands, or sparsely populated areas.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to the future, therefore, it is absolutely essential to reinforce cohesion policy with major economic resources to cope with all the challenges involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday we adopted the Lisbon Treaty in Parliament by a large majority, and today we must drive forward a new component of the Treaty, setting out territorial cohesion as a basic EU objective to make progress towards a more prosperous future for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is an initial stage, and I am extremely pleased and wish to congratulate the House since these close-knit reports between you, your associates, our committee and our Parliament have produced such a level of cohesion between our points of view. Now, however, beyond this cohesion, we must move forward with implementation, for it is all well and good to achieve cohesion among ourselves, but this must produce some specific results.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel this is possible by means of the Green Paper you are drawing up for the autumn, and here I would like to mention two items dear to my heart, which in my view are essential to implement the entire cohesion policy and the Leipzig Charter we desire so much.</p>
<p class="contents">The two items are: firstly, the necessity, which you have already mentioned and which I wish to reiterate in the strongest terms, of showing how different EU policies must be made coherent at the level of urban and periurban areas. Yesterday evening we were discussing population. Yesterday afternoon we were discussing transport. Before that we were discussing social issues. All the Commission’s DGs are involved, all the various EP Committees are involved ... All this must be made coherent within the microterritory of a town and its surrounding area. I expect a position to emerge from the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Second item. How could we, Parliament and the Commission, if we agree on all this, succeed if we do not have European citizens and governments on board? I have already told you, Commissioner, we must make a huge effort, and I know you are endeavouring to do so, in terms of communication, so that all our speeches, all our comments, all our hopes with regard to cohesion, emerge in words and phrases that will encourage governments to act and persuade and motivate our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the two main points, Commissioner, that I expect to see in the Green Paper. After listening to us, I trust you will help us find specific applications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These differences have become more marked in recent years, because significantly less developed countries have joined the Union in the latest enlargements.</p>
<p class="contents">It is estimated that these countries are more than 15 years behind the others. Swift development is the only way to level out the differences. This represents a considerable challenge, especially taking into account the cuts in financial resources and the limited opportunities the countries striving to move forward have to make use of them. It is unlikely that the success achieved in Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland will be repeated, certainly not quickly. It is also unlikely that we will catch up with the United States and Japan in the near future. We should remember, however, that the start is always the most difficult stage, and look to the Czech Republic for a positive example of how much can be achieved. Our citizens’ outlook on life has changed and is continuing to do so, which bodes well for the future. In addition, the Lisbon Strategy lays down clear guidelines for our actions.</p>
<p class="contents">As I conclude, I should like to thank our rapporteurs most sincerely for their statements. I see Mr Martínez is no longer in the Chamber, but I must add that I totally disagree with his intervention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We look forward to seeing her in Scotland again soon and to continuing our very fruitful cooperation on this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I make my brief points, I would echo Mr Guerreiro’s points about support for the fisheries sector within cohesion policy. We will be supporting his amendments, and I do think this sector is of particular strategic importance in our geography.</p>
<p class="contents">I would pick up on the rapporteur’s call for better statistics, particularly for the targeting and monitoring of the efficiency of funding programmes. It seems pretty clear, as things develop, that targeting at NUTS I, NUTS II or even NUTS III level is pretty broad and pretty scatter-gun. I welcome moves in the future funding streams towards more thematic activity, be it the Lisbon Agenda, the promotion of a knowledge economy, the promotion of R&amp;D, cross-border cooperation or, indeed, support for the fisheries sector under the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">That is, I believe, the future for a really vibrant cohesion policy for the European Union, which is very much the jewel in the EU’s crown. It has brought the EU closer to our citizens and it has made us one Union where the Member States would keep us a series of different states.</p>

Balanced regional development is very important. The focus of Mr Guellec's report was on ensuring that regional funds are sufficient and that they will focus on promoting the needs of the citizens and the needs of the regions effectively. The only way to deal with a cohesion policy is as an implementation tool for the Lisbon Strategy. I would like to thank the Rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland has benefited a great deal from cohesion money and in order for other countries to benefit in the same way we must ensure that increased resources are directed at promoting regional development and tackling social exclusion. Not only must the gap between Member States be decreased but we must also decrease these gaps within Member States as well as the gaps between regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Guellec reports on Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece's impressive growth rates between 2000 and 2006. He has highlighted, however, that in spite of this growth, there are great inequalities between regions within those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Kallenbach as well for her report and I especially welcome the emphasis placed on strengthening the role of local urban authorities in order to make access to public services available to every citizen. There is a need for local empowerment, respect for the environment and a high standard of public services to be universally available so that the urban environment is an attractive place to live and work in.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable development is a huge challenge within urban areas in the 21st Century and the framework presented to us today by Mrs Kallenbach can help us to face this challenge.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The answer, apparently, is to offer a vast catalogue of cultural, economic, technical developments and social engineering provision. It notes the success of such programmes in Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece to relieve these inequalities and encourages similar strategies, frameworks and action programmes to generate progress in affected areas, especially in eastern Europe. Above all it mentions cohesion funds. We get to the nub. EUR 65 billion on such programmes in needy western countries in the last few years, but eastern Europe is much poorer than those countries ever were. So these subsidies – for that is what they are – will be taken from those countries still receiving them and from an ever smaller pot as the chill economic winds from the USA reach us.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately for all its citizens – the well off and the poor alike – these subsidies are self-defeating for they strip away initiative from people and produce a culture of dependency.</p>
<p class="contents">If you really want to help, listen to Professor Buchanan of the London School of Economics. His paper states clearly that ‘to help a poor country, trade is worth six times more than aid’. Will you ever learn that? Or, to put it another way, if, in a poor country, you give a starving man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and you feed him for life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the rapporteur on all the basic issues and congratulate him on his good work. He rightly emphasises that the anticipated new challenges can be dealt with only if cohesion policy remains a Community policy, which is anyway in accordance with the Treaty. His report clearly rejects, therefore, all attempts to renationalise this policy. The prerequisite, however, is a balanced cohesion budget for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, adequate resources must be available in order to safeguard the harmonious development of all regions in the EU and deal with the new challenges. A different view exists, however, regarding the choice of wording in the report on the demand for financial resources for cohesion policy post-2013. Like many of my colleagues, I do not feel it is right that at this early stage, in 2008, the report should contain anticipatory demands for more financial resources for the future, not least in view of the fact that we are quite rightly facing criticism that we do not always draw down, on time, all the funding which is already available.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee has therefore found good compromise wording which, however, only applies to the text of the resolution and not to the recitals. So we should not include any conflicting statements in the recitals, but should remain consistent with the wording 'adequate resources for a balanced cohesion policy'.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, this is about credibility: in the past, cohesion policy has been able to achieve sustainable successes and can do so in future too if it is adequately resourced, without our calling for more financial resources at this stage. Commissioner, you referred in your introductory statement to adequate financial resources to deal with future challenges. That is a good formula. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Jean-Jacques Rousseau must certainly have favoured the integrated approach. It is a method that falls directly within the scope of this approach of building cities and not fragmented towns, as set out in the Leipzig Charter and the Territorial Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to thank all those responsible, especially Mrs Kallenbach, for their excellent cooperation on this task. I welcome the scope of the proposals in relation to social and economic aspects, the environment, spatial development and territorial cohesion, and likewise the close attention paid to proposals intended to improve the report submitted by our Socialist Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Paying closer attention to the territorial and urban dimensions of EU policies, especially through integrated development plans and better cooperation between urban and periurban areas, will draw all the benefits out of this integrated approach. Cooperation, however, must not end there. Provision must also be made for a relationship or some kind of connection between rural areas, urban and periurban areas. Here I must stress the importance of stimulating the attractiveness and competitiveness of rural areas as a tool to combat the mass exodus from the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">If the main points in this report had to be specified, my first mention would be the urgent need to create integrated multimodal transport networks supported by Europe to improve infrastructures, especially environment-friendly transport such as bicycles and walking.</p>
<p class="contents">Identifying the signs of decline in certain areas and stepping up work to implement a social integration policy constitute a framework for a public policy to reduce inequality in an efficient manner and prevent social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Positioning human beings at the very centre of the construction of infrastructure policies by reconciling urban concerns with human concerns, and all the more so within the current context of a housing crisis, in a society where not everyone has a roof over their head, and placing more emphasis on decent affordable housing, are still essential, and constitute a crucial factor of social integration and standards of living in cities, within a context of sustainable urban development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that I call on all my colleagues to vote <span class="italic">en masse</span> in favour of this report, which demonstrates the EP’s wish to support the sturdiest form of territorial cohesion and a comprehensive integrated approach that will finally allow us to build the city. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For, even in those that can be classified as relatively prosperous overall, there may still be certain groups that are disadvantaged or excluded. This may be a matter of their territorial location. Inhabitants of islands and mountainous and scarcely-populated border and peripheral areas can be cases in point. So, too, can fisheries-dependent communities, particularly when they are to be found in areas of the kind just mentioned. Which is why I, too, very much hope that Parliament will approve Amendments 19 and 20, which seek to reinforce their position.</p>
<p class="contents">But disadvantage and exclusion may be at a more distinctly social level. I am thinking of a project back home in Aberdeenshire called Can-Do. It has provided occupation for people with learning difficulties, in sorting cans and bottles for recycling. It lost eligibility for European support when funding for the current period was relocated to parts of the country where deprivation is more widespread. But the people concerned remain just as much at risk of social exclusion as before.</p>
<p class="contents">Both examples show that, if we are to target funding at those most in need, we need to develop a more sophisticated approach to quantifying that need. I ask the Commission to pay particular attention to the call in the report for improved statistical tools to allow more accurate measurement of the extent of cohesion and better assessment of the contributions of local actions aimed at achieving it. Such tools would also allow us to pinpoint actual cases of disadvantage and decide how they can best be addressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The latter contains information and analysis regarding the effectiveness of cohesion policy. In effect, pursuant to the procedure adopted, it represents the first stage in the debate on cohesion policy in the new programming period. Mr Guellec's report therefore presents proposals as well as opinions on the analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on the future of cohesion policy must take account of the new conditions and challenges. Ongoing implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, climate change, changes in energy policy and appreciation of the implications of migratory processes mean that the European Union is facing new challenges. All this also means that action must be taken to reduce new disparities in development. Obviously the question arises as to which actions should be financed from common funds and which should be undertaken as Union policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate on the future of cohesion policy we refer to the debate on the future of the European Union. We often speak of a so-called Union of action or Union of results and of a Union such that it is appreciated and accepted by its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are aware that so-called reformers are promoting new solutions, such as, for example, renationalising cohesion policy. In essence, that would amount to negating the policy of solidarity. We must bear in mind that the Member States are implementing their own internal policies to narrow disparities and that they are doing so independently of European funding, drawing on their own resources. The richer countries are therefore proving most successful. In effect, renationalisation will amount to restricting cohesion policy and we must oppose that. Accordingly, if we want to create a so-called Union of results or Union of action, we must strengthen cohesion policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just as the outermost regions have had a special strategy, we now need priority treatment and a strategic approach for the least prosperous regions, in order to overcome their specific difficulties, which are a combination of socioeconomic problems and territorial and spatial characteristics.

<p class="contents">That situation goes to the very heart of cohesion policy and clearly indicates the need to include a significant territorial dimension in all policies, but particularly in the Lisbon Strategy. I have seen this situation occurring in my own country, Ireland, where convergence with the EU average has been achieved – indeed surpassed – but where the economic gap between different regions is widening. It is extremely important that this gap does not continue to widen, and one of the ways of ensuring this is to increase investment in innovation, research and development in those regions that are lagging behind.</p>

We are all aware of the role played by physical capital, natural capital and human capital as the basis for economic growth and development. However, social capital, which is the latent resource residing within and among cooperating groups, provides the added value. Data from the UN Handbook, which relates to a very significant number of countries, indicates that the contribution of social capital to economic growth is in the order of 5% of GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in response to the comment by Mr Clark, who suggests we should have ‘trade not aid’, I would say that in the EU we manage both – trade via the single market and targeted aid where needed. That is the best of both worlds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the main challenges facing the development of the Union is the swift spread of built up areas, together with energy consumption, transport and demographic changes, such as the depopulation of certain parts of the Union and the widening disparity between richer areas and less affluent ones. An integrated development policy focusing mainly on modernising infrastructure, improving energy efficiency and introducing cheap environmentally-friendly transport will help to ensure continuity in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aim of the strategy in question ought to be focusing on the development of rural areas so as to make them more competitive, and thus slow down the depopulation of those areas, which is so significant for the new Member States. I would also like to draw attention to the importance of cooperation between urban and rural areas in order to promote the development of the territory as a whole. Access to information and communication technology should play a vital part in creating territorial cohesion and developing individual areas, and that is where our greatest problem currently lies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But does this require new European powers in respect of housing policy and spatial planning? There is a very big question mark here, to my mind. As regards Mr Guellec's report and specifically the prospects for future structural policy, the regional challenges posed by globalisation, demography, climate change, migration and so forth are all accurately described. The same applies to the political outlook.</p>
<p class="contents">We should stick to the tried and tested objectives of structural policy, and we should supplement them with these new components. I welcome the integrated approach advocated by the rapporteur, also as regards the challenges arising in relation to rural development. However, we should be focusing, as a general principle, on the European value-added of these programmes to a greater extent. Whether in relation to cohesion, innovation or transnational funding, Europe should only be providing support where we can genuinely make a sustainable European contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve success in the future, we must also be looking more critically at the instruments hitherto deployed. The one-off operational subsidy does not create any European value-added, whereas long-term expansion of research, education and infrastructure certainly does! We can only enhance the efficiency of structural policy through greater transparency in the deployment of funding and through leverage effects, for example by funding loans and with more public-private partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we certainly have not exploited all our options here, I cannot support the rapporteur's blanket call for more money from 2014. We need to evaluate the current period first of all, and we need to gear our instruments more efficiently towards challenges such as climate change and demography. Then we can start demanding a budgetary contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">The blank cheque for the future currently being demanded in the report really cannot be taken seriously. I therefore ask you to support our amendment in the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report rightly recognises the enormous efforts made (particularly in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland) in terms of growth and convergence.

<p class="contents">In this respect, I made contributions aimed at clearly recognising insularity and remoteness as factors restraining development. In particular, in accordance with Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty and as stated by Commissioner Hübner, accessibility problems form one of the main obstacles to development.

<p class="contents">Cohesion policy is important because it has helped in the economic and social development of many regions. It has reduced the gaps between regions, brought regions closer to the norm and reduced disparities within them.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still much to be done. Uniform development has not been attained. There are divergences, which are acute in many cases. Any thought of a renationalising cohesion policy ought to be rejected. New Member States have joined, with regions that are very far removed from the norm. The term ‘territorial cohesion’ described in the Lisbon Treaty needs to be worked on and further analysed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, particular attention ought to be paid to isolated regions and islands, as in the case of Greece, where cohesion policies will significantly help the local population to stay put, find employment, have access to new technology and professional opportunities, and to comply to the Community norm.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, the terms in the cohesion policy report are correct: funding will need to be secured and increased, even for the period after 2013. The challenges are significant and the cohesion policy ought not to fall short or be delayed because of financial inadequacy when all parties recognise its usefulness.</p>

We are aiming to create a Europe where all regions are equal.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the latest enlargements, it has become increasingly necessary to strengthen the cohesion aim. This is because, according to certain estimates, at the present rate of economic growth, countries such as Poland, Bulgaria and Romania will take more than 15 years to reach a level of GDP equal to 75% of the average for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Full use of structural funds pursuant to Community legislation is a<span class="italic"> sine qua non </span>for reducing social and economic disparities between European regions. This applies especially to the new Member States. The latter are experiencing many problems. For example, Polish local authorities have recently had to cope with difficulties caused by the continuous fall in the value of the euro in relation to the Polish currency, thus reducing the actual value of Union funds allocated to the implementation of regional projects that had already been confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the cost of labour and production in Europe is constantly rising, which leads to an increase in the cost of investments funded from Union resources and to a reduction in the value of those funds in real terms. Consequently, implementation of many Union projects is threatened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In truth, with this report, more than with the assessment of the cohesion policy’s impact in 2000-2006, we have opened the debate on what type of cohesion policy we want for post-2013. Accordingly, I must make one comment on the present and three on the future.</p>
<p class="contents">My first comment is that, as shown by the Fourth Report, the cohesion policy continues to be essential for reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and for encouraging the least-favoured regions that are lagging behind or, in other words, for creating a European Union that is more harmonious and viable and has a greater sense of solidarity. However, we should not forget that, in addition to this essential objective, the cohesion policy has made a decisive contribution to the construction and expansion of the internal market, to the success of the successive enlargements, to the creation and consolidation of the single currency and to the increasing identification of citizens with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment is that the cohesion policy must now revamp its role, boosted and reinforced by the new territorial dimension to cohesion enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, by taking advantage of the diversity and complementarity of the territories and by firmly targeting the polycentric development of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Kallenbach, who I also congratulate, offers us some good guidelines in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment is that the cohesion policy must increasingly encompass and respond to the current challenges such as those represented by globalisation, migration, population ageing, climate change, energy diversification, research and technological development. In order to be coherent, we must therefore consider increased resources for a reinforced regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a new perspective for the most remote regions will be necessary to guarantee that these can continue feeling comfortable within the European area. It will be vital to find new answers to the serious problems, such as isolation, lack of accessibility and competitive disadvantages, that these regions face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are significant differences in the development of our regions, but if we look into it more deeply there are even greater chasms between individual areas within the regions. We have not managed to deal appropriately with liquidating rural poverty and bringing into line those areas that have fallen behind, within the framework of agricultural policy. There is a need for much greater effort in this area, within the framework of a renewed, integrated cohesion policy that is capable of turning round the negative processes in the areas that are growing poor.</p>
<p class="contents">The synergy between cohesion and the reinforcement of competitiveness must be strengthened, because they cannot be subordinated to each other. New challenges have emerged, such as ageing or even the matter of energy efficiency and climate change, which we must also deal with. For this very reason it is vital to reinforce cohesion policy, and we must reject its being put at national level. If we put solidarity and cohesion at the heart of the European project, the Union will truly be strong and competitive. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why I very much appreciate the adoption of the Territorial Agenda and the Leipzig Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">Cities have a unique responsibility for climate protection: this protection should be a priority at all political levels. Cities could help solve a bad traffic situation and lower global emissions causing the greenhouse effect by, for example, interconnecting different modes of transport and developing an infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians. I would also suggest that cities prioritise energy-efficient buildings and use already existing buildings for new purposes, instead of developing new sites.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that not only metropolitan regions but also suburban areas and rural areas are successful in meeting cohesion goals. This is why I appeal to the Commission to monitor such successful projects and to prepare, on their basis, a development model for smaller and medium-sized towns outside metropolitan areas. One of the characteristics of Europe, in spite of its relatively small size, is her geographical diversity. This is why it is necessary to be mindful of unique regional features and resulting differences, and to give people in different regions the chance to make use of the unique opportunities and potential offered by the areas in which they live. To me it is also very important to include, among our policy goals, the need to solve territorial issues relating to islands and mountain areas, border regions and sparsely populated regions, so that the quality of life of people who live there is also enhanced.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude I would like to stress that urban development must follow an integrated and well-coordinated strategy, supported at all levels by both the government and the private sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are debating the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion and the reports by Mrs Kallenbach and Mr Guellec at a time when the first subjects for the 2014-2020 budget plan are beginning to emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to link the two and to emphasise the importance of such a link. I do not fear that cohesion policy funding will disappear from the budget plan but I would not like to see the extent of this fund during the life of the next budget in any way reduced. In addition to that, as the rapporteurs rightly point out, major regional disparities still exist, including structural problems, and since this situation has worsened due to enlargement, it is necessary to contemplate giving more weight to this chapter of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As the reports correctly point out, the situation is so complex that we cannot solve it at Commission level. Although governments of the Member States play an important role in this matter, it is becoming more and more clear that it will not be possible to solve the problem without the participation of regional and local authorities. Their role lies not only in the possible synergy between them and the government in the process of making decisions on the issues of development in their territories but also in the responsibility for this development and, last but not least, in providing feedback about how development and cohesion are progressing.</p>
<p class="contents">Who can provide more information about the real development in a region, if not the people who live in it? Therefore I appeal to the Commission not only to include in its monitoring process the macro-economic indicators but to be creative and to draw on such information…</p>

I would also like to say that I understand the passion of Members from the new Member States. I know that it is far from easy to satisfy your constituents back in your own Member State, but you are now part of the European Union and, as such, like the rest of us, you will at times not get everything that you would like or want.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say to those who are merely playing on words that the difference between increased resources and sufficient resources is very small indeed. I certainly will be supporting the wording of ‘sufficient resources’.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes it is wise to recognise what you have achieved and bank it.

<p class="contents">The enlargement to 27 brought about changes in the nature of Europe. The goals now being set are different from those which existed at its genesis. The challenges to which we must now respond, such as globalisation, population falls, desertification of certain regions or climate change, combined with the increased frequency and scale of natural disasters, are much more demanding and require a greater effort on our part.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovation is also giving this policy new goals but, despite facing greater challenges and a larger Union, its budget has not increased in proportion. However, it has been adapted, in the name of solidarity, which has led, for example, to regions which were previously in Objective 1 now being regarded as wealthy regions not eligible due to the statistical effect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore imperative that the disparities are reduced through access to an adequate budget, without having to abandon certain regions in this vast Union to their fate.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon reinforced this need and firmly enshrined in law the territorial cohesion which is the most important aspect of the cohesion policy.

It is rather too early to assess the results of cohesion policy in the new Member States of the Union, but there is cause for concern regarding the obvious delays in use of current structural funding in those countries. Convergence between countries often masks deepening differences between regions and within them.

There are many points to which I cannot respond now, owing to the lack of time, but which I will take with me. These include the concerns expressed with regard to small and medium-sized towns, as well as the issue raised about urban transport development.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear link between the past and the future in your reports. You are in fact building a bridge, which is why I would like to say a few words on the stage reached in the public consultations on the future of European cohesion policy. We launched those consultations at the end of September 2007, and to date more than 100 well-elaborated statements and opinions have been submitted, not only by national, regional and local governments, but also by a number of European spatial planning associations, as well as economic and social partners, academics, research institutions and private citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">At the request of one of the governments, we have extended the consultations until mid-February, because there are still opinions being prepared.</p>
<p class="contents">A preliminary assessment of those opinions clearly shows there is overwhelming and impressive support for the policy. The direct impact on growth and development is pointed to, as is the fact that this is a policy that triggers new ways of thinking and also performs a very effective leverage role by attracting additional financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">There is strong interest in the delivery mechanism and broad support for all the principles we have jointly developed with the European Parliament in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also strong support for the need for this policy to respond to the challenges that you have been discussing today, and which are linked not only to globalisation, but also to demography, climate and energy, and restructuring in general, with strong support for the integrated approach.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues of importance you have raised today is how we will proceed with the Green Paper, which will be adopted by the Commission in September. We will then have a broad period – probably of four months – for discussion in all formats, not only on the web. In the mean time, our services are organising a meeting with the key stakeholders for mid-April. This will help us to take into account further views.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be prepared, if there is such a need, to organise a hearing with Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development and with any other institution interested in sharing with us its views on the Green Paper, ahead of its adoption by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue raised, which is also a concern for the Commission, was that of statistics and indicators. Through our analytical institution, ESPON, which we have strengthened very substantially, including financially, for the years to come, and which now has a significantly higher budget, we will endeavour to measure some of the new dimensions and some of the existing dimensions of territorial cohesion. That work is ongoing, and we hope to have the results soon.</p>

First of all, in relation to the observations made on the amendments submitted by the Committee on Fisheries, I must say immediately that fishing is an issue dear to my heart as a coastal MEP, but unfortunately we did not manage to add the committee’s amendments to the text that is about to be put to the vote. We regret this, but I feel it does not mean any less attention ought to be paid to a sector so important to certain EU regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that cohesion is a major European policy. I also think it was portrayed as a major theme in the House this morning. This is an important point, particularly in relation to future tasks. The Commissioner said earlier that we are dealing with a report, but obviously it is the future that interests us. She realises expectations are running high with regard to territorial cohesion, and what this represents once it is taken up in the Lisbon Treaty. We might say that the ball is now in the Commission’s court with, of course, our assistance and support, Commissioner. The job must be done, and it must be done well, on a joint basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to add that the fact that regional policy as a whole will now be a matter for codecision by the Council and Parliament will help us move forward together, to make this clearer for our fellow citizens, also a point I feel was solidly made this morning, and also to implement genuine solidarity to the benefit of regions which need it most. Both these concerns were pointed out most firmly this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">A huge task therefore awaits us. We welcome a policy that is essential to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Hübner. Commissioner, you have made it clear that, together with this House, you are interested in the practical steps: the integrated approach, indicators which produce measurable outcomes, the definition of the territorial dimension, the Green Paper. I think we will particularly need your help in ensuring that the Council is on board. Again, I think it is regrettable that no one from the Council is present at this important debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions drawn in these two reports must lead to an amendment of the Lisbon Strategy and must genuinely underpin the new Community objective, the territorial dimension, in practical terms; otherwise, they will be nothing but empty words.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make one final appeal to my fellow Members before the vote: let us be practical. Let's not only review and analyse again; let's make it a condition that we demand the integrated approach for the provision of funding from the Structural Funds, and let us establish clear commitments for the reduction of greenhouse gases as well. Climate protection must be implemented in the cities; otherwise, all our pledges at European and national level have no value at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This feature of European policy is the envy of regional integration initiatives in other parts of the world. The unique nature of the European project is largely due precisely to the notion of cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of regional initiatives in Africa and South America there are no funds for even a token cohesion policy. Plans for enlargement of the Union are often assessed in terms of the potential to conduct effective action in order to increase cohesion. It may be stated quite unequivocally that cohesion policy is a great success for the Union and for all its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the Union's own citizens assess it in terms of whether, in their view, cohesion policy is being implemented and is attaining its stated aims. In many Member States, especially in those that have acceded to the EU only recently, there are very high hopes of cohesion policy. It is hoped that solidarity will not prove merely a fine term, but will translate into a specific commitment to those who fate has treated less kindly. Cohesion is also an instrument for creating equal opportunities and a splendid advertisement for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that very reason that we should not consider limiting the financial resources allocated to increasing economic and social cohesion. On the contrary, we should contemplate allocating more financial resources to cohesion, if only because of the many new challenges arising. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was no accident that cohesion policy was devised when relatively less developed countries acceded to the European Union as these countries did not cohere well with the six original Member States. From that time on, cohesion has gained importance, becoming a pillar of European integration and central to treaties and budgets. The allocation of more than EUR 308 billion to cohesion in the framework of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is evidence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">A tendency to question this fundamental Union policy has arisen of late. Curiously, the tendency has coincided with the expansion of the European Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The latter have the most ground to make up, for historical reasons. That is why it is not proposed to do away with cohesion policy outright, but to radically refocus it, due to alleged waste of Structural Funds and abuses in the area. That is the greatest mistake we could make! Irregularities must be detected and eliminated, but it is precisely regional policy that makes the Union's presence felt in all 27 Member States. Cohesion means creating equal opportunities and a sense of fellowship and must not be subsumed into other policies. The latter, competitiveness and combating global warming for example, ought to have their own budget lines. Assessment of what should be financed within the framework of cohesion should remain within the competence of countries and regions. They have a far better understanding of their own needs than the Brussels authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In January this year, a new programming period for cohesion policy began. This will focus on new priorities and objectives: environmental protection, competitiveness, and the creation of more and better jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's cohesion policy is intended, through its four separate programmes, to help make Europe and its regions more competitive, for example through innovation, the development of the knowledge society, and strengthening economic competitiveness. It is also intended to increase the attractiveness of the regions for investors and residents through sustainable regional development. Better and above all more jobs are to be created, and the regions developed further in order to promote opportunities and reduce disparities. With its further enlargement, EU funding now has to be divided among 27 Member States. The money must therefore be used better, more efficiently and transparently.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the financial framework, the European Council has made EUR 307.6 billion available for the period 2007-2013. This is a great deal of money. It is important that regions with development problems in the wealthy Member States such as Austria also have a fair share of the funds.

It was a shocking experience to enter the Gaza Strip and come face to face with the everyday consequences of the occupation and blockade. 80% of the population is unemployed, the Israelis cut off the electricity and water supplies from time to time, many people only get to eat once a day, and the vast majority of the population have not been able to leave an area smaller than Budapest for years. As an Israeli professor said, Gaza is a prison, and its residents are prisoners from whom it is difficult to expect rational behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is also embittering that some Palestinian groups are using rockets from the Gaza territories to threaten the lives of innocent Israeli civilians. The crisis goes too far back for it to be solved in the traditional way. By now, both sides have become the prisoners of their own extremists and are unable to make real concessions because of them.</p>

Admittedly, a lot of good questions, trains of thought and solutions are enumerated. More and better relief for children must indeed be urgently provided, older workers must indeed also be provided with continuing opportunities within the employment markets, and health services must indeed urgently prepare themselves to face the challenge of the accelerated aging demographic.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, this Parliament is straying off course in considering immigration as an instrument with which to secure the demographic and economic future of Europe. Just recently, one of the British Prime Minister’s most important advisers, Lord Turner, described the axiom that immigrants are necessary to make up for the shortage of workers as, and I quote, ‘economically illiterate and completely incorrect’.

Under the framework of the proposed new working method, citizens’ queries and complaints should be handed back directly to the Member States in question. As the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, rightly pointed out, this new working method of the Commission, in other words the handing back of the complaint, carries an inherent risk of the Commission renouncing its fundamental responsibility for the application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I would also like to point out another fact, which has already been subject to criticism in the European Parliament: it is the lobby groups, which always manage to access the Commission’s notifications directed at Member States in cases of suspected breaches of Community law, while citizens do not. Yet it is precisely the citizens, whose submissions provide an irreplaceable source of information and alert us to breaches or non-application of Community law, not some interest groups with their own agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their implementation is essential to improving the effectiveness of European Union policy on, for instance, European Fund actions and harmonisation of standards for products goods on the Community market.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the appeal to national parliaments contained in the motion for a resolution is very important.

The removal of barriers, the cornerstone of EU free-trade policy since the very outset, and the creation of a business-friendly economic climate will reflect a high level of protection both for consumers, through the observance of high standards on health and product safety, and for businesses, which will benefit at last from a rigorous system of checks and balances to protect goods made in Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">The agreed compromise includes the transfer of some of the articles dealing with the CE mark to the report by Mr Brie on market surveillance, so that they can be put into practice more quickly. Our decision to do so was based on clear information proving that products made in developing countries and wrongfully CE marked, that is bearing the CE logo that indicates that a product is in conformity with European legislation, keep turning up more and more often in the European database of dangerous consumer products (RAPEX).</p>
<p class="contents">Trusting or not trusting the CE mark cannot be based on the CE mark alone, out of context. There must be trust in the entire system of accreditation, notification and market surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">I see no reason for introducing additional marking on products, not even if these were quality marks. Such new marking could be confusing for the end consumer and furthermore the extra cost could be reflected in the price of the goods. This is why I will curiously await the results of the impact study assessing the usage of national markings alongside the CE marking that the Commission should prepare, as requested by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new accreditation scheme for organisations whose products are certified as conforming to harmonised standards will entail administrative costs but will lead to a better result, a working internal market and more equal conditions of competition.</p>

It is a fact that the constant fall in natural growth in recent years, accompanied by an increase in average life expectancy, is likely to lead to significant changes in the population structure of the European Union by 2050. The changes will include general ageing of the population and a reduction in the number of persons working. This will result in a significant increase in the burden on Member States' budgets. The process will be a painful one not only for the individual Member States but also for the Union as a whole. The latter may be faced with losing its competitive edge and with a fall in economic growth compared to the situation in other parts of the world characterised by swift demographic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear too that this demographic imbalance will have negative consequences for the financing of social care and the sustainability of pension schemes.

Each year after the year 2010 the number of people at work will decrease by 1 million and that will threaten intergenerational solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand there are the problems caused by the decreasing birth rate; these problems have already existed for several years. Postponing childbirth until later in life may be the reason for an increase in infertility of couples. Protection of mother and family must be the focus of all EU policies. Pension systems must not punish women for being mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years the differences between the Member States have been reducing but at the same time the differences inside the individual Member States have become much deeper. Disadvantaged regions in particular are less developed and on top of that they are also the ones most affected by demographic changes, namely by population ageing and migration. Since there are not enough well-paid jobs, qualified workers leave for the big cities. Heavy concentration of economic activities in capital cities erodes the demographic, economic, social and environmental balance and leads to a population decrease in rural areas that often lack the basic infrastructure needed for development.</p>

<p class="contents">Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have recorded strong growth. Similar help must be available for the new Member States. Like everyone else who grew up and lives in a more remote region, I know that there are pronounced disparities between regions, and even inside individual regions. Sometimes these disparities are even greater than disparities between individual countries: disparities in living standards, in the number of jobs available, in income and in education opportunities. This is why I emphasise that there is a real need to reduce the disparity between territorially accessible regions and regions facing structural disadvantages. I see the way forward as prioritising such policies that would decrease the pressure on capital cities and support the development of second-tier cities.

<p class="contents">It has been an economic success story for many European countries and regions; there has even been talk of a miracle in some cases and, thanks to the proper implementation of cohesion policies, the quality of life has improved for many of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion plays an even more important role in the Europe of 27, with its pronounced economic and social disparities. The first effects of EU economic aid are beginning to be seen in some of the regions where development is lagging behind, even though it will only be possible to assess economic convergence on a longer-term basis owing to a very low initial GDP per capita.</p>
<p class="contents">Comparative circumstances will be different in the near future, but perhaps even today. Therefore the cohesion policy will have to confront other, new challenges having a strong territorial impact, such as demographic change, urbanisation and new urban planning, migratory movements, energy supply and climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">While voting in favour of the report, I would call upon the Commission and national governments to devise a joint approach for tackling these issues in an appropriately dynamic and cooperative manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The idea that it is right and necessary to ensure an identical level of development across all the Member States is a concept that we must not abandon and whose positive result we must celebrate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, not everything has been successful in this area. Firstly, it is essential that the cohesion funds are increasingly integrated with other funding programmes in order to guarantee that the benefits of these funds are not lost in the absence of a concomitant investment in policies directly aimed at more advanced stages of development. Sometimes it is necessary to take bigger steps, otherwise we will always be lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is worrying that we are seeing a constant process of retraction in the Portuguese State in terms of guaranteeing equal access to basic services throughout its territory. What point is there in calling for Community-level cohesion when this is absent from national policies, with citizens in less developed regions being abandoned in the name of, not a development idea, but a merely accounting-based view of the allocation of resources?

This crisis cannot be resolved without the involvement and cooperation of the East Timorese authorities. The latter must bring about the dissolution of all paramilitary groups and disarm civilians.

We would stress that such attacks can only increase the instability of the East Timorese political situation, created by the events of 2006 and 2007 and maintained by the political process resulting from the recent legislative elections in that country. We call for a thorough investigation, within the constitutional and legal framework of East Timor, to identify and try the main perpetrators of these attacks. We must be alert to any manoeuvres which, in light of these events, may aim to justify further outside interference and which may threaten the independence and sovereignty of East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore reject the joint resolution of the European Parliament which, among other aspects, seeks to ignore all the outside interference which has tried to condition and mould the free choices of the East Timorese people. Also, by trying to lump everyone together, it seeks to exempt from responsibility the main perpetrators and mentors of the violence and destabilisation of the situation in East Timor. It also seeks to ignore the fact that, in order to understand the current situation in East Timor, it is vital not to forget that its people were victims of colonialism, brutal repression and the destruction of their country and that its people heroically won their independence and sovereignty, in particular over their natural resources, in a fairly recent past, even after having been abandoned, at fundamental points in their struggle, by the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite referring to respect for the sovereignty of the people of East Timor, this resolution forms a basis for interference in the internal affairs of that country. In fact, it adopts a stance which seeks to present East Timor as a failed state. Finally, this resolution ignores the fact that the solution is political and lies solely in the hands of the people of East Timor. In the past, the East Timorese people have more than adequately proven their dignity and courage and we express our confidence in their ability, by their own hands, to declare East Timor a sovereign and independent state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also want to call for an independent investigation, as requested in the motion for a resolution before us which we support, to find out who carried out the attacks, what they represented and what has failed in the security system of East Timor, both within East Timor and, in particular, internationally.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this episode indicates that the international community must make further efforts to reinforce the state institutions of East Timor and, in particular, to reform the security system which was also called into question in the 2006 crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the issues relating to justice, compliance with justice and law and order must be considered. In this context, I must say that the attempts at national reconciliation with the rebel groups may have given a negative and counterproductive signal of impunity which has led the rebels to carry out this miserable attack.</p>
<p class="contents">East Timor is not a failed state and bears no similarities to Somalia with which Mr Onyszkiewicz has tried to associate it. East Timor gained its independence heroically, despite the international community’s silence, and the East Timorese people have already demonstrated on several occasions that they are committed to democracy. They once again demonstrated this in an exemplary manner in the presidential and legislative elections that took place last year during which I had the honour of heading up this Parliament’s mission.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community now has a responsibility to show its support for East Timor, to coordinate this support which it clearly failed to do in relation to the security system, and to resolve the basic issues of the structure of the East Timorese state. In terms of the signals given by the East Timorese people, there is no doubt that they want democracy and the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, on 11 February, crisis returned to East Timor, once again at the hands of the same people who were responsible for the crisis two years ago. This prompts us to ask questions about the return of those who would harm the stability of this country and the gravity of an attack which seriously injured, and could even have fatally injured, the President of the Republic, José Ramos-Horta, and which also, fortunately without any personal consequences, affected the Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmão.</p>
<p class="contents">The violence and the disruption of the normal functioning of the institutions have once again laid bare the failures of a country with the history and circumstances of East Timor, which courageously fought and is fighting for independence, democracy and progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone having supported East Timor from the beginning cannot fail to feel renewed sadness at this incident which we vehemently condemn. We hope that President Ramos-Horta will fully recover and we call for a thorough investigation into what happened and into the necessary response to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the international forces were slow to act, with the exception of the Portuguese GNR (National Republican Guard). There are also clear failings in the rule of law in East Timor which is not functioning fully and which has in fact never functioned fully. East Timor needs to rebuild the very core of its security system in order to ensure law and order.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must assist the East Timorese people in these steps. This is not a failed state; it is a state with failings that we must support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the main responsibility obviously lies with the East Timorese people who must try to achieve a cross-party compromise for lasting peace and respect for the rule of law and judicial decisions, without hesitation, without prevarication and without complacency. They have already managed to reach agreement on what we would call a national consensus with regard to the very core of the state’s operation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this consensus that Ruy Cinatti referred to in his poem which is the most pressing need of East Timor. As a result, dear friends, we must help the people of East Timor to help themselves and make their country stronger. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would, in fact, be a good idea if some of our friends, Spain included, for instance, took a leaf out of the Portuguese book and assumed their responsibilities in terms of legacies from former colonies, as is the case in Western Sahara.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, obvious that all these cases are no simple matter, nor do they produce immediate results. Mention must be made of the difficulties experienced by East Timor where, following peaceful elections a few months ago, there are still many disturbances, including an attempt on the life of President Ramos Horta. Here I wish to add my best wishes to those already sent by the House for a speedy recovery, and also to Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão.</p>
<p class="contents">No one, I feel, will dispute the willingness to reach agreement, as demonstrated by President Ramos Horta, among many others, and I am sure that even after this attack President Ramos Horta will lead any work that is required to find a political agreement between the opposing factions to settle differences in a democratic, non-violent manner.</p>
<p class="contents">For this, however, the international community must be fully committed, and the UN mandate renewed, as some countries have suggested. It must be renewed in any case until 2012 and at all times in response to the needs and requests of the Timorese Government and democratic forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN presence on the ground also ought to be in line with the needs of the country and should be reviewed not only in terms of reconstruction and dealing with basic necessities, but also in terms of the ability to act in a preventive fashion and react to disturbances.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the EU must set up a delegation in Dili as soon as possible and Parliament must also make arrangements for a delegation of observers to support the democratic forces in the country and to assess the focus and effectiveness of EU assistance at the present time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The young democracy of East Timor is still extremely vulnerable in its political, judicial and security institutions. The country is confronted with poverty and high unemployment, especially among the young people who have so far little expectations for a prosperous future and are amenable to violent groups.</p>
<p class="contents">In its meetings with the leaders of the country, the Commission has supported a peaceful settlement of the conflict, including the eventual disbanding and disarmament of any paramilitary group.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the 2006 violence, the European Commission has reacted quickly: firstly, with humanitarian assistance to the internally displaced persons; secondly, by supporting dialogue among the leaders; and thirdly, in implementing a cash-for-work programme for unemployed youth.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission also decided to open a fully-fledged delegation in Dili, and the new head of delegation is expected to start work in March 2008. The delegation will become fully operational towards the second half of 2008. This will create the opportunity for a formal political dialogue with the government and a faster assessment of support to the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy of the European Commission for East Timor under the 10th European Development Fund has recently been approved. It aims to support the still weak judicial sector, the Parliament and other institutions, thereby assisting in building up a democratic culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Support to rural development will help to alleviate poverty and to improve infrastructure. Health-related activities will contribute to tackling poverty-related diseases and reducing alarmingly high mother and child mortality rates.</p>
<p class="contents">Addressing the root causes of the present conflict and providing support for their solution will be as important as the longer term programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The East Timorese Government has submitted a comprehensive Governance Action Plan, which will be the subject of political dialogue between the delegation and the Government, supported by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In a mission during the next weeks, the Commission will assess the situation and the possibility of assisting with further measures addressing some of the root causes of the conflict. This may include requests of the Government to support some labour-intensive programmes to combat unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">In a joint Commission-Council paper of December 2007, both the Commission and the EU Member States supported the central role of the United Nations in coordinating the assistance to the security sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the envisaged support under the Commission programme, more than EUR 80 million, is comprehensive and will help to address many of the present problems of the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not mean we can be confident that things are moving in the right direction in Belarus. On that very same day, the homes of a whole range of individuals connected with the opposition in Belarus were raided. In addition a secondary school teacher was sacked. By way of explanation he was told that since he was a member of the opposition Civil Party he did not represent an ideology in line with that of the State.</p>
<p class="contents">A very strange situation exists in Belarus. In that country, there is a concept of state ideology, and therefore it is hardly surprising that when candidates apply to study journalism, law, and international relations, they have to present recommendations from the authorities. That is how the selection process works. This is totally unacceptable, although we do welcome the step taken and are cautiously pleased about it.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Belarus itself, the question that immediately springs to mind is what the underlying reason for such action can be. It would appear that through this action and by consenting to the opening of a European Commission delegation in Minsk, President Lukashenko wishes to demonstrate that he does not feel irrevocably bound to adopt a pro-Russian policy to the exclusion of all others. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly difficult to conduct such a policy in Belarus. The country does not wish to become totally absorbed by Russia. In this instance, even Mr Lukashenko has adopted such a stance, but events speak for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is quite simply buying up Belarus. <span class="italic">Gazprom</span> has just concluded yet another transaction, as a result of which it now owns one quarter of the shares in the companies controlling the oil and gas transit routes through Belarus. <span class="italic">Gazprom's</span> share will soon increase to 50%. It also seems that Russia will succeed in persuading Belarus to adopt the rouble as its national currency.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of all this, the situation is becoming increasingly threatening. Support for independent action in Belarus and for civil society is all the more necessary. Support is already being made available, but it must be scaled up. In particular, support must be provided for the institutions that have just been set up in Belarus. I could focus on television broadcasts to the country, which are an important resource for ensuring that the local people know what is actually going on. In my view, we should keep Belarus in the forefront of our minds, because this is an issue for Europe as a whole. We cannot tolerate a situation in which there is a country like Belarus, run by a dictator, in the very centre of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first one is the opening of the European Commission delegation in Minsk, which as far as I know, has also been approved by the President of Belarus. I believe that opening an EU delegation provides the bases for further development and activating of relations with the European Union in such mutually advantageous areas as energy, transport, transit and even protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The other positive factor I consider important is the meeting of experts in Brussels last June, which concentrated mainly on the issues of energy supply and also the planned expert talks on transport corridors and the environment. I consider this development to be extremely important. We must not forget that Belarus itself is still struggling with the extremely serious consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Present trends in mutual relations reveal that a certain view of Belarus has taken hold among the political circles of the European Union and that view is very critical and one-sided.</p>
<p class="contents">We need not just criticism but also cooperation. The time has come for a positive step on the part of Belarus as well, and I think that the official Belarusian regime should offer at least a moratorium on the death penalty, which could enable us to open new negotiations regarding the status of Belarus’ membership of the Council of Europe. On the part of the EU, I would welcome for example a relaxation of the visa system or support for young specialists from Belarus on work experience by providing them with opportunities to get to know the workings of the European institutions at first hand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent developments on the agreements to establish the European Commission’s delegation in Minsk are a positive step toward renewing dialogue with the European Union and Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to encourage the Commission to use the full potential of the opening of a delegation. The time has come for the international community as a whole to extend more support to civil society in Belarus, in particular to increase financial aid to the independent media, to non-governmental organisations and to Belarusian students studying abroad. The Commission’s decision to give financial support to the European Humanities University in Vilnius is very wise. The Commission and the Council should consider offering financial support to the project, which is already in existence, to create the independent Belarusian television channel Belsat.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Parliament calls on the Commission and the Council to take further steps towards the facilitation and liberalisation of visa procedures for Belarusian citizens. We call on Member States in the Schengen area to use all available tools, mainly national visa costs, in order to facilitate the movement of Belarusian citizens within each Member State’s territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we call on President Lukashenko’s regime above all to move towards liberalisation and democratisation, to release all prisoners of conscience in the country, to introduce the rule of law and freedom of media associations and to abolish the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to express this afternoon our solidarity with the United Democratic Opposition of Belarus, the leader of the democratic movement, Alexander Milinkevich, and all Belarusian citizens in their struggle towards an open society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The actions taken by Mr Lukashenko's dictatorship against his own people in Belarus are widely known. Since the beginning of this year alone, three peaceful demonstrations have been brutally suppressed. The authorities are systematically persecuting opposition activists. They have brought in restrictions on travel abroad by members of the clergy and religious instruction teachers. Some rather curious provisions have also been introduced. For example, anyone wishing to study law or journalism must be approved by the ruling authorities. Against this background, imposing stricter sanctions against Belarus unfortunately seems to be the only possible response to recent events. We must not forget, however, that it is our moral right and duty to create and support civil society in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the immediate measures to assist the opposition is to overcome the news blackout. A good example of this is the initiative taken by the Polish national television service, which began to broadcast to Belarus on 10 December 2007 through the first independent channel, called Belsat. Unfortunately, as Mrs Romaszewska, the producer responsible for this project, told me today, no financial support from the European Union has yet been received. There is not even a budget line from which human rights and democracy in Belarus could be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would remind you that the high cost of Schengen visas is another mayor problem for the people of Belarus. If access to the European Union for members of Mr Lukashenko's regime is restricted, we must make access to the Union easier for people who are not connected with that regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is the last real dictatorship in Europe. Belarus still has the death penalty, political prisoners, arbitrary arrests, media censorship, violence and restrictions on access to the internet. All Europeans should not take their liberty for granted, and young Europeans should follow the DEMYC example in showing solidarity with their neighbours by standing up for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus cannot be a partner of the EU while this intolerable intimidation and targeted arrests continue. Reading the official internet biography of President Lukashenko, I became aware that he considers himself to be ‘notable for his in-depth understanding of events, hard work, sense of duty, realism, fairness and fidelity to principles’. Why, then, can Mr Lukashenko not realise a very simple and plain fact: Soviet-style tyrants belong in the past?</p>

Dictator Lukashenko continues to ensure that his country systematically distances and isolates itself from its neighbours. He tramples human rights under foot and maintains the death penalty. This is not only a concern for us; it is also encountering massive opposition among Belarus's own population. More and more young people are leaving Belarus. It is a dramatic situation for that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's task is therefore to help Belarus to return to the path towards democracy. From my perspective, this will not happen with Dictator Lukashenko and his presidential apparatus, but only with the opposition, civil society and the young people who could form the country's future elite.</p>
<p class="contents">So I appeal to the Member States to change their visa policy for these people and give them the chance to engage in exchanges with young people in the European Union, a chance of democratic education and a chance actually to experience democracy for themselves by visiting the European Union. Visa policy must not become an insurmountable obstacle which obstructs the path to democracy. That is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">In negotiations with Lukashenko, however, there should be no concessions on human rights. There is consensus on this point in Parliament, across all the parliamentary groups: we want the release of all political prisoners, a moratorium on the death penalty, media freedom and respect for all the basic principles of democracy. That is the fundamental prerequisite for negotiations. No concessions. The crucial factor here is what happens at the next elections. I hope very much for the Belarusian people that they take control of their own destiny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could mention the Kazulin case that Mrs Gacek referred to just now, and the repression of national minorities, including the Polish national minority.

In addition, however, I should like to mention another very important issue, namely that we cannot deal with policy on Belarus in isolation from the European Union's eastern policy as a whole. We had a tendency to forgive the Russian administration a great many undemocratic actions. That should be borne in mind. I know that events in Belarus do not bear comparison with what is currently taking place in Russia, but they most certainly did and do bear comparison with what took place in Chechnya. We cannot adopt one course of action for Belarus and a different one for Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Conducting our eastern policy from the point of view of enlargement of the European Union is another very important issue. The fate of Ukraine currently hangs in the balance, and if it swings towards democracy it will enrich the whole of Europe. If we are prepared to open the door to the people of Ukraine, it will send a signal to the people of Belarus and show them that there is another option, one involving closer links and relationships with the European Union. In the future it may also involve membership of the Union, although that may not come about for many years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since mid-January, five of the six political prisoners previously identified as such have been released. One of these political prisoners, though, former presidential candidate Aleksandr Kozulin, is still in jail and in a poor state of health.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, for its part, through my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, has expressed its satisfaction with the release of the prisoners, which has been a long-standing request from all EU institutions, including the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">But we have equally been clear that we want to see all political prisoners freed, and that we want to see an end to the systematic harassment of Belarusian civil society, before we can give a new dimension to our relationship with Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, our message to Belarus remains the same: there cannot be a full partnership with Belarus until Belarus takes convincing steps towards democratisation, and respect for human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the gist of the European message to Belarus that the Commission released over a year ago and which includes the ‘12 points for democratisation’ that your resolution mentions. Again, the release of all political prisoners would be an important step in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we will be closely watching the parliamentary elections set for September 2008. The organisation of free and fair elections would be seen as a decisive step on the part of the Belarusian authorities. We hope that the OSCE will be able to send a full-scale observation mission to this election and that the European Parliament will also be able to send representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point that your resolution demands is that Belarus should apply a moratorium on the death penalty. The European Union has carried this message to the Belarusian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming back now to the recent developments in Belarus, another issue close to our hearts has been progressing fast over the last months: the opening of the European Commission’s delegation in Minsk, which we officially requested more than two years ago, is now imminent. We hope to be able to sign the establishment agreement soon, so that our delegation can be opened without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">This delegation will allow us to reinforce our links with Belarusian civil society and also to develop contacts with the middle rank of the administration that could be open to democratic change.</p>
<p class="contents">On this matter, as your resolution underlines, we have had a number of meetings at technical level with Belarusian experts on matters of mutual interest, such as energy, transport and environment. Let me, however, reiterate that the scope of these meetings remains limited as long as the current political conditions prevail in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards to the Commission actions to support civil society in Belarus, the Commission remains committed more than ever to supporting Belarusian civil society, and our 2008 assistance plan is aimed in particular at cementing Belarusian civil society and independent media. In addition, the Commission has also made clear that its support to the European Humanity University in exile in Vilnius will continue as long as necessary. I will also pass the message about the Free University on to Commissioner Figeľ. I think that this is very interesting and a bright idea.</p>
<p class="contents">A few other comments to Mr Pinior and Ms Schroedter. The opening of the negotiations on visa facilitation and on readmission is amongst the elements that would be considered in the event of a real breakthrough in our relationship. According to EU policy, visa facilitation can only be considered in the context of the European Commission readmission policy as part of a real partnership in external relations.</p>
<p class="contents">This was explained to Belarus in the verbal notes sent by the Commission on 8 May. The European Union’s willingness to enter into such negotiations with neighbouring countries with an action plan in force has also been reaffirmed, by the Commission communication on this matter of December 2006. In the case of Belarus these conditions are not met.</p>
<p class="contents">On the point raised by Mr Bielan, Commission contracts are awarded following strict tendering procedures in order to ensure a transparent and fair competition. This means that the Commission does not support radio and TV stations as such, but specific programmes instead. The ENPI Regional Information and Communication Programme includes support to media activities of EUR 7 million over three years for seven countries. The tendering procedure is ongoing, and media from both European Union and partner countries are eligible to submit tenders for contracts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Belarus is not only a near neighbour of the Union, involved in the European Neighbourhood Policy, but it is also an immediate neighbour of my country, Poland. We share a common border.</p>
<p class="contents">This is probably the best explanation of why the issue of fulfilling the real hopes and expectations of ordinary people in that country is so important to me in my work here in the European Parliament. After all, one cannot remain indifferent to what one can see happening just across the border: restrictions and administrative pressure on NGOs, intimidation, persecution and imprisonment of democratic opposition activists, including leaders of the youth movements known as the Belarusian Popular Front and Young Front.</p>
<p class="contents">Genuine dialogue between the Belarusian authorities and the European Union should therefore be set up quickly. It is not only the Union's right but also its duty to require the Belarusian Government to free all political prisoners, guarantee media freedom, the independence of the judiciary, and also respect for democratic values and the fundamental rights of the people of Belarus. Priority must be given to abolition of the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the European Parliament has moved towards making it easier for Belarusian citizens to enter EU territory and spend time there. The reduction or even total lifting of visa charges is currently under consideration. That is the only way to prevent Belarus and its citizens from becoming even more isolated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

These horrors have been part of the conflict in the neighbouring countries of Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Internationally recognised state borders have little meaning for groups of people who must seek new territories as a result of being expelled or the continuing lack of means of existence. Everything is in motion in this region, and the thing is that the slightest movement one way or the other potentially stirs up either violence or horror. Warlords who acquire respect, power and wealth by their innate love of conflict increase the already existing problems and make them even more difficult to solve.</p>
<p class="contents">Very recently, on 17 January, we discussed the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo here in this House and adopted a resolution that stated our wish to see all horrors cease. I fear that we could adopt many more resolutions on this matter without any solutions coming of it. The expectation that last year’s elections in the Democratic Republic of Congo could solve the problems has ended in disappointment. The incumbent president, Kabila, has won, but he represents different points of view from the movement from which he originated, and the outcomes of both the presidential and parliamentary elections were controversial for the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">The question is, how is such a large country with poor lines of communication and a wide range of peoples to function in a way that is supported by its whole population and all its divergent political forces. It does not seem that this is likely to succeed in an area like the Democratic Republic of Congo, where life-threatening diseases reign, the environment and the land are over-exploited, and people remain completely without rights. The question is whether the armistice of 23 January for North and South Kivu, which takes for granted the disarmament of the warring factions and the return of refugees to their places of residence, is feasible, and whether the United Nations can contribute on the ground to this end. It will not succeed by electing parties in the midst of conflict but possibly by persuading parties, the warring party for example, to abandon sexual violence and allow doctors in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You might say that all wars are vile, but I feel this one is much more so. This war has produced, and continues to produce, hundreds of thousands of victims, deaths and displaced persons, but hundreds and thousands of women, little girls and grandmothers have also suffered what is now called sexual violence. It is more than that, however; it is the use of rape as a genuine weapon of war, and this goes on amid a certain amount of indifference in public opinion and the international community, and more specifically European public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">This vile war has been raging for two years between rival factions: the rebel troops led by Laurent Nkunda, a dissident Congolese general, the former perpetrators of genocide in Rwanda who were imported after the end of the campaign in 1994, but also, unfortunately, certain elements of the recently dismantled Congolese army. That is enough. Fortunately a peace conference was held there recently, attended by all the factions involved, and it led to a cease-fire. Unfortunately, Mr President, the cease-fire is extremely fragile and tension is again mounting.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore propose two essential priorities: the first concern is protection for civilians, to provide means for the MONUC mission on the ground to defend them. In accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter it can use weapons to carry out the mission, for these massacres simply must stop. The second priority is to support the peace efforts discussed there, because the solution to the problem in the Great Lakes region would be a political solution involving all parties, including Rwanda, which must honour its commitments to repatriate its nationals operating in Kivu. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Armed conflict in North Kivu province has continued with variable intensity for the last 10 years. It has resulted in more than five million victims. Some 1 500 people are dying every day as a result of the fighting.</p>
<p class="contents">Mass killings, the rape of young girls and mothers, and forced conscription of civilians and children into the armed forces are the order of the day. Many other serious violations of human rights have also taken place in recent months in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. They have been committed by the rebel groups loyal to Laurent Nkunda, by the fighters of the democratic forces attempting to liberate Rwanda, and by the Congolese army itself. The eastern part of Congo is in need of immediate medical aid and food supplies, as recent events have forced most humanitarian organisations to suspend their activities.</p>

In reality, it is often more like hell on earth. It is a region of fantastic natural beauty and a wealth of natural resources, on the one hand, and appalling suffering, on the other: natural disasters, war, expulsion, famine, disease, massacres, mass rape and ethnic conflicts – worse than almost anywhere else. There are 800 000 internally displaced persons in North Kivu alone.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to recognise that this problem of expulsion exists on both sides of the border. In Africa, there is a phenomenon which does not exist in this form anywhere else, namely that people are not just displaced from one specific side of the border to the other. Instead, each country expels people from its side of the border into the other country, so there are refugees and displaced persons on both sides. As a result, the countries are completely unstable. That is why we need to provide humanitarian aid, and we need a massive presence here in order to help the people.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, however, that is merely tinkering with the symptoms. Unless we can establish reasonably viable state and rule-of-law structures, the disaster will never end, no matter how much assistance we provide. That is why it is extremely important for us to play a major role, also politically. The cease-fire of 23 January is extremely fragile and only really exists on paper. That is why we need to force all the parties, as a matter of urgency, to get round the table and talk to each other, but it also means that we have to play our part.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, Europeans often profit from these disasters. That is why the call for us to take certificates of origin more seriously, e.g. for natural resources, is justified, for often it is the Europeans who brutally exploit the people's suffering for their own economic interests. We have a responsibility here too, and we should not be content with making pretty speeches and applying sticking plaster solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this case the scene is North Kivu, but the plot and the victims are the same, as covered by an emergency resolution in the January part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost five and a half million people have died in the war since 1998, and forty-five thousand more die every month, directly or indirectly due to the war. The upshot of this is that one thousand five hundred people die every day: in other words, since we started this part-session on Monday, six thousand people have died already in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">The last few months, moreover, particularly in the east of the country, have seen an increase in massacres, rape of little girls and women, and forced recruitment of girls and boys. Both Laurent Nkunda’s rebel troops and the soldiers fighting in the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda are responsible for all this.</p>
<p class="contents">We also ought to remember that the MONUC mandate is based on Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, giving it the authority to use all necessary means to dissuade any attempt to use force that jeopardises the life or integrity of civilians or constitutes a threat to the political process.</p>
<p class="contents">To date, however, the MONUC presence has proved totally insufficient to bring an end to these barbaric acts. We must therefore again appeal to the Security Council to react and provide all available means to curtail these massacres.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, although we must welcome the Goma Conference paving the way towards political negotiation, its agreements, especially agreements concerning demobilisation, remain ambiguous, and their application is unclear.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, this is another chance, as Mr Posselt has already said, to again call for control mechanisms to be activated and implemented such as the Kimberley Process for diamonds producing certificates of origin for natural resources imported by the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the beginning of its existence, that is to say from 1960 onwards, Congo has been the scene of horrific pogroms, killings and civil wars. As a result, Congo has never been able to stand on its own two feet despite being endowed with abundant natural resources. The conflict in the area is the most cruel and barbarous to have occurred since the end of the Second World War. Sadly, it is still ongoing, claiming the lives of almost 50 000 human beings every month. Half of the victims are children under the age of five. The passage of the armies is accompanied by all kinds of crimes against the civilian population: rapes, looting and murder. That is why we welcome the outcome of the Goma peace conference and have such high hopes of it. It could mean the end of armed conflict in the Kivu region, but whether it does will depend partly on us too.</p>
<p class="contents">It may, however, prove impossible to resolve this conflict without support from the international community and neighbouring countries. It is important for international support not to be limited to political declarations, but to focus first and foremost on providing appropriate financial, organisational and technical assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

North Kivu is not in the spotlight, however, and no one in the international community is taking notice of what is happening there. Since the official peace agreement in 2002, Kabila's government has attempted to integrate the regional militia into a national army, so far without much success. The civilian population is still vulnerable to the impacts of the armed conflicts. Doctors Without Borders/<span class="italic">Médecins Sans Frontières</span> (MSF) highlights the difficulties facing relief workers in gaining access to the civilian population due to the continued fighting and says that malnutrition is another major threat to the population in North Kivu.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore urge the Council and the Commission to provide aid immediately and to launch comprehensive medical assistance programmes for the civilian population in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo without delay. We also urge the Council and the Commission to ensure that the recent strengthening of the UN mission leads to substantial improvements in the security of the population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They become the victims of rape or are forced to join armed groups.

<p class="contents">At the same time, we are aware of, and condemn, the severe human rights abuses – including recruitment of child soldiers and widespread sexual violence – taking place in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, in this context, it is important to remember that today’s critical situation in North Kivu, while exacerbated by the fighting taking place in the second half of 2007, is a result of years of war in the region. The root causes of the Kivu conflict can be traced all the way to the Rwandan genocide at the beginning of the 1990s, while also bearing in mind that there are several local components – such as insufficient political representation of ethnic minorities, pillaging of natural resources and land tenure issues – that significantly contribute to the instability and insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission welcomes the recent Goma Peace Conference and the following cease-fire as positive steps towards solving the enduring conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The Conference restored President Kabila’s credibility after the army’s defeat against General Nkunda’s troops at the end of 2007, and launched an inter-provincial dialogue process – something that the Commission has always advocated.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, along the lines of the commitments made by the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda in their Nairobi Joint Communiqué in November 2007, the Goma Conference also re-emphasised the need to tackle the problem of the ex-FAR as a priority. At the same time, it was made clear that there is a need to address the root causes of the conflict, while restoring the State authority in the east.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, it should not be forgotten that nothing was definitively solved at Goma or Nairobi. Finding a permanent solution to the root causes of the Kivu crisis, and thus a sustainable restoration of peace in the region, will take time. Indeed, while complementing each other, the Nairobi Joint Communiqué and the Goma Conference represent an encouraging start – but only a start – of a difficult and lengthy process.</p>
<p class="contents">The main challenge ahead is now an effective implementation of the Nairobi and Goma commitments. It ought to be assured that all the concerned stakeholders stand by their commitments. The EU will continue to follow closely and participate actively in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, international action in support of the Congolese is very much needed. The Commission, together with the Member States, is ready to continue to play an important role in the Kivus. We have traditionally been one of the most important donors in the east, via our humanitarian assistance and our rehabilitation and capacity-building programmes. We are willing to further increase our support for the region, especially through European initiatives, as well as in close collaboration with the United Nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>You will of course be aware that the question of human rights is always discussed at the annual Joint Council and Ministerial Meeting between the EU and the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC), which includes Saudi Arabia. The specific question of women’s rights is discussed with the GCC within that framework.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Council expects that it will be possible to bring up discussion of human rights, including women’s rights, at the next EU-GCC Ministerial Meeting which is due to take place on 26 May 2008. At that meeting the Council will present the EU’s view on women’s rights and listen to the view of its partners from the GCC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1060"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Bali Action Plan marks the beginning of a comprehensive negotiation process to be concluded in December 2009 at the Copenhagen Conference at which it will be necessary to discuss, inter alia, the shared vision for long-term cooperative action, mitigation, adjustment, technology and funding. If I may, I will set out the component parts in greater detail.</p>
<p>The first component, that is to say the shared vision for long-term cooperative action, including a long-term global goal for emission reductions, is of essential importance in guiding future joint efforts in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>The second component, that is to say enhanced national and international mitigation action, is set out in a carefully worded text which balances the action of the developed countries and that of the developing countries.</p>
<p>The Bali Action Plan has also brought the USA back into the UN process. Furthermore, the traditional line which had divided Annex I parties and non-Annex I parties since 1992 was abandoned in the text of that resolution. A clear distinction was also established between the action to be taken by developed countries and that to be taken by developing countries in order to prevent the developed countries from using this opportunity to abandon their quantified emission reduction commitments.</p>
<p>The third component, that is to say enhanced action on adaptation, will include international cooperation to support urgent implementation of adaptation actions, risk management and risk reduction strategies, disaster reduction strategies, and an increase in economic diversification.</p>
<p>The fourth component includes enhanced action on technology development and transfer to support action on mitigation and adaptation, and the fifth component relates to enhanced action on the provision of financial resources and investment to support action on mitigation and adaptation and technology cooperation.</p>
<p>The text of the resolution contains all the items which the EU called for and in no way prejudices the final outcome of the negotiations on them. A final assessment of the Bali Conference will be possible only in the light of the text drawn up at the Copenhagen Conference.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1065"></a>

<p>According to the weekly 'Der Spiegel' (January 2008), the German authorities are planning to exchange a hostage of German nationality, Donald Klein, who has been held by the Iranian authorities since 2005, for a number of terrorists belonging to the Iranian satellite organisation active in Lebanon, Hezbollah, among them the ringleader of the terrorist operation of the Iranian regime which resulted in the elimination of four opposition figures in the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin in 1992.</p>
<p>The Federal Court of Berlin concluded that the terrorist act was the brainchild of Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khameini, and the former Iranian president, Ali Hashemi-Rafsanjani.</p>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As regards the possibilities of promoting and developing transalpine routes, as the member will no doubt be aware, and in accordance with Decision No 884/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 amending Decision No 1692/96/EC on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, the priorities of the trans-European transport network include: establishment and development of the key links and interconnections needed, inter alia, to fill in missing sections, complete major routes and overcome natural obstacles, and integration of security and environmental concerns into the design and implementation of the network. Article 8 of the abovementioned decision further states that the Member States must also take account of environmental protection in connection with the trans-European transport network.</p>
<p>Mention should be made of the two priorities set out in Annex II to the abovementioned decision, namely the rail link Berlin-Verona/Milan-Bologna-Naples-Messina-Palermo and ‘Priority Project No 6’, the rail link Lyon-Turin-Venice-Ljubljana-Budapest. According to the progress report drawn up by the project coordinator Karel Van Miert in July 2007, activity on the rail link Berlin-Verona/Milan-Bologna-Naples-Messina-Palermo has progressed swiftly in the second year and a memorandum of understanding on the Brenner Tunnel has been signed between Austria and Italy. In December 2007 the Commission adopted a decision on the request for cofunding for the Brenner Tunnel.</p>
<p>‘Priority Project No 6’ - the rail link Lyon-Turin-Venice-Ljubljana-Budapest - also resolves the problem of crossing the Alps, that is to say from west to east. This priority also includes the Mont Cenis Tunnel, which is already under construction and is a cross-border project of Italy and France. In connection with this project mention should also be made of the Trieste–Divača link in respect of which the Commission approved cofunding for drafting design documentation and preparatory work in December 2007. Activities on that project are under way and a memorandum of understanding between Italy and Slovenia concerning that section was signed in July 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0005"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Slovenian Presidency will devote particular attention to the Western Balkans. The stability of that region is of crucial importance for the security and prosperity of the entire EU. A number of events can be expected during the transition process in 2008: a review of the 2003 Thessaloniki Agenda, conclusion of the network of stabilisation and association agreements, and strengthening of regional cooperation in several areas. The Council will continue to support the prospect of EU membership for the Western Balkans and bring it closer to the people of the region (primarily it will help prepare the beginning of dialogue on liberalisation of the visa regime with the countries of the region). In addition, the establishment of a Regional Cooperation Council will be a further important achievement of regional cooperation and an expression of enhanced regional ownership. The Council has emphasised the importance of regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations and the need for cooperation between neighbouring countries in seeking mutually acceptable solutions to unresolved issues.</p>
<p>In carrying out a comprehensive examination of the Western Balkans, account must be taken of the considerable progress that has been achieved in recent years: greater stability, democratic reforms, economic growth, enhanced regional cooperation and progress on moving closer to the EU as part of the stabilisation and association process. However, certain significant challenges remain: the fight against organised crime and corruption, compliance with international law (ICTY) and finding a solution to the issue of Kosovo’s status, the latter being the most important from the point of view of stability in the region. Therefore, the issue of Kosovo’s status is a key priority of the EU presidency. The Council considers that it is a European problem to which it is necessary to find a solution which will contribute to regional stability and the prospect of EU membership for the countries of the Western Balkans.</p>
<p>On 17 February 2008 Kosovo’s parliament passed a resolution on Kosovo’s independence. In the conclusions of its February meeting the General Affairs and External Relations Council stated that the resolution commits Kosovo to the principles of democracy and equality of all its citizens, the protection of the Serb and other minorities, the protection of the cultural and religious heritage and international supervision. The Council welcomed the fact</p>
<p>that the international community will maintain its presence in Kosovo on the basis of UN Security Council resolution No 1244. The Council noted that the Member States will decide on their relations with Kosovo, in accordance with national practice and international law.</p>
<p>In the conclusions of its February meeting the General Affairs and External Relations Council recalled the EU’s longstanding commitment to the stability of the countries of the Western Balkans. The Council reiterated the EU’s readiness to play a leading role in strengthening stability in the region, and recalled the European Union’s commitments contained in the conclusions of the European Council of 14 December 2007, as well as the agreement to Joint Actions establishing an ESDP Police and Rule of Law mission and appointing an EU Special Representative in Kosovo. The European Union will also continue to cooperate with the UN, KFOR, OSCE and other international actors in order to preserve stability in the region.</p>
<p>The European Council reaffirmed its commitment fully and effectively to support the prospect of EU membership for the countries of the Western Balkans. It asked the Commission to use Community instruments to promote economic and political development and to propose concrete measures to the broader region in order to advance in that direction.</p>
<p>The main objective of the EU presidency with regard to the successor States of the former Yugoslavia in the EU on the road towards the EU are as follows:</p>
<p>Serbia: the EU presidency will encourage Serbia to create the conditions necessary for the swift signing of the SAA and to make progress on attaining applicant country status, and will support Serbian leanings towards the EU, improve the EU’s visibility in Serbia and encourage Serbia to continue its successful regional cooperation.</p>
<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina: the presidency will encourage the political actors to create the conditions necessary for the earliest possible signing of the SAA, promote the prospect of EU membership for BiH and enhance the EU’s visibility. It will support political dialogue and State-building efforts in order to provide, through constitutional and other reforms, functional and effective State institutions which will enable the country to improve the lives of its citizens. It will also support efforts by EUSR Miroslav Lajčák and continue preparations for the planned transition from the OHR to a strengthened EUSR office following an assessment of the PIC and creation of the necessary conditions.</p>
<p>Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: the presidency will, in close collaboration with the Commission, support the deepening of political dialogue and continued implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement and encourage speeding-up of the reform process to create the conditions necessary for the next stage of the country’s integration into the EU. The presidency is aware of the name issue and encourages both sides to make efforts to attain, through a constructive approach and negotiations under the auspices of the UN, a mutually acceptable solution and thereby to contribute to regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations.</p>
<p>Montenegro: like all the countries of the Western Balkans, Montenegro is a possible applicant country for membership of the European Union. The speed of progress along the road to the EU depends on the speed at which Montenegro adopts and implements the necessary reforms. As regards signing a stabilisation and association agreement, Montenegro has made good progress. However, at present it is necessary to focus on implementing the SAA, building and strengthening Montenegro’s national institutions, further strengthening administrative capacity, and the rule of law and promoting the fight against organised crime and corruption. These areas are of fundamental importance to any functioning European country. The Council will continue to support Montenegro in these efforts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0007"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council’s position is that ‘the political situation in Palestine’ to which the member refers in his question necessarily requires the fostering of institution building, good governance, civil society contributions, support for the growth of the Palestinian economy, and the strengthening of the rule of law to prepare for the establishment of an independent, democratic and successful Palestinian State on the West Bank and in Gaza, which will unite all Palestinians and coexist in peace and security with Israel and its neighbours.</p>
<p>The EU therefore welcomes the results of the International Donors’ Conference for the Palestinian State last December at which over USD 7.4 billion were pledged to support efforts to build effective, democratic institutions and a successful economy for a future Palestinian State in accordance with the Reform and Development Plan presented by Prime Minister Fayad. The EU remains determined to contribute considerably to this effort in accordance with its Action Strategy ‘State-building for Peace in the Middle East’, which includes the broad range of its aid operations. The PEGASE funding mechanism, which will provide support for the Palestinian people, was also launched recently.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 28 January 2008 the Council expressed its deep concern about recent events in Gaza and the grave disturbance at the border between Gaza and Egypt. It condemned the constant firing of rockets into Israeli territory and all other activities which are contrary to international law and endanger civilians. While recognising Israel’s legitimate right to self-defence, the Council called for an immediate end to all acts of violence. It reiterated its grave concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza and called for the continuous provision of essential goods and services, including fuel and power supplies. It reiterated its call on all parties to work urgently for the controlled re-opening of the crossings in and out of Gaza for both humanitarian reasons and commercial flows. In that context, the Council underlined its support for the proposal by the Palestinian Authority to take control of the crossings, and supports the Arab League resolution in that respect. The EU will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the population of Gaza and stands ready to assist in the economic rehabilitation of Gaza. The Council stated that the EU is ready to consider the possibility of resuming its monitoring mission at Rafah under the provisions of the relevant international agreements related to access and movement, which were concluded in November 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0041"></a>

<p>After the 1999 conflict in the Kosovo province of what was then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the criminal and civil justice system collapsed. Although the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia had jurisdiction over Kosovo, it was clear that it would only be able to try a very limited number of cases. Therefore, the UN established the International Judges and Prosecutors Programme to incorporate a limited number of foreign judges and prosecutors into the local criminal justice system. Regrettably, the performance over more than seven years of the International Judges and Prosecutors Programme has failed to meet expectations. Local prosecutors and judges are still not prepared for cases involving crimes under international law. Legal reforms essential for such cases still have not been enacted into law.

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is still deeply concerned about the situation in Sri Lanka, as demonstrated by the EU declaration of 8 January 2008:</p>
<p>‘The EU deeply regrets the Sri Lankan Government’s decision to abrogate the ceasefire agreement concluded with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2002. This decision and the current military campaign further deteriorate the country’s already difficult situation, including the humanitarian and human rights situation. Without the ceasefire agreement prospects of negotiating a lasting, peaceful solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka are narrowed further. The EU particularly regrets that the work of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission will be terminated.</p>
<p>The EU has been similarly concerned by LTTE acts of terror in recent months and statements promising further violence from their side. The EU urges both parties to put an end to all hostilities and avoid further escalation.</p>
<p>The EU calls upon the Government of Sri Lanka to come forward with a substantive devolution offer around which negotiations can start, as soon as possible. For an arrangement to serve as a feasible basis for negotiations, it needs to go beyond past offers and the EU urges both parties to work towards a solution that would bring a peaceful and lasting resolution to the conflict.’</p>
<p>The EU is presently examining a proposal for a political solution to the conflict on the island, which the All Party Representative Committee presented to President Rajapakse.</p>
<p>It is clear that the situation in Sri Lanka has still not stabilised. The Council has therefore decided to send a diplomatic mission there to study the development of events and express concerns on behalf of the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0017"></a>

<p>Under existing Community law, the imposition of taxes does not fall within the competence of the EU and in any event falls within the sole competence of the Member States. Moreover, the Member States alone are able to decide on the internal allocation of taxation powers to the various territorial and/or regional sub-units in a country. The Community legislature has no role to play in such decisions. The relevant Member States may at most call on it to take account of the specific features of national systems when amending legislation to harmonise Member States’ tax legislation.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice of the European Communities has consistently held that the Member States have competence in the field of taxation but must exercise that competence in accordance with Community law. Therefore, national law cannot be incompatible with harmonisation measures, where they have been adopted. Furthermore, national taxation powers must be exercised within the bounds of the Treaty and therefore cannot constitute prohibited State aid or a prohibited restriction on free movement. However, it is not the Council but rather the European Commission and the courts which establish whether or not national tax measures are consistent with Community law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0024"></a>

<p>The Council answers the question relating to the effectiveness of the implementation of Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA as follows:</p>
<p>Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> of 25 October 2004 lays down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Under Article 9 of the Framework Decision, Member States are to take the necessary measures to comply with the provisions of this Framework Decision by 12 May 2006 and transmit to the General Secretariat of the Council and to the Commission the text of the provisions transposing into their national law the obligations imposed on them under this Framework Decision.</p>
<p>In a letter of 4 September 2006 the Netherlands informed the Council of the implementation of the Framework Decision in its national law and also submitted the text of the provisions transposing the relevant obligations into its national law. Those provisions entered into force on 1 July 2006.</p>
<p>As regards the question of how an individual Member State fulfils its obligations under the Framework Decision, it must be borne in mind that under Article 9 the Commission is, by 12 May 2009, to submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the effectiveness of the implementation of the Framework Decision, including its effects on judicial cooperation in the field of illicit drug trafficking. Following this report, the Council is to assess whether Member States have taken the necessary measures to comply with this Framework Decision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Azerbaijan has a huge number of refugees in relation to its population: around one in seven Azeris is a refugee. Some 4% of the world's total number of refugees are in Azerbaijan. The problem of 'internally displaced persons' (IDPs) has already existed for 14 years in Azerbaijan. Many children have known nothing but the life of a refugee and are living in inhuman conditions and do not go to school. The huge camps in which they live are hotbeds of social unrest, epidemics and crime. The government is failing to tackle this problem. The majority of 'internally displaced people' are being left to their fate, without proper accommodation, food or medical and health care.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan is bidding to hold the Olympic Games in 2016. Will the EU be putting pressure on Azerbaijan to tackle the refugee problem and in general to show greater respect for human rights? Azerbaijan does not hold democratic elections, the rights of the media are restricted and impunity and corruption are rife. Will the EU if necessary be opposing Azerbaijan's bid to hold the Games, bearing in mind that initial hopes that the holding of the Olympic Games would encourage China to improve respect for human rights are proving vain?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council attaches great importance to the refugee problem and also to elections, human rights and media freedom in Azerbaijan and thus devotes particular attention to these issues. These issues concern fundamental European values which Azerbaijan recognised by its membership of the Council of Europe and the OSCE and its involvement in the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan (ENP).</p>
<p>The European Union strongly supports the Azeri refugees and internally displaced persons and hopes that they will be able to return to their homes as soon as possible once an overall peace agreement has been reached. Furthermore, the EU frequently stresses that it is prepared to provide financial support for the reconstruction/repair of Nagorno-Karabakh and the neighbouring occupied areas when a peace agreement has been reached. This would facilitate the return of refugees and internally displaced persons.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly – in particular in the statement by the EU Presidency on the parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan dated 7 November 2005 – expressed its disappointment at the assessment of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) that in spite of some progress compared with previous elections the 6 November 2005 parliamentary elections fell short of many OSCE obligations and Council of Europe obligations and standards with regard to democratic elections. The European Union is now encouraging Azerbaijan to increase its efforts to establish democracy, having regard to the fact that presidential elections will take place in October 2008.</p>
<p>In recent months the EU has repeatedly expressed its concern at the worsening of the situation in the country with regard to human rights and fundamental freedoms. These developments will have to be closely monitored in the run-up to the presidential elections.</p>
<p>EUSR Peter Semneby and SG/HR Personal Representative on Human Rights Riina Kionka visited Baku together in July 2007 to encourage further dialogue on the media.</p>
<p>A statement on the sentencing of Eynulla Fatullayev in Azerbaijan was published on behalf of the European Union on 8 November 2007.</p>
<p>On 8 January 2008 the European Union expressed its pleasure at the pardoning by President Aliyev of 119 prisoners, including several imprisoned journalists, and its belief that the presidential pardon is a positive step towards Azerbaijan’s fulfilment of international and European obligations with regard to freedom of the press. Nevertheless, the EU remains concerned that three journalists (Mirza Sakit Zahidov, Ganimat Zahid and Eynulla Fatullayev) are still in prison. It called upon the Azerbaijani authorities to release or pardon them at the earliest opportunity. In addition, it supports the introduction of a moratorium on proceedings for defamation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU will – also within the framework of cooperation with the OSCE and the Council of Europe – continue to take every opportunity to express its concerns about the refugee problem, elections, human rights and media freedom in Azerbaijan. It has already done so at meetings of the EU-Azerbaijan Cooperation Committee (in Baku on 28 September 2007) and the EU-Azerbaijan Cooperation Council (in Luxembourg on 16 October 2007).</p>
<p>The European Union Special Representative for the Southern Caucasus, Ambassador Peter Semneby, is also helping Azerbaijan implement political and economic reforms, in particular in the field of the rule of law, democratisation, human rights, good governance, development and poverty reduction. During his visits to Azerbaijan Ambassador Semneby also meets members of the opposition party in that country.</p>
<p>The Council therefore intends to keep monitoring very closely developments in Azerbaijan in those respects and, where necessary, to discuss them with the Azerbaijani authorities. One such opportunity for discussions with the Azerbaijani authorities was presented by the visit of the EU Troika foreign ministers to Baku on 4 February 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0029"></a>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council would like to thank the member who has expressed interest in this important matter. Reducing the burden of cancer is a priority of the Slovenian Presidency in the field of public health. On the basis of discussions as part of the conference entitled ‘The Burden of Cancer – How Can It Be Reduced?’ held in Brdo (Slovenia) on 7 and 8 February 2008, the Presidency will draw up conclusions on cancer which the Council will adopt on 10 June 2008.</p>
<p>Considerable inequalities and gaps in terms of cancer mortality, morbidity and survival rates have existed for a long time within and between the Member States. The reasons for these differences are the very different levels of service as regards disease prevention, diagnostics, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. In its draft conclusions the Council therefore stresses the need in the EU to adopt an overall cancer prevention and control strategy which will help remove gaps in diagnostics, treatment and care.</p>
<p>Although it should be stressed that the organisation and provision of health services and care, such as are required where cancer is discovered for example, fall within the exclusive competence of the Member States, in its draft conclusions the Presidency proposes that the Council call upon the Member States to give cancer patients the best possible care.

<p>Morocco has taken a strategic decision to move closer to the European Union. The European Union and Morocco are establishing increasingly close partnership in many fields. For the European Union it is a strategic partnership of fundamental importance since it involves a region where sources of instability continue to exist.</p>
<p>At the same time, the partnership with Morocco is founded on a commitment to certain common values. Respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms forms the basis of relations between the EU and Morocco and an essential element of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement. These values also form the core of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and were confirmed in the EU-Morocco European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan in 2005. The relevant issues, including the situation in Western Sahara and its consequences, are normally to the fore at all the meetings held as part of bilateral dialogue. Morocco is committed to these values. This is reflected in the significant reforms which have been implemented in recent years in the field of politics and also in the fact that Morocco is willing to discuss these issues with the European Union, in particular in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, Democratisation and Governance, which has met twice to date, most recently in November 2007.</p>
<p>Morocco has been seeking advanced status in its relations with the European Union since 2001. Since then considerable progress has been made. Within this overall framework and the framework of the neighbourhood policy the European Union and Morocco agreed at the most recent meeting of the Association Council on 23 July 2007 that they would facilitate ways of examining options to strengthen considerably relations which would grant Morocco the advanced status it was requesting.</p>
<p>The EU-Morocco Association Council decided that it was necessary to assess implementation of the ENP Action Plan. The Association Council also established an ad hoc working group which, on the basis of the progress made in implementing the action plan and the other plans submitted within the framework of other forums, is studying new objectives for the partnership and further steps to develop bilateral relations, including a large number of contractual relations, as already provided for in the Action Plan. The Commission’s next communication on European neighbourhood policy, which is due to be presented in April, will be significant in that respect. All this will be included in the discussions at the next meeting of the EU-Morocco Association Council, which will be held in the second half of this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0052"></a>

<p>On the pretext that there is no ‘realistic prospect for a world without nuclear weapons’, five former chiefs of general staff and senior NATO commanders insist that the ‘nuclear first strike’ option remains an ‘indispensable instrument’ for prevention. The ‘preventive nuclear strike’ is part of the arsenal of the USA’s bellicose, imperialist policy. Thus, as part of their proposals for an enhanced role for NATO, the five former top officials recommend the use of a preventive nuclear strike, even without authorisation from the UN Security Council, when, in their view, there exist ‘threats to western values and the western way of life’. Their recommendation, which has already been presented to the US Pentagon and to the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, is due to be discussed at the NATO summit meeting due to be held in Bucharest in April where it is certain to elicit strong reactions.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom does not participate in the Community’s common visa policy. Therefore, the Community does not have to take any measures which would be binding on the United Kingdom as regards facilitating procedures for applying for and issuing visas for members of the Olympic family to enter the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom may, if it so wishes, take account of Council Regulation (EC) No 1295/2003 relating to measures envisaged to facilitate the procedures for applying for and issuing visas for members of the Olympic family taking part in the 2004 Olympic or Paralympic Games in Athens<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and Regulation (EC) No 2046/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2005 relating to measures envisaged to facilitate the procedures for applying for and issuing visas for members of the Olympic family taking part in the 2006 Olympic and/or Paralympic Winter Games in Turin<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. These two regulations are based on the fact that Greece and Italy are Member States which implement fully the Schengen acquis and thus participate fully in the Community’s visa policy.</p>
<p>On a more general level, United Kingdom bodies can make use of the recommendations from the handbook for police and security authorities concerning cooperation at major events with an international dimension (OJ C 314, 22.12.2007, p. 4).

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 February part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>EU policy towards Belarus continues to be based on a dual approach. On the one hand, it maintains restrictive measures (the visa ban and assets freeze) against Belarusian officials responsible for oppression and abuse of democratic principles and, on the other, is increasingly willing to cooperate with Belarusian society, including contacts with the authorities. The EU has laid down the release of all political prisoners and an end to the arrest of opposition supporters and civil society activists as the first condition for the actual commencement of cooperation with Belarus. This message has been stressed repeatedly, inter alia in interviews with the High Representative for the CFSP, Javier Solana, for the independent Belarusian media in 2007 and also directly in talks with the Belarusian authorities.</p>
<p>The Belarusian authorities often infringe basic human rights as regards the political opposition, the media and freedom of assembly. Although involvement in opposition political organisations in Belarus is not unlawful, in practice it is impossible for those organisations to carry on their activities. Politically motivated arrests and detentions (albeit sometimes only for a short period) are continuing. Last year dozens of opposition activists were beaten up and detained. However, in January and early February five out of six political prisoners were released. Only Aleksandr Kozulin remains in prison for political reasons.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the problem of increased visa fees for Belarusian nationals since the end of 2007 when the neighbouring countries which are EU Member States joined the Schengen area. The European Union does not want Belarusian nationals to have more favourable treatment with regard to obtaining visas than nationals of its other neighbouring countries. However, visa facilitation negotiations are necessary for the introduction of lower visa fees. Unfortunately, the Belarusian Government has not responded positively to the EU’s proposal for participation in European neighbourhood policy which would encourage that country and at the same time impose obligations on it. Consequently, it is still not possible to commence visa facilitation negotiations.</p>
<p>The Council is still willing to conduct dialogue with Belarus on the gradual regulation of bilateral relations, including relations as part of an agreement on partnership, cooperation and European neighbourhood policy, if the Belarusian authorities demonstrate that they are actually willing to respect democratic values, human rights and the rule of law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0061"></a>

<p>Acting in violation of Greek law – the law of the flag of a vessel – Egyptian armed forces boarded the Roll-On Roll-Off ship ‘Nikolas A’ on 2 January 2008.

The Greek shipowner has complained that the six members of the crew were savagely beaten and two of them suffered serious injuries. The Egyptian military then arrested and imprisoned the ship's Greek second engineer and the Spanish captain of the company and seized the passports of the other crew members.</p>

<p>Does the Council intend to endorse the findings of the EFSA and authorise food production from cloned animals, a development which is causing great concern with regard to food safety in the light of scientific findings to the effect that cloned animals are not only short-lived but also affected by numerous genetic or other anomalies, that, as a result of genetic manipulation, the replicants may differ from the naturally occurring animals from which they were cloned and that artificial characteristics may be inherited, slowing down subsequent livestock development and improvement through crossbreeding?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU has taken upon itself the role of driving force in efforts to reduce the greenhouse effect. A decisive measure in this connection is reducing citizens' energy consumption. The EU countries and the Commission should not, therefore, on the one hand urge Europe's citizens and undertakings to increase their energy efficiency and reduce their carbon dioxide emissions while at the same time imposing barriers to imports and increasing the cost of such measures by means of punitive tariffs on imports of low-energy light-bulbs from China.</p>

<p>The Council would first like to draw the member’s attention to the answer of 5 March 2007 to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2007-0080_EN.html">E-0080/07</a> and the answer of 23 May 2007 to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0291_EN.html">H-0291/07</a> concerning anti-dumping duties on imports of integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps (CFL-i) originating in the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>On 15 October 2007 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) 1205/2007<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which extends that measure by one year following conclusion of the review. The aim of the regulation is to address unfair competitive advantages resulting from the export of such lamps to the Community and to find a proper overall balance between the wishes of consumers, manufacturers and retailers.</p>
<p>By adopting the regulation and restricting the payment of duty, the Council took account of the interests of importers and consumers and was able to affect the introduction of those measures. If those measures had been implemented for more than one year, their negative effects would not have been proportionate to the benefits which they bring to Community manufacturers.</p>
<p>The Council’s objective is to strike the correct balance between one agreed objective, namely to increase energy efficiency and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the Community, and another equally important objective, namely to protect the Community’s industry from the trade-distorting practices of non-member countries. The questions put by the member were discussed and taken into account in the final decision on adopting the regulation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Under the Third Community Support Framework 2000-2006 for Greece, an amount of some € 22.7 billions has been committed for Community assistance in the Greek regions from the four Structural Funds (ERDF, ESF, EAGGF and FIFG)<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. By the end of the year 2007, an amount of some € 16.6 billions was paid from the Structural Funds. This amount corresponds to 73% of the total EU structural allocations to Greece. However, it should be underlined that, late December 2007, the Greek authorities submitted to the Commission a payment claim of some € 2.5 billions, all Structural Funds included. The evaluation of this claim by the Commission's services is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Following the wildfires which ravaged part of Greece in summer 2007, the Greek authorities applied for modifying the Operational Programmes and Community Initiatives of the third programming period (2000-2006). This modification will not include any retrospective modification to the financing plans of the programmes. The programming period 2000-2006 has been completed and therefore re-programming is no longer permissible. Consequently, no transfer of credits from one Operational Programme to another, from one Priority Axis to another within the same Operational Programme, or from one Community Fund to another could be acceptable. The only modifications that the Commission could accept are those which do not require the modification of the financing plan of the programmes, namely, transfer of credits from one measure to another within the same Priority Axis through revision of the Programme Complement.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities also applied for a one-year extension of the eligibility deadline of the Operational Programmes and Community Initiatives of the third programming period (2000-2006). In reply to the Greek request, the Commission considers that a one-year extension of the eligibility deadline of the Operational Programmes and the Community Initiatives can be granted, provided there is a direct and substantial link between the unforeseeable event of the wildfires occurred in summer 2007 and the implementation of the Operational Programmes and Community Initiatives for which the extension is requested. Consequently, such an extension can be accepted for Western Greece, the Peloponnesus, Continental Greece and Attica, as these programmes concern precisely the regions where the wildfires occurred.</p>
<p>As regards the national Operational Programmes and the Community Initiatives Leader+ and Equal, the Greek authorities were asked to communicate to the Commission all substantive elements demonstrating that the aforementioned criterion of direct and substantial link is met.

<p>The appropriations earmarked for payments under heading 1a in 2008 come to over EUR 40 billion and, although they are higher than the sum proposed for this heading in 2007, there are fears as to whether they will cover the funding needs of the individual Member States. It should be borne in mind that the majority of both sectoral and regional programmes presented by the Member States for the 2007-2013 period were approved by the Commission.

<p>The question seems related to the expenditure under Heading 1b (Cohesion for growth and employment) rather than 1a (Competitiveness for growth and employment). The following information should be presented.</p>
<p>2008 payment appropriations for Heading 1b amount to € 40.6 billion, an increase of 7.5% over the 2007 figure. This amount comprises three components:</p>
<p>advance and interim payments relating to the commitments under the new 2007-2013 Financial Framework, which is the largest component;</p>
<p>reimbursements to clear the stock of outstanding commitments (RAL) for the 2000-2006 programmes and projects;</p>
<p>and a residual amount to clear the remaining RAL for the pre-2000 programmes.</p>
<p>In order to propose the level of payment credits for the 2008 budget, the Commission took into consideration:</p>
<p>forecasts of payments provided by Member States (for both programming periods);</p>
<p>analysis based on the previous years' payments execution;</p>
<p>experience with the start up of the 2000-2006 programming period.</p>
<p>In the budget 2008:</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 82 of Regulation 1083/2006<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (Pre-financing), the Commission reserved sufficient payment credits to execute the second advances for all new 2007-2013 programmes. It is worthwhile to underline that most of the programmes have been adopted late in 2007 and thus the first advances have just been paid (in December 2007/ January 2008).</p>
<p>The 2008 budget contains also € 13.6 billion for execution of interim payment according to Article 86 of Regulation 1083/2006 under the new programming period.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 71 of Regulation 1083/2006, before the submission of the first interim payment claim, or at the latest within 12 months of the approval of each operational programme, each Member State shall submit to the Commission a description of its management and control systems. The description shall be accompanied by a report setting out the results of an assessment of the systems set up and giving an opinion on their compliance with Articles 58 to 62 of Regulation 1083/2006 (Management and control systems). These documents are subject to the Commission's approval.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned requirements may lead to significant delays and in effect result rather in under-spending of the budget than shortage of funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The final date of eligibility of expenditure from the 2004-2006 period for Structural Funds can be up to the end of 2008 for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) and up to the end of 2010 for the Cohesion Fund projects. That said, the Commission has launched in 2007 the ex post evaluation of Objectives 1, 2 and 3 2000-2006, which will evaluate the impact of Structural Fund resources in all 25 Member States before the 1 January 2007 and will provide information on how the Funds were used, in terms of what the resources were spent on, what was achieved and the effectiveness of implementation systems. Results from this evaluation will be available in 2009. Ex post evaluation of the Cohesion Fund will be launched in 2009, with results available in 2010. The later date of the Cohesion Fund evaluation arises from the need for as large a number as possible of projects to be completed in order to evaluate their impact.</p>
<p>At this point, the absorption of Structural Funds – ERDF and ESF – is more advanced than that of the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p>The current state of play as of 17 January 2008 indicates a payments absorption rate of 79.7% for the European Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), 72% for ERDF, 65.29% for ESF, and 44% for the Cohesion Fund (CF) for the ten new Member States. So far, all of the Structural Funds operational programmes have complied with the n+2 rule and no budget has been lost (apart from Slovenia for EQUAL and Slovakia on Objective 3). Implementation of Structural Funds programmes in the Member States concerned has been taking off in the last year and is now on track.</p>
<p>The present situation therefore indicates satisfactory progress in respect of project implementation and compliance with the planned implementation timetables.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Cohesion Fund projects are still ongoing and most projects will only be finalised by 2010. The final date of eligibility of expenses for the Cohesion Fund is 31 December 2010. Full absorption will depend mainly on the timely implementation of projects and the timely certification of expenditure to the Commission. Although the Cohesion Fund implementation is somewhat slower than for the ERDF and ESF, there are no grounds at this stage to suggest that the absorption of Funds will be other than very good. Implementation challenges can be observed particularly in the environment sector (Poland, Lithuania). The majority of the delays are due to the technical and administrative complexity of the projects in the environmental sector. However the countries concerned are working toward improving the progress of projects and addressing the administrative shortcomings and at this stage the expectations are for a very good absorption of the 2004-2006 allocations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0037"></a>

<p>One of the goals of both the old and new Lisbon Strategies was to make the European Union the most competitive economy in the world by 2010.

However, some regions in the European Union have natural limits placed on their innovative capacity by their geographical and infrastructure situation, most notably mountain regions. In the light of the most recent developments, what specific measures is the European Commission planning in order to improve innovative capacity in mountain areas by 2013 and thereby ensure the even development of competitive capacity, territorial cohesion and regional development in the European Economic Area?

<p>Mountain areas with their various disadvantages and considerable diversity stemming from their geographic peculiarities (e.g. isolation, difficult accessibility, climatic conditions) constitute a particular challenge for regional policy.</p>
<p>The Commission is of course aware of these problems and has been very active in pursuing a policy aimed at the improvement of the situation of disadvantaged regions i.a. by adopting the Fourth Report on Economic and Social Cohesion on 30 May 2007. It confirms the importance the Commission attaches to achieving greater territorial cohesion in Europe and to the particular difficulties certain territories are facing. The Commission will communicate the results of the discussion on the questions raised in this report in the context of the Fifth Progress Report on Cohesion due for spring 2008.</p>
<p>As you know, the new regulations for 2007-2013 and the Community Strategic Guidelines contain explicit provisions for mountain areas, thus creating the basis for progress in addressing territorial specificities in programming documents. Additionally, the Territorial Agenda of the European Union adopted at the informal ministerial meeting in Leipzig in May 2007 strives to strengthen territorial cohesion.</p>
<p>During this meeting the Commission presented also a document which assesses the way national strategies for 2007-2013 would propose to tackle territorial issues. One of its observations was that only a few Member States set clear and explicit interventions for specific types of territories. However, some € 6,400 million were "earmarked" specifically for mountain areas. As a consequence, the Ministers requested the Commission to develop further this analysis and to present a Report on Territorial Cohesion (Green Paper) in 2008.</p>
<p>This report under preparation and its adoption is scheduled for the third trimester of 2008 with the aim of launching a broad debate on the concept of territorial cohesion of the European Union and its Member States. It will raise a number of issues concerning the need for a more integrated approach on territorial cohesion in the future as well as the use and implementation of the concept at various levels and in different policy domains. This report will also cover policies specific to mountains and other areas facing geographical difficulties supporting a harmonious and balanced development of the Union. This common vision is essential for avoiding the fragmentation of European policies while taking into account the specificities of the areas concerned.</p>
<p>It is also worth recalling that under the European Territorial Cooperation and especially under the trans-national strand there are spaces among the 13 cooperation areas where partners can clearly benefit from the trans-national approach both from a geographical and thematic point of view. The programme "Alpine Space" 2007-2013 which covers the Alpine regions of Germany, France, Italy and Slovenia and in which Liechtenstein and Switzerland also participate, is an example of one such trans-national programme. Approved in September 2007, the 130 million euro programme, 98 million of which represents European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding, aims to increase the area's competitiveness and attractiveness through working jointly in fields where trans-national cooperation has been shown to be more effective and solutions more sustainable than acting alone. The programme has three priorities. In the field of competitiveness and attractiveness, the programme aims to promote innovation, entrepreneurship and research and development (R&amp;D) among small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to enhance cultural heritage and strengthen urban areas as engines for sustainable development. Another area of paramount importance to Alpine Space countries is accessibility. Here the programme will focus on securing fair access to public services, to transport, particularly sustainable and innovative mobility and also to connectivity which forms the basis for a knowledge-driven Information Society. The prevention, mitigation and management of natural and technological hazards is the programme's third priority. Enhancing cooperation in environmental protection issues, stimulating an integrated approach to conservation and resource efficiency are among the issues addressed.</p>
<p>The broad consultation launched by the Commission at the occasion of the 4<span class="sup">th</span> Cohesion Forum put forward the question how cohesion policy should address territorial specificities and how the global challenges affecting these areas should be treated. There is undoubtedly an urgent need to reinforce multi-level governance and to ensure consistency between actions to promote territorial development and the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0063"></a>

<p>The Commission Communication "Towards a Common Immigration Policy"<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of December 2007 establishes the need for a stronger and coherent European approach towards migration. This appeal was confirmed by the most recent European Council.</p>
<p>This need felt by many European citizens is also reflected in the various instruments the European Union has at its disposition.</p>
<p>There are first of all the instruments in the area of justice, liberty and security. These include the External Borders Fund, the Frontex Agency and the European Refugee Fund.</p>
<p>The issues related to demographic change and specifically migration flows have indeed been one of the elements that Member States have taken into account when drawing up their national plans and operational programmes. Illegal immigration is one of these issues that affect both the economic and social cohesion within a region and between regions.</p>
<p>The framework for Cohesion Policy, through its Regulations and strategic guidelines, provide the interface between these European policies and the national needs and opportunities that have been identified.</p>
<p>The management and implementation of Cohesion Policy programmes financed through the Structural Funds is primarily the responsibility of the Member States and their regions.</p>
<p>In the above mentioned context, the European Social Fund (ESF) outlines action aimed at the better preparation of migrants and reinforces their social adaptation, while the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) also makes provisions – of relevance to migration – that could support investments and infrastructure expenditure in the sectors of public health, social inclusion, labour market conditions, cross-border activities and even activities in non-EU countries under certain conditions provided that such expenditure is foreseen in the relevant operational programme(s). The answer to the first part of the question is therefore positive. The policy has taken the migration dimension into account in its particular national, regional and local context.</p>
<p>The Commission reminds the Honourable Member of the recent Cohesion Reports in which the involvement of local and regional authorities in the development and implementation of immigration and asylum policies is stressed. These authorities, together with the social partners, non-governmental organisation(NGOs) and other local actors, play an increasingly important role in integrating third country nationals into society and economic life. A coordinated approach is needed, which includes ensuring access to education and training, health and social services, decent housing and so on. The reports also contain information on net migration and linked issues such as demographic and labour market change. The policy developed has also been fed and inspired by various calculations using social economic models and thus implicitly taking immigration aspects on board.</p>
<p>In relation to Greece, the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) for Greece for 2007–2013 sets out the overall strategy for Cohesion Policy. It takes account of the socio-economic situation in Greece, in order to develop a vision for the development of the country. In doing so, the presence of immigrants is of course a factor in the analysis undertaken.</p>
<p>The resulting Operational Programmes (OPs) address the issues posed by the presence of immigrants and focus in particular on their integration into labour market, with specific actions being foreseen.</p>
<p>The particular challenges posed to Greece as a frontier country in terms of illegal immigration are addressed by programmes administered by Directorate-General (DG) Justice, Liberty and Security (JLS). The Commission has elaborated a number of measures, based on the principle of solidarity, to support in particular those Member States such as Greece that are confronted with increasing migratory pressures. Member States are already working together in joint operations in the Mediterranean, under the coordination of the Frontex Agency, aiming at a more effective surveillance of the EU's Southern maritime borders and the open sea with a view of curbing seaborne illegal immigration and of preventing humanitarian tragedies. Taking into consideration that countries with a maritime border have experienced pressure of spontaneous arrivals of irregular migrants and asylum seekers, they should actively use the financial support available from existing or planned funding possibilities, like the European Refugee Fund, the External Borders Fund, the Integration Fund and in near future the Return Fund, which are allocated to the Member States in proportion to their share of burden.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the Commission’s opinion, Directive 89/552/EEC, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (previously known as the Television without Frontiers Directive), as amended by Directive 2007/65/EC of 11 December 2007, updates the European legislation to adapt it to the current European audiovisual landscape, the envisaged changes in the markets, technological progress and new advertising techniques in use. The reasons are set out below.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Directive concerned covers all linear audiovisual media services (provided on the basis of a programme schedule), irrespective of the technology or platform used (traditional broadcasting, mobile telephone, Internet Protocol (IP) television, etc.), and non-linear audiovisual media services (on-demand video or programmes). The result is that all audiovisual commercial communications, not just television advertising, are now subject to the rules stipulating that such communications must not cause physical or moral detriment to minors.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Directive stipulates that the Member States and the Commission must encourage audiovisual media service providers to develop codes of conduct regarding inappropriate commercial communications, accompanying or included in children’s programmes, concerning nutritional substances such as fat, trans-fatty acids and salt, excessive intakes of which in the overall diet are not recommended from a medical point of view. These codes, which are to apply to the media service providers themselves (and indirectly to sponsors and advertisers), are in addition to the new provisions that Member States will have adopt to transpose into national law the provisions of the Directive aimed at protecting consumers, especially minors, and must facilitate their application. Moreover, since obesity in children is a problem that is caused by different factors, the Commission proposes in its White Paper on obesity of 30 May 2007<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> a comprehensive multi-sector strategy promoting various measures aimed, in particular, at providing better information to consumers, facilitating access to healthy food, encouraging physical activity, etc.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Directive recognises the importance of, and calls on the Member States to promote, media literacy as a special means of protecting families and children from harmful or offensive material (paragraph 37 of the preamble). The communication on media literacy in the digital environment<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> encourages actions that enable young audiences to develop a critical approach to commercial communication.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>European Network Information Security Agency (ENISA) has so far achieved very good results, considering its limitations in terms of funds and personnel. In only two years of activity, ENISA has proven, as supported by plenty of evidence, to be the right answer to Europe’s needs in the field of network and information security. All unsubstantiated claims about the ‘location’ of the seat have been definitively answered. Greece has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness and commitment to actively contribute towards the success of ENISA, by providing the Agency with substantial support. The presence of ENISA in Heraklion is also a significant step forward towards decentralisation and regional development in Europe.</p>
<p>There is a strong need to avoid wasting accumulated know-how and invested resources. We ask the European Commission why it does not support ENISA to continue effectively its successful activities by increasing its budget, staff and competences? Why are the tasks, competences, budget and staff of the new Telecoms Agency not assigned to ENISA?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission made proposals for the reform of the EU Telecom Rules on 13 November 2007. A key aspect is the proposal to create the European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA),<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> to stimulate creation of pan-European services in a Europe without frontiers, and further strengthen the internal market in electronic communications.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s opinion, network and information security must be a key policy priority of the reform to enable all stakeholders, including telecoms operators and regulators to respond faster, quicker and in a coordinated way to security breaches and attacks. This is why the Commission proposed to enhance the security-related provisions of the current EU rules, taking into account the results of a public consultation last year. Notably, the proposed package introduces better instruments to fight against network security breaches and to strengthen networks against cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Even though the findings of the evaluation of ENISA indicate that its achievements were adequate or even good,<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the Commission believes that today’s network security challenges should be addressed by ensuring new synergies between the work of telecommunications regulators and security experts, with a view to making Europe’s information and communication networks more secure. Moreover, these synergies should be utilised in assisting the effective implementation of the strengthened network security rules. This is why the Commission’s proposal includes a substantial focus on the challenges posed by network and information security in the broader context of the dynamics of the internal market in electronic communications.</p>
<p>The scope of EECMA is much wider than that of ENISA. EECMA will play a very important role in the reform of the whole field of electronic communication regulations. Because the activities of ENISA relate to a limited, albeit important, part of this field, the Commission has proposed a new Authority that will integrate responsibility for the activities currently undertaken by ENISA. A proposal for a Regulation amending the current ENISA Regulation to extend its duration until the EECMA assumes responsibility for its activities on network and information security on 14 March 2011 was necessary and has therefore been adopted by the Commission on 20 December 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission recalls the scope of its strategy for mobile TV outlined in the Commission Communication of July 2007 on Strengthening the Internal Market for Mobile TV. In this document, the term mobile TV refers to broadcast terrestrial mobile TV services only. The Commission is aware that there are various ways to provide mobile TV, ranging from cellular networks to satellite. However, terrestrial broadcast is an indispensable element to develop a mass market for these new innovative services and this is why it is at the centre of the Commission's current action. The Honourable Member in her question asks for a clarification of the definition of mobile TV in the context of content regulation. As mentioned, mobile TV in its scope as mentioned refers to a sub-set of audiovisual media services which are governed by the recently adopted Audiovisual Media Services Directive. Like "fixed" television broadcasts, broadcast terrestrial mobile TV is defined as a linear audiovisual media service as outlined in Article 1(e) of the Directive.</p>
<p>The eCommerce Directive, which does not provide for a specific definition of audiovisual services but a general definition of information society services, also coordinates certain fields with regard to those audiovisual services which are provided at the individual request of the recipient.</p>
<p>Regarding the second part of the question, which deals with media pluralism, the Commission would like to quote from the Audiovisual Media Services Directive: "Audiovisual media services are as much cultural services as they are economic services. Their growing importance for societies, democracy – in particular by ensuring freedom of information, diversity of opinion and media pluralism – education and culture justifies the application of specific rules to these services." Provisions in terms of protection of minors or cultural diversity as stipulated in the directive apply to mobile TV as to any other service covered by the Directive.</p>
<p>Mobile TV is a nascent service platform which should benefit from a light touch regulatory approach. Therefore inappropriate obligations such as must carry rules should not be imposed. However, the main national channels, both public and private, will be most certainly in every mobile TV bouquet out of business decisions, as offerings would lose much appeal without them.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to draw the Honourable Member's attention to the fact that DVB-H, the mobile TV standard favoured by the Commission, can carry a large number of channels, thus enhancing media pluralism.</p>
<p>The last aspect of the question deals with radio spectrum. The two Directives mentioned have no direct relationship with the regulation of radio spectrum. From a spectrum policy viewpoint, mobile TV services delivered over the airwaves should follow the same rules and regulations as any Electronic Communication Services, as defined in the current EU regulatory framework.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Communication on Creative Content Online was indeed adopted on 3 January 2008. It explores added-value actions that could be taken at European level to improve the competitiveness of the European online content production and distribution industry.</p>
<p>The online distribution of high value "creative content" represents a major structural change in the European content market. Such high value "creative content" covers music, audiovisual content, radio, online games, online publishing and educational content. New market developments also arise from Web 2.0, i.e. user-created content.</p>
<p>The Commission encourages the content industry, telecoms companies and Internet service providers to work closely together to make available more content online, while at the same time ensuring a robust protection of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to stress that the debate within the Content Online initiative will also address the new advantages and opportunities offered by the new technologies with the view to strengthening the creation, marketing and competitiveness of European culture in general. In line with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention on cultural diversity, the Commission considers as a priority to support cultural diversity in creative content.</p>
<p>The Commission deems that there are four main, horizontal challenges which merit discussion, exchange of good practice and possibly a coordinated approach at EU-level: availability of creative content; improved licensing for creative content; interoperability and transparency of Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems; and an effective fight against piracy.</p>
<p>The market for online creative content is emerging and developments take place at a rapid pace. This calls for a twofold approach to deal with already identified challenges that need to be addressed quickly, and to launch further discussions on some of the existing and forthcoming challenges.</p>
<p>To help kick start the process the Communication on Creative Content Online has launched a focused public consultation in preparation for the adoption of a Recommendation by the Council and the Parliament. The public consultation is based on a questionnaire included in the Communication and the deadline for replies is 29 February 2008. The questionnaire focuses on three issues: interoperability and transparency of DRM systems; multi-territory licensing for creative content; and legal offers and piracy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in parallel, the Commission is creating a stakeholders' discussion and cooperation platform, the so-called "Content Online Platform". The remit of the Content Online Platform will include the issues mentioned in this Communication such as: availability of content, improvement of rights clearance mechanisms, development of multi-territory licensing, management of copyright online, and cooperation mechanisms to improve respect of copyright in the online environment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0043"></a>

<p>When the 'Eurotariff' for making and receiving calls by mobile phone abroad (Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 717/2007<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) entered into force, the Commission said that it would also strictly monitor agreements between service-providers concerning the costs incurred by people living in border regions. The first report of the European Regulators' Group (ERG), which was published on 17 January 2008, now states that operators do not regard this as a major problem because relatively few consumers are involved. Moreover, it is possible for most providers to cancel charges arising from 'inadvertent' roaming as a sign of good will. However, we learn from an inquiry to the Association of European Border Regions (AEBR) that many residents of border areas are still receiving excessively large bills. Technically, it is possible to prevent inadvertent roaming by means of location using triangulation and by means of traffic steering. It should also be possible to inform consumers that inadvertent roaming can be prevented by switching off the 'automatic network selection' option in their telephone.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that the goodwill policy of operators, referred to in the ERG report, is sufficient? What does the Commission think of the idea of requiring providers to inform consumers about this and also to take measures at source to definitively put an end to the annoying phenomenon of inadvertent roaming?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Under Article 7 (3) of the Roaming Regulation, national regulatory authorities are required to be alert to the particular case of involuntary roaming in the border regions of neighbouring Member States. The Commission is required to report to the Council and Parliament on the functioning of the Roaming Regulation at the end of 2008 and will include the issue of involuntary roaming in that Report. In that context all national regulatory authorities, under the auspices of the European Regulators Group (ERG), have carried out a first detailed data collection exercise which, at the behest of the Commission, included questions to all operators in the EU on the issue of involuntary roaming.</p>
<p>As stated by the Honourable Member in his question, the ERG has now issued its Report which included responses from operators to questions that had been raised concerning inadvertent roaming. Operators claimed that inadvertent roaming was not a significant problem, with apparently relatively few consumers adversely affected. Providers claimed that information was generally available on their websites, and where a particular issue was identified by national regulators (for example between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) providers generally took additional steps to ensure consumers were aware of the issue, in some cases offering specific bespoke tariffs. The majority of providers also reported that where roaming genuinely occurred inadvertently, charges may be waived as a goodwill gesture.</p>
<p>The Commission is now considering the ERG's findings and will shortly discuss this issue again with the national regulatory authorities to ascertain what further action could be taken by them to address this issue. The Commission shares the concern that this is not an insignificant problem for those affected. Also, following specific complaints, the Commission has recently contacted national regulatory authorities in Germany, France and Luxembourg asking for their comments and details of the action they are taking on this issue. The Commission believes that the initiative undertaken by the Irish and United Kingdom authorities provides a very good example for others to follow. It is too early to say what conclusions the Commission will come to on this issue in its end of year Report to the Council and Parliament. ERG will publish a second Report to the Commission in July of this year.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Commission believes that problems such as involuntary roaming are the result of the fragmentation of the EU telecoms markets into 27 markets. This issue can be addressed by its proposals for greater harmonisation of regulation including a European Telecom Market Authority to support the Commission and national regulators in regulating better, more speedily and more consistently across the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The majority of Member States appear to favour a coordination of activities in the telecommunications area rather than a heavy-handed regulatory approach, a role that may be well fulfilled by ENISA, if a thin layer of competences in telecommunications is added to ENISA’s mandate (currently under revision).</p>
<p>The Commission is therefore asked: why is the Community value built by ENISA being discarded instead of expanding the mandate of ENISA with a view to encompassing the planned new activities of ETMA?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The mid-term evaluation of ENISA, launched in 2006 by the Commission<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, indicated that the Agency’s achievements were adequate in the light of the limited means at its disposal. They confirmed the validity of the policy rationale behind the creation of ENISA and its original goals as well as the relevance of acting through a European agency. Improvements made following suggestions by the evaluators and the Management Board are contributing to improve ENISA’s work.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission believes that today’s network security challenges should be addressed by ensuring new synergies between the work of telecommunications regulators and security experts, with a view to making Europe’s information and communication networks more secure. Moreover, these synergies should be utilised in assisting the effective implementation of the strengthened network security rules. This is why the Commission's recent proposals include a substantial focus on the challenges posed by network and information security in the broader context of the dynamics of the single market in electronic communications.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that its proposal<a href="#defann_42_2" name="refann_42_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> to create the European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA) will stimulate the creation of pan-European services in a Europe without frontiers, and further strengthen the single market in electronic communications while enabling all stakeholders, including telecom operators and regulators, to respond faster and in a coordinated way to security breaches and attacks.</p>
<p>The scope of EECMA is wider than that of ENISA and it will reach a critical mass in terms of human resources and budget. EECMA will play an important role in the reform of the whole field of electronic communication regulations. The activities of ENISA in contrast relate to a circumscribed albeit very important part of this field, which is one of the reasons why the Commission has proposed a new Authority integrating responsibility for the activities currently undertaken by ENISA.</p>
<p>A proposal for a Regulation amending the current ENISA Regulation to extend its duration until the EECMA assumes responsibility for its activities on network and information security on 14 March 2011 was necessary and has therefore been adopted by the Commission on 20 December 2007.</p>
<p>A new Authority must be free to hire its own staff. Naturally, it will be hiring the best people that apply for positions. ENISA staff should have good prospects in this process, since they are highly qualified, have the right profile and in addition can put forward their directly relevant experience at ENISA.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission agrees with the honourable Member that it is essential for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries to have an independent and effective media.</p>
<p>As part of the programming for the 10<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (EDF), priority has been given to democratic governance in all its dimensions in the dialogue between partners in the preparation of the cooperation strategies and national indicative programmes. In that regard, the Commission and the EU Member States represented in each partner country have carried out an analysis of the democratic governance process and governance profiles have been drawn up.</p>
<p>The press situation and restrictions on press freedom and capacity are analysed in the profiles. The conclusions are incorporated in the programming dialogue with the partner country, which is encouraged, where necessary, to commit to reforms in various areas and to implement measures to tackle the problems highlighted. All press matters are thus an integral part of the programming dialogue, but they are also discussed during the regular political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p>As regards financial support, where the reform measures or actions envisaged by the government require financial backing within the framework of the cooperation between the Community and the partner country under the Cotonou Agreement, EDF funds may be used. Indeed, €1.5 million was recently allocated to the media support project in Mauritania for analyses and viability studies on press firms, strengthening radio services, improving the distribution of the print media, supporting radio and written production, and enhancing journalist capacity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, most of the media support activities financed by the EDF are part of broader projects focusing on democratisation, human rights and the rule of law. This applies, for example, to most electoral assistance projects, which have a component on media assistance, journalist training, logistical support for communication agencies and support for civil society organisations for the monitoring of media activities.</p>
<p>EDF financing can be usefully supplemented in particular by funds from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which does not require any explicit prior agreement from the partner country authorities. The EIDHR provides direct support for the initiatives of civil society actors. Examples of actions to support the press or promote press freedom in ACP countries include actions in Chad, Namibia, Rwanda and Sudan.

<p>The Commission has adopted a policy aimed at establishing and strengthening passenger rights. In line with this policy, the Commission launched in 2007 an impact assessment study on the establishment of rights of passengers with reduced mobility in maritime transport. On the basis of this study, the Commission is currently finalising an impact assessment that assesses different options in view of improving the rights of passengers when travelling by ferry or cruise, and more particularly passengers with reduced mobility.</p>
<p>It is correct that such initiative does not appear as such in the Commission's Legislative and Work Programme 2008.

<p>Officially, the Zambian Government aims to guarantee access to HIV treatment for all by 2010.</p>
<p>In a recent report, Human Rights Watch describes in detail how the Zambian Government is failing to provide HIV treatment for women. Numerous obstacles prevent women from gaining access to appropriate treatment; these include inveterate gender-based violence and the discrimination inherent in property law and divorce law. Human Rights Watch's conclusion is clear: unless the Zambian Government enacts specific legislation against gender-based violence and eliminates discrimination in other fields of the law, women will never enjoy full access to HIV treatment (report by Human Rights Watch, 'Hidden in the mealie meal: gender-based abuses and women's HIV treatment in Zambia', in: Human Rights Watch, 'Zambia: abuses against women obstruct HIV treatment', 18 December 2007).</p>
<p>Does the Commission endorse the conclusions of Human Rights Watch? How is this issue raised? Does not the Commission consider that the provision of development aid should be made conditional on progress in this vital field?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The report by Human Rights Watch to which refers the Honourable Member has been reviewed with interest by the Commission. The comprehensive review of the situation regarding women's access to antiretroviral treatment and in particular the qualitative analysis based on a series of interviews and focus group discussions provides important insights with regard to the impact of gender-based abuses on women's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment. It can be assumed that the findings are equally relevant to other countries in Southern Africa and developing countries at large.</p>
<p>As noted in the report, in 2006 women accounted for 57% of the approximately 1.1 million people living with HIV in Zambia. While more women than men have ever been tested (15.3% and 11.4% respectively), and 61% of those accessing HIV treatment were women, the report rightly underlines the significance of addressing gender inequality and gender-based abuses as barriers for scaling up access to HIV treatment for women, and in particular to ensure optimal adherence for women receiving HIV treatment.</p>
<p>The Commission is equally concerned with regard to the marked difference in HIV prevalence in particular among young women and young men (in 2005 12.7% and 3.8% respectively), which is driven by and reflects the great and persistent disparity among men and women in Zambia, ranking number 130 among 144 with a Gender Development Index of 0.383. The situation in Zambia is also characterized by widespread violence against women including children, rape and sex-for-food practices.</p>
<p>However it is important to note the impressive progress made by the Government of Zambia and partners in scaling up access to HIV treatment, from only 1,483 people in 2004 to more than 122,700 in September 2007. In addition, the government has taken several steps to enact and enforce legislation and services addressing sexual abuses, including the creation of victim support units and shelters as well as the recent amendment of the Penal Code to widen the scope of sexual crimes, which has led to more severe punishment for sexual offences.</p>
<p>The conclusions and recommendations of the Human Rights Watch report correspond well with the support planned for Zambia in the context of the 10<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund. Human Development/Health will be a focal sector with the objective of enhancing human development in Zambia through secure, improved access to good quality basic health services, including equitable access to health services especially for children, women and disadvantaged localities.</p>
<p>The Commission works in close coordination with Member States and other donors to support the Fifth National Development Plan, where gender features as a full chapter with the goal to eliminate gender imbalances and attain gender equality, and also appear as a specific focus under the health chapter. The government plans to fully integrate the gender dimension in the monitoring and evaluation system related to the human development area, in particular addressing poor performance in reduction of maternal mortality and discrimination against women in access to health care including family planning.</p>
<p>The constructive and concrete recommendations of the Human Rights Watch report provide valuable guidance for government efforts to ensure women's rights, services which work for women and women's participation in decision making, and for the European Commission's policy dialogue with the government.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0004"></a>

<p>In June 2005, the European Council called for a period of reflection on how to take the institutional reform forward. In response to this call, the Commission adopted Plan D for Dialogue, Democracy and Debate on 13 October 2005<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It experimented ways of bringing people together locally, nationally and across borders and of giving them the means to debate in an informed way about European issues. It also encouraged Member States to organise a broad public debate on the future of the European Union, involving citizens, civil society, social partners, national parliaments and political parties, with the support of the EU institutions. The main axis of Plan D was defined as listening better, explaining better, and going local to engage citizens. As a matter of fact, Plan D did not involve any extra money. The initiatives were financed through the re-focusing of the Directorate-General Communication (DG COMM) budget in order to make the Commission action more efficient and citizen-oriented.</p>
<p>The leading vehicles of these actions were the trans-national European citizens' projects co-funded by the Commission. Three were EU-wide<a href="#defann_50_2" name="refann_50_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>and three involved part of the Member States<a href="#defann_50_3" name="refann_50_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.The aim of these projects was to enable people from the different national public spheres to connect with each other and with the decision-makers. Therefore, the projects explored different ways of combining virtual and face to face communication as well as deliberative consultation and polling at national and European level. Overall, approximately 40,000 citizens participated physically in the six trans-national projects, while they reached out to about 1.5 million people via the internet.</p>
<p>Besides these projects, Citizens' Fora events took place in the majority of Member States. The "Debate Europe" forum was conceived as an online discussion space where EU citizens could exchange their views and opinions on a variety of EU-related subjects. Since its launch in March 2006, the forum has received thousands of contributions and over 1.3 million views. It won the European eDemocracy Award in 2006. The Europe Direct centres organised 3672 regional and local events with citizens. A special Eurobarometer survey on the future of Europe was published in May 2006 and some of its items were integrated into the standard Eurobarometer surveys.</p>
<p>In November 2006, the Commission decided to co-fund a series of regional and local civil society initiatives targeting youth and women; to develop a network of European public spaces in Member States; to re-launch the debate on the Internet; and to better target Eurobarometer surveys. Fourteen Commission Representations are now co-funding a series of local civil society projects covering a wide range of issues including the social inclusion of women, helping young people to understand better the European Single Market, food safety and climate change. In 2007, "European public spaces" were set up as a pilot project in three locations: Tallinn, Dublin and Madrid. These spaces provide information and documentation, host exhibitions, films, debates, forums and lectures as well as training and seminars on European issues. Using web-based multilingual conferencing facilities, they are also able to host trans-national debates. The "Debate Europe" website on Europa was re-launched at the end of January 2008. It is easier to use and will, for the time being, focus on three main topics: the Future of Europe, Energy and Climate Change and Intercultural Dialogue.</p>
<p>The listening, two-way dialogue approach promoted by Plan D proved to be well suited to the period of reflection of 2005-2007. The standard Eurobarometer surveys carried out in spring and autumn 2007 show a marked increase in citizens' support for membership of the EU, in the positive perception of the EU and of trust in its institutions. Although these developments also depend on other factors, the Plan D approach is a useful way to accompany the development of a European public sphere. It is a form of political communication which is well adapted to the emergence of multicultural and cross-border democracy in Europe. It is therefore destined to become a long-term framework for communicating with citizens and promoting participatory democracy on EU-related affairs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In addition to efforts towards the negotiation of agreements to ensure visa-free travel, considerable funds are allocated to support education cooperation and mobility opportunities for students from the Western Balkans<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>:</p>
<p>Under the Tempus Programme, an amount of €20 million has been earmarked on an annual basis for the cooperation between academic institutions of the Western Balkans and the EU Member States in the field of higher education.</p>
<p>In addition to the possibilities offered to the students from all the third countries under the Erasmus Mundus Programme, the Commission has been offering through the pre-accession instrument a considerable number of scholarships for students from the Western Balkans. Specifically, €4 million have been earmarked on a yearly basis since 2006 for scholarships to students following an Erasmus Mundus master course as of the academic year 2007-2008 (“Western Balkans window”), and an additional €6 million have been earmarked since 2007 for scholarships to students and academic staff at all levels as of the academic year 2008-2009 (“the Erasmus Mundus External Cooperation window”). A further increase of the amounts allocated and the corresponding number of scholarships offered is currently under consideration.</p>
<p>In the framework of the Youth In Action Programme, additional support has been provided from the pre-accession instrument (€1 million in 2007, and €1,5 million planned in 2008) to expand the possibilities of youth exchanges and trans-national projects among young people and youth organisations in the Western Balkans and with the EU Member States, which contributes to foster inter-ethnic and inter-religious dialogue.</p>
<p>Inter-cultural dialogue is also promoted through the Culture Programme, which stimulates cooperation and cultural exchanges in order to promote the diversity of cultures and languages in Europe and improve knowledge among European citizens of European cultures other than their own. The Culture Programme is open for all candidate and potential candidate countries. The candidate countries (Croatia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey) and Serbia already participate in the Culture Programme. Candidate and potential candidate countries are also eligible to participate in the Europe for Citizens Programme. Croatia participates already, and preparations are under way for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania.</p>
<p>As announced in the 2007 Strategy Paper on enlargement<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, a new facility to promote civil society development and dialogue will be established this year. This new Civil Society Facility aims to contribute to open democratic societies in the candidate and potential candidate countries through strengthening civil society bodies and their role in the political process. The facility will cover three areas of intervention:</p>
<p>support for local civil society initiatives and capacity building, reinforcing the role of civil society;</p>
<p>programmes to bring journalists, young politicians, trade union leaders, teachers etc into contact with EU institutions (“people-to-people” programmes);</p>
<p>support for building partnerships and the development of networks between the civil society organisations in the beneficiary countries, business, trade unions and other social partners and professional organisations, and their counterparts in the EU to promote transfer of knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>Overall support to civil society in the Western Balkans through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) will increase substantially, reaching an estimated amount above €90 million for the period 2008-2010, an estimated threefold increase with respect to the period 2005-2007. Assistance provided to civil society under the IPA complements support given under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR)<a href="#defann_51_3" name="refann_51_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Inter-cultural dialogue is also supported through projects on natural and cultural heritage as well as the cross-border-cooperation component of the IPA Programmes, which include projects for people-to-people contacts and other inter-cultural activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Pursuant to EC Treaty (art. 151), EU competence in the culture area consists in contributing to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Commission is very active in the promotion of cultural diversity and is mainstreaming this value in many of its activities and programmes.</p>
<p>Intercultural dialogue is one of the three objectives of the Culture programme (2007-2013), meaning that projects supported under this programme have a strong intercultural dimension. The two other objectives are the mobility of cultural players and of art and cultural works.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. The Commission is going to support many projects specifically aimed at fostering intercultural dialogue. Several other activities are planned in this context throughout the year in order to bring the richness of European cultural diversity to the fore.</p>
<p>In addition, under a pilot scheme for artist mobility voted by the Parliament, the Commission will undertake a feasibility study this year for a comprehensive scheme designed to provide a European wide system of information on the different aspects to mobility in the cultural sector. It will also publish a call for proposals aimed at funding networking structures supporting mobility at national level in order to develop exchanges of best practices.</p>
<p>All these activities will nurture the Commission's medium-term reflections with a view to preparing the next generation of programmes in the field of education and culture for the post-2013 period, in which cultural diversity will continue to have a central position.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0015"></a>

<p>Today, the provisions of Directive 93/119/EC allow for derogation from stunning in the case of religious slaughter taking place in slaughterhouses. This reflects the Protocol on the Protection and Welfare of Animals<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> annexed to the EC Treaty which insists on respecting religious rites when considering the welfare requirements of the animals.

<p>As the right of freedom of religion, including the freedom to manifest one's religious beliefs in worship, teaching, practice or observance, is part of the fundamental rights that all EU citizens enjoy, the Commission has no intention to put this right into question when revising the directive. At the same time, the Commission has no plans to extend further this derogation from stunning prior to slaughter.</p>
<p>As regards the drafting of a new EU legislative proposal on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing, the Commission confirms that it has started in 2006 a process of revision of Directive 93/119/EC<a href="#defann_54_2" name="refann_54_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The possible content of new provisions in this area has been widely discussed with stakeholders, and the Commission expects to present a draft proposal by July 2008.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the project concerning the gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea, known as the "Nord Stream" project. Indeed this project is included in the list of priority projects of Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as "North European gas pipeline". Article 13 of this decision stipulates that where an environmental impact assessment is required in accordance with relevant Community legislation, the results of such an assessment have to be taken into consideration before a decision on the carrying out of the projects is actually taken in accordance with the relevant Community legislation.</p>
<p>An environmental impact assessment under the Espoo Convention (Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context) is currently in process and expected to be concluded later in 2008. Similar questions related to environment have to be treated in that framework and assessed by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned. It has to be noted that consultations with other countries, contracting parties of the Espoo Convention are an important part of this process.</p>
<p>With respect to the specific question, it is understood that glutaraldehyde is to be used in pressure tests of oil and gas pipelines as a biocide to prevent bacterial growth that produces corrosion. This use of glutaraldehyde would be covered by Directive 98/8/EC concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market<a href="#defann_56_2" name="refann_56_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and would fall under product-type 12 (ie slimicides), which covers products used for the prevention or control of slime growth on materials, equipment and structures used in industrial processes.</p>
<p>Glutaraldehye for product-type 12 is to be assessed under the 10-year review programme established by Directive 98/8/EC for the evaluation of substances used in biocidal products which were already on the market at the time of entry into force of the Directive. Until the substance evaluation has been concluded, biocidal products containing glutaraldehyde and used in product-type 12 can remain on the market and Member States can continue to apply their national rules regarding the placing of biocidal products on their market.</p>
<p>The Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC<a href="#defann_56_3" name="refann_56_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> aims to protect both the inland and coastal waters against pollution. One of its objectives is to prevent deterioration of the ecological status of water bodies. In authorising any activity like the one described in the oral question, Member States should ensure that the WFD's objectives are respected and that any deterioration of status is prevented.</p>
<p>With respect to nature protection, the site in question seems to relate to a Site of Community Importance (Natura 2000 site) of Gotska Sandön-Salvorev. This site is located at the Northeastern corner of the Island of Gotland and it has been mainly designated for the protection of underwater sandbanks. The total size of the area is 60 500 ha. The site is also distribution area of grey seals which are protected under the Habitats Directive<a href="#defann_56_4" name="refann_56_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. The rules for the protection of sites which have been designated as Sites of Community Importance under the Habitats Directive are laid down in article 6 of the Directive. This protection regime inter alia foresees that the effects of projects which are likely to have a significant impact on a Natura 2000 site must be duly assessed and that such projects may be authorised only under certain conditions. If the pipeline project mentioned by the Honourable Member is likely to have significant impact on the above mentioned Natura 2000 site, it is the responsibility of the competent Swedish authorities to make sure that the abovementioned provisions are being respected. This means that the authorities must ensure that a sound assessment of the project's impact on the protected nature values is carried out before the project is authorised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The aim of Commission Regulation (EC) 1546/2006<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> is to address the threat to civil aviation that is posed by home-made liquid explosives. As such, it prohibits passengers on flights departing from Community airports from taking liquids in hand luggage in individual quantities greater than 100ml.</p>
<p>However, an exemption has been granted for liquids sold at airport shops and on-board aircraft when certain security conditions are met, including the "tamper evident" bag system.</p>
<p>Given that Community legislation does not apply in third countries it cannot be assumed that airports in third countries or non-Community air carriers have security requirements that are equivalent to those applied within the European Union and the European Economic Area. Consequently, such airports and airlines cannot automatically benefit from the exemption.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has developed, in Commission Regulation (EC) 915/2007<a href="#defann_58_3" name="refann_58_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, a means of establishing equivalence of security measures for liquids sold at third country airports, and in such cases an exemption may be granted.</p>
<p>This possibility is available to all third country airports and the Commission has thus far received applications from several third countries.</p>
<p>To date, one country – Singapore – has satisfied the Commission of the equivalence of the security provisions at its airport with those applicable in the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EC) 915/2007. Thus liquids bought there may be exempted from confiscation at security points at Community airports, provided the liquid is in a tamper-evident bag and that it also displays satisfactory proof of purchase on airside at Singapore within the preceding thirty-six hours.</p>
<p>The process of granting equivalence for the security provisions at third country airports is determined largely by the third country itself, as is any wish to apply for the process. In order to be granted equivalence they must demonstrate that their security standards are equivalent, which includes analysis of the national legislation and other pertinent information. In addition, they shall be applying the recommended security control guidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organisation for screening liquids, gels and aerosols and using tamper-evident bags for liquids sold at the airport. After the analysis of this information the Commission may supplement it by means of an inspection.</p>
<p>Whilst many third countries have expressed an interest in having their airports added to the list of exempted airports few have provided this information to substantiate their case or, in some cases, have regrettably not introduced the use of tamper-evident bags in airport shops.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Water Framework Directive<a href="#defann_59_2" name="refann_59_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (WFD) allows for a particular water-use activity to be potentially exempted from water charges only in cases of "established practices", i.e. practices that already existed under national laws at the time the Directive was adopted (2000). Therefore, it does not allow for new exemptions for specific water uses. According to the Irish authorities only households were exempted from paying water at the time the Directive was adopted.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that there are other conditions applicable to a possible exemption under Article 9.4. Member States must ensure that it does not compromise the achievement of the objectives of the Directive and should report the reasons for not fully applying the principle of cost recovery in the river basin management plans.</p>
<p>A proper water pricing is one of the most important tools to provide incentives to use water resources efficiently. The principal purpose of water-pricing under the WFD is therefore not to raise revenue, but to send a price signal acting as an incentive not to waste an exhaustible resource that requires expensive infrastructure to deliver and that may be necessary to sustain biodiversity and protect other important resources such as fisheries.</p>
<p>Charging for water on a metered basis – just like electricity or other utility – is perfectly consistent with EU water policy. Therefore the Irish Government approach to charge for water is in line with the WFD. On the other hand, while the choice of mechanisms for the funding of schools is entirely a matter for the Irish authorities, the Directive creates no obstacle to funding arrangements which enable Irish schools to meet their essential running costs, including for water. There is therefore no objection to block grants (a global amount) or capitation grants (amount per pupil). This combination of water charging and fixed allowance would allow schools to meet the normal metered costs while still providing an incentive for them to save water.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The question of the Honourable Member highlights the issue of the European Union speaking with one voice on external Energy issues. The Commission is working on all the aspects of the external energy policy falling into its present competence and is working towards a coherent approach outlining the possible instruments in this respect, which it expects to detail further this year. The EU's medium term security of energy supply, as well as the international geopolitical situation affecting energy supplies, is a cause of common concern for all Member States and requires the definition of a common European concept of security of supply, bearing in mind the following aspects.</p>
<p>First, the Member States of the European Union have the right to determine their choice between different energy sources and the general structure of their energy supply. However, in the context of the growing role of imports in the EU’s energy mix and the need to adopt a more coherent and focused EU approach to external energy security, the European Council of March 2007 recognised the importance of developing a common external policy approach in support of energy policy objectives.</p>
<p>Second, for major infrastructure projects, it is crucial to have a concrete debate within the EU on the collective interest in order to identify common priorities and promote greater co-ordination between Member States' policies. This happens already within the Trans European Networks for Energy (TEN-E) programme, which allows for the setting of European priority projects. Such a debate should contribute to a better understanding of the full impact of South Stream on EU interests and security of supply.</p>
<p>Third, it is important that Member States increasingly exchange timely information with the Commission and with each other on such bilateral projects that have implications for the EU’s security of energy supplies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0027"></a>

Measures specifically addressing odour therefore remain within the competence of the Member States. However, where problems of odour arise from the operation of certain industrial installations, those problems fall within the scope of Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC).<a href="#defann_62_1" name="refann_62_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> The industrial activities covered by that Directive include among others the production of chemicals on an industrial scale as well as waste water treatment plants in case they are associated with activities covered by the Directive.</p>
<p>Under the IPPC Directive, competent authorities are required to issue for each installation a permit including emission limit values or equivalent parameters and technical parameters based on best available techniques, taking into account the technical characteristics of the installation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions.</p>
<p>All the environmental impacts of the IPPC installations need to be controlled in the permits issued, for instance the releases into air, water, the generation of waste, the efficient use of energy and the protection of soil. Appropriate measures need also to be taken to address problems of odour which might arise from the operation of certain installations and, for example, the Reference Document on Best Available Techniques in Common Waste Water and Waste Gas Treatment/Management Systems in the Chemical Sector is specifying Best Available Techniques for the reduction of odour emissions.</p>
<p>Odours from waste management are regulated by Article 4 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste, which provides that Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment, and in particular without causing a nuisance, inter alia, through odours.<a href="#defann_62_2" name="refann_62_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>In addition, Annex I to Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste<a href="#defann_62_3" name="refann_62_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>mentions that measures shall be taken to minimise nuisances and hazards from a landfill through emissions of odours.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Symmetry is the name given to the integrated management system designed to provide full life-cycle management of the programmes, actions and projects of the Directorate-General for Education and Culture (EAC) as well as the Education Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA), and not simply the local financial system intended to replace Appfin.</p>
<p>The core financial and contractualisation module of Symmetry has been in pilot production since September 2007. An initial group of 41 pilot projects from 4 actions split between the Directorate-General and the Executive Agency have been used to prove the system (100% of commitments and 75% of pre-financing have been successfully completed; the remaining pre-financing could not be completed yet for budgetary reasons). These outcomes are considered positive and will lead to a gradual ramp-up to full production capacity over the course of 2008.</p>
<p>The principal contractor for the supply of the system is Intrasoft International; while in a secondary lot worth about 5% of the market, Siemens Business Services was selected as Quality Assurance contractor. The contractors were chosen by means of open public call for tender<a href="#defann_63_1" name="refann_63_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the first specific contracts for developing the system were signed in December 2001.</p>
<p>To date a total of €7,485,982 has been paid to cover all aspects of development including quality assurance, acceptance testing, user helpdesk and training services. A payment of €903,216 was made in 2007 to procure a high-performance server platform in the Commission's Luxemburg Data Centre for a period of four years.</p>
<p>The system has taken longer to reach its targets due to the need to be adapted to significant changes in the financial and organisational environment; in particular the introduction of the New Financial Regulations 2003 and 2006, the creation of the EACEA and the introduction of accrual accounting in January 2005.</p>
<p>When comparing Symmetry with Appfin, the latter is a local financial system with a restricted interface towards the central ABAC system and a limited set of functions. Symmetry offers a far wider range of functions including: online proposal submission, proposal selection, project contractualisation, follow-up, closure and reporting. Comparison of running costs is therefore difficult; however, once the main wave of development is concluded (end 2008) the running costs of the financial sub-systems of Symmetry should be lower than those of the ageing Appfin system.</p>
<p>The Internal Audit Service (IAS) has planned an information technology (IT) audit of the Symmetry application, once it is in large-scale operation, in the period 2008-2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Some large European companies, such as Total and Shell, are continuing to burn off gas in Nigeria in conjunction with their oil-extraction operations, which is enormously damaging to the environment and also to the health of people living nearby. Gas is the by-product of the oil which is extracted in Nigeria and provides 95% of the country's income. The quantity of gas which is flared in Nigeria is equivalent to a quarter of Britain's entire consumption. According to the World Bank, 40 billion dollars is wasted every year by flaring natural gas, and the practice is responsible for 400 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere per annum. According to the World Bank, companies would do better to catch the gas and sell it in liquefied form. However, this would require investment.</p>
<p>In October 2007, the Nigerian Government announced that, as from 1 January 2008, flaring of gas would be banned. At the beginning of January, however, it decided to postpone the deadline until the end of 2008. The postponement is said to have resulted from pressure from the multinationals. In European countries, gas flaring in conjunction with oil extraction is prohibited. Will the Commission pressurise these companies to halt this damaging practice, or will it impose penalties on them if the Nigerian authorities do not punish them for their activities?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The damaging practice of gas flaring in the Niger Delta has a severe impact on the local environment, on the economy of Nigeria and also contributes massively to global climate changes. The Commission's recognition of the importance of taking action to reduce gas flaring is recalled in the "Africa-EU Strategic Partnership" (Priority action 5 "Partnership on energy") issued at the Lisbon EU-Africa Summit in December 2007. The Niger Delta is the place on earth in which the largest flaring operations occur. This practice – which begun some 40 years ago – has only been marginally reduced by the large investments made by multinational oil companies to liquefy natural gas. Nigeria, traditionally an important oil supplier is also becoming a major gas supplier. Its reserves make it the seventh largest natural gas reserve holder. In 2006 Nigeria exported to Europe 83% of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) production corresponding only to about 60% of the total gas extracted. The remaining 40% - mainly gas associated to oil wells lacking the infrastructure to collect and produce natural gas – was flared. Recent estimates indicate that some 24 billion m<span class="sup">3</span> of associated gas are flared every year. The government plans to raise earnings from gas exports to 50% of oil revenue by 2010 which will require investment in the range of € 10-12 billion to build large infrastructure including more gas liquefying plants and gas pipelines. One of the projects under consideration is a Trans-Saharan gas pipeline crossing the Sahara desert which in the future will provide an additional opportunity for gas export and could supply gas directly to Europe, through Niger and Algeria.</p>
<p>In such a context it was indeed disappointing to learn that the deadline set by the Government to stop gas flaring had been postponed to the end of 2008. While we hope that the new deadline will be met, we note that stopping gas flaring seems to have become a priority for the Government of Nigeria. Major stakeholders recently came together to develop a road map for the elimination of flaring within a realistic time frame. The representatives from several ministries and sector companies agreed to establish a Flare Reduction Committee – chaired by the Minister of State for Gas - the work of which is likely to be facilitated by the World Bank Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR), which the Commission is supporting and contributing to.</p>
<p>Two avenues are available to the Commission to address gas flaring concerns: i) the EU/Nigeria political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement; and ii) the ongoing programming of the development cooperation under the 10<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (EDF).</p>
<p>Concerning possible interventions against the EU oil companies operating in Nigeria, in the form of pressure or action, the Commission does not have the legal power to impose sanctions. As part of its policy to promote corporate social responsibility (CSR), however, the Commission does support CSR codes of conduct that are adhered to by companies on a voluntary basis in and outside the EU. For example, the Commission is supporting and contributing to such codes of conduct as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which is a powerful tool to monitor the revenues derived from the mineral sector. The Commission is also committed to promoting awareness and implementation of reference international instruments and initiatives on CSR, such as the International Labor Organisation (ILO) Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) and Social Policy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for MNEs and the United Nations (UN) Global Compact.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0034"></a>

<p>Climate change is being exacerbated by the enlargement of dry regions on all continents, which are rapidly warming up and changing both local and regional climate.

<p>In July 2007 the European Commission adopted a Communication on water scarcity and droughts. These issues have emerged as a major challenge and climate change is expected to exacerbate it further as underscored by the Commission Green Paper on adaptation to climate change<a href="#defann_67_1" name="refann_67_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Communication identifies a set of policy options at European, national and regional levels to address and mitigate the challenge posed by water scarcity and droughts. To name just two key orientations promoted in the Communication: (1) Progressing towards full implementation of the Water Framework Directive; (2) Putting priority on water savings and all possibilities to improve water efficiency.</p>
<p>This Communication is based on the assessment of the EU water saving potential. In some regions, up to 30% of the volume of water consumed in buildings could be saved. In some cities, leakages in public water supply networks can exceed 50%. Similar wastage of water has been recorded in irrigation networks. There is therefore a huge potential for water saving across Europe. Water saving must become the priority and all possibilities to improve water efficiency must therefore be explored.</p>
<p>Policy making needs to be based on a clear water hierarchy. Additional water supply infrastructures should be considered as an option only when other options have been exhausted, including effective water pricing policies.</p>
<p>Alternative options like rain water harvesting are increasingly considered as potential options across Europe. Their development is subject to EU legislation and needs to be in line with the water hierarchy principle.</p>
<p>Further to the Communication, the Commission is now launching an in-depth risk and impact assessment of all alternative water supply options including rain water harvesting.</p>
<p>The Commission will present the outcomes of this assessment in the follow up report of the measures of the Communication to be adopted by the end of 2008. Initial results will be presented at the meeting of a Stakeholder Forum planned for early September 2008 in Zaragoza.</p>
<p>Regarding developing countries affected by droughts, desertification and land degradation, the Commission is actively involved in supporting the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Programs to address this problem obviously include sustainable water resources management schemes. The Commission also supports specific programs related to water management and rainwater harvesting and use as part of its development programs. Finally, the EU Water Initiative is also a privileged tool to progress towards the achievement of the objectives of the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the Millennium Development Goals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Third European Road Safety Action Programme (EC 2003) specifically outlined a key proposal to ensure the proper enforcement of the most important safety rules in the areas of speed, drink driving and seat belt use. This resulted in a Recommendation on Enforcement in the field of road traffic law (European Commission 2003). The European Commission had a cost-benefit analysis carried out on the basis of proposals similar to the Recommendation. It assessed that increased enforcement would result in a total annual reduction of 14 000 road deaths and 680 000 injuries in the EU (ICF Consulting 2003). The Recommendation stated that the European Commission would by autumn 2007 evaluate if enforcement policies had improved sufficiently across the Member States and consider proposing more binding legislation, such as a Directive.</p>
<p>What have been the findings of this assessment and how will the European Commission ensure the improvement of traffic law enforcement in the Member States and cooperation across their borders?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has indeed carried out an assessment of whether enforcement policies have improved sufficiently across the Member States since the Commission Recommendation on enforcement in the field of road traffic law was adopted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the findings of this assessment are not positive, since the trend over the past years in road safety has not improved. True, the reduction of the number of fatalities was 6% in 2004, but in 2006 it was 5% and last year there was no reduction at all. Over the period from 2001 to 2007, the number of fatalities has decreased by 20%, while a 37% reduction would have been necessary if we want to reach the European objective of halving the number of road fatalities by 2010.</p>
<p>Enforcement has proven to be a very effective instrument for reducing the number of road accidents over a short time. Given the wide variety of traffic and road conditions found across the European Union, it is not appropriate to consider harmonising domestic traffic laws and penalties. But domestic laws and penalties must be respected by all drivers if road safety is to improve and at present we cannot be sure that drivers and car owners who commit a serious offence in a Member State other than that of their residence will be effectively pursued and sanctioned after they have returned home. Mechanisms for the exchange of data between national authorities remain limited and bilateral agreements have not delivered an effective EU-wide system. This is a serious loophole in enforcement which reduces the overall effectiveness of enforcement and the credibility of controls in the minds of domestic drivers. Here there is a clear European dimension and an issue to which Europe can bring a solution: a system of exchange of information on vehicle data is needed which would enable the Member State where an offence has been committed to find the person responsible regardless where in the European Union that person resides and to allow the responsible authorities to impose the corresponding sanction. This will encourage universal respect of road safety related traffic rules and ensure equal treatment of all European citizens under the law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0039"></a>

<p>The Honourable Member asks whether the Commission sees an opportunity to adapt Annex II.2 of the Birds Directive in a way that the corvids would be huntable for Austria.</p>
<p>It has been stressed to the Austrian authorities as well as to other interested parties who have contacted the Commission about this matter in the past years that the revision of Annex II of the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC<a href="#defann_69_2" name="refann_69_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>) is a very complex and lengthy procedure as it requires a full legislative process by co-decision, involving the Council and the Parliament.</p>
<p>In light of this the Commission has already made it clear that any adaptation of such kind must be done in a strategic way together with all Member States and must be based on comprehensive information on the conservation status of the species in Annex II. Such an approach may lead not only to the inclusion but also to the exclusion of certain species from Annex II.</p>
<p>At this moment the Commission does not envisage an adaptation of Annex II.2 of the Birds Directive. However, work is currently being undertaken in relation to some management plans for Annex II species.</p>
<p>In relation to the specific problem of Austria which seems mainly related to the hunting of crows, the Commission has on many occasions suggested to the Austrian regions to overcome their difficulties by making full use of the derogation procedure (Article 9 of the Directive). Derogations are permissible under Article 9 of the Directive for the purpose of preventing “serious damage to crops, livestock, forests, fisheries and water” and a range of other reasons. Some Länder have already taken this advice. The Commission can only continue to give that advice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member on the importance of free distribution both for the citizens and for the fruit and vegetables sector.</p>

<p>First of all, the Member State will have to ensure that its national strategy adopted in 2008 covers withdrawals. Secondly, the producer organisations will have to modify their operational programmes to meet the requirements of the reformed fruit and vegetables CMO as soon as the national strategy is established and before an application for the related payment is made.

<p>EU policy aims, inter alia, to close down permanently and redevelop uncontrolled waste tips, to introduce compulsory processing for all solid waste before it is buried in landfill sites, to use waste as a source of energy and to recycle packaging waste (Directives 75/442/EEC<a href="#defann_72_1" name="refann_72_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, 1999/31/EC<a href="#defann_72_2" name="refann_72_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, 2004/12/EC<a href="#defann_72_3" name="refann_72_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and 2006/12/EC<a href="#defann_72_4" name="refann_72_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>).

<p>The Commission has received a considerable number of complaints concerning the operation in Greece of illegal or uncontrolled sites, where the waste disposal endangers human health and harms the environment. In order to stop this practice, the Commission initiated a horizontal infringement procedure which concerns the operation of all illegal or uncontrolled waste disposal sites in Greece. In its judgment of 6 October 2005 (case C-502/03), the European Court of Justice declared that Greece had failed to comply with its obligations under Articles 4, 8 and 9 of Directive 75/442/EEC on waste<a href="#defann_72_5" name="refann_72_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> as amended (now Directive 2006/12/EC<a href="#defann_72_6" name="refann_72_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> - Waste Framework Directive). The judgment established that at least 1 125 illegal or uncontrolled landfills are operational in Greece. Greece must now comply with this ruling, in accordance with Article 228 of the EC Treaty. In this regard, the Greek authorities adopted a new national waste management plan and updated their regional waste management plans. Those new plans aim at the closure and rehabilitation of all illegal or uncontrolled waste dumping sites by the end of 2008 and their replacement by appropriate waste management infrastructure.</p>
<p>According to information received from the Greek authorities in October 2007, the Greek authorities have adopted decisions for the closure and rehabilitation of 1 038 illegal or uncontrolled waste dumping sites, while for 774 dumping sites the necessary rehabilitation works are underway. The Commission services are assessing this information and will take all necessary measures in order to ensure that Greece complies with the ECJ ruling.</p>
<p>The Commission collects information about recycling levels in Member States as an element of verifying the proper implementation of Community legislation. In 2005 Greece has achieved a recycling level of 41.8% which is well above the previous target of 25% recycling (set for 2001) but is still below the target of 55% recycling of packaging set for Greece for 2011. The detailed data for Greece as well as other Member States are available at the website http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/packaging/data.htm" </p>
<p>It should be noted that the information given at this page may be subject to change when countries send updates or corrections of data provided.</p>
<p>The management of hazardous waste in Greece is under scrutiny of the Commission. Greece has not adopted an adequate management plan for hazardous waste and tolerates the uncontrolled disposal of the majority of the hazardous waste produced, violating several key requirements of the Waste Framework Directive which is the central pillar of EU legislation designed to ensure environmentally sound waste management in Member States.</p>
<p>After being sent a final warning in December 2005, Greece modified its legal framework for the management of hazardous waste and adopted a new management plan that was sent to the Commission in March 2007. Despite that adoption, Greece is still not complying with its obligations.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the plan is too general and does not provide a coherent waste management strategy. The Commission takes the view that the management plan adopted is not sufficiently precise, in particular as regards the identification of suitable disposal sites, and that the inventory of hazardous waste is not yet definitive for all categories. Thousands of tons are stocked "temporarily", pending disposal or recovery. Greece has admitted that 600 000 tons of hazardous waste are stocked at sites considered by the Greek authorities as "polluted in principle".</p>
<p>While the Greek authorities have recognised the problem and are committed to solving it, the adopted management plan will not ensure the resolution of the problem. Therefore, in January 2008 the Commission decided to refer the case to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Council Directive 96/29 Euratom<a href="#defann_73_1" name="refann_73_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Basic Safety Standards Directive, requires that Member States ensure that all types of practices resulting in exposure to ionizing radiation are justified in advance of their introduction. This implies that an analysis is made of the societal benefit generated by the practice, and it is demonstrated that the net benefit, is positive. The decision on whether a practice is justified however lies with national governments.</p>
<p>There is a potential exposure of hidden persons in the case of X-ray screening of vehicles to counter illegal immigration. Council Directive 97/43/Euratom<a href="#defann_73_2" name="refann_73_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> includes specific provisions on exposures of individuals as part of so-called "medico-legal procedures", i.e. procedures performed for legal purposes without a medical indication, such as security screening. In particular, Article 4.2 (c) of this Directive requires that Member States ensure that special attention be given to keep the doses arising from medico-legal exposure as low as reasonably achievable.</p>
<p>The issue of justification in this category of practices, which is very complex, was discussed among radiation protection experts and stakeholders at a conference organised by the Commission (Dublin, 2002)<a href="#defann_73_3" name="refann_73_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. A second conference of this type is in preparation for this year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the X-ray screening of vehicles must be conducted in full respect of other provisions of the Basic Safety Standards Directive, e.g. for the protection of those operating the equipment, where appropriate truck drivers, bystanders etc.</p>
<p>Concerning the question whether the Commission encourages other Member States to consider the wider use of the equipment described, it should be noted that there is no Community competence. The Schengen Borders Code<a href="#defann_73_4" name="refann_73_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> only determines the general rules how border checks shall be carried out. Besides the rules laid down in Annex VI of the Code, the details of the procedures for the checks are to be decided by Member States according to national law. This includes also decisions concerning the adequate equipment. The latter does not exclude the possibility of co-financing national equipment with means of the External Borders Fund.<a href="#defann_73_5" name="refann_73_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a></p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission, in its response of 16 January 2007 to the Parliament's Written Declaration No 0038/2006, recognised the high level of public concern regarding the animal welfare aspects of seal hunting and undertook to make a full objective assessment of the animal welfare aspects of seal hunting and, based on the results, to report back to the Parliament with possible legislative proposals if warranted by the situation.</p>
<p>In the framework of this assessment process, the Commission requested the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to issue an independent scientific opinion on the animal welfare aspects of the killing and skinning of seals. On 6 December 2007, EFSA adopted its scientific opinion stating that "there are only a limited number of quantitative studies published in peer-reviewed journals to be used as the basis for the efficacy of various killing methods with an adequately high degree of certainty." EFSA also concluded that "it is possible to kill seals rapidly and effectively without causing them avoidable pain or distress. However, the Panel also reported evidence that, in practice, effective and humane killing does not always happen."</p>
<p>The management, monitoring and enforcement issues related to seal hunting are currently being examined through a Commission-funded assessment study, which will be completed end of February. This study assesses the potential impacts of a possible ban of products derived from seal species, focussing in particular on trade, legal and socio-economic aspects. The Commission has also launched a public consultation through internet to gather a wide variety of views on trade in seal products and their links with concerns on seal hunting in general or welfare aspects in particular.</p>
<p>The Commission will take a decision on the policy response on the basis of its own impact assessment by taking into consideration the results of the above-mentioned actions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0048"></a>

The question was raised about who should finance the acquisition and maintenance of the equipment necessary to implement the directive - the retention of telephone conversations, SMS messages, unanswered calls and other data for a period of twelve months. Under the Lithuanian Constitution, the State has no right to delegate to private individuals its task of ensuring the security of society and preserving public order by asking them to perform these duties without public funds.</p>
<p>In view of the above, will the Commission say who is footing the bill for the acquisition of the equipment by communications enterprises in the EU Member States? How is the Data Processing Directive being implemented in the EU Member States? How are citizens protected against the fraudulent use of information concerning them?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Data Retention Directive obliges Member States to require providers of public electronic communications services and networks to retain traffic and location data for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 24 months and to ensure that these data are available for the investigation, detection or prosecution of serious crime. As such the Directive essentially imposes obligations on communications providers and networks to retain specified data for an appropriate period of time under certain conditions.</p>
<p>These obligations may generate significant additional costs for communications providers and networks. However, the Directive does not oblige Member States to reimburse providers for any costs which they incur in connection with these obligations.</p>
<p>To the extent that Member States wish to grant aid to undertakings with respect to the costs of data retention, they must notify this to the Commission in accordance with Article 88 (3) EC. Moreover, such aid could be approved only if one of the exemptions of Article 87 (2) or (3) EC was applicable. This would require in particular that the aid must have an incentive effect, i.e. that such aid helps to achieve an objective which goes beyond the mere implementation of obligations which already result from European Community law.</p>
<p>In November of last year the Commission invited all Member States to a meeting on transposition of the Data Retention Directive. This included a Roundtable discussion of Member States' approach to reimbursement of costs incurred as a consequence of the Directive and indicated a wide range of practices.</p>
<p>Member States' approaches vary considerably. For example, one Member State is introducing systems which will reimburse additional costs incurred by providers and which will involve pre and post auditing of providers' costs to ensure a cost neutral approach. Some others provide for a system which allows payments to be made to providers based on a pre-established set of tariffs without assessing the specific cost base of individual providers. Many Member States do not intend to reimburse any additional costs incurred by electronic communications providers as a result of the Directive. Finally, a number of other Member States are still assessing the full implications of a cost reimbursement system and have not yet arrived at a final position. A report of the November 2007 meeting can be found on the Commission's Europa web site<a href="#defann_75_2" name="refann_75_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As for transposition into national law, Member States should have transposed the Directive into national law by no later then 15 September 2007. To date 12 Member States have notified their transposition measures to the Commission. In November of last year the Commission began infringement proceedings against those Member States which had not notified the Commission of their transposition measures. An overview of how Member States are transposing the Directive can be found in the report of the November 2007 meeting.</p>
<p>The Data Retention Directive also provides important guarantees against misuse of data retained under the Directive. The strict purpose limitation of the Directive implies that retained data cannot be used by private enterprises or individuals. Moreover, the Member States are anyway under the obligation to ensure that provisions in national law relating to access to retained data comply with the European Convention on Human Rights and ensure full respect for the principles of proportionality and necessity. The general data protection regime provided for by Directive 95/46 remains applicable to the retention of data by the operators.</p>
<p>These provisions are further complemented by strict data security requirements designed to guard against accidental loss or unauthorised access to these data. By way of example, the Directive requires that communications providers and network operators shall ensure that only "specially authorised personnel" may access the data. The Directive further requires national measures to provide that intentional access to or transfer of retained data which is not in accordance with national law, shall be punishable by appropriate sanctions, including the possibility of administrative or criminal penalties.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The phenomenon of corruption has assumed alarming proportions in Greece. According to Transparency International, one in five Greek citizens admits that he or she has given bribes in order to expedite some business in the public or private sector. The phenomenon of corruption is concentrated chiefly in services such as public hospitals, urban planning, tax authorities, banks and municipal and prefectural authorities. Over the last few years corruption has even spread to the justice system. It is calculated that the total value of illegal bribes exceeded € 600 million in 2007.</p>

What data does it have available and how is it addressing the phenomenon of corruption in respect of the use of Community funds by Greece? How can it contribute to stamping out corruption?

<p>The Commission is aware of the data published by Transparency International.</p>
<p>The Commission does not possess complete data concerning the methods used by the Member States to combat corruption, in particular in the public sector. Therefore the Commission cannot assess to what extent increased levels of corruption in Greece may affect the economic and social convergence with other European countries.</p>
<p>Against this background, the EU has been very active in the field of the fight against corruption and has adopted a comprehensive group of instruments to tackle this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Following the introduction of the EU Convention on the protection of the Communities' financial interests in 1995, a Protocol drawn up in 1996 addresses the issue of corruption in relation to the Communities' financial interests.</p>
<p>In 1997 the EU Convention on the fight against corruption involving officials of the European Union or officials of Member States of the European Union was drawn up. The Convention criminalises corruption involving public officials, requiring Member States to be able to investigate and prosecute cases, even when they involve an official of another Member State of the European Union. The Convention is in force since September 2005.</p>
<p>Framework Decision 2003/568/JHA on combating corruption in the private sector was adopted in July 2003. It requires Member States to provide for offences of corruption in the private sector, whether involving a profit or non-profit organisation. In June 2007 the Commission adopted an implementation report which found that transposition of this Framework Decision into Member States' legislation was still at an early stage.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the continued existence of "European City Guide" and similar directory companies and continues to reply to numerous letters from Members of Parliament and businesses.</p>
<p>As the Commission has stated in the past since this problem concerns business-to-business (B2B) relationships much of the EU consumer protection legislation does not apply. An exception is Directive 2006/114/EC of the Parliament and of the Council concerning misleading and comparative advertising.</p>
<p>The competent law courts and/or public enforcement authorities of the Member State from which such schemes operate are competent for deciding on a case-by-case basis whether a commercial communication is misleading and to take appropriate enforcement action.</p>
<p>Several competent authorities and courts, for example in Spain and Belgium, have already taken enforcement action against these practices.</p>
<p>The Unfair Commercial Practice (UCP) Directive does not cover B2B commercial practices since there was no case for maximum harmonisation of the national laws on acts of unfair commercial practice (for example B2B misleading advertising, slavish imitation, denigration).</p>
<p>A full harmonisation Directive on unfair B2C commercial practices was already a very ambitious proposal, which would have failed if its scope had been extended to B2B unfair competition practices.</p>
<p>It resulted from the consultation and the works in Council that there was no consensus on extending of the scope of the directive to cover B2B unfair commercial practices.</p>
<p>It must also be stressed that not all the Member States have a system to address unfair commercial practice.</p>
<p>Some Member States (for example Germany, Austria and Sweden) were in favour of extending the scope of the directive to acts of unfair commercial practice. Others (for example the United Kingdom, France and Ireland) supported consumer protection but opposed the introduction at EU level of a fully harmonised system to address unfair commercial practice.</p>
<p>Although the Commission cannot intervene against companies involved in such practices it has attempted to increase awareness of the problem by presenting the issue to European business organisations. Furthermore, the Commission has written to the competent authorities in the relevant Member States, including Spain, to highlight that the situation is on-going and to request further information on this issue. The Commission is awaiting replies to some of these letters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The question of the Honourable Member addresses issues, which fall within the scope of two separate sets of Member State's obligations, notably obligations under the EU asylum acquis and obligations to respect fundamental rights when carrying out immigration or border controls.</p>
<p>The Commission does not dispose sufficient information which would enable it to drive a concrete conclusion regarding the actions of the Greek authorities referred to in the question of the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>As far as the implementation of the asylum acquis in Greece is concerned, the Commission has undertaken a number of procedural actions concerning the failure of this Member State to implement its obligations under Community Legislation.</p>
<p>Thus, the Commission inter alia has opened infringement procedures against Greece for non-communication of transposition measures under Council Directive 2004/83/EC on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted<a href="#defann_81_1" name="refann_81_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (Qualification Directive) and Council Directive 2005/85/EC of 1 December 2005 on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status<a href="#defann_81_2" name="refann_81_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>If needed, the Commission will proceed with further procedural steps in accordance with the power conferred to it by Article 226 of the Treaty establishing the European Community in order to ensure that the Member State comply with its obligations under the EU asylum acquis.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to highlight that the EU financial support to ensure inter alia proper reception conditions for asylum seekers as well as the identification and integration of refugees and persons granted subsidiary protection has been available for Greece. On the basis of the numbers of officially registered asylum applications, € 1 283 253, 07 have been allocated to Greece under the European Refugee Fund II in 2007 and € 1 571 280, 36 will be available under the European Refugee Fund III in 2008.</p>
<p>As concerns the movement of persons in need of international protection within the European Union, the Commission would like to refer to its proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 2003/109/EC of 25 November 2003 concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents to extend its scope to beneficiaries of international protection.<a href="#defann_81_3" name="refann_81_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> If adopted, the Directive would enable third country nationals granted refugee status or subsidiary protection to acquire long-term resident status in a Member State as well as to reside in other Member States for various reasons, including employment and self-employment activities, subject to the provisions of the Directive.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission wishes to reiterate its firm position that Greece must comply with fundamental rights when it exercises border controls or takes measures against irregular stay of third country nationals on its territory.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The importation of Brazilian meat into Europe is an issue with high priority, partly because there is currently a shortage of beef in the EU. To introduce barriers to trade, therefore, is contrary to our fundamental principles relating to free trade and openness. Agricultural policy is already being severely criticised, and measures of this kind - debarring for unclear reasons a product which citizens want to have - do not benefit support for European farmers. In Sweden it is estimated that the price of beef could rise by 30% if the ban remains in force for long. However, I share the Commission's concern to assign priority to safeguarding human and animal health. It is important to remember in this connection that the strong upturn in sales of Brazilian meat in Europe was largely due to the outbreak of mad cow disease in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>I would ask the Commission, therefore, how it intends to help solve this problem, and how can the Commission guarantee that these temporary measures genuinely remain temporary and proportional, so that they do not damage the interests of consumers, to the advantage of the European farmers' lobby?</p>
<p>It is important for Europe's consumers that this issue should be resolved without delay!</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>To protect EU public and animal health, the European Union has put in place a comprehensive set of requirements for imports of meat. The fulfilment of these requirements is verified by the Commission, in particular through on-the-spot inspections carried out by the Commission inspection services (Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) located in Ireland). Recent inspections in Brazil have identified serious instances of non-compliance with Community import requirements for bovine meat.</p>
<p>The Commission has therefore adopted measures to strengthen the control and surveillance of animal holdings, from which bovine meat could be sourced for import into the EU. The definite list of holdings together with their audit reports is expected to be received from the Brazilian authorities before the end of February 2008. In addition, the Commission is prepared to organise a further FVO inspection to Brazil late February 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that these measures have consequences on trade. They are the result of Brazil's repeated failure to address the deficiencies identified.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the measures are designed to be temporary. Trade could recover as these measures permit additional holdings to be listed provided they fully meet EU requirements.</p>

<p>According to the Staff Regulations, officials, temporary agents and contract staff (and their spouse and dependents, if they are eligible for the household allowance) have the right to an annual flat-rate payment of travel expenses from their place of employment to their place of origin.</p>
<p>For staff employed within the European Union, this payment is made automatically, thus the number of actual beneficiaries corresponds to the number of officials eligible for the payment. The figures are as follows:</p>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse; border-color:#EAF2FF; border-style:solid; border-width:2px; align:center; widh:100% " cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<p>Total annual travel expenses</p>

<p>22 958 780</p>

<p>17 814</p>
<p>2007</p>
<p>28 209 707</p>
<p>18 389</p></table>
<p>For officials who work outside the European Union, Article 8(4) of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations provides for the reimbursement of travel expenses in the form of a flat-rate payment corresponding to the cost of return air travel for the staff member, their spouse and dependents from their place of employment to their place of origin (or to another destination for those entitled to the payment who do not live at the place of employment).</p>
<p>As regards reimbursement, the Commission pays this flat-rate fee each year in July subject to prior presentation of boarding passes as proof of travel. Therefore, only those who provide proof that they have taken the journey will be eligible for this reimbursement.</p>
<p>For these staff members, the budget spent and the number of files processed are shown in the following table (elements collected from different data bases since data were not processed under the same IT system during 2005/2006 and 2007). These figures include beneficiaries (and their dependents) posted to Commission Delegations at least part of the year during the said exercises. Some of the beneficiaries have also received flat-rate payments for the time spent when posted inside the territory of the European Union.</p>
<p>These are not the final data, since regularisations for 2006 and 2007 exercises are still ongoing.</p>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse; border-color:#EAF2FF; border-style:solid; border-width:2px; align:center; widh:100% " cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">

<p>In 2006 and 2007 the increase in the number of beneficiaries is due to the application of the new Staff Regulations of 2004. Former staff employed in different status (local agents of technical assistance – ALAT – and individual experts) were converted into contractual agent positions, which resulted in new recruitments under the conditions of employment of other servants of the Communities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0073"></a>

<p>The Commission Communication "Preparing the Health Check of the CAP reform", adopted on 20 November 2007 states that a revised Article 69 would require a relaxation of the present rule that those measures under such provision can only apply at a sector level.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently finalising an impact assessment report on the Health Check of the CAP. The aim of this report is to examine the different options that can be proposed by the Commission from an economic, environmental, social and administrative point of view. As part of this analysis, the revision of Article 69 is also being examined.</p>
<p>The impact assessment report will accompany the legal proposals on the Health Check. The Commission has planned to adopt this package on 20 May 2007.

<p>In 1995, the EU was the world's second-biggest exporter of high-technology products. In 2005, it became the biggest exporter of such products, accounting for 17.2% of world exports in the field, but also the biggest importer, with 19.1% of world imports. In 2005, the total value of the Union's exports and imports in the field rose to EUR 230 bn and EUR 198 bn respectively. Over the period 2000-2005, the EU's exports of high-technology products registered an average annual growth of 1.7%, while imports fell by an average of 1.3% per annum. The category 'electronics and telecommunications' accounted for the largest share of European imports and exports of high-technology products (in 17 Member States and Norway).</p>

<p>The Commission notes with satisfaction the increased European Competitiveness in high technology products.</p>
<p>The capacity of enterprises in the EU to produce and export high-technology products depends on a wide range of framework conditions, some of which can be set at EU level, and others which lie within the powers of the Member States. In 2005 the Commission set out its industrial policy<a href="#defann_85_1" name="refann_85_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> for the coming years, based on a combination of horizontal and sectoral initiatives, followed by a mid-term review<a href="#defann_85_2" name="refann_85_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> in July 2007. The Commission plans in the future to strengthen its work with Member States on industrial policy in the framework of the relaunched Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.</p>
<p>A particularly important factor in the competitiveness of high-technology products is the level of investment in Research and Development. The Commission’s policy in the field of research and technological development, particularly the seventh framework programme for research and technological development, is a vital contribution to the international competitiveness of the high-technology sector of European industry.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
