In a statement made yesterday, the Commission strongly deplored yesterday’s verdict by the Ankara State Security Court confirming the sentencing of Mrs Zana to serve her full prison term until June 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly remind you of the background to this case. As part of the political reforms adopted in Turkey in the period 2002/2003, new provisions were introduced in the Turkish legal system allowing for the retrial of persons whose convictions the European Court of Human Rights has found to violate the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. This was a specific priority under the Accession Partnership with Turkey. Another priority concerns the need to remedy the situation of those persons prosecuted or sentenced for non-violent expression of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the introduction of these new provisions, a decision was taken in February 2003, under which Mrs Zana and her three co-defendants were to be retried by the Ankara State Security Court. However, in spite of the several sessions held by the Ankara State Security Court, retrial largely resulted in a repetition of the previous trial, leading to persistent concerns about the respect for the rights of the defence and the principle of presumption of innocence, as acknowledged by independent international experts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has repeatedly expressed its concerns to the Turkish authorities in the framework of the political dialogue. In our view, while fully respecting the principle of independence of the judiciary, the way this case has been handled shows the gap that exists between the spirit of the reforms and their actual implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">As I mentioned, the trial against Mrs Zana was held at a State Security Court. It is worth recalling that, according to the relevant priority under the Accession Partnership, the European Union has repeatedly asked Turkey to align the functioning of the State Security Courts with European standards. We note that the abolition of these courts is among the measures envisaged in the next package of legislative reforms announced in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that in his speech before the Turkish Parliament in January 2004, President Prodi called for the immediate release of Mrs Zana. Moreover, the Commission has raised this issue several times in its regular report and within the framework of the political dialogue with the Turkish authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand that the lawyers representing the defendants have announced their intention to refer the case to the Court of Cassation and hope that it will be dealt with in accordance with all the relevant principles of equal justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Probably uniquely in this House, I actually knew Leyla Zana before she was tried and convicted. I first met her in the late 1980s. She is, to put it mildly, a controversial figure.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless the action that she took is perfectly within the realms of democratic expression. After all, all she did was to say something in the Kurdish language within her Parliament. Mrs Ahern and others sometimes choose to use the Irish language within this Parliament. Indeed my Quaestor colleague, Mrs Banotti, did so in her opening speech. However, I do not think even the worst enemies of Fine Gael would wish Mrs Banotti to be locked up for 15 years for that.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been complete over-reaction from the very beginning. The way in which the trial was conducted was unacceptable and it was thanks to the intervention of the Council of Europe that a retrial was held. It is a great disappointment to me and my group that the Turkish judicial authorities did not show themselves to have sufficient flexibility to use this opportunity of having a retrial that would effectively have exonerated Mrs Zana.</p>
<p class="contents">She has been the victim of what is in effect a struggle between a reactionary judiciary and a state that is trying to reform. I welcome the packages of reforms that have been adopted and I also welcome the fact that the state security courts are to be abolished. This is not before time.</p>

I, too, am far from agreeing with all her views; to judge by her latest letter – which I have here – to, among others, Javier Solana and President Prodi, her assessment of Öçalan and of the PKK’s successor organisations is perhaps somewhat naive, rather exaggerated or understated, depending on your chosen way of putting it, but – as has already been said – none of these things are reasons for someone to be locked up for many years and their sentence confirmed in the teeth of rulings by European courts. I entirely agree with the Commissioner that this shows that there is still a great discrepancy between a parliamentary decision in favour of reforms, and those reforms being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not to be taken as criticism of the government, which, as I see it, has, in so far as it has been able to do so, made quite plain its interest in a different decision on Leyla Zana being reached. We really do, though, have to urge, beg, or urgently petition the government to really put its whole weight behind the reforms in order to push them through, especially in the justice system, for I do think we will have major problems if the government proposes the right things, if the parliament backs them up, but the necessary democratic practices are not in place in the administration or in the law courts to make them happen. This government, too, when decisions are taken in December, is sure to have the charge laid at its door that too little has been done by way of implementation and that too little effort is being made to bring Turkey’s administration and its justice system up to modern European standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the recent Joint Parliamentary Committee meeting in Turkey, we brought up the issue of the Leyla Zana trial, as we always do. Justice Minister Cicek promised us that in the next package of constitutional reforms, which I think is to be published this week, the State Security Courts would be scrapped. This is, of course, first-class news because these courts do not contribute to justice; they do not contribute to security. The Turkish Government fully appreciates the political importance of the Zana case for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As a strong Turkophile, let me be quite clear that, if Leyla Zana and her colleagues are not released soon, it will be impossible for Turkey's closest friends to argue that accession negotiations should be opened from December. No country can seriously contemplate European membership with nearly six thousand prisoners of conscience, no matter how controversial those people prove to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Among the many serious aspects of this trial that have already been mentioned by fellow Members and the Commission representative, whom I thank, what matters is the very fact that the 1994 sentence has been confirmed. The Strasbourg Court condemned the 1994 trial because it was illegal in many respects and called for a new trial to take place. The sentence is not based on the proceedings of this trial, but explicit reference is made to the 1994 sentence. The behaviour of the State Security Court in Ankara not only affronted the European Union but also the Strasbourg Court.</p>
<p class="contents">I attended all of the trial hearings: the right to defence was breached in a most blatant manner; more specifically – and to keep it short – the defence was denied any possibility of objectively replying to claims made by the prosecution witnesses. By the way it acted throughout the 14 hearings, the Court was only concerned with protecting the 1994 sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not add any more general comments since I agree with what has been said by those Members who spoke before me. In October, the European Commission will put forward its proposal on whether or not to open, and if so when, the negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union. Having also listened to the Commissioner, I believe that the European Commission’s assessment will be a conscientious one. Having heard my fellow Members, I also believe that the future Parliament will conscientiously assess the advisability or otherwise of opening negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union or whether to open them immediately. At the moment, frankly, the conditions for opening negotiations do not exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who have been involved in this matter over the past months and years have been able to see with their own eyes that this trial was a farce. The judges and especially the public prosecutor had absolutely no interest in properly reinvestigating the old evidence from 1994. And in this trial the defence once again had no opportunity to call new witnesses who wanted to put forward contrary evidence. This was a copy of a bad trial, and the result of a bad trial is a bad verdict.</p>
<p class="contents">But one thing should be quite clear: this says less about the government's attitude to reform than about the stubborn resistance of conservatives. These judges, yesterday's judges, wanted to show who is boss. Their answer is clear: we are the bosses, not the European Parliament or the European Commission in Brussels, and not the Government in Ankara either: we are the ones who decide what will happen in this case. I think that the only way the Government can limit the damage it has undoubtedly suffered in connection with its request to start negotiations in December is to show that this is an exception to the rule. That rule must remain the same: reforms on paper must be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Two examples. There has already been mention of the plans – and I emphasise the word 'plans' – to abolish State Security Courts. I should like to call on the Government to make haste in this matter, not to drag things out, and to ensure that these courts are actually abolished by December.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example, highly symbolic of course in this context, is the use of the Kurdish language, which we should remember was where this whole issue started. On paper, once again on paper, the use of this language is permitted, but in practice there are still numerous administrative hurdles. So it is very important that by the end of the year the Kurdish language can actually be used in the education system and in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for those who have concluded solely on the basis of this matter that negotiations should not start, I would like to remind you of what Ms Zana herself said. In a letter to the European Parliament she said: I would rather be in prison in a country that is negotiating with the European Union than free in a country on which Europe has turned its back. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would prefer Ms Leyla Zana to be at liberty in a country that is negotiating with the European Union. That is actually the only option which I find acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in fact very rare for someone to have spent so long in prison and to have held the Sakharov prize for almost as long. The situation is quite extraordinary. It is also very unusual for the European Union to have continued proceeding on a 'business as usual' basis for so long. This cannot continue. We must make more of a nuisance of ourselves, exert more pressure so that this pressure can in turn be exerted on the opposing forces in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The old state philosophy, the old type of Kemalism, still holds considerable sway as can be seen in this trial. Those in charge are themselves supporters of this old philosophy and of course time and again come to the same conclusion. I agree with other Members who have already taken the floor and made the point that the unusual feature here is that the Government, as we must recognise, is doing its best and has adopted some dramatic legal reforms. The Government was behind the change allowing trials to be reopened, in particular. It also introduced the option to free someone from prison, but this is not used: the legislation is either not used at all or not used properly. I believe that we must persuade our own governments of this. It is not just a question of isolated symptoms, like the serious case of Leyla Zana and her associates. It is a consequence of a more profound question which we must discuss with Turkey. I would also add that in my opinion it is essential to build up contacts between European judges and public prosecutors and their Turkish counterparts in order to change attitudes, as the wrong attitude can take us down the wrong track time after time, falling into the trap of nationalistic hatred against minorities caused by the fear that they could undermine the integrity of the State.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons I think that we must press for the existing opportunities to be used to free Ms Leyla Zana and others imprisoned for similar so-called offences in anticipation of reform of the entire legal process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been restarted twice. The Supreme Court, at the request of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights, has restarted the trial. The verdict is identical. We could not be more disappointed and, faced with such confusion, there is nothing more to say.</p>
<p class="contents">I went to see Leyla Zana in 1995 at her prison in Ankara, with the other Kurdish prisoners, prisoners of conscience, we must remember. It was the year when the Customs Union was to be voted on. I was very confused and said to myself that maybe I should give Turkey a chance, since I was in favour of its accession in the future. I therefore went to the country to learn about its evolution, which I wanted to give a chance by voting for the Customs Union. I thought that maybe this would have an effect on respect for human rights, respect for minorities and freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I must recognise today that, unfortunately, things have hardly developed in a positive way. I am, nevertheless, Mr President, in favour of Turkey entering the European Union. I am, however, sorry that Turkey continues to violate human rights and I insist that a considerable effort be made.

Unaffected by the official reforms in Turkey, the court is doing things the way they were done in the old days, so anyone who had attended the hearings – as I did – could conclude that the initial judgment, founded upon one sentence spoken in Kurdish and harshly criticised by the European Court of Human Rights, would be upheld. Turkey could have used the trial as a means of demonstrating that its reforms of the justice system exist not only on paper. This was not, in the final analysis, about the minutiae of the law, but about a woman whose fate had become a symbol of the failure of Turkish politics and Turkish justice, a woman whose trial was a test of how seriously reforms were being taken. Neither that, nor the fact that the eyes of the world were upon them, could induce the court to conduct a trial in accordance with the rule of law. Let me ask you this, then: if even the case of Leyla Zana cannot bring about change in the Turkish legal system, how are reforms to be implemented at all?</p>
<p class="contents">In principle – and let me make this clear – I am in favour of Turkey joining the EU, provided that it meets the relevant conditions. Turkey has known for years that there must be drastic change in it if it is to have a prospect of acceding, but yesterday’s judgment shows that the willingness to do so is still not yet present, and so the EU must now, at last, cut short all this talk about the commencement of accession negotiations being imminent. Those who, in the aftermath of this ruling, continue to insist that accession negotiations will be possible in six months’ time, show only their indifference to the Copenhagen criteria and their interest in the implementation of strategic objectives to the exclusion of all else. Far from it; the fact remains that the criteria for accession to the EU have been laid down and must still be met. For as long as Turkey ignores that fact, there can be no accession negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hermange (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span><span class="bold"><span class="italic">–</span></span><span class="italic"> (FR)</span> Employment results today constitute a key element of the principal objective of Lisbon, set in 2000. As you surely know, this objective is the following. I quote: ‘making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion’. We must not forget that Europe has already made considerable progress as we have created six million jobs on the European continent since 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, it is clear that, despite this progress, Europe will not reach the intermediary quantitative objective: to reach an employment rate of 67% by 2005. Today, a major French newspaper used the headline ‘Europe’s growth at a standstill’, growth that will only reach 1.7%. This is the reason why, faced with the observation that the economy is slowing down, we must bring everything into play, and it is the duty of the European Union to react.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that Mr Wim Kok’s report was produced. This report stressed that there was an urgent need for practical action, by putting in place some decisive measures on a fiscal, social, environmental, research and innovation level in order particularly, in all areas, to create jobs, taking into account, of course, globalisation and the problems linked to the ageing of the population. This requires to a great extent a rapid reaction and good management of the change. This is why we have a duty to choose this change in order not to be subjected to it. This is why, in my report, I wished to insist on the practical implementation of the employment guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is advisable to improve the reaction capacity of businesses and their employees. This requires an adaptation through an increase in levels of human capital and a policy of life-long training, which should be encouraged. This also requires active encouragement of the creation of businesses, particularly small businesses. It is in this spirit (this is the subject of Amendment 7 of the report) that Europe must support networks and partnerships, for example platforms of excellence that link small businesses, research centres, universities and private businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is cause to mobilise the working population, indeed the entire population. In this spirit, I recommend (this is the subject of Amendment 5) making the employment of young people a great European cause.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is advisable to launch a huge European plan against de-industrialisation. In this spirit (this is the subject of Amendment 6), it is certainly important that the European Union support the most disadvantaged regions without neglecting the development of the most dynamic areas. This is the subject of Amendment 5.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, very specific guidance, intended to improve governance. This is, in fact, the conclusion of the Wim Kok report. Improved governance, meaning the need to mobilise all of the players – national parliaments, regional and local players, social partners, trade unions and associations, but also businesses – and also to facilitate, in this spirit, improved access to the structural funds. Until now, Europe has supported the policies of the Member States, but in a spirit of assistance, by adopting a policy of what I would like to call assistance in the form of a crutch, but not in a spirit of economic dynamism. I think that if it is advisable to keep in mind the need to support the most disadvantaged regions, Europe must both show overtly, and demonstrate, to the outside world its ability to be dynamic. Community financing policy must be established in this spirit of economic dynamism. This is very specifically what I would like to say.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Mr President, I am sorry that, following the votes that took place yesterday, which were on such important issues as the environmental life cycle, tyres, marmalades and sweetened chestnut purée – all votes of great consequence – we are obliged to discuss employment policy now, and, moreover, without the Council. I am sorry about the conditions under which we have had to produce this report, given the ambiguity that surrounds it. Indeed, you are producing a report on the guidelines, a legislative report, but you cannot amend it because the guidelines have been fixed for the past three years, as if the environmental context, the international, sociological, financial and fiscal context of this matter, were not changing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We think it right that we should be doing as we now are and considering these broad economic policy guidelines not merely over a year, but over a longer period. That does not, however, mean that we do not have to take a very practical and critical look at these guidelines and at the need to adapt to changes in growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see very clearly that the European economy is continuing to lose its strength, and that, within the eurozone, recovery, where it has occurred or has had a beneficial influence on growth, is primarily attributable to a steep rise in exports, while domestic demand has sunk as a result of low levels of private consumption over several quarters. That must surely give us cause for concern, and so we want to consider and reformulate these broad economic policy guidelines in such a way as to stimulate economic growth and enable it to become more sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms. Only if all the Member States keep to what has been agreed will this be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now reiterate Parliament’s criticism to the effect that many Member States are not keeping to their commitment on the Lisbon strategy of combining and bundling all measures aimed at creating truly sustainable growth and also enhancing competitiveness. This is why I believe that the policy guidelines must be targeted even more than before at stimulating economic growth by way of investment and job creation, thus bringing about a rise in productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Growth Initiative, with this as its end, is surely to be welcomed, the guidelines should also express in clear and definite terms a concentration on human resources, research and development, and innovation, as well as on an industry policy that particularly prioritises small and medium-sized enterprises, renewable energies and environmentally-friendly technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the environmental technologies action plan must be implemented, we must not forget the need to invest in social infrastructure, for there will be no increase in productivity if we do not make work and family more compatible and thereby increase the number of women in work. This I do regard as a very important measure; it cannot be too much stressed that this is an area in which many Member States must make much more of an effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is the funding of growth-promoting investments any more adequate, and we should also be including in the broad economic policy guidelines coordinating measures to combat unfair tax competition and tax evasion. Indeed, the spending envisaged in the present Quick Start programme and in the Growth Initiative will take us no further than that, as all the economic research institutions are of course right to state that no investment under 1% of gross domestic product will have the desired effect, in particular, the positive effect hoped for on the vast mass of people in the European Union – over 14 million of them – who are unemployed.</p>
<p class="contents">The broad economic policy guidelines must continue to focus on social and regional cohesion and on convergence in real terms, but there must be greater clarity as to which policy mix will actually prove successful, as we need strong synergy effects between, on the one hand, the necessary structural reforms and, on the other, investment and macro-economic policies aimed at stability and growth. This, of course, is where intelligent use of a more flexible Stability and Growth Pact is called for.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency and participative implementation of the Lisbon strategy are not just lofty ideals; these approaches really do promise a great deal in terms of using reform partnerships as a means of implementing the Lisbon strategy. It is my belief that such partnerships for change must concern themselves with economic, social and environmental issues across the board if the Lisbon strategy is to be improved and moulded into a more political form.</p>
<p class="contents">Affirming, as I do, the spirit of Lisbon, I believe that this is the most comprehensive strategy for the purpose of mastering the problems of the European Union, but we must, of course, respond to economic change by updating these guidelines every year, which, as we can see, is becoming more and more necessary. Any reform of the structural funds must also take into account the importance of forging a link between the economic policy guidelines and the structural funds and the use made of them. Moreover, the whole must be formulated in such a way that all the partners really are compelled to make the connection in the interests of sustainable growth, full employment and social cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This debate is being held in response to the update of the broad economic policy guidelines and the Commission's 2004 report on the employment strategy. I should like to congratulate in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath and Mrs Hermange on their reports. The adoption by the Commission of the so-called package of guidelines, a package which jointly covers the broad economic policy guidelines and the guidelines for employment policies, is proof yet again that streamlining bears fruit. Streamlining has resulted not only in the update of the economic policy and employment policy coordination circuits of the European Union, but also in stronger complementarity and cohesion between these two basic procedures. The core objective of streamlining, of coordination of the policies, was to increase their efficiency, by placing more emphasis on application than on the annual drafting of guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the broad economic policy guidelines and the guidelines for employment policies were adopted with a three-year perspective. It was clear right from the outset that the guidelines must be amended only in order to take account of important developments. Within this framework, as there are no important developments, the three-year guidelines must remain stable this year. By maintaining a stable strategy, we shall be able to improve how we project and forecast the impact of European Union policies and ensure that they continue and are efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like first to comment on the broad economic policy guidelines. The Commission considers that the overall political strategy laid down in these guidelines continues to apply. Emphasis was placed in the 2004 update on incorporating the 10 new countries within the framework of the coordination of our policies. I should like to comment in greater detail on these two aspects, taking account also of certain comments made in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has confirmed the Community's medium-term strategic economic policy laid down in the broad economic policy guidelines for 2003-2005. This strategy has three main axes: macro-economic policies predicated on development and stability, economic reforms to increase development potential and policies to reinforce sustainability. This package of policies focuses on the contribution which economic policies can make towards achieving the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for continuing the existing strategy and for achieving progress are obvious. First, economic developments are in keeping with the expectations which applied when the Council issued the present broad economic policy guidelines last year. As stated in our new economic forecasts, the economies of the European Union are in the process of recovery, which is expected to consolidate. Of course, I have taken note of what Mrs Randzio-Plath said earlier about concerns about recovery and growth and Mrs Hermange's comments in today's publication about the stagnation in the economy and growth. In all events, the general framework of macro-economic policy is not negative. I should like – and I think that we must – emphasise that we need to take pains to give new impetus to financial restructuring once the recovery has progressed and we must not make mistakes, as has happened on previous occasions when the short-term economy has been sound.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in order to strengthen both potential growth and the endurance of the economy, decisive application of the objectives we have set for structural reforms is required. In the first evaluation of the application of the present broad guidelines in January, the Commission recognised that some progress had been made. It did, however, also become clear that more progress with the reforms is needed in order not to jeopardise the achievement of the Lisbon objectives. The 2004 update of the broad economic policy guidelines focuses on integrating the new Member States within the framework of the coordination of our economic policies. It is positive that in Mrs Randzio-Plath's report and in the motion for a resolution you express your support for this objective. The economic challenges which the new Member States face do not differ materially from those which the current Member States face, they are just bigger.</p>
<p class="contents">Our medium-term economic strategy is in a position to address the challenges of the acceding countries. The synergy created from the interaction of macro-economic policies and the necessary structural reforms will result in gradual <span class="italic">de facto </span>convergence between these countries. This – gradual <span class="italic">de facto </span>convergence – is the most important challenge which the acceding countries face.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the 2004 guidelines for employment policies are concerned, I should like first of all to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Hermange, for the dynamic way in which they prepared the European Parliament's opinion on the guidelines. It is very positive that the issues addressed in the report all relate to the four basic policy sectors, as set out by the European Employment Task Force and in the 2004 joint report on employment, which were confirmed by the spring European Council, namely: improving the adaptability of workers and businesses, attracting more people to the work place, improving the quality of employment and investing in human resources. I consequently consider that, materially, we are on the same wavelength, we have the same concerns and the same priorities for action in coming years. It is also important that you emphasised the need for stricter assessment of the performance of the Member States, in order to give impetus to the application of the strategy on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall refer very briefly to the Commission proposal for the 2004 guidelines for employment. The Commission proposes maintaining the guidelines as adopted by decision of the Council last July. As part of our joint efforts to streamline the economic policy and employment policy circuits of the European Union, the guidelines for employment policies, like the broad economic policy guidelines, follow a three-year cycle. The reform of the policy on employment carried out last year aimed to address better the basic challenges of the job market in the European Union, in order to respond to the Lisbon objectives for 2010. This reform emphasised the medium-term approach and the definition of a framework policy which would take account of the diversity which prevails in the enlarged European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint report on employment on which the European Employment Task Force under the chairmanship of Mr Kok agreed, highlighted the need to emphasise the monitoring of the reforms which the Member States undertook to implement, rather than becoming involved in a procedure of further amendments to the guidelines. Similarly, the spring European Council confirmed the need identified in the joint report on employment for the procedure on employment to focus the following year on evaluating progress. The main issue in the next joint report on employment must therefore be the Member States' response to the special recommendations for each country. This means that these recommendations must be at the epicentre of the national action plans submitted by the Member States, both the current fifteen and the new Member States, in the autumn of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I assure you that the European Commission expresses its satisfaction with the constructive approach by the European Parliament, which has focused its amendments on the recitals. The European Commission, during further negotiations with the Council, will also take account of and will support those amendments which improve certain recitals. I am absolutely convinced that the immense challenge which we face in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives by 2010 makes it necessary for us to focus 100% on application, by translating the challenges into political action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Hermange has the correct approach: we are not seeking to amend the detail of the structure of the guidelines. When we agreed to the streamlining of the economic and employment guidelines last year, we implicitly agreed not to unpack the guidelines themselves until 2006 – the mid-point. That is the right approach: we need that stability in the guideline structure.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must acknowledge that we need to focus ever more upon the implementation of both the economic guidelines and in particular, perhaps, the employment guidelines. The problem lies there: Member States are not implementing the guidelines properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we have introduced a number of recitals that seek to focus upon key areas of implementation. For example, Amendment 1 concentrates on research and development. With the streamlining of the broad economic and employment guidelines we have every right to expect a comprehensive European framework for investment in lifelong learning, research and development and infrastructure to create a European Union engine for growth and to transform that growth into full and better employment and more social cohesion. That is what the Lisbon process is about and we are falling far short of that at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In our Amendment 2 we focus on a couple of issues highlighted by the Employment Task Force – the Kok report – namely adaptability and lifelong learning. They are there in the employment guidelines. However, we must acknowledge that in all the national plans, to a greater or lesser extent, there are failures in achieving the targets laid down in those respects.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 3 concerns taking possession of the delivery of guidelines by national parliaments, social partners, NGOs, and local and regional authorities. We need to encourage those tiers of government to take possession of the guidelines and ensure their proper implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome Mrs Hermange's Amendment 6 on better harnessing of the structural funds for delivery of the guidelines. I also welcome Amendment 7 to encourage companies to better anticipate economic, technical and industrial change. Throughout this mandate, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has insisted on a proactive approach to the management of industrial change. She is right to make that call.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I know that Mr Bushill-Matthews intends to table an oral amendment to Amendment 5 to place emphasis upon the need to retain older people in the workforce. We would be happy to accept such an amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish in particular to recognise Mrs Randzio-Plath’s solid work on this report. She has also done some sterling work for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Your chairmanship, Mrs Randzio-Plath, has been characterised by impartiality, knowledge and professionalism. I am quite sure that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will miss you. Thank you.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU economy still suffers major problems. Overall growth has not achieved the rate we had desired and expected. Even if the American economy is improving all the time, many problems remain. The double deficit and the political uncertainty are undermining economic strength. Nor is growth in the eurozone impressive. We are well aware of the current figures.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the EU of the Fifteen, it emerges that the countries concerned have greater economic strength, with growth of 2% this year and 2.4% next year. Things are significantly better in the new Member States, with growth of 3.5% this year and, on average, 4% next year. Those are figures we can virtually only dream about in the EU of the Fifteen. We know that the changes in the new Member States have been very far-reaching and often painful. The trend is manifestly in the right direction, even if a number of objections may be raised and caution recommended in the manner, for example, of today’s statement by the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU of the Fifteen should be able to learn more from the new Member States with a view to giving impetus to the economy. The competition and the increasing market that is now opening up are to everyone’s advantage. Instead of criticising countries like Slovakia and Estonia which have reduced their taxes and in that way created room for growth, we should see what we can learn from their having done this. Above all, it would be devastating if, in an attempt to standardise and direct the national economies, the EU were to force the new countries to introduce tax increases and extensive welfare reforms at a rate that they themselves are not in favour of. Certainly, competition will become tougher. It has done so already. Corporation tax in the new Member States is lower than in our own countries, but healthy competition is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still a need for structural reforms in quite a few of the Member States. We know who the sinners are, and the list of these will unfortunately become longer. The Netherlands and Great Britain are next to be added. Where the Stability and Growth Pact is concerned, we think that this has operated well. It is already flexible. Certainly, the rules can be reviewed, but <span class="italic">pacta sunt servanda.</span></p>
<p class="contents">We Liberals believe that Europe can extricate itself from these economic problems but, if it is to do so, more must be done. The Lisbon process must be implemented in full. The Liberal recipe for enabling the EU Member States to obtain growth and more jobs involves sound public finances, increased competition, completion of the internal market in all its aspects and structural reforms for the future. We shall not support the extra amendments in Mrs Randzio-Plath’s report, but we are prepared to support the rapporteur’s balanced assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we face huge challenges in Europe, but the opportunities in the new Europe are so much greater. Peace, freedom, democracy and social and economic stability now dominate Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Randzio-Plath’s excellent report documents how dreadfully bad matters look. That applies particularly to Europe and not to the whole world. It must therefore have something to do with specifically European conditions. I am among those who believe that it has to do with the Stability and Growth Pact and with the policy linked to the Stability and Growth Pact. As long as the pact prevails, there is little help to be found. We have a low level of investment and a lack of growth and dynamism, meaning in actual fact that we have a surplus of capital. This capital then has to leave Europe in order to find more profitable investment opportunities. We also have a tragic surplus of labour in the form of people who are unemployed.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe we can break this pattern unless we also abandon the Stability and Growth Pact and, instead, begin to think in terms of public investment as practised in the Keynesian tradition. It is nowadays forbidden to talk about Keynes, but I think it incredibly important to begin to debate Keynes and post-Keynesianism. The fact that this is not being done must be due to a kind of ideological block. I cannot see how it could be otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">Our having a sound employment policy does not help much as long as those with education and qualifications are not given jobs. Companies do not want them. We need to pin our hopes on public investment. I believe, above all, that we are concerned here not only with infrastructure but also, to a large extent, with the consumption of public services. This needs to be increased. I also believe – and this is another matter that is not allowed to be discussed – that there is a place for reducing working hours in order to get more people into work. We should then obtain a better balance and be able to increase work productivity. Such measures are needed if we are to get anywhere, but as long as neo-liberal politics dominates, matters will, unfortunately, continue to go badly for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that, at the end of this legislature, it is time to briefly take stock of economic policy in the European Union. Economic policy includes a Lisbon agenda whose philosophy we could certainly share, but whose implementation is, in fact, deeply unbalanced, since it concentrates on the liberalisation of the sectors and neglects the social and environmental objectives included in the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, another part that is definitely lacking, and this is macroeconomic policy at European Union level, which, if it exists at all, does so only through a Stability and Growth pact. The policy that has been followed in recent years, particularly by France and Germany, has consisted of making an effort in relation to budgetary policy, in an attempt to reduce deficits and debt at the same time as decreasing public revenue, in the hope that this can all be resolved by an increase in growth. This scenario did not work. We have very weak growth, increasing unemployment and an increase in disparity in income between different social groups, with no reduction in exclusion and poverty, in one of the richest regions of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there are alternatives. These have been discussed within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but without success, or at least without achieving a majority. There are alternatives that consist, in particular, of making efforts in relation to supply, certainly, but also substantial efforts in relation to spending. Is it normal that European savings should be financing an increase in military spending in the United States? I formulate the problem in these terms, which is how it must be formulated. There is, therefore, room for a relaunched neo-Keynesian policy, which relies fully on the size of the internal market within the context of a Union of twenty-five and on the need to increase public and private investments. Maybe the growth initiative is moving in the right direction, but it is inadequate in terms of both quantity and quality. We need to coordinate the budgetary policies of the Member States and the social and environmental convergence rules, particularly concerning working conditions, salary progression – yes, salary progression – and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to end on the fiscal issue. It is a point we have discussed at great length. I would simply like to tell Mr Schmidt that I was struck by a French Press Agency dispatch, a statement by the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr Persson, which said that if the candidate countries continued to decrease corporate tax as they were doing, it would no longer be possible to agree to finance these candidate countries through the structural funds. We would do well to think about this kind of observation, and I maintain – and I am weighing my words carefully here – that those who do not want to subject corporate tax to the system of qualified majority voting laid down in the European Constitution are irresponsible and will have to face ever harsher scenarios of fiscal competition, which will unravel our systems of social protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had hoped to be in a position to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report. It was an excellent report but by the time it came out of our committee earlier this week a lot of the more excellent parts of it were unfortunately removed. What is left is still very useful, very positive, but it is a pale shadow of the excellent and very thorough work that she had put in.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately her amendments were voted out by the PSE Group who were there in strength on Monday. Unfortunately, apart from herself and one other Group Vice President from the PPE-DE Group, I was the only representative of our Group there.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no quibble with the Socialists for what they did in pursuing their agenda. They happen to believe they are right in saying there should be no legislative changes and I am not going to debate that particular point now. I congratulate them for their single-mindedness and the efficiency with which they pursued it. However, I do say to our colleagues, particularly our absent colleagues from this side of the House, that if we care about employment, as we do; if we care about unemployment, as we do; if we care about the social injustice that flows from unemployment, as we do; then we must be prepared to make this area a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is work simultaneously in other Committees, we have to make certain that we can stand up to be counted, so that our view may prevail in these meetings and so that we can drive change. Change is important on the issues of employment guidelines; I was delighted that the Commissioner again reinforced the importance of the Lisbon Agenda, to which all sides of the House have agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, if we are to deliver the Lisbon Agenda, it is not good enough simply to say that the guidelines will not change before 2006. Similarly, it is not good enough to say it is entirely up to Member States to make changes and implement the guidelines. The guidelines need to be strengthened and refocused and there is a lot of work both to do and to undo in this House in order to give more impetus to the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank Stephen Hughes for saying that he is in full agreement of an oral amendment, which I believe the rapporteur will also support, concerning the importance of elderly people, which I will be proposing later this morning. I am delighted to have that agreement; I hope that augurs well for our relationship in the coming mandate. I know that Stephen Hughes hopes to be back; I also hope to be back, but next time with more support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On different occasions, I have been able to develop, on behalf of my group, specific proposals to reform the Pact in order to turn it into the instrument of a European policy of growth and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we recommend greater stringency when the economic climate is good. It would be a case of, for example, requiring the Member States to have a balanced budget when growth exceeds, let us say, 3%, even if it allows them greater infrastructural spending flexibility at the time of an economic turnaround. Our objective is the transposition of the British golden rule to European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Christian Social Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, has just taken up the Socialist proposals again. In an interview for the newspaper <span class="italic">Le Monde</span>, he recommends that the Pact should be more flexible when the economic climate is poor and stricter when the economic climate is good. At the recent Ecofin Council, the theory that it would be necessary to reform the Pact in 2005 gained ground. The Socialists will bring their constructive participation to this necessary reform, but Mr Juncker will have difficulty persuading his colleagues in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who demonstrate almost religious dogmatism in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact. In fact, stability without growth will only increase the economic and social problems of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I recommend that you read the paper of Professor Jean-Paul Fitoussi for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. This paper broadly demonstrates that the Stability and Growth Pact has slowed, and continues to slow, growth in Europe. The Pact is particularly harmful to the large European economies, whose economic activity depends more on internal stimulation than that of the small countries, who depend more on external demand. This certainly explains the fact that the small countries seem more virtuous in relation to stability than the large countries, whether the large countries are governed by the left or the right. Stability and Growth Pact reform is, therefore, not a question of politicking, but rather a vital necessity for a Europe that is losing the fight for growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, allow me to address a final word of thanks to Mrs Randzio-Plath. Mrs Randzio-Plath will no longer be part of the next Parliament, which saddens me greatly. With her, we will lose a woman who was committed to the euro, to a social Europe and to a Europe of growth and employment. I think that I speak on behalf of all our fellow Members in thanking her publicly for her work at the head of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>

We have not only deplored the European Union’s situation of profound underemployment and weak growth, but we have sought to build an economic policy at European Union level. In order to overcome the various obstacles, I too would like, moreover, now to put forward some political objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that we must first of all seize the opportunity that enlargement offers. The new Member States want growth and they need solidarity. Just like us, and even more so, it is in their interest that the enlarged Europe be a much more dynamic region of the world. The fears of the West must, therefore, be dispelled and common interest built, which means that positive mobility, restructuring and specialisation strategies that enable human and productive capacities in the East and the West to be increased are essential. How, though, are these to be brought about?</p>
<p class="contents">The second objective is to create new options in the debate on structural reforms. How can investment be encouraged? Two ways are possible. Only the first of these is being used at the moment: the drawing power of capital for high profitability, with fiscal and statutory competition. Failure is inevitable. Another way is to be opened up. Indeed, we must issue the challenge of a new mixed economy, a mixed economy of multinational cooperation, founded on policies of partnership and networks. This is the structural reform that Europe needs and that we will have to devise.</p>
<p class="contents">The third objective is the renewal of the macroeconomic framework. The Lisbon strategy chose good objectives and a good driving force, but its guidelines are still very ambiguous and it has not found the tools to work with. The greatest ambiguity reigns as regards its interpretation. National policies differ. The redefinition of this policy must be at the heart of the agenda of the next few years, particularly in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact. I think that with a good European budget and fiscal harmonisation, we would indeed be in a better position to resolve the problems relating to the reduction of national public deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my last point is a question of method. The Member States have got an absolute nerve: they do not respect the Lisbon strategy; they do not take it on board. We must build up the responsibility of the national parliaments and envisage reinforced cooperation in the field of economics, but it is particularly amongst the players of civil society, amongst businesses and territorial communities, that we suffer most from a loss of profit. There is a mass of activities to start, but a great backlog of projects and of players. European policy is only possible on the basis of decentralised participation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to say something about Lisbon, about Mr Kok's report on the quality of work, about China and India, and finally about the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards procedure, I think that this is the second or third time that we have realised how little time we have when it comes to determining employment guidelines. This causes conflicts among us, beyond the normal political differences, as to how the guidelines should be interpreted, how they should be amended, what needs to be changed and so on. I would suggest a different approach next year; that is a piece of advice to the future presidencies of the Council and to the Commission. It is vital to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to play its role under the Treaty, namely commenting in an appropriate manner, so that we need not vote down a series of votes on a pile of amendments, which, let me put it this way, are not in the correct procedural order. I also wonder whether the triennial procedure we have adopted is the most sensible approach. Given the fast pace of change in the economy, and in view of the fact that the Commission soon had to adjust its optimistic outlook and accept that things were not going as smoothly as expected, I think that we need to have the opportunity to alter some important aspects of these economic and employment guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out a major shortcoming in the Treaty. It needs to be said. According to the definition, employment guidelines are, in fact, subordinate to economic guidelines. We do not want that. It causes all kinds of problems, for example when liberalisation is on the agenda, but it also means that all kinds of other measures are put forward that have their impact in this way. I agree with what a number of other speakers who have already taken the floor, including Mr Jonckheer and Mr Goebbels, have said on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Little progress has been made since Lisbon. This has been commented on in our committee as well. We have achieved little on poverty and on the participation of older people and women in the workforce. There has been some progress, but far too little and we must really revise the guidelines. We should revise the Lisbon agreements in the light of various factors, including the evolution of the economy. Against that background the position adopted in the Kok report, namely that we must achieve better implementation of the agreements in their entirety, is welcome. That is what the Council was supposed to be doing. I wonder whether it is enough though.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kok proposes discussing and encouraging flexibility and security. He certainly addresses the issue of flexibility, but I see nothing about security. Both Germany and the UK are still blocking the Temporary Agency Workers Directive. That is not in keeping with the principle of promoting the quality of work, also one of Mr Kok's ideas. In other words, I think we must look carefully at this and that we should get back to, for instance, the proposals of the Belgian Presidency on the quality of work. That was a useful report, not only with regard to a simple category like job satisfaction. I also think that we should look not only to the United States but also to developments in China and India. We are currently facing massive off-shore outsourcing with all its consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I should like to thank all those who have cooperated during this last term in office. I can also tell you that the Group of the Greens will support the amendments submitted by Ms Hermange and probably also the oral amendment tabled by Mr Bushill-Matthews. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was her first vice-chairman for two and a half years. I was able to appreciate both her rigour and her courtesy, even if, as you know, our ideas scarcely brought us together.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also pleased to hear Mr Goebbels speaking of the harmful aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact. When I spoke in similar terms within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs three or four years ago, I think my fellow Members were shocked. It is now clear that, in fact, I was right and that the Stability and Growth Pact is a corset that is far too tight for growth, investment and employment to be able to develop in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, in my opinion, another subject that weighs down European growth, and I think that this is the euro. In order to be convinced, we need only see that the three countries of the Union that have not adopted the euro and have preserved their monetary sovereignty are doing much better than the twelve that have chosen, within the framework of the European currency, to link their destinies and to entrust them to a veritable State Bank, a supreme bank that does not care two hoots about growth in Europe. I hope the subject of the euro will be at the centre of the next electoral campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know if, like Mrs Randzio-Plath, I will not return. Personally, I hope to return, but it is far from certain. That said, I very much hope that the consequences of choosing the euro will be at the centre of the next electoral campaign since, in my view, this is the main problem between Europe and its citizens today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, increasing employment is a highly complex procedure and policy. It affects all sectors of economic policy, of social policy, of education policy, of vocational training, of transparency, of the fight against tax evasion and of undeclared work. Research and innovation have been particularly highlighted recently. This was, in fact, a decision by the recent spring Council and I thank the rapporteur for accepting my amendment on the subject, which calls for proper coordination of all these policies when designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating the application of the guidelines. This coordination policy is very important to the new Member States, which are being called on to adopt European results in their internal policies. We also note that the countries in which there is no proper coordination have the worst performance records in the field of increasing employment. Coordination and complementarity are needed both between European policies and national policies at all levels – central, regional, local – and between all the agencies involved. I agree with the rapporteur's proposals about transparency and simpler procedures and about information on making the best possible use of the structural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue on which I want to comment is the issue of structural reform, mainly in the fiscal sector and in the social security sector. It would appear that this issue, however necessary everyone considers it to be, is not easy. It demands a political price, it needs to be distilled by society and matured and this is not happening to the required extent. The assent which we set forth as policy, in order to have meaning and be successful, needs properly informed and prepared citizens, responsible social partners and serious effort if the results of our policies are to become visible and if we are to create trust in our chosen objectives and procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Implementation is key to the employment guidelines and to the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it so important for us? We understand that not only have the Lisbon guidelines not been pursued and that progress is slow but also, as Mr Dimas commented, the new Member States have to do what we have to do and they have the same problems. Unfortunately size does matter in a situation where we must keep to the employment guidelines and yet overall unemployment and the budget deficit in the new Member States are roughly double that of the EU 15. Size definitely matters.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why implementation is key, rather than new guidelines. Implementation is important, as some people have touched on – in Amendment 5 for example, concerning youth unemployment and as regards women in the workplace – but we also have to look at the issue of older workers, the rapidly ageing population of working age. Also, as was briefly mentioned by the chair of our committee, the job shocks that our regions are now facing, such as the outsourcing and offshoring of work – issues that this House is at last taking seriously – will have to be incorporated into the Lisbon goals. I am sure Mr Dimas will take account of that in his work in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">The big issue here is to ensure not only that implementation is key, but also that there is better understanding among the main players – the trade unions and business organisations – of what the strategy is. This clearly does not yet exist in Member States. It is vital with regard to this issue, which is one of the last the Committee on Employment will address before the end of the mandate, that we register that the players concerned by this Lisbon goal are insufficiently aware of the strategy being pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">Also important are the quality of lifelong learning and the regional impact of issues like equal funding and market discrimination. All of these issues are vital and must remain within the Lisbon goal and the employment guidelines. We must strengthen implementation. That is the key to today's debate and I welcome Mrs Hermange's report for that reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the recent reforms of the employment guidelines were a positive step, it now seems clear that the European Union will not achieve the Lisbon goals set for 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The employment rate at the moment is 64%; achieving 70% by 2010 would entail creating 22 million jobs in the new 25-Member European Union. Only through the development of competitiveness and growth potential will Europe achieve this rise in employment and productivity. The 2004 Spring Summit therefore drew up employment recommendations with the aim of highlighting priority areas for action by each Member State and underlining the need to strengthen the exchange of good practice and experience, which have a fundamental role in European employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I support Marie-Thérèse Hermange’s excellent report, which highlights the need to make more effective use of all available instruments, the effort to implement what has already been agreed and the mobilisation of all the players involved. My country, for instance, Portugal, is well on the way to meeting the Lisbon employment objectives, even though it has recently seen its unemployment rate go up, mainly because certain multinationals have pulled out. Even so, the unemployment rate is below the Community average.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the objectives of promoting the employment of women and older workers, Portugal has exceeded them. Let us not evade the issues, however: the economic environment we have in Europe today is very different from the one that formed the backdrop to the Lisbon Summit in 2000. The economic and financial situation in certain Member States demands tough policies to curb public spending and, most of all, structural reforms as a precondition for economic growth and job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Those Member States that remain courageous enough during this economic slowdown not to give in to easy solutions and undertake the necessary reforms of employment legislation, social security schemes, and so on, deserve not reprimands but encouragement and incentives for their ability to reform. I am certain that without structural reforms Europe will not achieve the levels of growth needed to implement the Lisbon objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Santos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, Romano Prodi recently stated that recovery in Germany and Italy is non-existent, which means that this year will see a continuation of all the same old uncertainties, doubts and risks as to economic recovery in the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">All this statement does is carry over the pessimistic forecasts made by the Commission for 2004 into the political field. This then is the background against which we must analyse how Europe’s economic situation develops in the framework of the broad economic policy guidelines. We cannot continue to dodge the issue. We do in fact have at our disposal powerful theoretical instruments, such as those resulting from the Lisbon Strategy or arising from the good practice associated with economic policy coordination. We also have powerful limitations, however, such as those resulting from too strict an interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which demolish all the efforts we make.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is becoming more and more political, or, put another way, a matter of choices, and while it is true that there can only be long-term, sustainable economic development with financial consolidation, it is also true that there will be no financial consolidation, even in the short term, without economic growth. Europe needs a new agenda, focusing on the problems of the economy and employment, in place of the current agenda, focusing on the budget deficit and public spending, which have become a veritable obsession. What Europe really needs is structural reforms, but it also needs the financial means to carry them through. In the early stages there will always be an increase in public spending or a reduction in revenue, and that can only be possible with a profound change in the budgetary rules in force. It is at this point that delays begin to occur to the proposals for a review of the Stability and Growth Pact announced by the Commission, especially if these proposals focus on the essence and are not confined to sweetening the regulatory aspects of control.</p>
<p class="contents">Reform of the SGP is inevitable, partly because this instrument has, strictly speaking, been suspended since 25 November. The new rules can no longer ignore the changes in the economic cycle, or fail to take account of each Member State’s individual situation without prejudice to the efforts to achieve budget conciliation for the whole euro zone. They certainly can no longer ignore the role of public investment and quality spending in the framework of development. Aiming at a zero budget deficit in the euro zone over the long term is complete folly, is not supported by any economic theory and would result in the absurdity of a public debt that would, after all, be no better than zero.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe these concerns are to be found in the excellent report tabled by Mrs Christa Randzio-Plath, to whom I offer my warmest wishes, because the dealings I have had with her over the last three years have shown her to be a woman who is capable, competent, determined and profoundly pro-European. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Much has been done in Europe in recent years concerning employment. Specifically, in my country, the People’s Party Government, during its two terms of office, has created more than 4 300 000 jobs. Clearly we all agree on the need to reform our employment strategy, with a considerable degree of stability, and we all also agree on the importance of the three objectives – full employment, improved labour quality and productivity and strengthening of social cohesion – and we will agree on both the common recommendations and the specific recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress the importance of certain principles which must underpin the application of employment strategies, in addition, of course, to a principle already often repeated here – the need to coordinate economic policies and social policy – and I should like to emphasise the need to horizontalise policies such as equality, health and safety in the workplace and integration, which seem to me to be essential objectives in the construction of Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise, Madam President, the need for improved productivity in the face of relocation – which has already been highlighted by Mrs Bastos – which has disastrous effects on territorial cohesion and the necessary polycentrism of the European Union. I believe that increased productivity and labour quality are the best remedies for slowing down relocation. Nowadays this makes many European citizens sceptical about the European Union. It also seems to me that the link between the structural funds, territorial restructuring impact policies and employment policy is vital for the achievement of territorial cohesion, a tool <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for genuine polycentrism in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for concerted action on the part of the European Union, the Member States, the regions and local authorities and, of course, social dialogue, are other important tools in the application of these directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, the term 'European economic policy' which we use is somewhat misleading. The Union does not have primary responsibility on this matter nor, unfortunately, does it acquire it under the new draft Constitution. Primary responsibility lies with the Member States. The Union simply intervenes in a coordinating capacity. Where the Union has responsibility, in monetary policy, we have indisputably seen immense success with the introduction and stabilisation of the single currency. Unfortunately, we cannot also say the same of the management of the real economy. Growth rates have remained low and unemployment has remained at correspondingly high levels. The recession in the real economy has led to a crisis in public finances, with huge deficits appearing in major economies, resulting in collapse due to failure to apply the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">25 November 2003 should have released us from the Stability Pact. Instead, however, we returned to the same tired debates about how to revive it, instead of finding ways to get out of the stagnation of the European economy. There are, of course, two ways. One is a common, truly European policy, within the framework of a mixed economy. We must stop worshiping the market, which has failed miserably because, if you take the 30 years after the Second World War, the mixed economy achieved full employment and high rates of growth. If you take the next 30 years, during which the doctrine of the free economy has triumphed, full employment has collapsed and the European economy has stagnated and weakened. It is time we returned to more logical principles, to a mixed economy like that which served us so well in the post-war years.</p>
<p class="contents">They tell us that unemployment is structural and that, in order to cure it, we need to take structural measures. This simply means measures against the workers. I would reply to this that the lack of investment is structural and that we should act against speculation on the money markets, which has paralysed the investment mechanism. If we could find a new alliance of social forces, then we could really bring the European economy back to its old levels. If we cannot find this alliance, then the European economy is condemned to stagnation and, ultimately, to becoming a satellite of the US economy. It is time we realised this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For an example of how to debate economic and employment policies, we should take the debate about the Stability and Growth Pact, a subject about which there was far more public debate than there has been about the economic and employment guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to put the case for a greater role for the Commission in economic and employment policy, and I urge it to make more use of its right of initiative, rather than hiding behind the unanimity required of votes in the Council. Thirdly, I would like to see an end to unanimity in all economic and employment matters affecting the internal market, which would make it possible for Parliament to exercise its power of codecision and unleash new dynamism.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also draw your attention – and particularly that of the left wing in this House – to the whole catalogue of economic and employment policy principles in the new Constitution. In it, rather than setting social policy at odds with the market, we affirm our belief in the social market economy, in sustainability and in full employment; we do not play the various areas off against each other, for they are all mutually dependent and mutually complementary.</p>
<p class="contents">The competitiveness of enterprises is dependent on the skills of employer and employee, as well as on the stability of the currency and on the low level of inflation associated with it. It is on competitive businesses that growth depends, and without growth there are no jobs, and employment is the precondition for social cohesion. If we communicate this, in these terms, to the public and know ourselves bound by these basic principles and by this interaction, this reciprocity, then we will be able to implement the guidelines all the more efficiently. The fact is that we have to get stuck in to the job with greater earnest and greater determination. We cannot, we must not, have a situation in which internal market directives are not transposed. We cannot, we must not, have a situation in which the Commission has over a thousand infringement proceedings pending against Member States. We cannot, we must not, allow Member States to justify breaching the Stability and Growth Pact by saying that, by so doing, they wanted to do something for growth and employment. If that were the case, then Germany would have the highest proportion of people in work; instead, it has the highest proportion of people out of it.</p>
<p class="contents">In bringing this speech to a close, let me ask what our weaknesses are. They lie in our structure, in our lack of dynamism, in rigidity and over-regulation, and in population change. Where do our opportunities lie? We have them in enlargement, in the concept of the internal market, in small and medium-sized businesses, in the skills of our workers, in the Lisbon strategy, in the euro and in the social dialogue. Let us take these objectives and make them into action plans and timetables! Let us apply more seriousness and determination to the task of doing away with our weaknesses and seizing our many chances, which are still, like treasure, buried and waiting to be brought to the surface. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that anyone will disagree with this conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to formulate a few more conclusions. Within the framework of the gradual strengthening of economic activity and the increase in employment in the European Union, we need to make decisive progress, as Mr Hughes and other speakers emphasised earlier, in applying our medium-term strategy for economic policy and employment policy, as laid down in the broad economic policy guidelines and the strategy on employment. This strategy continues to apply, both to the old and to the new Member States, as Mrs Kratsa said and, of course, it must be understood in the best possible way, as Mr Moraes pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to safeguard the continuation of both packages of guidelines in accordance with the principle of streamlining. Instead of reforming the guidelines, we need to focus, even though Mr Bouwman said earlier that conditions are changing. Of course, but there must be important changes, as I said in my first speech. Therefore, instead of reforming the guidelines, we need to focus on closing the gap between expectations and results. Careful monitoring of these procedures on your part, in close contact with your counterparts in the national parliaments, is the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to success, especially within the framework of the interim review of the Lisbon strategy. This review will be carried out next year and will naturally focus on ways in which we can achieve in practice the main objectives of our economic policy and our employment policy, including productivity, as Mr Pérez Álvarez emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Randzio-Plath presents a series of amendments to the European Commission's recommendations relating to the 2004 update of the broad economic policy guidelines. The report by Mrs Hermange and her relevant amendments are designed to change the recitals of the guidelines for employment policies for 2004. I should like once again to thank the rapporteurs and the Members of the European Parliament for the constructive way in which they expressed their concerns. I am delighted that the amendments are in line with the strategy which we have agreed on in order to strengthen the economy and employment in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments to the recitals of the employment guidelines, I should like to assure you that the European Commission will support in spirit those aspects designed to improve the recitals during further negotiations with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that the reference to older workers introduced by Mr Bushill-Matthews complements the reference by Mrs Hermange to the young unemployed and our position is therefore positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We spent a great deal of time yesterday considering the Boogerd-Quaak report on the media, which has been a matter of some controversy. I would like to say that we regard the refusal by the President of Parliament to permit the amendments as lacking any legal justification and we are therefore contesting his decision. We will also be considering legal action to test whether the rights of Members of this House can be set aside by sweeping aside all the amendments, as was done in this instance. It is because we regard this as a very serious course of action that our group will not be taking part in today’s vote on the Boogerd-Quaak report on the media, thereby recording our protest and our inability to accept this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a second matter that I would like to address, and it has to do with what Mr Barón Crespo said in the plenary yesterday. The first question that has to be dealt with has to do with the background to Mr Barón Crespo’s assertion that documents had disappeared from the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for, if that is indeed the case, then it follows that it could affect all the procedural issues connected with the Boogerd-Quaak report. I would, however, ask Mr Barón Crespo to withdraw the allegations he made in the plenary yesterday, which are, unfortunately, not recorded in the Minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, I heard the remarks that Mr Barón Crespo addressed to Mr Tajani, and they are recorded on the House’s official tapes, but not in the Minutes. Yesterday, Mr Barón Crespo said to Mr Tajani, for whom we all have high regard: ‘<span class="italic">Calla, desgraciado’</span>, which, when translated, means ‘shut up, you wretch!’ I think it unworthy for one Member of this House to describe another in these terms, and I ask Mr Barón Crespo to withdraw this remark. Something else was said, and I regret that. I had never thought I would have to say something like this in this House. There is, though, something that binds us together no matter what disputes we may have with each other, and that is our mutual respect. That is something that our group, at any rate, stands for, and such language should not be used to anyone. I will add that Mr Barón Crespo also said something that I will read out, which was taken down for me from the tape. I am reading it in Spanish, a language that I, unfortunately, do not speak, and so I apologise if I am not getting it quite right: ‘<span class="italic">pediría a los jabalíes que andan sueltos por ahí que tengan tranquilidad.</span>’ Translated, that means: ‘I would ask the wild boar running loose in this Chamber to calm themselves!’</p>
<p class="contents">Such, ladies and gentlemen, is not the language that should be used here in the European Parliament, and I ask Mr Barón Crespo to put right the remarks he made yesterday.</p>

Firstly, in relation to the issue raised concerning the disappearance of documents, I have written to President Cox, as he requested yesterday, and I have sent a copy to all my colleagues, the Group Presidents, explaining that certain documents did indeed disappear, but thanks to the efforts of the assistants and the officials of the Groups and the committee, they were replaced before the start of the meeting.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Noise)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On this point, moreover, I hope that Vice-President Podestà will give explanations to the House concerning the serious accusations he has made in writing in the <span class="italic">Corriere della Sera</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>which he has not mentioned at all until now, and this is a grave insult to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As regards my statements, I see that Mr Poettering has noted what I said, but not what was said to me. That is, I would ask that everything be recorded. I shall give explanations about what I have said. I told Mr Tajani that he was like a basilisk – this is not an insult, it is a word whose meaning can be looked up in the dictionary – '<span class="italic">calla, desgraciado</span> [be quiet, wretch]'. '<span class="italic">Desgraciado</span>' – I refer you to the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy of Language – describes someone who has no grace, and as far as I am concerned, he clearly is such a person.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As regards 'wild boar', there is a problem, which I accept is to do with Spanish parliamentary culture.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Noise)</span></p>
<p class="contents">‘<span class="italic">Jabalí</span>’ has been a traditional expression in Spanish parliamentary affairs since the Second Spanish Republic. Pérez Madrigal was well known for acting as Mr Pannella is acting now – shouting to right and left. In Spanish, ‘acting the wild boar’ means doing what many of his colleagues were doing.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure, Mr Poettering, that since yesterday you have received no complaints from the European Association of Wild Boars concerning such a comparison.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take the liberty of noting that, in his letter to Mr Cox, Mr Barón Crespo, when quoting what was published yesterday in the <span class="italic">Corriere della sera </span>in my name, completely misinterpreted it and changed the wording. This is serious, Mr Barón Crespo, because I wrote that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has breached some of the Rules of Procedure, which is why I sent Mr Cox a letter, to which he sent a reply, which I answered.</p>
<p class="contents">The difference between saying ‘breached some of the Rules’ and saying ‘systematic breaches’ is merely one of intellectual integrity, or otherwise. It means saying ‘black’ or ‘white’: it is one thing to raise some points; it is another thing to say that our Rules of Procedure have systematically not been respected.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take the liberty – in conclusion, Mr President – of making one remark. You said that yesterday the House voted on something that is, in any case, the sole responsibility of the President, but since we chose – or rather, since he chose – Rule 130(3) without considering that paragraph 1, which is binding, says that first of all amendments are put to the vote and then the text, we – or perhaps not we, but someone here whose responsibility it was – betrayed this Parliament’s sense of democracy.</p>

<p class="contents">On the other hand, Mr President, and according to the explanations given by the secretariat of my committee, and of which the Presidency is directly aware from the note which was sent to it, it is absolutely clear that all, absolutely all, the documents were available in the Committee on Freedoms at the start of the day on the 20th. Documents which, moreover, are public and which, besides being available in the documentation department, are also available on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, I would emphasise that no political group – including the Group of the Party of European Socialists – nor any member of the Committee on Freedoms made any comment or statement on the matter, neither during the course of voting on the amendments nor at the start of the same.

<p class="contents">The Vice-President, Mr Martin, enjoys the full confidence of the House and of the President to conduct our affairs this morning.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In all calmness I can say that I have had a week where I have received an enormous amount of advice – mostly unsolicited – from many friends in this House. I have understood, more fully than most in this House, the passions that have fed into our debate. Yesterday I sought advice from the House after a lengthy exchange of views and then, not following a vote but under the prerogatives of the Presidency, I made a ruling. I accept that there are many colleagues in this House who are not satisfied with that. Solomon does not chair the European Parliament – lucky for Solomon.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">So there it is. The House was divided from the very first day as to whether there should be a debate on this question. That division has manifested itself at every stage of this report from its inception until now with the final vote.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view the essential elements under discussion have always had a considerable underlying and latent political dynamic. That being so, the divisions have been inevitable. But now the report is before the House and the House must now exercise its mandate however it sees fit.</p>
<p class="contents">I would commend to you, Mr President, that you should – as you remarked – stand by the ruling. Mr Ribeiro e Castro will propose – as is his right – referral back. The House, in its wisdom, can then decide.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, can I say that over the past 24 hours I have asked the services of the House to conduct, on my behalf, their own investigation into this question of documentation at a committee meeting earlier this week. I am entirely satisfied that everything was done as it should have been. If there was a temporary problem with some documents, that fell more into the category of 'cock-up' than 'conspiracy'. I would commend to the House that we put an end to this matter and recognise and salute the integrity of Mr Hernández Mollar, his committee and his services.</p>

<p class="contents">For ten years now, I have been the rapporteur on the problems of beekeeping in the European Union, and today sees me presenting my seventh report to you. As before, it improves another half-hearted Commission proposal for a regulation on actions in the field of beekeeping.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither the Commission nor the Council have made much of a response to the many good proposals we have made since 1984 on saving beekeeping in Europe. Since 1997, admittedly, there has been a regulation on the 50% cofinancing of national programmes to improve the production and marketing of honey, for which different amounts are made available to the 15 Member States every year; in one year EUR 10 million, in another EUR 15 million, in yet another EUR 16 million. That is next to nothing in terms of the overall budget of the European Union; it is peanuts.</p>
<p class="contents">As, yet again, the new regulation proposed by the Commission is far too half-hearted, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted my suggested improvements by an overwhelming majority, with the particular intention of securing additional co-finance for measures under national programmes to support the restoration and development of the Community's bee population, in support of honey analysis laboratories, and for the analysis of honey.</p>
<p class="contents">My hope and expectation is that you will give this report your unanimous support, not as a farewell present to mark the end of a legislative period, but, as before, out of conviction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, paragraph 3 states that ‘the President may put the original text to the vote first, or put to the vote before the amendment that departs furthest from the original text an amendment that is closer to the original text’.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the decision taken yesterday by this Parliament, which annulled a good 350 amendments with an arbitrary act, I would like to ask you what we will vote on if a paragraph in the text had to be deleted, since there is no amendment left. We will have a text that is like a lump of Gruyere, that is full of holes, which can only be closer to the truth given the content of this report. This is, however, an extremely serious further breach of the EP Rules of Procedure that we are being forced to commit – or rather those who will vote will be forced to commit – on the basis of the bad decision, taken yesterday by President Cox, not to give a ruling and to make this Parliament decide to put to the vote the original text, understood as the consolidated text that was put forward by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. That means to say a single voice, that of the left, incorporated its amendments into the original text. This itself is a distortion, to which is added a further one, which I pointed out pursuant to the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to my fellow Members – who do not know the ins and outs of this case – that they have one last chance to prevent a serious injustice, a precedent that could become dangerous for the future, by voting to refer this report back to committee or by rejecting it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No. Can we declare, like a people’s court, that certain facts have been established – particularly for Italy or Poland – for which no evidence has been produced or presented? No. Can we determine the national legislative process of the German Bundesrat? No. Some say that the subject of the report is covered by Article 7 of the Treaty.

<p class="contents">Others say that the report has its basis in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

<p class="contents">I thank you, therefore, for giving me the floor. I will be brief. I am in full agreement with this motion for referral back to committee, but I would like to add an essential reason, which is that the text of the proposed report particularly targets Italy, as is shown in the heading. There are, however, countries in our European Union where freedom of expression is much more seriously threatened. I am thinking of Belgium and France in particular: Belgium where, yesterday, a decision of the Ghent Court of Appeal, pronounced in accordance with some truly Stalinist legislation, condemned a perfectly legal and peaceable party, the Vlaams Blok. It is completely understandable that its growth worries its political rivals who, in this situation, practise the revolutionary logic of 'no freedom for the enemies of freedom', which is completely inadmissible.</p>

However we are not divided on our concern for human rights and democracy, and the resolution before the House was supported unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vitally important that there be a strong vote for this particular resolution. The reason I recommend this is that when this House agreed to ratify the third generation agreement, it gave a commitment to review progress on human rights and democracy after one year. The position the Committee on Foreign Affairs puts forward in this resolution under my name is the appropriate benchmark for judging how much progress has been made. I welcome the amendments tabled by Mr Ford and Mr Swoboda, which strengthen the resolution. I respect the fact that there were sincerely-held views on both sides in the debate over Pakistan. I would therefore like to thank Members for all their individual contributions during the time I had the honour to be rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">This is my last speech in the House, so I wish to thank all my colleagues for their friendship – and indeed the battles over the years, even if I lost one today – and also to thank the staff for the courtesy they have extended to me. I wish my colleagues who are standing again well – I hope they are successful. To those, like me, who are retiring, I wish fulfilment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I very much welcome the fact that President Cox paid you such an outstanding tribute today when your authority in the Chair was challenged, since you have been an outstanding chairman of these proceedings. You have always chaired with efficiency, courtesy and, most important of all, humour. I wish you well. You are an asset to this House and I hope you return.</p>

The fact is that unilateral withdrawal of troops from Iraq at the present time, without the assumption of responsibilities by the United Nations, would certainly be highly problematic and could well plunge the country into chaos. If that were agreed to, we could support the amendment as a whole. That is my question to the proposer of the motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We consider that this is extremely dangerous and destructive to beekeeping, precisely because honey is primarily a quality agricultural product. The existence of genetically modified crops, in conjunction with a 0.9% limit on GMOs in honey, presupposes that bees can choose between genetically modified and non-genetically modified plants.</p>

The amendment of Directive 91/440 increases even more the liberalisation of rail transport. International freight services will be handed over to the market on 1 January 2006, and national freight services on 1 January 2007.

He presented our group's final position on the railway package, making it clear that this liberalisation proposal is suitable for a Europe quite different from the one the Confederal Group of the European United Left would like to see.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2000, the European Commission tried to force the Member States to privatise the whole of public transport. Since this Parliament excluded significant portions of urban and regional transport from this attempt on 14 November 2001, the Commission has turned its attention to the railways. It wants to liberalise not only international freight services but also domestic passenger services. In the meantime, we have gained bad experiences of this in the Netherlands. The move to sell shares in the state-run rail company Nederlandse Spoorwegen on the stock market appeared to lead to neglect of rolling stock and rail infrastructure, delays and industrial unrest and so has been stopped. This was done not as a political choice but because staff, passengers and eventually politicians too learned the lessons. The provision of train services by a competing company, since bought up by the international transport giant Connex-Vivendi, has also been terminated. Similar plans for Europe are now being held up by the Council, but are still not off the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Important proposals are presented, such as those that aim at improving investment by the various Member States, ensuring the application of technical specifications for the interoperability of both high-speed trains and conventional networks through greater financial support, and equipping trains with a recording device.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also provides for a new institutional approach, through the idea of setting up a European Railway Agency as a regulatory body for the system and a joint supervisory authority that can manage and ensure safety in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">If the aim of the directive is achieved, it should lead to the specification of a high level of technical harmonisation, as shown in the agreement that has been reached.</p>

The ‘European CV’, to be known as a ‘Europass’, may include other documents, such as:</p>
<p class="contents">- a ‘MobiliPass’: designed to record a specific European learning pathway in a common European format, and awarded to students/trainees who have undertaken periods of learning in another Member State;</p>
<p class="contents">- a ‘Diploma Supplement’: attached to a higher education diploma to help third parties to understand the meaning of that diploma;</p>
<p class="contents">- a ‘Certificate Supplement’: attached to a vocational qualification to help third parties to understand its meaning;</p>
<p class="contents">- a ‘European Language Portfolio’: a record of linguistic and cultural skills.</p>
<p class="contents">Each of these documents already exists, as a result of cooperation with the Council of Europe and/or UNESCO. The only document to which the Commission proposes substantive changes is the MobiliPass, which would cover all kinds of learning and not just vocational training.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that arises is what basic motive lies behind the development of these instruments: is it to add value to a country’s human resources, or is it to enable economically more developed countries to exploit the workers and their mobility? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These companies, covering a broad spectrum of business areas, are thus vitally important for job creation and local/regional development, but they encounter certain difficulties, such as access to finance, which require an urgent solution. A policy of suitable support mechanisms directed at this broad sector is therefore needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Growth and Employment Initiative (1998-2000), despite its shortage of funds and much publicity, had the objective of promoting job creation through support for SMEs. It was replaced with the Programme for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship (2001-2005), which introduced mechanisms providing guarantees and access to risk capital, such as the Joint European Venture (JEV), which is now being wound up, thereby jeopardising the EUR 42 million of unused funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The programmes aimed at SMEs need an injection of funds but also a change in objectives: they must promote job creation; support the formation of associations; support research and training; provide guarantees for all the critical phases in the life of a start-up company; improve the geographical spread of support (broadly concentrated in the countries in the centre of the European Union); and support not just high-technology companies but also traditional and craft enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the proposed amendments, which the rapporteur supports, is the winding-up of the Joint European Venture programme (JEV), designed to support traditional joint ventures. This measure is justified by the impossibility of using the remainder of the budget for projects involving accession and candidate countries, and by the fact that simplifying, as opposed to deactivating, the project would entail losing the unused budget commitments of approximately EUR 42 million.</p>

Whenever voters elect a decent government to power, it is eventually overthrown by the military. Former Prime Minister Bhutto was even killed after being deposed, and his daughter, popular so long as she was regarded as his political heir, was also later thrown out of power. This military intervention against progressive governments has created a breeding-ground for Islamic fundamentalism and for groups that want to set individual sections of the population against each other. These groups have been able to continue their activities legally under the military regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Current President Musharraf was until a few years ago regarded as a dangerous general who had seized power in a coup, who wanted to make his country a nuclear power, was creating space for a very conservative interpretation of Islam and cooperated with the Taliban regime in neighbouring Afghanistan. Once he helped the American military intervention in Afghanistan he suddenly came to be seen as an American ally. This proposal gives him the same status in Europe. Once again, commercial and military interests take precedence over human rights.

<p class="contents">Firstly, I believe that the Commission’s proposal for a financial framework for 2007 to 2013 is patently inadequate in terms of ensuring social and economic cohesion in an enlarged EU and of meeting our commitments to the least developed countries of the world. Secondly, I am opposed to the political objectives of the established framework, which are already in line with the so-called ‘European Constitution’, and which reinforce the federalism, the neo-liberalism, the militarism and the excessively security-conscious face of the enlarged EU. Thirdly, this report is ambiguous and implicitly accepts the Commission’s proposal. Lastly, I am opposed to extending the British correction mechanism to the remaining net contributors, and to replacing current national budget contributions with some kind of European tax. I am, therefore, sorry that the amendments we tabled were rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact, however, that Parliament rejected Amendments Nos 16, 17 and 18, which were intended to restrict the average annual Community budget to a maximum of 1% of Community GNP – in line with the wishes of the signatories of the ‘Letter of the Six’ – and to renationalise, or, to put it more accurately, to do away with the Community regional policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately the reason for this is rarely discussed. To start with, much of the European Union's imports arrive through the port of Rotterdam. The relevant import duties are levied by Dutch customs and then transferred to Brussels; in fact, none of this is Dutch money.</p>
<p class="contents">A second reason lies in the agreements reached in Berlin by Mr Kok and Mr Zalm in 1999. The outcome of these agreements is that Dutch agriculture now receives much less from the Brussels coffers than before. Dutch farmers account for 7% of European agricultural production. In 1999 the Netherlands still received 3.5% of the European agriculture budget, but by 2004 this had fallen to 2.1%. In addition, the Netherlands receives only 1.2% of rural development funds because the then Dutch Government set a low priority on this issue during the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The best way of improving the Netherlands' position as a net contributor is to ensure that in future the Netherlands receives a greater share of European Union agricultural and rural funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end it is not The Hague but the Dutch countryside that pays the European bill. Correcting the flaws in the Berlin Agreement is the best way of restoring the Netherlands to its rightful position in the European Union.

<p class="contents">A financial framework for a multiannual period (from 2007 until 2013, or a minimum period of five years), arising from the adoption of the financial perspectives, has undeniably lent financial and political stability to the European Union’s actions. Against this backdrop, the expectations of administrative operators, Member States and the public have resulted in efficiency gains and have led to more ambitious and significant projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is proposing to meet three strategically crucial aims of the forthcoming financial perspective: to improve competitiveness, growth potential and territorial cohesion, to establish an area of security, freedom and justice and to develop external relations. These aims will hopefully not be thwarted by the proposed top-down approach set out in the ‘Letter of the Six’, which seeks, primarily, to set an upper limit, as distinct from the bottom-up approach – which identifies political priorities and assesses needs and amounts required – as proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly welcome the rapporteur’s work and would like to quote a most apt question that she poses: ‘is it fair to pretend that the amounts proposed allow matching resources to needs, especially the goals of Lisbon for growth and employment in an enlarged Union?’ I should like to mention at this juncture that the Bradbourn proposal for an amendment was resoundingly rejected – more than two-thirds voted against – and...</p>

<p class="contents">Solidarity between the peoples of the European Union, economic and social progress and the strengthening of cohesion feature among the European Union’s general objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">For many, the main fear elicited by enlargement is that of seeing the regional funds currently available in the fifteen Member States disappear to the sole benefit of the ten new members.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this solidarity is at the core of the European contract, under no circumstances could partnership be abandoned. The European Union must continue its support in the regions of the Fifteen affected in particular by natural geographic handicaps.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking in particular of mountain regions. The Council, the Commission and Parliament cannot remain idle on this issue. For a long time, the mountains have been comprehensively ignored by European programmes. These areas have many resources. They require special attention in the agricultural sector (aid for the countryside and for young farmers) and within the framework of sustainable tourism development, as well as requiring specific support for SMEs (to avoid desertification and protect employment) and support for maintaining services.</p>

There are still huge inequalities in the development of several areas, while the prospects for the poorer Member States are unpropitious.</p>
<p class="contents">With enlargement, due to the purely statistical approach, numerous areas in the existing Member States risk being excluded from funding. In Greece, for example, four areas will not be funded under the fourth CSF, while another three are on the borderline. These areas account for 75% of the country's population and to date most of them were eligible Objective 1 areas, with acute and increasing social and economic problems which the proposed transitional 'temporary support' will only extend.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece is a typical example for another reason: the promotion and concentration of resources in certain areas, such as Attica, which exacerbates the wider regional problem of the over-concentration of the population in the towns. At the same time, while there is a great deal of talk about supporting remote areas, the ΕU continues without justification – and despite our repeated proposals – to exempt the Aegean islands from special treatment for remote areas, despite the very serious problems they face.</p>

I must, however, register my disappointment at the treatment of the outermost regions, and in particular Madeira and the Canary Islands. A common approach to the outermost regions, as provided for in Article 299(2) of the Treaty, is conspicuous by its absence from the Commission’s proposals. I feel that it is inadequate merely to allude to a specific programme being established to offset the particular difficulties faced by the outermost regions, or to implement a <span class="italic">grand voisinage</span> ['wider European neighbourhood'] action aimed at facilitating cooperation with their neighbouring countries. These instruments strike me as inadequate, given that when it comes to the crucial issue, it does not make sense, for example, for any future phasing out applied to Madeira and the Canaries to be exactly the same as that applied to continental European regions. Where, then, is the special access to structural funds, as provided for in Article 299(2) of the Treaty?</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the permanent handicaps affecting the outermost regions. We know how those handicaps seriously hamper their development.

A majority wants more money for the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund. That will allow payments to the richest Member States to be held in check, not depriving the currently poorest Member States, and giving priority to the new Member States as they will for the time being have the lowest standard of living. The thinking behind this is that the European Union will be more popular if everybody gets more. It is expected that a Union that is generous to everyone will be looked on favourably by public opinion, the broadest section of society and local authorities. So we still see placards wherever a project is being co-funded by the European Union publicising the fact. The question of whether the money in question actually becomes available is not raised. Far less the question of whether these projects, many of which are undoubtedly beneficial, are most usefully conducted via the intervention of European officials and with European money. EU funds can be better targeted at development aid to help those lagging behind. Less money and less bureaucracy can produce better results. All other projects should revert to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such projects can have a major impact in an area, and this has, fortunately, been the case in Portugal. The unanimous support given to this report in the relevant committee also reflects the wide consensus among European citizens in favour of genuine European social cohesion throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, I welcome the confirmation of principles such as, for example, the need to retain temporary phasing-in support, which will vary between 85% and 60%, for regions that no longer belong to Objective 1, because they are victims of what is known as the statistical effect of the limit of 75% of GDP being reduced due to enlargement. I am also pleased that the Cohesion Fund is to be maintained as a support mechanism for major projects in the sectors of transport and the environment in Member States whose GNP is below 90% of the Community average. I applaud the particular emphasis given to the needs of the outermost regions and of regions with the greatest structural problems. Lastly, I welcome the move to encourage the various procedures to be simplified effectively and efficiently, as far as possible, since these often represent major obstacles to the implementation of programmes and projects.</p>

That caused the collapse of the previous Commission. Nothing has changed, because no one has been prepared to take responsibility for Eurostat.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that EUR 5 million has gone missing; despite the fact that money has been channelled into bogus research by bogus companies, some of which it appears are owned by senior members of Eurostat; despite the fact that taxpayers' money appears to have been channelled into staff perks – such as a riding school and a volleyball team – we have seen no resignations from the Commission over this issue and no acceptance of responsibility. Mr Solbes Mira's response seems to be just that he did not know what was happening. This seems to be a charter for Commissioners just to tell their civil servants not to inform them of the dubious activities going on in their departments, so that, on the basis of the Commission's analysis, the Commissioner will get off scot-free.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that Mr Solbes Mira has resigned from the Commission but not over this issue, so there is still a complete failure on the part of the European Commission to take responsibility for this waste of taxpayers' money. That is a matter of extreme concern to me and my British Conservative colleagues. I hope that before our vote on the motion of censure in May the Commission will accept its responsibility and do something serious to take responsibility for Eurostat and to clean up the EU and stop the unacceptable waste and abuse of taxpayers' money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This affair has also shed light on serious problems and irregularities in working methods and internal monitoring, on the part of both the Commission and OLAF, such as the lack of effective enforcement of existing rules.

<p class="contents">It is appalling that the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat has not accepted political responsibility and that the Commission President has not asked him to resign.</p>

At that point I immediately demanded transparent action. Investigations by bodies dependent on the Commission are pointless as they have to keep their findings secret. Fraud, embezzlement and nepotism will only be prevented in the future if public opinion is properly informed and able to form a view. This could be done by a parliamentary inquiry. At the end of September 2003 a secret report was submitted to members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and still the European Commission acts as if it bore no responsibility in the matter. The person first appointed to handle the matter, Commissioner Solbes, is now a Minister in the new Spanish Government. All efforts are being made to prevent discussion of a motion of censure against the European Commission signed by me and others. Malicious delay in placing this issue on the agenda means that this motion cannot be put to a vote this week. After 1 May the number of signatories will fall to below 10% as a result of enlargement of this Parliament. The chairman of the Green Group has called on his members to sink this initiative by withdrawing their signatures.

In Portugal, more than one hundred of the main national media organisations are in the hands of half a dozen large companies, which, at the very least, is an alarming state of affairs. Freedom of expression, access to information and freedom of employment are all in danger; this is the logic of business taken to extremes. This reality is reflected in the concerted assault by neo-liberal policies, of which media domination is one weapon. The media is, indeed, one of the areas in which the battle over ideology and class domination is most obviously being fought. Everything must be done, through legislation and other means, to reverse the situation, to reduce the excesses and abuses taking place, and staunchly to defend public radio and television worthy of the name. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If all media become concentrated in the same hands then we will be going back to the days in the past when the media had less reach and often a monopoly was created involving the authorities, a powerful party, the Church or a regional publisher. People only heard one opinion as to what was good or bad, and how society should develop. Government and big business are still trying to achieve that. In Spain recently the previous government tried to shift the blame for three major bomb attacks onto a separatist movement rather than an international movement because that would be better for them in the elections. In Italy, the Prime Minister controls the commercial company MEDIASET as its owner and the State-run company RAI thanks to his role in government. The Christian Democrat group shies away from criticising this situation and have attempted to keep this topic off the agenda by ignoring the problems, holding endless procedural debates and submitting enormous numbers of amendments. They are abusing democracy in order to abolish democracy.

<p class="contents">What this amounts to is a purely political attack on the Italian Government and, as such, it is appalling that Parliament has been hijacked for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the subsidiarity principle has clearly been violated.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot allow Parliament to be used to mount purely political attacks or to impose its will on the sovereignty of States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The basic problem, however, is that, through a dubious issue of procedure, Parliament was not given the opportunity to vote on the amendments that had been tabled and that were aimed at improving the report. No less than 338 amendments had been submitted to plenary, and not a single one of them was debated. Most of these amendments came from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and, as a result of the proposals never having been put to the vote, the PPE-DE Group chose not to take part in the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the PPE-DE Group’s criticism to the effect that the amendments should have been debated in plenary, but I nonetheless think that it is the duty of each elected Member to take part in the vote. I therefore chose to participate by consistently abstaining in all the votes, including the final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Voting in favour thus entails, first and foremost, being perfectly aware of the serious breaches of human rights and democracy that occur in Pakistan and, consequently, exerting on Pakistan all the pressure that we can and must exert in order to reverse that trend. Additionally, the resolution has enabled those people who fight for human rights and democracy to vote in favour of signing the Agreement. Given that human rights and democracy are two of the main aims of the European Union – and ones to which I subscribe completely – they must be seen as such: as aims and not as conditions for relations between countries. The pragmatic context of international relations would justify such prerequisites, but the countries involved would become isolated, and therefore unable to persuade other countries to meet these aims.

<p class="contents">The original version of the report focused on just three areas and contained some provisions that were entirely out of place, particularly in areas such as terrorism and so-called reproductive health.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur accepted a large number of amendments, which led to this less unbalanced version.</p>
<p class="contents">The various situations highlighted in the ‘new’ report are, nevertheless, almost all taken out of context.</p>
<p class="contents">The document contains issues that do not fall under the traditional concept of ‘human rights’; indeed, they go far beyond the original meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted against the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I object to the way in which the report has far exceeded its scope. I cannot allow the European Union to use this method – endeavouring to bring, on a permanent basis, all other kinds of rights under the umbrella of ‘human rights’ – to find an easy way of extending its scope for action. It is wrong for the EU to seek to increase its competences by means of deliberately blurring concepts which, in turn, makes it more difficult effectively to safeguard fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are seeing is a clever move that will subtly pave the way for the European Union to deem the most diverse fields ‘human rights’ and to intervene in any area it wishes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was a disgraceful decision that brought to a close a new trial, begun on 28 March 2003, which was the result of a concerted international campaign to free Leyla Zana and her fellow MPs.

The report maintains emphasis on the structural reforms of the Lisbon Strategy, such as measures to make the labour market more flexible, in other words making workers more adaptable and contractual provisions more pliable, which has led to greater insecurity in industrial relations. This is not all, however. The report paves the way for the private sector to enter the fields of pensions and health, at a time when over 1.5 million workers in the European Union have swelled the ranks of the unemployed since 2001, at a time when more and more companies are closing down and others relocating, and when the long-trumpeted upturn is taking its time to appear.</p>
<p class="contents">The right approach would be a policy of economic regeneration, committed to reinvigorating production and labour, with the aim of promoting economic growth, jobs and social and economic cohesion.

<p class="contents">In the report I have drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I present the situation of women in south-east Europe as configured during the transitional period, compared with the previous situation. My report complements the reports on relations between the Union and the countries of south-east Europe and the progress of these countries within the framework of the stabilisation and association agreements. My intention was to present an integrated picture of the position of women in an area in which there are important differences between countries, but a great deal of similarity in the problems which they face. The report focuses mainly on the following sectors: education and economic activity, participation in democratic institutions, violence against women and sexual exploitation, health and reproductive rights and trafficking in women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">In most countries of the Balkans, there has of course been a considerable improvement in the situation of women over the last five years. Nonetheless, the basic problems remain and the question of addressing them is not very high on the political agenda of the countries in the area. There is no sign of change in numerous sectors and, where there is some change, it is very slow in coming. Armed conflicts, the perceptions of the regimes, traditional social prejudices, outdated practices and attitudes and ethnic quarrels have marginalised women. It is telling that women from various minority groups, such as the Roma, receive no or little state care. The report analyses the problems, giving typical examples of the weaknesses in each individual country, in order to send a strong message to the governments of these countries, so that they can immediately develop actions and initiatives to combat discrimination against women and actively promote gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as education and the economy are concerned, the acute changes have differentiated to a major degree both the positions and possibilities of different generations of women. Demographic trends today demonstrate that family life is no longer a primary life objective for women, who are more interested in their economic independence and professional achievement and are therefore investing more time and energy in education. In numerous countries in the area, such as Greece, most university students are women. As far as professional life is concerned, women are more often employees, in other words they are employed in the tertiary sector, in services, and are less often employers than men. They are also less often self-employed. In the sectors in which women are mainly employed, pay is generally low and there are few prospects. I also note the higher percentage of unemployment and poverty among women in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the participation of women in political decision-making is concerned, the situation is rather disappointing in most countries, although this participation is tending to increase constantly. One of the main similarities between these countries in the political sector is the fast spread of non-governmental organisations which are active in women’s rights and are making a significant contribution to strengthening the position of women in employment and politics. However, I must point out that, in comparison with other regions of Europe, such as central Europe, the Balkan countries have the highest level of exclusion of women from political decision-making positions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as women's health and reproductive rights are concerned, I stress that particularly stressful living conditions, by which I mean the economy of survival based on the intensive exploitation of female human resources, the increase in violence against women and the fact that, in numerous countries, the health care systems have collapsed, put women's health at real risk. Similarly, in the Balkan countries, domestic violence is often one problem with dramatic dimensions; it is also basically a problem which is inadequately recognised and addressed. This problem, together with trafficking, has reached explosive dimensions. Nonetheless, in the entire area, there is a lack of serious and systematic statistics on the problem, a lack of adequate legislative regulation, monitoring and guidance and a lack of economic and psychological support for victims.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as trafficking in women is concerned, south-east Europe in general has been identified in recent years as an area in which the trafficking networks act almost unimpeded. Trafficking prospers because it is of course economically viable and it constitutes a basic part of the sexual economy and part of consumer society. Trafficking in the area is a real industry, consisting of small- and large-scale businesses and local and international networks. The industry in question has political support and economic resources in the countries of origin, transit and destination, in the form of corrupt officers, and I should like to quote as a typical example the scandal of sexual slavery in Montenegro. A woman from Moldavia, the victim of trafficking, recognised key political figures as clients and/or as those involved in the white slave trade. I should also like to stress that the peace forces in the area have increased this phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to say that it is certain that the road towards the economic and social development of south-east Europe and respect for the rights of women depends on their integration into European structures and I should like to remind you that the European Council in Thessaloniki in June 2003 emphasised that it supported the European prospects of the countries of the western Balkans. Europe cannot be secure and at peace while violence, ethnic hatred and violations of fundamental rights are a daily occurrence within its borders. The role of women in reconciliation, peaceful coexistence and development in the countries of south-east Europe must be given the recognition it deserves by the European Union and strengthened in every possible way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission welcomes the adoption of the Karamanou report on women in South-East Europe and the many valuable observations and proposals which it contains. In its relations with the countries of South-East Europe the EU is striving to promote stability, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human and minority rights, including of course gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission pays the utmost attention to ensuring that gender issues are integrated into the mainstream of all European Community assistance programmes as a cross-cutting issue. It is nevertheless clear that in a number of countries the situation is far from ideal and is a problem of great political importance. The Thessaloniki agenda for the Western Balkans as endorsed by the EU-Western Balkans Summit in June 2003 specifically states that support for activities to defend women's rights and improve their situation should be better reflected in EU policies towards the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Involvement of non-governmental organisations, civil society and local authorities in EU-supported policies and activities is of paramount importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding trafficking in human beings, in the Thessaloniki agenda the EU also urges the countries of the region to act both domestically and regionally in line with the principles of the EU and proposals contained in the Brussels Declaration of September 2002. The EU assigns high priority to victim assistance, training programmes for competent bodies, exchange of information, public awareness, and strategy development. In this context, coordination of all international actors is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Most recently the Commission has pointed out in its 2004 report on the Stablisation and Association Process for South-East Europe that gender is insufficiently ensured and domestic violence remains a problem in several countries. Although improvements have been made in certain countries on issues such as equal salaries, equal treatment of men and women concerning employment, training, career advancement and working conditions, and women's participation in government, progress is generally slow and insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the regional CARDS programme for 2002, the Commission published an open call for submission of proposals for support for the rule of law, good governance, public accountability and freedom of opinion. Promoting the equal participation of men and women in the democratisation process was one of the priorities of the CARD stabilisation programme for 2002. Of the twenty-two projects selected for funding which are ongoing until 2005, one is funding a women's leadership programme and another a project on women in media. The rest relate to work with various representatives of civil society to improve the access of citizens more generally to the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the 2003 CARDS regional programme on democratic stabilisation, an open call for submissions was issued recently and the deadline for receiving proposals is 28 April. While this programme does not specifically target women, it supports equality of men and women and the participation of diverse civil society groups and associations at local grassroots level in the process of strengthening democratic structures.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an additional call for proposals under the 2003 CARDS regional programme is due to be issued soon. The programme proposes to strengthen capacities of civil society network associations in order to deliver better services to their member organisations. This constitutes a logical continuation of the 2002 initiatives and we expect and hope that women's associations will submit sound proposals in response to this call.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a new CARDS multiannual programming cycle is currently under preparation and the suggestions in the Karamanou report will be duly taken into account in the context of this exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">As pointed out in the report, problems have also occurred and still exist in certain candidate countries. In order to address this situation, from 1999 to 2003 gender equality projects under the PHARE national programme and MEDA totalled more than EUR 13 million. During the same period, participation by the candidate countries in the Community programmes involved close to EUR 1 million and gender equality projects financed under civil society programmes totalled EUR 2.5 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Once they are members of the European Union, these states will obviously be subject to the same obligations and benefit from the same instruments as other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues related to gender equality and the improvement of women's employment are raised in the regular reports on Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. This matter is being dealt with in the negotiations on the Union's social <span class="italic">acquis</span> for the first two countries. Furthermore, as pointed out by the honourable Member, more that 20 projects have been financed for civil society actions to improve women's conditions. Recent legislation adopted in the three countries is improving the legal situation of women and the Commission is following the implementation of this legislation very closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My political group has supported their move towards Europe and all the development and cooperation procedures which have been applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Historic experience and daily life in the European Union have demonstrated that development and prosperity cannot be achieved without democracy, without respect for human rights and special attention to women's rights, without making full use of the manpower of both sexes, without a dynamic civil society. That is why I wish to welcome the initiative by Mrs Karamanou in drafting a report on the rights of women in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the monitoring of the stabilisation and association agreements, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has drafted various opinions, one of which I had the honour of drafting, in which it emphasises the problems faced by women in the Balkans and the need to integrate equality into all policies. The seriousness, however, of the issues, as presented to us by the rapporteur in her report, and the challenge of addressing these issues, for the sake of development in the area and good collaborative relations with the European Union, warrant a special report. I also take this opportunity to welcome the statement by Commissioner Nielson on including many of the proposals by my fellow Member in her report in the new CARDS programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that, in the face of this challenge, we are responsible on both sides. We, as the European Union, must activate all the mechanisms and potential for a good collaborative approach with the Balkans, but also the countries of the Balkans must take serious account of the fact that democracy and standards are the best guarantee of their development and their integration into the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are fundamentally talking about democracy, Mr President, because we are talking about equality and freedom, the combination of which should result in democracy. Democracy has not reached the women of the Balkans. Trafficking in women, domestic violence, difficulties accessing reproductive rights, lack of political participation, unemployment, poverty and prostitution are the reality of thousands of women living in the region. Each country has its own distinctive reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In Albania we could emphasise the serious increase in the trafficking in women and children for sexual exploitation. Bulgaria is entirely lacking in mechanisms for creating equal opportunities between men and women, which is a prerequisite for transposing our rules. Trafficking in women and girls in Bosnia Herzegovina is also increasing. In Croatia, violence against women goes unpunished. In Greece, we are faced with serious problems in terms of the political representation of women. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the sexual abuse of Albanian and Roma girls takes place on an almost daily basis and the legislation does not include any law relating to the crime of trafficking. In Romania there are crimes on ethnic grounds, mainly against Roma women. These women have practically no access to contraception and forced marriages and poverty are also part of their reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In Serbia and Montenegro, there is a very clear increase in trafficking in women, also influenced by the arrival of Kafor troops. In Turkey, violence against women is widespread and sentences are still reduced for what are so wrongly termed ‘crimes of honour’.</p>
<p class="contents">We must open our eyes, Mr President. We must pay attention to the situation of women in this region and we must not move ahead without taking account of the daily reality of thousands of women and girls living in poverty, exploitation and hopelessness.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must serve as an essential lever, as the incentive for these countries to commit themselves seriously to human rights and freedom for their citizens. No cultural tradition can be placed above universal human rights. There cannot be first- and second-class citizens. Inequality for women in south-east Europe must be a priority for all of us, because we are talking about democracy and not about women's problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call for exhaustive monitoring of the accession agenda in relation to the candidate countries, and greater solidarity with women, for this is what they expect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, equal opportunities between men and women in this region deserve our utmost attention in light of the problems caused by all types of exploitation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Human trafficking in south-east Europe is giving us the greatest cause for concern and worry. I am sorry to say that women are, in large numbers, the main victims of this terrible trafficking. The countries of this region too are called upon to take all measures necessary in order to put a stop to this modern slavery. For my part, it is true that combating the trafficking in women is an absolute priority, in line with our European values based on the principle of respect for fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The horror of testimonies from Romanian, Moldavian and other women who have been sold for a handful of dollars is intolerable. The marketing of women must be very strongly condemned. Some Balkan countries that persistently hammer on the door of the European Union with the aim, of course, of becoming Member States should make it their absolute priority persistently to target these mafia-like organisations, break them up and severely punish those guilty of this horrendous trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">I would reiterate that we cannot tolerate the exploitation and abuse either of women or, especially, of girls, who are slaves of unscrupulous networks. Nor can we tolerate any longer the indifference of governmental authorities that all too often tend to close their eyes and ignore what is not only a problem but also a curse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should now like to make some comments on trafficking in human beings in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spent a lot of time working in the Balkans and continue to do so. I notice that a lot is happening there. Action is being taken and, as the Commissioner said, many programmes are in place. I have mixed feelings though. Yes, on the one hand there is progress, but what about the other hand? I am seeing more and more well-motivated young politicians, both men and women, who want to do something. Improvements can be seen in the towns, but things are still very different in the countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said of the humiliation of the victims. We identified 5 203 victims between 2000 and 2003, but the actual number could be over 175 000. So a lot of work remains to be done. Since 2003 we have been seeing far fewer victims because the criminal sector is going more and more underground. What are they doing? They are bringing their victims, the girls, not to bars or brothels, but to private flats. This makes the networks much more sophisticated. Previously they operated in small groups, but now they are on their own – one dealer for each victim, and so the chance of catching them is smaller. It takes a lot of work. Secondly, blood vengeance is on the rise, not only among men but also involving women and children. If you are an Albanian woman, raped and kidnapped and taken to the West, what happens then? According to Albanian custom, this woman has shamed her family and even today they have the right to kill her. That is the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, I would urge you to support actions aimed at gender equality and activities and training aimed at the police, the military and the authorities. Jobs must also be created, jobs with a reasonable wage, in order to deal with the problem of corruption. In addition, we should involve Balkan countries in the European institutions. Invite people from these countries to attend courses so that they can see that there is another, less corrupt, way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its political success and practical impact have become a guiding light for multilateral efforts to eradicate the legacies of hatred and lingering threat left by conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">Since its entry into force significant progress has been made by the international community: 141 countries have ratified the MBT, 9 more countries have signed, over 110 countries are not using anti-personnel landmines, more than 30 million stockpiled mines have been destroyed by states parties to the Convention and, last but not least, mine action programmes are being successfully implemented in many mine-affected countries. However, much still remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of countries continue to use anti-personnel mines, and some are also believed to be continuing to produce landmines. Approximately 65 countries are still affected to some degree by mines and unexploded ordnance and, unfortunately, new areas of conflict are adding to this list. Global estimates of new landmine casualties each year vary between 15 000 and 20 000 people, many of whom are civilians, including children.</p>
<p class="contents">The upcoming review conference on 29 November to 3 December 2004 in Nairobi will be a major opportunity to take stock of past achievements and the lessons learned and to trace the course of action for the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">What has the EU done so far and what does it intend to do in preparation for this review conference? The importance attached by the EU to the goals of the Ottawa Convention became a tangible fact in 1997 when Parliament created the anti-personnel landmine budget line. In March 2000, the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Ottawa Treaty, the European Commission issued a communication and forwarded to Parliament and the Council a draft regulation on the reinforcement of the EU contribution to the fight against landmines.</p>
<p class="contents">In July 2001 Parliament and the Council adopted the legal instrument and its financial envelope. These lay the foundations of an integrated and focused European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, the new legal instrument was put into practice through the multiannual strategy for the years 2002-2004. The strategy is the first of its kind since the anti-personnel landmine regulations entered into force. It constitutes an operative framework for coordinating and prioritising EU-financed projects in this field. It contains an overall approach and detailed programming covering 33 countries for an average yearly EC contribution of about EUR 42 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in the process of launching the multiannual strategy for 2005 to 2007. The figures here also contain the contribution from sources within the European Development Fund and reflect the total level of activity we are supporting.</p>
<p class="contents">The setting of priorities will be conducted on an informed and coherent basis. We will do this against a background of perspectives and goals shared with the international community and reflecting a jointly-defined orientation and policy. We will ensure that in the preparatory work for the Nairobi Summit we coordinate within the European Union both at government level and non-governmental level, and also with a wide range of non-state actors. This consultation is important if we are to create 'ownership', within a very broad framework, for what we do in Nairobi.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the adoption of the APL regulation, the European Union has played a substantial and visible role in the fight against landmines, both in political terms and also in terms of financial commitments. Looking at the broad picture for the years 2000 to 2002, contributions to mine action from the EU Member States and the European Community stood at a sum total of EUR 410 million. We hope to be able to continue our engagement at this impressive level.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that failure to award sufficient priority to mine action would have enormous human costs and render its development fragile and fragmented. The mine threat can be overcome. The deadlines were set in the Ottawa Convention and clearly challenge us to swiftly eradicate this scourge. The Nairobi Summit will be an appeal to all of us to do more and to do it faster.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's resolution provides a forceful and positive signal in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This often causes, for prolonged periods of time, massive social and economic problems in countries, many of which are already amongst the poorest in the world and suffering from the ravages of long-term war and disease.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I particularly support the 1997 Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of antipersonnel mines and their eventual destruction. I congratulate the 141 States which have ratified or acceded to this Treaty and call upon the four EU Member States remaining after enlargement on 1 May which have not yet done so – namely, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and Poland – to do so without any further delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is true that some 68 states have destroyed more than 31.5 million mines, it is estimated that 78 countries still have between 200 and 250 million antipersonnel mines stockpiled, that tragically there are still between 15 000 and 20 000 new landmine victims per year and that landmines still litter 82 countries around the world. Much still remains to be done, to echo the words of Commissioner Nielson.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has pledged EUR 240 million for the period 2002-2009 to support the total ban and assist with mine clearance, victim assistance and stockpile destruction, and this support is at least part conditional on the recipient country demonstrating a commitment towards accession to the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to pay tribute to my colleague, Mr Van Orden, who has been particularly active in this campaign. I also wish every success to the November 2004 Nairobi Conference, which seeks to review the operation of this Convention and what further measures can be taken to implement its contents, in particular how to encourage armed, non-state actors to ban the use of antipersonnel landmines without recognising their legitimacy. This is particularly salient in Africa – the venue of the conference – which has been blighted by a series of tragic civil wars from Zaire to Liberia and Sierra Leone and which are characterised by insurgents and rebels, often heavily armed and financed by third parties.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not, however, accept – unlike some Members of this House – that this ban can be automatically extended to the legitimate military use of other munitions, such as anti-tank mines, as they, for instance, are less readily available to non-regular forces, because they are much more expensive and tend to be laid in a well-mapped and systematic fashion, which enables speedy clearance in peacetime after the cessation of hostilities. Furthermore, they are not capable of being detonated by the foot of an innocent child, as is the case with antipersonnel mines.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues need to be considered separately as, otherwise, there is a danger of losing cross-party political consensus on this important issue. I also support that this Parliament sends a delegation of Members of this House, as observers, to the conference so that they can report back to the House on the progress in this very important area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this particular case, the Ottawa Treaty, which was essentially signed seven years ago and has been in application for a very short time, has proven its applicability and efficacy and is therefore a successful policy <span class="italic">par excellence</span>. The choice of holding the first conference to review this Treaty in Nairobi is particularly symbolic, because we all know that sub-Sahara is one of the areas which has the biggest concentration of anti-personnel mines, given that mines are considered to be the weapon of the poor.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to point out that my country, which remained outside this Treaty several years ago, also recently agreed with and ratified the Treaty under the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Georgos Papandreou, and has applied it in connection with its border with Turkey where, for reasons which we all understand, there was a cold front of confrontation.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate objective of the Ottawa Treaty is to overcome the problem of land mines through coordinated action against mines at international level within the next ten to fifteen years. This objective is considered to constitute a challenge, because over sixty countries have stated that they are facing problems on this issue and 20 of them are very seriously affected. The experience of Europe itself after the cold war, and recent experience in the Balkans, demonstrates that this huge problem even exists on our continent. Of course, in Asia, Africa and Latin America, where hundreds of millions of mines undermine health and economic development every day, the issue is even bigger.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations plays the central role in organising and coordinating international efforts, while the European Union provides the greatest individual contribution. Since 1992, before the Ottawa Treaty even existed, the sums quoted by the Commission to date are significant but should possibly be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has undertaken a great many initiatives since 1992 in connection with a complete ban on this murder weapon, which exterminates human lives and prevents economic development. However, our greatest contribution has been in implementing these programmes in a great many countries of the world; in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in the Balkans, in dozens of countries in which both non-governmental and governmental organisations are involved in removing anti-personnel mines. Apart from neutralising mines, however, they need to pay greater attention to education, research and more general information in connection with the danger and how to prevent it.</p>
<p class="contents">The conference in Nairobi will provide a huge opportunity to apply all aspects of the Ottawa Treaty which have somehow not been applied due to technical shortcomings, to supplement the Treaty, to complete it and to give the world a new Treaty, a highly effective, albeit small-scale Treaty for the peace and security of the developing and, more importantly, the poor areas of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Easy to put in place and relatively cheap, mines are a recurring threat long after the end of fighting. Although the Ottawa agreement banning anti-personnel mines has now entered into force, only future conflicts are affected. The fight against the approximately 110 million mines across the world sadly remains a reality. There are stocks that pose a threat of proliferation, and several Phare countries, such as the former Yugoslavia, the United States, China and Russia, should be encouraged to ratify this treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor, unfortunately, has the time come to bring an end to the humanitarian action, carried out either by NGOs or the UN, to combat this scourge. I also welcome the preparations for the Ottawa Conference. Six years after the signing in Ottawa of a convention banning the use, stockpiling and production of anti-personnel mines, let us remember that it is said that, every year, there are still between 15 000 and 20 000 people in the world who are victims of such mines. In particular, children continue to pay a heavy price for the spread of the poor man’s weapon, and children make up a quarter of the victims. This is why it is our duty to continue the battle and, above all, to do everything possible to ensure that, finally, production of these mines comes to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament recently sent a delegation to Sudan where a civil war has been raging for 20 years. Thankfully the war is over in some parts of the country, such as the Nuba Mountains in the south, but the people living there are now faced with the continued presence of thousands and thousands of mines. Not only are more people regularly being injured in mine-related accidents, but mines are restricting access to the fields and other villages. This makes it very difficult for people to earn a living.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to appeal directly to all those in the world who are responsible for making these mines. We have no idea how long mines can remain active or how long they will still be around. I was shocked to discover in Sudan that Belgian mines are still being found there 20 to 30 years after they were made. And that is despite the fact that my country, Belgium, was one of the first countries to work for the abolition of mines.</p>
<p class="contents">That was in Africa, but the problem reaches as far as the borders of Europe. For example, remember that mines are still being used in Cyprus to protect the border between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot parts. I hope that the largest countries – China, the United States and Russia – will stop producing and using these mines as well. A general global ban is essential, because the effects of mines still remain a threat to the existence of poor people every day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I remember how, before 1999, it was above all Mrs Maren Günther who devoted herself to this cause, in which we have achieved a number of successes and made significant progress. Today, we can see how most of the Member States – almost all of them, in fact; only a few have not yet done so – have already ratified the Protocol, so the assertions made only a few years ago that it was, for this or that reason, quite impossible to accede to it, have proven to be without substance. What this shows is that this is all about political will, so I can do no other than appeal to our Estonian, Latvian, Finnish and Polish friends to see to it that they sign up as soon as possible. I would say the same thing to our important ally, the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">They and we may be partners in the war on terrorism, but in that anti-personnel mines have no part; they are themselves an instrument of terror. It is for that reason that we must do everything we can to prohibit production of them and trade in them, whilst also doing more to support the clearance of mines. It has been said, and rightly, that mines hit the poorest regions hardest. A few days ago, we heard from the Commission – and I am right behind them in this – that we intend to conduct accession negotiations with Croatia. Croatia is suffering in that, in the fields of one of its most fertile regions, that between Vukova and Ilok, with its wonderful vineyards, mines continue to be present on a large scale, thus preventing the people from returning home.</p>
<p class="contents">It is even worse in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Kosovo, right in the middle of Europe. The same is true, of course, in those regions to which we are particularly committed, such as Africa, which we have been discussing today – and I agree with all those Members who have said that things are at their worst there – and also in Afghanistan. Although we are doing everything to help Afghanistan, our aid is concentrated on a few cities; this is due not only to errors of political judgement on our part, but also to the fact that there are so many mines scattered over wide stretches of the country that reconstruction there is making little if any headway. That, though, is not where the eyes of the world are focused.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that I am glad that our resolution states that we have to pay more attention to mine clearance, to ridding the world of mines. It would be utterly absurd, though, if we were to deploy massive resources – as we must – in support of mine action programmes, while, at the same time, states such as our partners or even certain prospective Member States were to be producing new mines, which would then be laid. That would be nonsense from any rational person’s point of view. For this reason, there is no alternative to a ban, which must include all Member States of the European Union, and behind which we must throw our whole weight, both economically and in terms of foreign policy. Commissioner, I want to endorse your statement that it is not only Europe that must unequivocally ban these mines, but all the states on this earth, including the 44 that are still creating difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Tannock, it is true that there is a big difference between antitank mines and antipersonnel mines. However, they too can be used in a perverse manner: an antipersonnel mine can be stacked on top of an antitank mine, which is extremely dangerous. There are all kinds of perverse ways of stacking and combining these mines. I do not mean that we should move beyond the scope of the Ottawa Treaty. We should use it forcefully and constructively and then consider how we can move on.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of increasing the number of countries actually complying with and ratifying the Treaty is still a real problem. As a Danish government minister I signed the Ottowa Treaty on behalf of my country. Immediately after signing, the Canadian Government gave us all a nice ballpoint pen. I subsequently had a meeting with the roaming US ambassador. I felt sorry for him and gave him the pen I had just used to sign, saying that at least his government would have a pen that knew how to sign the Treaty. We still need to exert pressure on those countries that are not on board, including the EU Member State named during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important and effective thing way of proceeding in post-conflict situations is, if possible, to have the two sides in a conflict join together in demining mapping. Nicaragua was a good example of this, even though that was never a dirty guerrilla war. It was well-organised and both sides had mapped what they had done. In Nicaragua, working together became in itself part of the reconciliation and confidence-building process. In this case it was possible, but in many cases it is not. This is part of the problem. Having said that, local communities were mobilised in a fantastic way in Cambodia to provide intelligence for mapping, and a long-term broad participatory approach was taken to moving things forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to use our global presence not only to provide money but also to act as a catalyst for the use of best practice. We should probably also be doing more in terms of research and development in the field of detection technologies. This is all part of what we intend to do in the coming years.</p>

<p class="contents">I would ask the following question: with what authority can the Castro Government demand explanations of the situation of these prisoners and demand measures to guarantee that their rights are respected, when Cuba still has 74 citizens imprisoned in inhuman conditions, hundreds of kilometres from their homes, for the sole crime of wishing to exercise their inalienable right to freedom of expression and thought?</p>
<p class="contents">We also roundly condemn what is happening in Guantánamo. However, precisely because we are demonstrating the consistency that the Castro Government so cynically demands from the European Union in Geneva – a consistency that Fidel Castro himself is incapable of showing – we also once again condemn the arbitrary detention of the Cuban dissidents.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Julio Antonio Valdés has been freed, and we are delighted about that. But what we do not want is to allow ourselves to be deceived and forget that the other dissidents are still in prison and that this imprisonment and the conditions involved, which contravene all international conventions in the field, are a flagrant violation of fundamental rights. Neither do we wish to forget that the Varela Project has not yet gone ahead and that Osvaldo Payá, whom Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize, is still unable to leave Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the timeliness of the Resolution we are discussing, which is perhaps a repetition, according to the Socialist Group – and this is the reason why it has not wished to sign up to this resolution – but nevertheless necessary, because events in Cuba are, regrettably, repeating themselves and the situation not only remains unchanged, but as the months have passed has actually deteriorated.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want either Parliament or the Commission to abandon people who fight peacefully to defend freedom to their fate, and nor do we want to remain silent about their suffering or about that of their families. We want to tell them from this House once again that we are still standing by them and that, despite the isolation in which they have been confined, we are not forgetting them and we are still with them in their fight, in the hope that one day Cuba can begin to move toward democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost 80 civilians were arrested, tried and given very heavy prison sentences, ranging from six to 28 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Those arrested were tried very quickly: in a matter of weeks – or even days – in the course of trials not open to the public. The defendants were aided by lawyers not belonging to independent bar associations. The conditions of detention of these people raise serious concerns, insofar as the Cuban authorities are providing hardly any information on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, we urge the Cuban authorities to free these political prisoners and are anxious to remind them that freedom of expression is a fundamental right. Last month, a delegation from Reporters Without Borders, accompanied by relatives of unfairly condemned prisoners, came to protest and call for the help of the European Parliament in fighting to defend freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">I am anxious to stress that Cuba has ratified a number of conventions in the area of human rights and I call on the Cuban authorities to respect their undertakings. Cuba cannot, for all that, use the admittedly disastrous consequences of the embargo, which has lasted for more than 40 years, to claim that some of its nationals, described in particular as mercenaries in the service of foreign powers, have had their human rights systematically violated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I am not the author of this resolution but am actually more opposed to it. I therefore want to throw another light on the topic.</p>
<p class="contents">I have recently been to Cuba to investigate possible ways of cooperating to combat trafficking in and smuggling of human beings. This phenomenon is a serious and pressing problem in Cuba too, and the Cuban Government is working hard on it. In the first two and a half months of this year no fewer than 30 people-smuggling operations were closed down and about 70 attempts to leave the country illegally were thwarted. Half of these involved people-smuggling. Furthermore, five people died in a dramatic attempt to reach the United States, one person is still missing and three were found alive.</p>
<p class="contents">People-trafficking generally involves fake marriages and false promises of work. Why do ordinary Cubans take such risks? When talking about people-trafficking we often use the terms 'push factor' and 'pull factor'. We know that poverty is the principal reason, the push factor, both social and economic poverty. As far as pull factors go, we almost immediately think of the force of attraction exerted by the rich West, in this case the United States. That picture is not entirely accurate. What promises do people-traffickers usually make? As in Europe, they promise the chance to earn more money, sometimes a lot more, and claim that their victims will be grateful to them. A rose-tinted picture, bearing little relation to reality, is painted.</p>
<p class="contents">US President Lyndon Johnson approved the Cuban Adjustment Act in 1966. This law automatically gave all Cubans reaching the United States residence and employment rights after they had been in the US for a year. This is a clear pull factor, possibly the most important as far as Cuba is concerned. The assumption has always been that life in the United States, even for people on the breadline, is much better than life in Cuba. But the World Bank, not exactly known for its anti-American pronouncements, has praised Cuban healthcare and education. Compare this to the situation in the so-called Promised Land, the United States, where access to healthcare is far from universal, where affordable education is of low quality and where many prisons are privatised and outside democratic control. I have personal experience of this.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to criticise the human rights situation in Cuba we must bear two things in mind. Who is criticising, and is the criticism reasonable and balanced? Listening to the official voice of the European Parliament over the past few months it is clear to me that double standards are being applied, as whenever values that we ourselves regard as universal come into the picture we suddenly take a very selective approach in the case of Cuba. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Good news from Castro's Cuba; is that possible? Yes indeed, and I refer you to the full-page article in yesterday's <span class="italic">Neue Zürcher Zeitung</span> devoted to unceasing internal efforts to bring about peaceful regime change on the island. The title of the article speaks for itself: 'Third run-up to a referendum in Cuba'.</p>
<p class="contents">The driving force behind this planned plebiscite is still Oswaldo Paya, winner of the Sakharov prize awarded by this House. The enmity and quibbling of Castro and his associates do not worry him; Paya sees the growing popularity of his initiative as more important. Increasing numbers of Cubans are losing their fear of government repression. In May 2002 Paya and his supporters handed over 11 020 signatures for a referendum to the national parliament. 14 384 more signatures were added at the start of October 2003. About half of these were obtained in the period following the wave of arrests in March 2003. The muzzled parliament did not respond, but this has not stopped Paya from organising a third petition.</p>
<p class="contents">In this resolution, the European Parliament is clearly lending its support to Cubans longing for the achievement of a democratic, constitutional state. This House expects the Council, the Member States of the Union and the Commission to have the same supportive attitude. I sincerely hope that the Committee on Foreign Affairs will make good its intention to produce a full report on the situation in Cuba during the next session. We owe it to the peace-loving people of this island which attracts so many European tourists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are several dozen countries in the world in which the situation in terms of human rights and freedom is objectively worse than in Cuba, but we do not talk about those countries with the same concern. Instead, the European Union maintains relations with almost all of them and, incidentally, just today we have voted without any fuss to renew a cooperation agreement with one of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do not have in the world is several dozen countries on which the United States is obsessively fixated as it is with Cuba. In this area, both our agenda and the scandalous double standards of our positions are set by the United States, with the naïve or deliberate complicity of some of our fellow Members.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, I am in favour of the 70 or so prisoners in Cuba being released. I am aware, however, that people who have been shown to have collaborated with an aggressive power would be imprisoned in our countries as well. I would also contradict those who distort the truth, both in relation to the trials undergone by those prisoners and the conditions in which they are carrying out their sentences.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody would be surprised, Mr President, least of all the Cubans, if following its ‘bringing democracy to Iraq’ venture, the Bush administration were to embark on a similar ‘bringing democracy to Cuba’ operation. For this venture as for the previous one, the White House would find supporters amongst us, but I will certainly not be one of them, and nor will I be one of those who end up regretting not having resisted before.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that within Cuban territory there are cases of human rights violations, violations of the rule of law, illegal imprisonment and inhuman conditions, not for the 70, but for more than 600 men who have not been sentenced nor subject to any judicial procedure. But that is happening in the part of the island occupied by the United States: in the base at Guantánamo. I am shocked that those Members who collect signatures so that the rights of prisoners in Cuban jails are respected and in order to visit those jails, do not include the situation of the prisoners in Guantánamo and a visit to the jail there.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the human rights of Cuban citizens, I would point out that in the United States there are five Cuban prisoners who have been handed down horrendous sentences, in trials which are dubious in terms of legal security, all as a result of actions in defence of their people from attacks from terrorist groups based in Miami. The US Administration is denying them and their families their legitimate rights as defined in the most fundamental rules of international humanitarian law. In this regard, we have called for the mobilisation of the Council and the Commission, today we reiterate our support and we call on Parliament to support the five people who the Cubans see as their heroes, and their families, several of whom have not been able to visit, not for months, not for years, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must always work from an objective point of view and nobody in this House can deny that Cuba has achieved a high level of social, economic, scientific and technological development, which is objectively verifiable and indisputable, despite its international isolation and the asphyxiating blockade by the United States, which it has been suffering for almost half a century. This development has been demonstrated by the indicators in the most advanced and reliable studies and investigations by numerous United Nations bodies. This development also includes fundamental aspects of daily life, such as education, culture, sport and health.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that certain Members of this House are still expressing fury at the Cuban Government in such an irresponsible way and with so little objectivity, while refusing to condemn very serious situations in other parts of the world, resulting from the orders of Washington, that is to say, restrictions of freedoms, interference in the politics of other countries by the United States, as well as the prisoners in Guantánamo, about which you say nothing and whose subhuman situation you do not condemn. Their human rights are not recognised, because the United States has decided that they are in no man's land, but this territory belongs to the United States, it is on Cuban territory and Cuba is a sovereign country.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot have two different yardsticks when it comes to applying human rights at international level. It is highly regrettable that certain groups in this House continuously condemn the situation in Cuba in terms of political prisoners, opponents of the Cuban Government but, nevertheless, avoid debating the horrendous conditions of the five Cubans jailed in the United States, who are denied family visits and fair trials.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has been condemning this in this House and nobody has spoken out on behalf of these prisoners. And I ask myself, do the prisoners in the United States, Guantánamo, the 10 000 in Iraq and other countries not deserve the same consideration and treatment by the European Parliament?</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to mention two dates, so that we can be absolutely clear as to what is at stake: on 1 May, ten new Member States are to join this Parliament, our milieu, the house of democracy that we share. Ten years ago, eight of these States were languishing under the tyranny of Communist dictatorships. Once the Wall came down, they were able to develop democratically, to share the same cornerstones of the rule of law, democracy and freedom, and to live side by side with us. This is what we would like to see happen in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">Next Sunday, 25 April, sees the thirtieth anniversary of the ‘Carnation Revolution’, a democratic revolution, which was promptly hijacked by the extreme left and the Communists, who wished to turn Portugal – to use the expression of the time – into ‘the Cuba of Europe’. We strove hard in 1974 and 1975 to be able to call ourselves a free and democratic country and not a ‘Cuba of Europe’. What we would now like to see is Cuba become ‘the Portugal of the Caribbean’; we would like to see the carnations that brightened up Portugal do the same in Cuba; we would like to share the vibrancy, the colour and the warmth of Cuban culture, a culture we hold in high regard and which we would like to see smile and grow in freedom. This is what is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention has been made here of double standards. What I deplore here is the lack of solidarity, on the part of some Members of this House, with the terrible suffering in Cuba, with people sentenced one year ago to twenty or more years in prison for their beliefs. This is a diabolical state of affairs. If you do not wish to see double standards, then use your vote wisely, otherwise the accusers may soon find the tables turned on them. As revealed recently in Parliament by the <span class="italic">Reporters Sans Frontières</span> organisation, Cuba is currently the world’s largest prison for journalists. Since March, twenty-seven journalists have been imprisoned, and three were already in prison. We must, therefore, show unstinting solidarity with all those who advocate freedom of speech, of opinion and of expression, and political freedom in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, one or two words of support for campaigns to award the Nobel Peace Prize to Cuban democrats, such as Rivero Castañeda, a great writer and poet who is in prison, or Oswaldo Payá, to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize in 2002. We must not tire in our efforts and must never give up on promoting the Sakharov initiative until, as we have requested and as is his right, Oswaldo Payá is able to come here and speak to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We wished to draw attention to the fact that, on 18 March 2003 in the shadow of the Iraq war, Fidel Castro instituted a wave of repression in which 75 advocates of democracy were falsely imprisoned following summary trials. They were each sentenced to between 15 and 27 years’ imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">A total of 1 456 years’ imprisonment was thus imposed upon these 75 constitutional activists. Their fate must not be ignored by the surrounding world. It is therefore a matter of extreme urgency that we in the European Parliament make this statement today. As Members of the European Parliament, we believe that the judgments must be overturned inasmuch as the trials in Cuba were clearly conducted without legal rights for the accused, who were sentenced on exclusively political grounds. We ask for these 75 human rights activists to be released, and for them to be so without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Their so-called crime is that, in accordance with the Cuban Constitution, they collected approximately 10 000 signatures calling for a referendum on a more pluralistic and more democratic Cuba. For that, they were given extremely long sentences. The majority of those advocating democracy belong to the Christian and Christian Democratic human rights movement, Movimento Cristiano Liberación.</p>
<p class="contents">I, together with Mr Ribeiro e Castro and 206 other MEPs, took the initiative of inviting Sakharov prizewinner<span class="bold"> </span>Osvaldo Payà Sardiñas to visit us here in Europe.

Having failed to find any other excuse to regurgitate their slander of the Cuban people, they remembered the anniversary of the decisions by the courts which sentenced agents of US imperialism and decided to celebrate it. However loud you attack socialist Cuba, my dear fellow Members, you cannot deny the fact that Cuba is the only free country on the American continent, the only country where the people take authority into their own hands. That is why it has endured exclusion, threats and invasion. That is why the United States of America and the European Union want to overturn the Cuban revolution. If, therefore, you are truly interested in the people of Cuba and in human rights, organise a debate on its long-term exclusion or on the five Cuban patriots who are rotting in gaol in Miami, without even being able to see their families, because they acted against the terrorism which is striking their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For decades, this House has contended for freedom, human rights and the right of peoples to self-determination in Central and Eastern Europe. It has helped to sweep away Communism and its dictatorship, banish the ghost of Stalin, tear down the Iron Curtain and now unite the whole of Europe in freedom, and it is positively spooky that a relic of this inhuman ideology such as Mr Alyssandrakis should get up in this House and defend the dictatorship in Cuba.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say it loud and clear, my good friends: we are not, as you suppose, against the Cuban people. On the contrary, we defend them. Those who, before 1989, spoke in this House in defence of the Communist dictatorships must be ashamed when their words are dredged up from the Minutes. In the same way, you too will one day have to be ashamed of what you have said today about Cuba, one of the last brutal and repressive Communist dictatorships in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have an uncritical attitude towards the United States, and God knows that I am not going to defend all the things that a blockade entails. I take a thoroughly critical view of it. I have to say, though, that it stands to reason that it is our duty as democrats to defend with all our might Cuba’s democracy movement, the rule of law there, and its freedom, against those who repress them, represented by the old-school Communist Fidel Castro, a man as lacking in understanding as you are, Mr Alyssandrakis, and, like you, forever yesterday’s man. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This reflects political reality, but I have one plea. I direct it to Mrs Bergaz Conesa who highlighted Cuba's fine performance in areas such as health, sports and education. That is fine, but I would add, 'and so what'? It should be possible, without being misunderstood, to discuss the issue of human rights on its own merits, not just in Cuba, but everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is as if this is a sort of balancing game, a sort of political scoreboard relating to the totality of Cuba's situation, character and state of mind politically. This is not the case. As I understand it, this is about expressing concern – to put it mildly – on human rights issues there, and as friends of that nation we in Europe are entitled to do that here without being seen as escalating or creating even more problems than we have already.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares Parliament's concern about the human rights situation in Cuba. We need to see progress on democracy and the opening-up and normalising of political life, especially now, one year after the mass detention of dissidents. In our analysis things have not improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU continually follows the situation of political prisoners through the Human Rights Working Group in Havana and through contacts with family members of those imprisoned. Last February, the wives and mothers of the political prisoners expressed their appreciation to the European institutions for the support they give. The European Union intends to continue to raise the cases of prisoners of conscience with the Cuban authorities and to exert the pressure we can for real democratic reform and respect for human rights in Cuba. The recent declaration by the Council presidency, congratulating the Cuban journalist Raúl Rivero on the award of the Word Press Freedom Prize from Unesco, called again on the Cuban authorities to release all the imprisoned dissidents without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States supported the recent resolution on Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission, lamenting the sentencing of political dissidents and journalists last year and expressing hope that the government of Cuba will take measures to promote the full development of democratic institutions and civil liberties.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union considers dialogue with Havana important to promote political, economic and civil rights reforms. However, positive moves by Cuba on its political prisoners are needed. If Cuba took concrete steps to improve the human rights situation, I am sure that the European Union would immediately respond. We regret the current situation. We not only see scope for improvement, we also see the <span class="italic">need</span> for improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports Parliament's initiative to invite Oswaldo Payá. Our delegation in Havana is in regular contact with him and is trying to facilitate the visit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, despite Cuban decisions which impede our development cooperation activities, the Commission remains willing to provide aid to promote democracy and improve living standards for ordinary Cubans. We regret the lower level of activity in what we are doing together for the time being and, without wanting to create further political tension, we hope and work for a normalisation of the situation.</p>

<p class="contents">On the basis, therefore, of the serious violations of the rights of workers which we have noted, including of a great many women and children, in the production of sports clothing and footwear, we call on the European Commission to take initiatives and to demand that sport article industries and their world federations apply the rules of the International Labour Organisation. The Commission also needs to cooperate with the International Olympic Committee in order to ensure that the International Olympic Committee includes respect for the internationally accepted rights of workers in the Olympic Charter and the Ethics Code. We also call on the International Olympic Committee to demand that contracts concluded with sponsors and commercial companies include compliance with internationally recognised employment standards and fundamental rights.

What a pity that this no longer happens. It was a tribute to human individuality and dignity. However, now we see that it is precisely sports shoes that have become a symbol for human exploitation. This resolution is a justified response to this exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">The standards of the International Labour Organisation ought to be binding throughout the world. The reverse is true at present. Ethical investors are punished because they are the victims of unfair competition. We must devise systems of inspection and raise awareness among our consumers and trade unions. The International Olympic Committee should not permit advertising of goods that are not made according to ethical standards. Europe should use these ILO standards not only as a label demonstrating social acceptability and fair trade but also as an organisational principle that we regard as binding for imports and exports. Of course, that is not yet possible but I hope that we can develop a strategy towards this end, so that in years to come when the Olympic Games take place we will be able to say that the rules for equitable world trade and production methods have been integrated into the world trade system itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is tempting to look well into the future. For example, Flanders is now putting itself forward as a candidate to host the 2016 Olympic Games.

It is therefore crucial that these fundamental principles embrace respect for core labour standards in the production of sports articles for the Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, in the context of such production, the failure to respect labour law as laid down by the International Labour Organisation has been observed. Several factors indicate that many sports articles are produced by subcontracting firms which, through their improper conditions of work and employment, breach not only labour law, but also human rights. They do so by failing to respect humane working hours, by not giving their employees a safe and healthy workplace and, in addition, by providing nothing like decent and reasonable remuneration. Again, the problems relating to child labour might also be cause for reflection.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the sports industry to be vigilant in tackling this unfortunate state of affairs, which it is greatly responsible for and party to, and we call on it to adopt and respect, as quickly as possible, a genuine code of good ethical conduct, aimed at increasing human dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We know that the production of sportswear and athletic footwear is organised through an elaborate international system of subcontractors. Therefore, the European Parliament today expresses the view that the issue of working conditions for employees, especially in the developing world, must be addressed by the Commission and the International Olympic Committee. Some leading sportswear manufacturers and socially responsible investment firms have also stated that the current ruthless business and labour practices in the global supply chain are unsustainable, lead to unfair competition and constitute an obstacle to sound enterprise.</p>

I would therefore appeal to yourself, Commissioner Nielson, and to the Commission to add to all your very many other tasks that of taking such action in respect of the International Olympic Committee and the business and sports sector and its subcontractors as to ensure that they recognise the ILO’s international labour standards and such action as to ensure that these labour standards are incorporated into the International Olympic Committee’s regulations.

That there is room for improvement here is not a matter of dispute. My belief is that we should concentrate on commending, and publicly encouraging, those who adhere to the ILO's rules. We should call them in front of the curtain and congratulate them on maintaining standards. We should be showing them how best practice works even in the least developed countries; such incentive systems would, I believe, be the best way in which we could help promote economic activity in these countries. We stress the importance of acknowledging and integrating the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, and also especially family firms as suppliers, and of encouraging that both internationally and globally by means of objective and proper invitations to tender. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It considers that more should be done to strengthen the social dimension of globalisation, and will contribute to the follow-up to the report recently presented by the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation established by the International Labour Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Olympic Games, the European Commission financially supports the implementation of the Charter of Intent adopted by the Organising Committee for the Winter Olympic Games in Turin in 2006. This sets out the organising committee's commitment to dealing with ethical, environmental and social issues and to reporting on the social impact of the activities and compliance with the ethical standards. This initiative could also be very relevant for the 2004 Summer Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission also contributes to the promotion of corporate social responsibility, workers' rights and decent work in the sports goods industry. It encourages the involvement and commitment of all actors, for example to combating the use of child labour in the production of FIFA-licensed sportswear and footballs.</p>
<p class="contents">A similar approach covering all core labour standards could be developed for the upcoming Olympic Games with relevant partners such as the global trade unions, broader civil society, the International Olympic Committee, the World Federation of Sporting Goods Industry, the different brands and companies and the ILO.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue its efforts to promote a more cohesive approach to harnessing globalisation, also tackling issues such as the application of fair rules in global supply and production chains.</p>

However, with the organisers of the Olympic Games having given up the ideals of amateurism and voluntarily buried themselves in the deep dark hole of big money, there is a limit to what we can expect from them in the sphere economic ethics. They represent just another case in which we could discuss corporate social responsibility. In my view they are not a special case. They lost their innocence ages ago. The real problem is so huge that we must dig deep into our resources to continue the broader general struggle of ensuring decency triumphs in a world capable of producing child labour, etc. – with or without the Olympic Games. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a regional superpower and has made progress in terms of democracy, as well as contributing to vital peacekeeping military operations to settle regional conflicts. It is also a member of the ACP and the Commonwealth. I have many Nigerians living in London, my constituency.</p>
<p class="contents">Like a number of other countries with co-existing Muslim and Christian communities, such as Pakistan, Indonesia and Egypt, there have been periodic clashes. This most recent outburst of violence in the Nigerian state of Plateau is particularly troubling as not only has the violence been horrendous, but also there is evidence that Islamist extremists have been recruited from neighbouring Muslim countries, such as Chad and Niger, possibly with international Islamic terrorist connections.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, Nigeria is a country divided by ethnic and religious differences and every effort must be made by the government to build solidarity and social cohesion nationally. The introduction of Sharia law since 1999 has been particularly divisive and we have witnessed the imposition – although not yet carried out – of lapidation, or stoning to death sentences on women convicted of the so-called crime of adultery. It is only a matter of time before this issue resurfaces to disturb the consciences again of the western world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, I have personally called in this House for the expulsion of Nigeria from the Commonwealth in the event of such a barbaric punishment occurring. After all, the 1999 Nigerian Constitution guarantees total freedom of belief, and the country has signed international convenants on human rights. Therefore, I appeal to the federal and state authorities of this big African country to rapidly re-establish law and order, conduct a full investigation into the identity of the culprits and, in particular, where there has been outside provocation or infiltration, bring all those concerned speedily to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were present as guests along with the ACP conference when Mr Obasanjo 'replaced' the military set-up with a democratic system. Hope was strong and sincere. But since then thousands of people have died in ethnic conflicts and all manner of violent clashes. We were also in Kano, in the north, where a wonderful Islamic culture is flourishing and had the opportunity to compare this culture with that of other regions in the south. But this astonishing diversity of tribes, ethnic groups and cultures risks being submerged in severe armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Oil, which ought to be this large country's blessing, is in fact a curse because it is used mainly to buy arms and set up one power base against another. Smaller groups, like the Ogoni people, are at risk of becoming the victims of all this. I believe that we must take Nigeria seriously in the context of the ACP and that we must closely monitor what is happening in this large country, because it is a kind of Africa in miniature. I hope that the recommendations contained in our resolutions, focusing mainly on the danger of intolerance, the danger of Sharia law in those countries, stoning women and so on, are taken to heart because there is a risk that the whole situation could degenerate further if we are not much more closely engaged in dialogue, but also with strong sanctions if the rules are flouted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thousands dead, many tens of thousands fleeing, hundreds of churches burned, fear. The only thing the victims did wrong was to be Christians. These dreadful things are happening in central and northern Nigeria. The perpetrators are, once again, Muslim fundamentalists.

They must also take steps to put an end to this Islamic terrorism, by preventive action if necessary, and to abolish Sharia law in the twelve states where it has been introduced. If the government does not take firm action to deal with the violence, we would be justified in fearing that Nigeria could become the stage for a religious war.

<p class="contents">The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, which I have the honour of chairing, has repeatedly intervened and denounced the revival of religious hatred in Nigeria, especially against women, with the application of Islamic 'Sharia' law, which even makes provision for sentencing by stoning for adultery, over and above the laws and Constitution of Nigeria and also over and above the Cotonou Agreement and the clauses about respecting human rights and women's rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear, Commissioner, that the Nigerian Government either does not have the power or the political will to impose the 1999 Constitution and the laws on the country. Recent violence by fundamentalists and the outbreak of religious violence in the state of Plateau, which has cost 1 500 people their lives and destroyed 173 churches, is the culmination of a series of bloody events in which Islamic extremists are the protagonists.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the European Commission should exploit its powers and international standing to contribute more actively towards strengthening security, putting an end to the violence and promoting respect for religious tolerance and basic human rights in Nigeria. In other words, we need closer cooperation and pressure on the Nigerian Government and President Obasanjo so that the Constitution and laws are applied in the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This oil-producing country,<span class="bold"> </span>where the extreme wealth of a tiny minority contrasts with the extreme poverty of the population, is once again the scene of religious confrontations which, last month, caused 20 deaths when a village was attacked in the state of Plateau, a state principally inhabited by Christians.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time, this region has been plunged into a genuine conflict between Islamic and Christian fundamentalists. It is a conflict that has already killed more than 100 people in the region since February. These sad events once again show that poverty and the social divide, added together, constitute the ideal breeding ground for all fundamentalists.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Sharia law is practised in 11 northern states out of the 36 states of the Nigerian Federation. In order to react to the Islamic threat, governors of the South, where animists and Christians are in the majority, have created a forum for the Southern states. There are reports that in all areas, including in the institutions, mechanisms that could lead to a new explosion in the country are being put in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, faced with this spiral of violence affecting a battered population, we are anxious strongly to condemn any type of intolerance and religious violence. Since 1999, thousands of people have perished following inter-community confrontations. At the time, the detonator had been the introduction of Sharia law in several northern states.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore calling on the Nigerian Government to take the necessary measures and find a practical solution designed to bring this ethnic and religious violence to an end as soon as possible.

In contrast to Islam, which is a great world faith, Islamism is a criminal ideology, and a very clear distinction must be drawn between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be careful, though, not to consider these things from one angle alone. As we know, most of the states in West Africa are artificial creations drawn on the map by the colonial powers, so that peoples in the South are divided, two examples being the Ibo and the Ewe, who are Christians and animists and live on both sides of the border. The same can be said of the peoples of the North, the Hausa and Fulbe, most of whom are Muslims and also live in a variety of states. This simply happens to be the way these states’ borders were drawn; never, throughout history, have they corresponded with the ethnic realities. This is something that has to be clear to us, and this is something for which we Europeans really do share responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution quite rightly refers to the state of Plateau. It is in Plateau that these ethnic groups collide, and the situation is made even more acute by economic inequalities and migratory flows. The whole place is a highly unstable melting pot and could easily explode. It also has to be borne in mind that Nigeria is a multi-ethnic state, one of the most populous countries in the world and probably the most populous in Africa, and that there are massive oil interests at stake there, so it really does call for extremely sensitive handling and subtle thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">That notwithstanding, what I would like to say to Mrs André-Léonard<span class="bold"> </span>is that it is taking sophistry a bit too far to say that there is fundamentalism in both the Christian and Islamic camps. There is no Christian fundamentalism in Nigeria. There is no Islamic fundamentalism there either; there is, instead, on the one hand, this complex conflict situation, and, on the other, Islamist ideologues attempting to exploit it for their own ends. If we are to address this situation, we need sound knowledge of these countries’ history and ethnic make-up; only then will we be able to support the peace process and prevent Nigeria from disintegrating in a bloody war compared with which the carnage in the former Yugoslavia will seem trivial.</p>
<p class="contents">That, as has been said, is why our task is to get actively involved in the peace process, but to do so with precise knowledge of the realities of these countries, on which we can draw in our deliberations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation in Nigeria is extremely delicate, but is not unique. It is repeated elsewhere, in Sudan, for example, although this has not been sufficiently publicised in view of public attention on Iraq, where events are all the more unforgivable since they are occurring with the complicity of armed forces from the European Union. I feel that what we are seeing is a fanatical <span class="italic">sharia</span> regime gradually taking hold, in particular in Southern Iraq, in Basra to be specific. This is a regime in which Christians are persecuted, alcohol is banned, western clothes are banned and veils must be worn, and all of this is happening with the complicity of the British troops on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The real issue at the heart of the situation in Nigeria is Islamic fanaticism. This is more of an issue than the existence in the country of people of various ethnic backgrounds and beliefs, which is the case in most corners of the globe and is the result of the way in which history has unfolded. This problem must be combated, and we must not continue to play it down for the sake of short-term commercial interest or our oil-based diplomacy. This strikes me as the overriding message that we must convey to the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We caution against a simplistic analysis of the situation which focuses on just one area or religious group. The violence is often related to conflicts over access to resources or triggered by political tensions. In the case of Plateau State, the causes of violence are related to both these reasons and the perpetrators have come from both sides of the community. It is factually wrong to describe this as something driven only by Islamic fundamentalists.</p>
<p class="contents">For information, I would add that Plateau State is not a state which applies Sharia law, and it is not likely to because it has an overwhelming Christian majority composed of groups of indigenous people and settlers. In very many<span class="italic"> </span>cases, there is a sort of social clash between incomer settler groups and the original inhabitants – a version of a conflict that we see in very many<span class="italic"> </span>other places. The problem with understanding Nigeria is that there are several layers of problems, and each layer is normally enough to create a conflict. Therefore this complex situation is something we really have to respect in order to do something useful.</p>
<p class="contents">For the second time this afternoon I have to say that I agree with Mr Posselt's contribution. We have similar views on this situation. His reference to Yugoslavia is also very important because there we have assisted in a so-called solution which is contrary to what we, for very good reasons, find necessary for Africa, namely to avoid changing the geography. Even though we gave them nonsensical borders, Europe and others rightly agree with Africa itself that, as long as Africa does not want to change the borders, we definitely should not advise it to do that, even if it is difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Conflicts between communities in Nigeria have been evident for some time and we have been following the situation as part of the early warning system for conflict which the Commission is setting up. The Commission has also adapted its cooperation programme to reflect that situation. Support for human rights in Nigeria is a significant component of our cooperation strategy for the country. Nigeria was also selected as a focal country for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights to respond to precisely the sort of concerns raised by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Three projects were approved last year, including one with a Nigerian NGO working in Plateau State and Kaduna State to promote peace between Muslims and Christians. The project also covers improving the drafting and application of Sharia law in conformity with the guarantees of religious freedom provided in the Nigerian constitution as well as respect for the international conventions providing protection for human rights which the country has signed.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, reasonable co-existence between Sharia law and the constitution of Nigeria is an option. This is what the country is trying to organise. I mention this simply by way of a warning that we must not move blindly in one direction without really reflecting on the complexities involved.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, other conflicts relating to religious differences are very important and we should be careful not to overlook or marginalise these other aspects. If we fail to understand this, we will not be of much use in a dialogue aimed at stopping the conflicts. Social, economic and ethnic problems – all these other layers of problems I have mentioned – have to be given a proper place in the analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">At federal level the Commission is working with Member States to strengthen political dialogue with Nigeria. This dialogue is one of the instruments provided by the Cotonou Agreement and the Federal Government is participating actively in that dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adapted to the special realities of Nigeria, where the states play a powerful role, and in fact the bulk of our work relating to water and sanitation is being done in six of the 36 states that make up the Federal Republic of Nigeria. We have chosen the six states not on the basis of where it is easiest to work, but where need is greatest. Although, in so doing, we are inviting problems, this is the most meaningful way of working on matters that relate to the core of the problems underlying what we are discussing here this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">We share this House's call for the Federal Government to do everything in its power to protect its citizens, put an end to violence and promote respect of human rights, including of course freedom of religion. We hope that Parliament's adoption of a resolution which is balanced on this issue will be seen as meaningful encouragement along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As you are all aware high levels of external debt in many poor countries have resulted in debt service obligations that have consumed Government revenues and reduced critical public expenditure on essential basic services and social and economic infrastructure. The impact of debt on public expenditure programmes hits the poor in a number of ways that multiply its impact on them.</p>
<p>As stated in the Monterrey Consensus, agreed in March 2002 by the Heads of State and Government of the UN Members States, the EU recognises that sustainable debt financing is an important element for mobilising resources for public and private investment. The EU strongly supports the view that external debt relief can play a key role in liberating resources that can be redirected towards activities consistent with attaining poverty reduction, sustainable growth and development including in the health and education sectors of developing countries.</p>
<p>The Council would also remark that the EU objective remains to ensure that, within the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, the eligible countries can reach and maintain a sustainable level of debt in the long term, thus reinforcing their efforts to reduce poverty and promote growth. The EU is also examining ways of going beyond the current HIPC initiative.</p>
<p>The EU has also highlighted, as part of the HIPC review, the need to maintain and strengthen the link between debt relief and nationally owned and determined poverty reduction strategies comprised of a range of policies aimed at improved social programmes, good governance and widely shared economic growth. In our dialogue with developing countries, we have strongly advocated that these strategies should be clearly linked to the agreed international development goals, with measurable indicators and progress such as in the areas of health and education.</p>
<p>On the wider question of debt relief, the Council would remark that the HIPC initiative has provided significant levels of debt relief for many poor countries. It has not, however, provided the “sustainable exit” from the debt treadmill that had been envisaged. The failure to treat the poverty status of indebted countries and the vulnerability of their economies to the effects of external shocks was a major factor in the limited impact of the initiative. The fact that, in some cases, the relief provided was financed by existing ODA and not from additional resources from donors also reduced the net benefits to HIPCs.</p>
<p>You will be aware that the EU has argued that in future reviews of debt sustainability, account should be taken of the impact of debt relief on progress towards the achievement of the development goals of the Millennium Declaration, especially in the fields of health and education.</p>
<p>EU member states have provided significant relief of bilateral debt owed by developing countries and have also financed the relief of multilateral debt through the HIPC trust fund and through separate initiatives. If the substantial resources we have provided are to be effective in achieving the desired objectives, further initiatives will be necessary including measures that address the way that loan financing of development is administered and how this impacts on debt sustainability.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0148"></a>

<p>1.	The GAERC at its meeting in June 2003 invited the Commission, with the contribution, where appropriate, of the High Representative, to present from 2004 onwards detailed proposals on Action Plans for all countries concerned as appropriate commencing with Ukraine and Moldova to the east and those Mediterranean Partners with whom the EU had association agreements in force (i.e. Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, Israel). It was subsequently decided to include the Palestinian Authority in this first wave. First technical consultations with some partner countries were held in January-February 2004. The Commission services have elaborated working documents on possible elements for the Action Plans.</p>
<p>2.	Coreper on 10 March 2004 discussed guiding principles for the establishment of Action Plans and tasked competent Working Groups to look at the working documents. The Working Groups produced a joint paper summarising the views of Member States. This was considered at Coreper on 1 April 2004.</p>
<p>These discussions and their results provide part of the basis on which the Commission will work up and adopt its proposals for Action Plans, which will then be submitted to the Council for further discussion. In the meantime further consultations with partner countries are being held as appropriate. It is currently intended that Coreper should consider the Commission's overall strategy in mid May and decide then whether the draft Action Plans should be approved by the Council in June 2004 or deferred for consideration until the following month.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0153"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council recalls to the Honourable Parliamentarian that the EU’s approach to Conflict Prevention is set out in the “EU Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts” which was adopted by the European Council in Gothenburg in June 2001. Conflict Prevention also lies at the heart of the European Security Strategy adopted by the European Council last December.</p>
<p>The Presidency has identified conflict prevention as a priority for the first semester of 2004. The focus for work is the EU Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts, and the Presidency will be submitting a report on the implementation of this Programme to the June 2004 European Council. Work in this area is being brought forward by the Presidency across a range of issues, one of which relates to improved cooperation with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). This is set out clearly as an objective in the Presidency’s work programme.</p>
<p>In this context, and in association with the European Centre for Conflict Prevention (ECCP), the Presidency hosted a working level conference in Dublin from 31 March to 2 April, which was attended by representatives of NGOs and civil society. The objective of this conference was to examine how cooperation between the EU and NGOs can be developed and enhanced and to make concrete proposals for further work in this area. Another objective of the Conference was to reinforce EU action in conflict prevention by focussing on the EU's recognition of the role of NGOs / civil society.</p>
<p>The conference was opened by my colleague, Mr. Tom Kitt, Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Overseas Development. Key-note addresses were delivered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Brian Cowen, by the South African Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Zuma, and by the Foreign Minister of Mozambique, and Chair-in-Office of the African Union, Mr. Simao.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0156"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council invites the Honourable Parliamentarians to refer to the statement of the Presidency on behalf of the Council on 11 February 2004, regarding the progress made in the implementation of the Tampere agenda. In that statement, the Presidency underlined the measures taken to date, and the proposals under consideration, in the framework of the Council, in the areas of asylum, legal migration and in combating illegal immigration.</p>
<p>With regard to the establishment of a Common European Asylum System, it must be acknowledged that a significant number of measures have already been adopted by the Council. As regards the Qualification Directive specifically, the Council, at its meeting on 30 March 2004, reached an agreement on this key element of a Common European Asylum System. The Council recalls that the main aim of this Directive is, on the one hand, to ensure that Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of protection and, on the other hand, to ensure that a minimum level of benefits is available for these persons in all Member States. The Council has instructed its preparatory bodies to finalise the text in order to adopt it before 1 May 2004.</p>
<p>With regard to the Asylum Procedures Directive, which is intended to provide for "minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status" a number of key issues, remain outstanding. They are concerned with provisions relating to safe third countries and safe countries of origin and appeals procedures. Under this Presidency, other key outstanding issues relating to the scope of the Directive, the personal interview and legal assistance have been resolved.</p>
<p>The JHA Council on 30 March 2004 held an orientation debate on the main outstanding issues of this proposal. Following the debate, the Council instructed its preparatory bodies to continue work on the proposal with a view to reaching an agreement within the time-limit set by the Amsterdam Treaty (1 May 2004).</p>
<p>The Council is of the view therefore that, although further steps are still necessary, considerable work has been achieved towards the completion of the objectives defined in Tampere.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0162"></a>

<p>(EN) The treaty does not provide for permanent seats for any Member State on the ECB Executive Board. Article 112 of the treaty provides indeed that in order to be nominated to the ECB Executive Board, the candidates must be persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters and nationals of Member States.</p>
<p>The procedure for nomination is by common accord of Heads of State or Government of euro Member States on the basis of a recommendation of the (Ecofin) Council. The European Parliament has to be consulted beforehand on the recommended candidate and in that framework hearings of such recommended candidates by its competent Committee have been organised in the past. The European Central Bank must also be consulted prior to the final decision by the Heads of State or Government.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 2 May 1998, which the first appointments to the Executive Board of the ECB were agreed, the Heads of State and Government reaffirmed the Treaty requirement to make appointments from persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters, and the roles of the European Parliament and the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. They also undertook to give appropriate weight and appropriate consideration, according to a balanced principle of rotation, in their future decisions under Article 109 a (2), to the recommendations for nationals of Member States which do not provide members of the Executive Board appointed in accordance with Article 50 of the ECB Statute.</p>

<p>(EN) The Council recalls that the EU Strategy Against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, which was adopted by the European Council on 12 December 2003 defines as one of its objectives increasing the physical security of nuclear material and other radioactive substances. Measures designed to achieve that objective will, at the same time, contribute to the prevention of potential acts of nuclear (and radiological) terrorism.</p>
<p>Possibilities to support the activities undertaken in the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear security action plan are currently under discussion in relevant Council fora. This could lead to the financing of projects aimed at strengthening the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities, securing/dismantling radio-active sources in non-nuclear applications (i.e. for agricultural, industrial and medical purposes), and, combating the illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and radioactive substances. The projects would be implemented by the IAEA in selected countries which are in need of such assistance, e.g. those which are part of the wider neighbourhood of the EU.</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, the EU is carrying out démarches to third countries with the objective of encouraging them to apply the most recent standards set by the IAEA concerning the safety and security of highly radioactive sources.</p>
<p>The European Council, in its conclusions of 25 March 2004, welcomed the political commitment of the Member States and of the acceding States, taken as of now, to act jointly against terrorists acts, in the spirit of the Solidarity Clause contained in Article 42 of the draft Constitution for Europe.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council invites the Honourable Parliamentarian to refer to the European Council declaration on combating terrorism, adopted on the same day, in which the Union and the Member States pledge to do everything within their power to combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with the fundamental principles of the Union, the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and the obligations set out under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001).</p>
<p>As part of the declaration, among the European Union strategic objectives to combat terrorism, figures out the deepening of the international consensus and the enhancing of international efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
<p>This objective includes, inter alia, to work to ensure universal adherence to, and full implementation of, the United Nations Conventions on Terrorism, and to agree a Comprehensive UN Convention against Terrorism as well as a comprehensive UN Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0171"></a>

<p>On 12 September and 20 September 2001, the General Affairs Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council respectively, adopted packages of specific measures to step up the fight against terrorism within the EU in the fields of judicial co-operation, police and intelligence cooperation, the financing of terrorism, borders and air transport etc. Following the terrorist attack in Spain, the President-in-Office of the EU, the Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, stressed the need to ascertain to what extent those measures had been taken on board and implemented by the Member States.</p>

<p>(EN) At its meeting of 25/26 March 2004 the European Council adopted a Declaration on Combating Terrorism.</p>
<p>The Declaration stresses the decisive role that the legislative framework created by the European Union for the purpose of combating terrorism and improving judicial cooperation has to play in combating terrorist activities. The European Council has urged the Member States to take any measures that remain necessary to fully implement, by June 2004, certain legislative measures that were adopted in this field. Among the measures listed are the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant, the Framework Decision on Joint investigation Teams and the Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism. Member States are also called upon to ratify the three protocols to the Europol Convention by December 2004.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council was instructed to examine measures such as the retention of communication traffic data by service providers and exchanges of information on convictions for terrorist offences with a view to adoption by June 2005.</p>
<p>The European Council also emphasised the need for measures in the field of border controls and document security such as incorporation of biometric features into passports and visas and the creation of an integrated system for the exchange of information on stolen and lost passports having recourse to the SIS and Interpol database.</p>
<p>The position of a co-ordinator on terrorism was also established. The co-ordinator, Mr. Gjis de Vries, commenced work on 29 March 2004 and appeared before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Freedom and Security on 6 April 2004.</p>
<p>The Taoiseach Mr Bertie Ahern, addressed this Parliament on Wednesday 31 March 2004 in regard to the outcome of the meeting of the European Council. He stressed that the Union was united in its determination to face down the threat of terrorism and that a report on progress made in the implementation of the measures in the Declaration would be made to the European Council in June.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0177"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council, mandated by the European Council in December 2003, has together with the Commission, drawn up an assessment report on all aspects of the Union's relationship with Russia.</p>
<p>One of the main conclusions of this assessment was that the EU needs to emphasise the importance of the respect for shared values for the EU-Russia relationship. The European Council, at its meeting in Brussels on 25/26 March 2004, reaffirmed the Union's strong and genuine interest in an open, stable and democratic Russia. In this respect it welcomed President Putin's stated commitment to build up and strengthen a multiparty system, to develop civil society and to make every effort to ensure freedom of the press.</p>
<p>Such a statement had already been made in the Presidency declaration on the Presidential elections in Russia of 17 March this year, the EU welcomed the preliminary findings of the OSCE/ODIHR international electoral observation mission on the Presidential elections in Russia. The EU noted however, that these findings stated that the State-controlled media displayed a clear bias in favour of the incumbent and that the authorities failed to attempt to rectify this situation during the campaign.</p>
<p>The Council intends accordingly to follow the development of media freedom in Russia closely as part of its comprehensive political dialogue with this strategic partner. The Council would point out that the EU-Russia Permanent Partnership Council will meet on 27 April with a view to agreeing upon the provisional agenda for the forthcoming EU/Russia summit. In consequence it would be premature at this point to comment in advance this provisional agenda. Nevertheless the Council underlines that it intends to take this issue seriously.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0179"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU is firmly committed to Afghanistan's development and reconstruction and remains one of the leading donors. At the Tokyo Conference in January 2002, the Commission and EU Member States pledged more than 2.1 billion € in support of the reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. These promises have not only been fulfilled, but disbursements are actually higher than the initial pledges. Taking into account the most recent indicative figures for 2004, Commission and EU Member States have committed more than 2.3 billion € since Tokyo.</p>
<p>At the recent International Conference on Afghanistan in Berlin, 31 March - 1 April 2004, Commission and EU Member States pledged to provide approximately 700 million € to Afghanistan in 2004. This pledge is a signal of the strong commitment of the EU to the future political stability and development of Afghanistan. The total amount pledged at the conference was 6,75 billion € over a three year period.</p>
<p>President Karzai announced at the conference that elections will be held in September 2004. € 30 million of the EU pledge will be allocated to support the election process, following the Commission’s announcement on 2 March that it was increasing its support for electoral registration by € 8 million to € 15 million.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as the Honourable Member of Parliament rightly points out, tackling the drugs trade remains one of Afghanistan's greatest challenges. Afghanistan will return to peace and prosperity only if the drugs trade is eliminated. The drugs economy in Afghanistan cannot be treated separately from efforts to restore security and improve governance. The EU fully supports the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy. It is vital that the international community and the Afghan people work together to achieve success. The Council welcomes and fully supports the Berlin Declaration on Counter-Narcotics, signed on 1 April 2004 by Afghanistan and all neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>There are no overnight solutions. No single project can address the variety of factors that influence farmers to grow poppy crops. We need a range of different interventions to promote alternative livelihoods for farmers. We must improve the size and co-ordination of our interventions.</p>
<p>Equally important are investments to build up the effectiveness of the drug enforcement effort. But it is clear that more needs to be done and faster if we are to see sustainable reductions in opium levels in the short to medium term.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0183"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council would like to emphasise at first that it is of course for the institutions and citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina themselves to change their country's constitution should they wish.</p>
<p>Methods for constitutional change are defined by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Constitution (Annex 4 of the General Framework Agreement for Peace) itself. Providing the legal means to change the Constitution is one of the strengths of the Dayton Peace Agreement. We have already witnessed constitutional change in this regard. Last year Bosnia-Herzegovina's Parliament chose to change their own constitution in order to comply with EU and NATO (Partnership for Peace) requirements through expert commissions, led by international experts but staffed by Bosnia-Herzegovina experts, which were established by the High Representative and EU Special Representative, Paddy Ashdown.</p>
<p>These constitutional changes demonstrate that the people, politicians and institutions of Bosnia-Herzegovina are prepared to support even the most difficult reforms if they clearly help to achieve Bosnia-Herzegovina's ambitions for integration into Euro-Atlantic structures.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to support EU Special Representative Ashdown in his strategy of replacing the push of the Dayton powers with the pull of European integration as the key driver of reform in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0187"></a>

<p>(EN) The framework for the introduction of International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS) into European legislation is set by Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which - for the adoption of individual standards - provides for the "Comitology" procedure leading to Commission regulations.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member of Parliament is fully aware, the International Accounting Standard 32 (IAS 32) had been excluded from the adoption of the majority of IAS by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1725/2003 of 29 September 2003,<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> awaiting a revision of IAS 32 (among other standards) by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).</p>
<p>The IASB finished its revision work in December 2003 and published the revised IAS 32 shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>The classification of co-operative share capital as pointed out by the Honourable Member in her question is one of the central points, but not the only issue where the Accounting Regulatory Committee is currently examining carefully whether the revised standard is fully satisfactory in the European context. In this regard, however, it seems to be useful to mention the possibility of interpretations of international accounting standards or similar guidance issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).</p>
<p>Given the clear distribution of competencies and the fact that the work in the Accounting Regulatory Committee is ongoing, the Council is at this stage not in a position to express any views on the outcome of this process and the time-frame within which the remaining open questions will be solved.</p>
<p>However, the Council can take the opportunity of pointing out that, when considering the approval of a single IAS or a set of IAS, all relevant parties are bound by Regulation No. 1606/2002, which clearly states that international accounting standards can only be adopted within the European Union, if they are - among other criteria- conducive to the European public good.</p>
<p>It should furthermore be noted that the Council is not in a position to comment on any decisions taken by authorities from third countries when deciding on the coherence of their own existing systems with the work of the fully independent body IASB.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Depending on how liberal these national measures are, they may or may not result in full access to labour markets. However, under the "standstill clause", the present Member States cannot make access to their labour markets more restrictive than it was on the date of signature of the Accession Treaty, on 16 April 2003.</p>
<p>The present Member States may continue to apply such measures until the end of a five-year period following the date of accession, subject to notification to the Commission by those Member States concerned no later than at the end of the two-year period following the date of accession.

As for the dissemination of information, as the Honourable Member is certainly aware, it will be up to the Commission to ensure the necessary transparency of the applicable rules.

<p>The petition concerns the failure of the Irish Government adequately to redress the hardship caused by the overnight deregulation of the taxi industry, which resulted in a dramatic drop in the value of taxi licences (from 105.000 to 5.000 Irish punts) and left many such families with a massive negative equity/debt burden.</p>
<p>The delegation from the Committee on Petitions found that the measures taken by the Irish Government, such as the setting up of a 'Tax Hardship Panel', had not fully respected the individual rights of the families concerned, as it refused to conduct assessments on a case-by-case basis, and the delegation made a number of specific recommendations.

<p>(EN) The Commission’s Communication on Health and Poverty Reduction in developing countries sets out a comprehensive set of policies and strategies for improving the health outcomes of poor people in developing countries and hence achieving the Millennium Development Goals that relate to health. It aims specifically to help developing countries to develop dynamic, responsive and sustainable health systems that are capable of responding effectively to the myriad of health and health-related challenges that they face.</p>
<p>In order to achieve its aims the Commission is working to make the delivery of EC’s aid as effective as possible. To this end it is cooperating closely with the Member States and other donors to strengthen the harmonisation of policies and aid modalities for better health outcomes, with a particular focus on the development of sector wide approaches in health.</p>
<p>The Commission chose to highlight certain poverty-related diseases – notably HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis – as being of high priority to us, because of the particular severity of the threat they pose to global health and the potential added value of certain Community actions in the fight against them. It does not intend to develop further specific initiatives related to the fight against particular diseases or conditions, except in certain very special cases such as the global campaign to eradicate polio.</p>
<p>In general, it believes that better health in developing countries will be best achieved and sustained through the provision of general or sector budget support linked to strong policy dialogue with the country concerned. This will be aimed both at providing flexible support for strong and responsive health systems, and at ensuring adequate investment in other sectors which impact on health, such as water and sanitation, education, and so on.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0190"></a>

<p>In the last two years, the European Parliament has voted in favour of appropriations intended to finance pilot projects to combat poverty-related diseases other than HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis (EU Budget 2003 – € 1 million, EU Budget 2004 – € 3 million). In spite of the commitment made by the international community in 2000 to reduce by two thirds the mortality rate among children under five by 2015 (Millennium Development Goal number 4), UNICEF report that in 2003 a quarter of the world’s children still had no protection from vaccine-preventable diseases. At a time when epidemics spread faster and further than before, health interdependence between different regions of the world has deepened, and immunisation in one country can be the key to reduction of disease in others.</p>
<p>In light of this worrying situation, does the European Commission intend to renew and expand these appropriations in the preliminary draft budget for 2005 and beyond?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has provided €4 million to the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) through grants made under the provisions of the special budget line for poverty diseases other than HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The funding was provided as a pilot project in 2003 and 2004. There is no legal basis for this budget line and the budgetary rules do not allow for provision of any further funding in 2005 or 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission is, however, currently negotiating with relevant parties a package of support for a number of African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries for the global polio eradication initiative. This is a special situation where the global community is aiming to eradicate a specific disease, and achievement of high immunisation rates in all countries at the same time is particularly important.</p>
<p>In the long term the Commission believes that the only way to ensure continued high rates of protection against vaccine-preventable diseases will be through the development of sustainable programmes for childhood immunisation by developing countries themselves, as an element of a comprehensive package of interventions for the prevention and treatment of childhood illness.</p>
<p>In this context, the aim is to move to providing support for the health sector as a whole rather than for specific health projects. Where such a sector wide approach is in place the Commission highlights the importance of immunisation in its dialogue with national authorities. In those ACP countries where the Commission is providing general budget support, immunisation coverage rates are frequently selected as one of the performance indicators in the health sector for determining the size of the variable tranche.</p>
<p>Positive results are being seen from this approach. For example, in Mozambique, where the Commission is providing both general budget support and sector support, a national household survey last year found that immunisation coverage improved significantly for all childhood vaccines compared to 1997. Infant mortality fell from 149 to 101 per 1000 live births over the same period, which is a truly remarkable achievement.</p>

<p>(EN) There are very strict and well established mechanisms put in place by ECHO (the service of the European Commission responsible for humanitarian aid) in order to ensure that the aid delivered by its partner organisations actually reaches the intended beneficiaries. Partners work on the basis of a list of beneficiaries, which is established after an assessment of the household's economy and needs. The aid is delivered directly to these beneficiaries, without intermediary, which allows the Commission to ensure that the people who are on the lists do receive what they are entitled to.</p>
<p>In Chechnya ECHO continues to assist the most vulnerable people as much as access and security will allow. Due to lack of security, the population in the south parts of Chechnya is certainly less covered by ECHO assistance.</p>
<p>ECHO, through its implementing partners, continues to support and deliver humanitarian aid in Ingushetia (through water &amp; sanitation, temporary shelter, educational and protection activities as well as psychological and medical care provided to the Chechen Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) living in tented camps, in spontaneous settlements or in private accommodation). ECHO also finances the distribution of food aid to Chechen IDPs in Dagestan.</p>
<p>Despite the significantly increased pressure on IDPs to return to Chechnya, with the closure of four more tented camps in the last few months, and the fact that Non-Governmental Organizations experience many problems in obtaining the authorisation to build decent alternative shelter for those who do not want to return to Chechnya, the protection of Chechen IDPs in Ingushetia remains an issue of great concern to the EC.

<p>(EN) Globalisation creates opportunities for sustained economic growth and the development of the world economy but also challenges for sustainable development. Global market liberalisation has a key role to play in supporting the integration of developing countries into the world economy. However, the Commission recognises that the process of adjustment in the short-term can impose social costs in certain countries and sectors, in terms of unemployment and wage losses. The liberalisation of product, capital and labour markets results in changing economic structures, relative prices and consumption patterns. There exists the risk that competitive advantage will be sought through an artificial reduction of costs, for example, through the erosion of labour and environmental standards, or through protectionism. One should also recognise that globalisation could have negative impacts on the environment in as far as it increases pressure on natural resources and the environment in general.</p>
<p>The challenge is to manage the process of globalisation, in order to maximise its benefits, mitigate the social costs of adjustment and tackle its environmental impacts.</p>
<p>On 24 February 2004, the Commission welcomed the final report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation. The Commission believes that the EU should seek to reinforce global governance through an integrated, multi-disciplinary approach, while rejecting protectionist reactions. It will carefully analyse the recommendations and proposals made in the report of the World Commission, and is currently preparing a Communication on the social dimension of globalisation, as a contribution to the follow-up process on the report.</p>
<p>Independently, the Commission has, in its 2001 Communication, Promoting Core Labour Standards and Improving Social Governance in the Context of Globalisation<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, already set out its approach to globalisation and social development. Finally, and more recently, the Commission also issued a communication on the follow-up to the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. It takes stock of EU action to promote sustainable development both within the EU and at the global level, including what are the initiatives taken at EU level to reinforce synergies between trade and sustainable development<a href="#defann_28_2" name="refann_28_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission is a strong advocate of the protection of core labour rights and promotion of environmental standards at all levels. In its view, this should not play against the comparative advantages of Developing Countries and more efforts should be done to help DCs benefit from additional market access on products where they have such a comparative advantage, including environmentally friendly products. In order to achieve a sustainable development, there is a need to address trade, investment, growth, social development and environmental protection in an integrated and mutually supportive manner, while avoiding any abuse of the linkages between these issues for protectionist purposes,</p>
<p>The EU has in place a number of positive policies to promote sustainable development. With respect to trade, the EU Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) provides market access on a preferential basis to developing countries. The current GSP scheme provides a positive social and environmental incentive scheme, whereby compliance with core labour standards or internationally acknowledged environmental standards qualifies a beneficiary country for additional trade preferences. The scheme also allows for a temporary withdrawal of preferences, where beneficiary countries incur a serious or systematic violation of any standards referred to in the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at work, such as, for example, any form of slavery or forced labour.</p>
<p>By promoting Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) the Commission seeks to encourage business to focus not only on economic development, but on the social and environmental impacts of its activities. In a development context this can have a dramatic impact on improving working conditions, eliminating poverty and better addressing associated environmental impacts, as duly recognised in the World Summit on Sustainable Development’s (WSSD) Plan of implementation. The Commission has taken a number of initiatives to promote CSR globally. It established a European Multi-Stakeholder Forum on CSR to facilitate exchange of experience and explore the need for a common approach and guiding principles for CSR. The Commission also actively supports key global CSR instruments, notably the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These contain voluntary principles and standards for responsible business conduct in a wide range of areas of company activity. The Commission increasingly aims to build references to the Guidelines and other international CSR instruments into agreements with third countries (eg EU-Chile Association Agreement; and the agreement under negotiation with Mercosur). At the same time, the Commission recognises that further efforts are needed to improve transparency and accountability of CSR initiatives.</p>
<p>The “Fair Trade” movement can make a genuine contribution to sustainable development and poverty reduction, and the EU is supportive of such efforts, in particular, through awareness-raising projects. However, Fair Trade remains a niche market, and our recognition of its benefits for a small minority of traders should not diminish the Commission’s effort to help developing countries to get the most out of trade in general. The Commission is working towards better mainstreaming of trade issues into development policies and, more generally, helping Developing Countries move towards a sustainable development, through combined technical assistance efforts, notably in the trade, economic, social development and environmental field. . In the framework of Community Development Cooperation Policy, the EC is also addressing the constraints and challenges which globalisation poses for developing countries in different areas, including by focussing on social development and economic reforms.</p>
<p>In 1999, the Commission introduced the policy of Sustainability Impact Assessment for every major trade negotiation in which the EU is involved. The main purpose of Sustainability Impact Assessment is to assess the economic, social and environmental impacts of trade liberalisation, with a view to better addressing the linkages between the different pillars of Sustainable development and helping policy-makers design the policy mix to mitigate the negative impacts of trade liberalisation, and to enhance the positive impacts. A key aspect of the Sustainability Impact Assessment process is the consultation of stakeholders in civil society. The Commission is currently conducting a review of the methodology for Sustainability Impact Assessment, in order to improve the quality of assessments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>One of the Commission’s most important priorities for 2004 and 2005 is the review of regional State Aid control rules for the period after 2006.

<p>As far as low population density areas are concerned, no substantial change as compared to the present situation is envisaged at this stage of reflection. Low population density areas are likely to continue to be eligible for regional aid, including aid to offset additional transport costs that affect the economic activity in the regions concerned.

Nevertheless, Protocol 8 to the Accession Treaty on the restructuring of the Polish steel industry sets out a maximum amount of aid which must be strictly respected.

<p>As regards the Czech steel company Trinecke Zelezarny, the Czech Minister of Trade and Industry has confirmed that his government will meet all the obligations arising from the Accession Treaty and that the proposed measures would be in line with the State aid acquis. He explained that the measures would only be implemented upon a positive decision of the Czech Competition Office issued after consultation with the Commission. Technical meetings with the Czech authorities in order to clarify whether State aid in favour of the company is in compliance with EU rules are ongoing.</p>
<p>In the case of US Steel Kosice, the Commission is carefully monitoring the respect of the commitments undertaken by the Slovak Republic in the Accession Treaty. Following intensive discussions between the Commission and the Slovak authorities clarifying a number of issues in connection with this monitoring, in particular concerning production levels, the Slovak Republic has presented a formal proposal to the Commission to significantly reduce the level of State aid available to the company in question.

<p>On a number of occasions, the European Parliament has expressed its wish that the Council should appoint a special representative for Tibet. The budget appropriations for such a post have been allocated twice. The EU already has special representatives for Macedonia, the Middle East, the Southern Caucasus, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, as well as a special envoy for the Great Lakes region of Africa. As in these cases, a special EU representative for Tibet would be able to actively promote a peaceful resolution of the conflict, inter alia by supporting the dialogue which has been in progress for more than a year between representatives of the Beijing government and of the Dalai Lama. The fear expressed in a reply to a similar question by Mr Newton Dunn (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0828_EN.html">H-0828/03</a>) in January 2004<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> that a special EU representative would be able neither to visit Tibet nor to meet representatives of the Beijing government has not been substantiated in any way.</p>
<p>Why will the Commission not heed the European Parliament's clearly expressed wish in this case and appoint a special EU representative for Tibet, as has been done for seven other regions of conflict in Europe, Africa and Asia?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission, while not opposing in principle the concept of Special Representative for Tibet, must express doubts as to whether the appointment of such a Representative would bring any added value to the present situation where regular channels of communication already exist between China and the EU, notably within the EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights. It also wonders whether such a Representative could positively contribute to the fragile process now underway between Beijing and the Representatives of the Dalai-Lama (something which the EU has encouraged over the years).</p>
<p>Moreover, as mentioned in several instances, the Commission takes the view that a Special Representative would most likely be prevented by China from playing an effective role on the ground. In this respect, it appears that, while she has already been three times to China, the US Special Co-ordinator for Tibetan Affairs has thus far not been granted a visa to Tibet.</p>
<p>Finally, as already explained to the Parliament during the 2003 budget procedure, the Commission would like to underline that it is not up to the Commission to decide on the appointment of a Special Representative for Tibet. According to Article 18(5) of the Treaty on the European Union such a decision belongs to the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

As the Commission made clear in its report to the Spring Council in January 2004<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, this programme is only partially implemented at the Community level. Member States have a very large responsibility for implementing these commitments, and “numerous reforms and investments, which are the responsibility of the Member States, have yet to be achieved.</p>
<p>Specific Community level support to regions is offered under EU cohesion policy. In Ireland, specific attention is devoted to the Border, Midland and Western region which, until 2006, is eligible for Objective 1 of the Structural Funds. As such it has been allocated €195 per head per year for the 2000-2006 period (1999 prices), for measures designed to improve competitiveness. Since the mid-1990s, the Border, Midland and Western region has experienced the second highest growth rate of all equivalent regions in the current Member States.</p>
<p>In addition, the whole of Ireland was eligible for support under the Cohesion Fund (until 1 January 2004), which allocated €556 million to the Member State as a whole, for projects in the fields of transport infrastructure and the environment.</p>
<p>For the next period after 2006, the Commission has presented new proposals for the reform of cohesion policy in the Third Report on economic and social cohesion<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Under the Commission’s proposals for the reform of cohesion policy, the Border, Midland and Western region would be eligible for support under a new generation of Regional competitiveness and employment programmes.</p>
<p>The new programmes would seek to consolidate the achievements of the current period, with an emphasis on investment in innovation and the knowledge-based economy, accessibility and the environment and risk prevention.

<p>Commission Protection: the Commission has amended its internal rules by a Commission decision (C/2001/3031 of 29 November 2001) to complement these rules by security provisions. This decision complements the decision (C1995/1510) already taken.</p>
<p>Data protection within the Institutions: The Commission is implementing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data.</p>
<p>As proposed by the Commission, Directive 2002/58/EC of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector was adopted by the Council and the Parliament.</p>
<p>The establishment of a European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA): the Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 establishing ENISA entered into force on 14th March 2004. The ENISA budget amounts to € 33,3 million (EU 25) for the period 2004-2008. The Commission is actively preparing the establishment of the ENISA and it expects that the Management Board can be convoked for a first meeting in July 2004 and that the Executive Director will be nominated before the summer break.</p>
<p>Research: the effort made by the Commission continues. Following the 6 Research and Technological Development Framework Programme (FP) 1<span class="sup">st</span> call for proposals, 14 projects were selected in the area of network security for an amount of roughly € 70 million. The effort on cryptology in particular continues with the ECRYPT project, which follows on the 5<span class="sup">th</span> FP NESSIE project. A further call for proposals in this area will be made in 2005.</p>
<p>Preparatory action for security research: the Commission has launched this Preparatory Action in view of a full Security Research Programme as from 2007. Five priority missions have been identified in the Communication from the Commission with one in the area of network security aiming at “optimising security and protection of networked systems”. Another priority mission deals with the interoperability and integration of information and communication systems. Other priorities deal with situation awareness, protection against terrorism and crisis management. The first call was published on 31 March 2004 and work will start before the end of 2004.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0155"></a>

The Directorate-General for Agriculture is currently carrying out an extended impact assessment of its rural development policy for the purpose of preparing options and the legislative proposals for the future programming period.</p>
<p>The work on the new rural development Regulation is structured around the three main objectives for rural-development policies which were identified in Salzburg: increasing the competitiveness of agriculture, enhancing the environment and land management, and enhancing the quality of life and promoting diversification.</p>

BNFL needed to use best practice when sampling ground water and to develop an integrated monitoring programme. The current Sellafield contaminated land study was indicating that there was potentially significant contamination of ground water. Certain discharges were above proposed limits, and there were problems with the storage and handling of 'corroded and leaking magnox fuel'. The HM Nuclear Installations Inspectorate<a href="#defann_41_3" name="refann_41_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> raised many concerns and called on BNFL to adopt a management strategy 'for legacy wastes and residues, which are currently stored in ageing facilites on the Sellafield site'.</p>

<p>(EN) The reprocessing plant in Sellafield/Cumbria is a so-called “bulk handling facility”, in which the nuclear material is processed in loose form, such as liquid or powder. Generally, in such facilities measurement uncertainties and particular features of the process lead to differences between the book inventory and the physical inventory. An inventory difference does not hence correspond automatically to a physical removal of nuclear material.</p>
<p>The Commission evaluates these differences for all bulk handling facilities of the EU and seeks for explanations whenever necessary. According to the information available to the Commission and based on its evaluations it was concluded that there was no evidence that Plutonium was diverted from the intended use in the mentioned facility.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concern expressed by HM’s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) as to the situation regarding the storage of Magnox fuel, legacy wastes and residues and welcomes and supports the initiatives taken by the NII in this context.</p>
<p>The Commission issued on 30 March 2004 a Directive calling upon the United Kingdom Government to ensure that all measures be taken by BNFL in Sellafield, in order to bring a long lasting infringement (legacy from the 1950’s) to the safeguards provisions to an end. The Directive imposes on the United Kingdom the obligation to submit to the Commission, before 1<span class="sup">st</span> June 2004, a comprehensive plan in order to bring such infringement to an end. Furthermore, the United Kingdom should present to the Commission every 6 months a progress report on its implementation. On the basis of these reports and its own verifications, the Commission will assess the compliance of the United Kingdom with the obligations set out in the directive.</p>
<p>The Commission continues inspecting the Sellafield site under the provisions of both chapter VII and chapter III of the Euratom Treaty. With regard to the need of verifying the level of radioactivity in the air, water and soil in accordance with the provisions of Article 35 of this Treaty, a verification has taken place during the week from 8 to 12 March 2004.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to recall that it has proposed a new set of measures (the so called "nuclear package") in order to provide the EU with a global community approach to nuclear safety and to reinforce security of supplies. These proposals address nuclear safety, decommissioning, waste management and trade with Russia. They aim at the implementation of common rules and monitoring mechanisms, which will guarantee an even application of the same criteria all over the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Swedish Customs has decided to close down a number of customs houses in Sweden on the grounds that the enlargement of the EU in 2004 will result in the disappearance of certain tasks in the import/export field and that this, in conjunction with significant financial losses, will necessarily entail redundancies.</p>
<p>This decision means that Swedish Customs is laying off staff and abandoning the permanent manning of the following ten arrival points in Sweden for travellers from outside the Schengen area and outside the EU itself: Gäddede, Gävle, Halmstad, Kalmar, Lidköping, Skavsta, Sturup, Visby, Vittjärn and Västerås. Several of these places have important and expanding airports (in particular Västerås and Stockholm Skavsta outside Nyköping), or major ports (e.g. Gävle, Västerås and Halmstad) or are responsible for guarding long sections of the border (e.g. Gäddede and Vittjärn).</p>
<p>With such an extensive reduction in Sweden's overseeing of its own and the Union's external borders, it is not difficult to see that there is a greater risk of an increase in the smuggling of drugs and arms and of illegal immigration into the EU as a whole.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by the Honourable Members about the problem of child pornography distributed through the Internet.</p>
<p>There is need for continuous efforts to combat harmful and illegal content on the Internet based on international co-operation amongst governments, particularly law enforcement and judicial authorities, but also between governments and the Internet industry, dedicated hotlines and non-governmental organisations to effectively tackle this horrifying phenomenon.</p>
<p>Primary responsibility for dealing with illegal content (including child pornography) is with the appropriate law enforcement and judicial authorities of the Member States of the EU, which co-operate internationally in the fight against child pornography on the Internet through the existing channels of communications, such as Europol and Interpol.</p>
<p>The EU has been a forerunner in the fight against illegal and harmful content since 1996, with an approach agreed unanimously by the Parliament and the Council. The Safer Internet Action Plan adopted by the Council and the Parliament in 1999<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is a major element in the Commission’s activity in this field. It provides funding for a European network of hotlines allowing users to report illegal content, including child pornography.</p>
<p>The EU strategy to combat child pornography also consists of legal instruments and practical measures against computer crime and child pornography. These include the Council Framework Decision on approximation of laws and sanctions in the field of sexual exploitation of children, with particular reference to child pornography on the Internet<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, and the Council Recommendation of September 1998 on the Protection of Minors and Human Dignity<a href="#defann_46_3" name="refann_46_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and the Council Decision of May 2000 to combat child pornography on the Internet<a href="#defann_46_4" name="refann_46_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>On 22 December 2003, the Council adopted the Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation and child pornography. As far as sexual exploitation is concerned the act aims first of all at penalising those, who bring children into prostitution or pornographic performances or who profit from such activities. But also those who engage in sexual activities with a child shall be punished, where, for example, the child was coerced or a payment was given for the child's sexual services or where a position of trust, authority or influence was abused.</p>
<p>Offences concerning child pornography concern a variety of acts such as the production, distribution, dissemination, transmission, supplying, acquisition or possession of the material concerned.</p>
<p>Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the sexual abuse of children and specific acts linked to child pornography are punishable by criminal penalties of at least between 1 and 3 years of imprisonment. Penalties of a maximum of at least between 5 and 10 years of imprisonment shall be introduced for offences committed in aggravated circumstances.</p>
<p>The Framework Decision requires higher penalties for a variety of cases involving children below the age of sexual consent. On the other hand, the Council was not able to agree on a common definition concerning the age of sexual consent and the Framework Decision simply refers to national law.</p>
<p>As an example the Commission would like to mention that at the beginning of this year, the final version of the “International Child Exploitation Database” feasibility study has been received, which has been co-funded under the STOP II Programme and run by a project group composed by experts from several Member States. The project group has issued various recommendations, especially recommending that a sophisticated networked international child sexual exploitation image database, building on the fledgling system at Interpol, be urgently required. Such a database, being both technically and legally possible, would have to take into account the different national laws governing images of child sexual exploitation and protection of personal data.</p>
<p>The Commission is not responsible for the actual setting up of such an international database as this is left to the appreciation of the EU Member States and other involved Countries. The Commission is currently supporting an effort made by several Member States, Europol and other third Countries under the AGIS programme for funding an implementation study as a concrete follow-up to the above mentioned feasibility study.</p>
<p>It aims at preparing the establishment of a sophisticated networked international database of child-pornography on-line images. The database will be an effective tool for law enforcement in identifying victims and offenders of child sexual exploitation on-line around the world. It will reduce the international duplication of effort and increase international co-operation in achieving these goals.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the proposed database will have a major impact on the effective policing of this horrendous crime by improving the exchange of information, reducing duplication and significantly raising the analytical capacity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The special European Council held on 21 September 2001 adopted an inter-disciplinary Plan of Action to Combat Terrorism. More recently, following the tragic terrorist attacks in Madrid, the European Council of 25 March adopted a Declaration on Combating Terrorism that calls for a number of future measures to enhance the fight against terrorism and for the effective implementation of existing instruments and optimum use of existing EU bodies. The European Council also agreed upon a number of updated Strategic Objectives to enhance the European Union Action to Combat Terrorism.</p>
<p>In a Commission paper on terrorism providing input for the European Council the Commission proposed various types of action that the Union could take in response to the attacks in Madrid. Amongst them was the need for a better implementation of existing legislative instruments relevant to the fight against terrorism and the adoption of draft measures already on the Council table. The Commission believes that the Union has already put in place a series of legislative measures to combat terrorism but that the implementation of such measures is often slow and inadequate. A Commission report on the implementation on the Framework Decision on money laundering and the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds of crime was adopted the 5 April. A report on the implementation of the Framework Decision on combating terrorism will follow.</p>
<p>As regards future measures, the Commission is proactively engaged in the identification of further actions within the Declaration that require particular attention and is also continuing its work on proposals that will provide added value to the fight against terrorism (e.g. a future Communication on the establishment of a European Information Policy for law enforcement authorities or a proposal for the establishment of an European Register on convictions and disqualifications). In line with this, the Commission has just adopted a Communication on measures to be taken to combat terrorism and other forms of serious crime, in particular to improve exchanges of information, accompanied by a Proposal for a Council Decision on the exchange of information and cooperation concerning terrorist offences.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0174"></a>

<p>(EN) Media freedom is a defining characteristic of functioning democracies and is a key element underpinning the EU/Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.</p>
<p>For several years, the Commission has been concerned that media freedom has been undermined in Russia. These concerns have been raised repeatedly in political dialogue with the Russian authorities. The EU has also made several declarations of concern. Unfortunately, the most recent events, including the refusal of Russia to provide a visa for an EU foreign correspondent, have not been encouraging. In particular, international observation missions of the Office of Democratic Institution and Human Rights (ODIHR) reported that both the Duma and Presidential elections failed to meet Organisation on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) commitments concerning access to state controlled media.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken good note of the recent statement of President Putin that he will ensure media freedom, which it welcomes.</p>
<p>One observation is that a free media cannot be created overnight, but that the Commission expect the Russian authorities to put in place the right conditions to foster media freedom. The Commission, for its part, will continue to support the development of an independent and pluralistic media in Russia, for example via projects funded by the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights and Tacis.</p>
<p>The Commission firmly believes that the EU should hold open and frank dialogue with Russia on the values to which Russia is committed as a member of the OSCE and Council of Europe, such as respect for human rights and media freedom. It is ready to do so, and will closely follow developments in Russia, including the implementation in practice of President Putin’s recent statement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0192"></a>

<p>In 1999, I asked the Commission<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> about the need to speed up the evaluation of imidacloprid given its potential implication in the high mortality rate among bees in France next to sunflower fields treated with ‘Gaucho’. In 2002, the Commission replied to a question by Dominique F.C. Souchet<a href="#defann_53_2" name="refann_53_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the potential toxicity of fipronil and imidacloprid for bees: ‘The Commission has not so far received any scientific information on similar problems in other Member States.’ In the meantime, the situation has worsened. In Belgium, there has been a decline in the bee population near ‘Gaucho’ maize crops and near rape crops planted in fields where ‘Gaucho’ beetroot or cereal crops had been grown previously. According to the information available to me, serious reductions in bee numbers have also been recorded in other Member States (in particular, Germany, Sweden and Northern Ireland). The disappearance of bees clearly represents a serious threat to biodiversity.</p>
<p>Faced with this alarming state of affairs, what prevents the Commission from calling for the evaluation of imidacloprid and fipronil during the first stage of evaluation of existing active substances under Directive 91/414/EEC<a href="#defann_53_3" name="refann_53_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>?

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member is invited to refer also to the replies given to Written Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2004-0691_EN.html">E-0691/04</a> (Mr. Dominique Souchet) and Petition 488/00 (Mrs. Mary Paulette) relating to the same subject.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully aware of reports about an increased mortality of honeybees in certain regions of France.</p>
<p>Beekeepers allege that two phytopharmaceutical substances, fipronil and imidacloprid are the principal cause of the mortality. Other circles voice that this causal link is far from being certain and claim that a large variety of possibly interacting factors might be at the source of this phenomenon. This was also recognised by this Parliament in its recent resolution on the problems faced by the beekeeping sector.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Commission awaits the outcome of a number of investigations that are being currently undertaken in France as well as the Community evaluations of the two substances. It also has forwarded the relevant information to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) which is responsible for performing the risk assessment for both substances.</p>
<p>As to the measures taken by the French authorities, the marketing conditions of these substances, pending a Community Decision on them, are subject to a transitional derogation during which national rules continue to apply. This transitional regime is explicitly authorised by Article 8 of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 on the placing of plant protection products on the market<a href="#defann_53_4" name="refann_53_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As the safety evaluation is not yet finalised and no Community harmonisation has taken place, the Commission is not in a position to propose measures at this time.</p>
<p>Should it become clear that the substances pose an unacceptable direct or indirect risk to non-target species, a category which expressly includes honeybees and their larvae, or fail to meet any other requirements necessary for ensuring a safe use, the Commission would then formally propose the non-inclusion of the substances in Annex I ("Active substances for incorporation in plant protection products") of the above Directive. The practical consequences of such non-inclusion are the banning of the substances from the EU market.</p>
<p>The Commission understands that the Honourable Member makes a plea for a priority assessment for both substances and to shift them to the first stage of evaluation. However, this is not possible for different reasons. The review programme of existing active substances is organised in four stages, providing clear legal deadlines for industry, Member States and the Commission and modifying them would lead to situations of legal uncertainties.</p>
<p>One should not forget that the first stage was already established in 1993. Also, from a pure management point of view, the scarce scientific resources had to be used in the most efficient manner and the preparation of the technical dossier by the applicant and the evaluation exercise itself are processes that can take up to ten years. In practical terms, re-scheduling to phase one would not have accelerated the evaluations, both of which are now ongoing.</p>
<p>The evaluation of fipronil is already at EFSA level while for imidacloprid Germany, as Rapporteur Member State, is preparing the draft assessment report. In both cases, important input is expected from the different studies that are being carried out on the subject.</p>
<p>Also, it is fully recognised that the situation is of serious concern, not only from an ecological but also from a social point of view, considering the dramatic consequences on the welfare of the beekeepers and their families.</p>
<p>Therefore the Commission notes with great satisfaction the progress made during this very session of the Parliament on the enlarged specific supporting measures that in the future will become possible through the adoption of the new Council Regulation on actions in the field of beekeeping.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) EQUAL is part of the EU's strategy for more and better jobs and for ensuring that no-one is denied access to them. Funded by the European Social Fund, EQUAL tests new ways of tackling discrimination and inequality experienced by those in work and those looking for a job. With a budget of over € 3 000 million, EQUAL operates in two rounds, the first of which was launched in 2001, with the second being launched in 2004. In the first round, 1,400 Development Partnerships were supported. Given that it is now in the fourth year (out of six years), 67% of the budget has been committed and, to date, 28% has been paid to Member States.</p>
<p>The most visible success in EQUAL is the format of partnership which brings together very disparate groups, many of whom have not previously collaborated, combining skills and resources among a multiplicity of actors within society. This new approach has spawned innovation in a number of areas. Furthermore, Member States are integrating good practice from EQUAL into their National Action Plans for employment, and have identified an extensive array of 'promising practices' which can be found on the web ().</p>
<p>Due to its holistic approach i.e. partnership and empowerment operating within a policy context reinforced by transnational cooperation and supported by national and European platforms for exchange and mainstreaming, EQUAL is considered to have grown beyond the level of previous Community Initiatives and consequently delivered more positive and applicable results. Thus, as set out in the Third report on Economic and Social Cohesion,<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the new generation of employment-related programmes will seek to take on board the lessons of the current EQUAL initiative across the EU (covering innovation, empowerment, partnership and trans-national cooperation in employment matters).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Following the exceptional solution adopted in 2003<a href="#defann_57_2" name="refann_57_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> with the agreement of the budgetary authority, whereby an operating grant for the Info Points Europe (IPE) and Carrefour rural information networks is still directly supplied in 2004, the only option for funding the Info Points Europe and Carrefour information networks as from 2005 that is compatible with the financial rules in force is via a call for proposals. This could be prepared on a multiannual basis in order to guarantee a minimum of stability. This system would also meet the needs of enlargement and of the very necessary modernisation and extension of the current network.</p>
<p>It remains to be decided whether this call for proposals will be launched on a centralised basis by the European Commission (direct administration) or by each Member State (indirect administration).</p>
<p>The Info Points Europe and Carrefour information networks will, of course, continue to benefit from the technical assistance that the Commission intends to step up within the framework of the enlarged EU, in particular in the form of: free supply of documentation and publications for the general public (around 1 500 000 copies a year – EUR 15), access to the relays and networks intranet, specialist assistance via a relays and networks help desk (at an annual cost of around EUR 1 500 000 – EUR 15), free staff training courses (800 person/days a year – EUR 15), events and networking, in particular regular coordination meetings, visits, exchange programmes for relay staff (over 1 000 person/days a year – EUR 15) and original information products tailored to their specific needs.</p>
<p>The Commission should adopt the aforesaid communication in the course of the next few weeks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the concerns expressed in relation to the use of hair dyes. It has considered all aspects of use of hair dyes in cosmetic products and their impact upon consumer health.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are 89 hair dyes (and not only 8 as mentioned in the question) which have been regulated by the Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC. Use of 17 substances has been banned. With regard to the other 72 substances, the current legislation imposes labelling requirements and fixes very strict maximum concentrations for their use.</p>
<p>In July 2003, the Commission, together with Member States and the representatives of both consumers and industry agreed on the strategy for the systematic evaluation of hair dyes. This strategy is published on the web site of the Commission. The overall objective of the strategy is to regulate the use of substances as hair dye ingredients on the basis of the most recent scientific evaluation of safety dossiers. The industry is required to submit by strict deadlines safety dossiers on hair dyes to be evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers (SCCNFP).</p>
<p>This strategy includes a possibility of setting up a positive list for hair dyes within the Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC.</p>
<p>With a view to strengthening the competitiveness of the cosmetic sector and improving consumer safety, the Commission will carry out in the year 2005 an analysis of the current situation of the sector and the application of the cosmetics legislation.</p>
<p>The fact that a positive list on hair dyes does not exist yet does not mean that the harmful substances can be employed in hair products. Apart from the specific regulation of the above-mentioned 89 hair dyes, the Cosmetics Directive states as a general principle that only cosmetic products that do not cause damage to human health can be put on the market (Article 2 of the Directive). Therefore cosmetic products can only contain safe ingredients.</p>
<p>Moreover, the manufacturers shall keep information on the safety of their cosmetic products readily accessible for the competent control authorities of the Member States.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is in the process of starting the comitology procedure that should lead to the ban of substances for which no safety files have been submitted for evaluation by the SCCNFP.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The use of technology in the electoral process, including electronic voting, is part of electoral procedures, the regulation of which falls under the responsibility of the Member States. This is explicitly confirmed regarding elections to the Parliament in Article 7(2) of the 1976 Act<a href="#defann_63_1" name="refann_63_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which provides that the electoral procedure shall be governed in each Member State by its national provisions. The principle was not changed but confirmed by Council Decision 2002/772/EC amending the 1976 Act<a href="#defann_63_2" name="refann_63_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, which entered into force recently.</p>
<p>Naturally, national legislation and practice must respect the general principles of law and fundamental rights. The above-mentioned 1976 Act, as amended by Decision 2002/772/EC, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union provide that Members of the Parliament shall be elected by direct universal suffrage in a free and secret ballot. Compliance with these basic electoral principles, (direct, universal, free and secret suffrage), represents a challenge for systems using electronic voting, but every voting system must respect these principles. The Commission considers that electronic voting can be compatible with these basic electoral principles, provided that procedural, operational and technical standards are such that voting is secure and reliable. The Commission does not have any indications that would imply that the use of electronic voting systems would in any way compromise direct, universal, free and secret character of European parliamentary elections in any Member State.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Capacity building is one of the key problems in improving the situation of the Roma in Europe. Up to this moment many EU projects targeting the Roma have failed to capacitate the Roma, as there has been no clear regulation on how to involve and train Roma in those projects, especially regarding managerial positions. It is impossible for Roma organisations to apply for tenders from the Commission.</p>
<p>What is the Commission doing to address this issue? Is there a clear plan to properly coordinate and manage the activity of the Commission with regard to the Roma, as many projects initiated by different DGs have practically been overlapping in the past?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the Honourable Member's concern to ensure that Roma communities in current and future Member States should be able to participate on an equal basis in economic, social and political life. Of course, many of the solutions to the challenges faced by Roma must be found at national, regional and local level. The European Union is committed to supporting efforts by public authorities and civil society to address these challenges.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises that tendering procedures sometimes make it difficult for smaller organisations, including some Roma organisations, to apply for EU funding. However, the Honourable Member will certainly understand that the Commission is under a general obligation to respect the relevant financial regulations and rules governing public procurement.</p>
<p>Over €100 million of EU funding has already been devoted to projects in favour of Roma in acceding and candidate countries through the PHARE programme. These projects have been monitored by the Commission's delegations in the beneficiary countries and are currently the subject of an external evaluation, which should help the Commission and national authorities to learn from past experiences and to maximise the effectiveness of future funding interventions.</p>
<p>New Member States will now have access to the Union's Structural Funds, which may be used inter alia to promote labour market participation and social inclusion of Roma. In negotiations with the national authorities of acceding countries with significant Roma populations, the Commission has placed considerable emphasis on the need to ensure that a significant proportion of EU funding is used to support projects in favour of the Roma. Selective and integrated actions involving improvement of education, health, water, waste water, and road infrastructure will be implemented. Certain measures will be funded at 80% by the EU (the normal limit is 75% for co-financing of public expenditure). The aim will be to begin a process of improvement of living and working conditions, especially an integrated approach to education, advice, and training, to assist in opening up opportunities, particularly for young people. New Member States will also have access to Community programmes in the fields of social inclusion, anti-discrimination, education, training and youth.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member that the relevant EU funding instruments and programmes should be implemented in a coherent and coordinated way. Various mechanisms have been put in place to promote coordination and exchanges of information between the relevant Commission services, including specific inter-service meetings on Roma.</p>
<p>It would clearly be positive if similar mechanisms for cooperation and coordination, as well as on-going monitoring during the entire project cycle, could be put in place at national level. One positive example in this respect is the establishment in Slovakia, at the suggestion of the Commission, of a committee bringing together government officials, municipalities and Roma representatives to monitor the implementation of Structural Fund programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0211"></a>

<p>When the Flying Finn airline went bankrupt, there were 26.000 private Finnish consumers among its creditors, approximately half of whom will lose the money they had already paid for travel. There is no security for compensation to passengers, unlike package trips and the liability which travel agents bear. Neither can Regulation (EC) 261/2004<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights be considered applicable. According to an answer to a question in the Finnish parliament, the issue has been dealt with in the EU and the International Aviation Organisation.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission fully recognises that the bankruptcy of airlines can seriously affect passengers, either by causing them to lose the money that they have paid or by obliging them to buy expensive return tickets if left stranded far from home. It would have liked the sector to have found a solution itself but understands that this is unlikely to happen, at any rate for some time. It is therefore launching a study that will, first, establish on what scale passengers are affected by airline bankruptcies - little information about this is available at present - and, second, compare the different solutions possible. The results will be available in mid 2005, after which the Commission will decide whether to propose legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
