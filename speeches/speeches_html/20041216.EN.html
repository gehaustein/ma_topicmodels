<p class="contents">Allow me to assure you that I know full well how important this issue is, not only to the European Parliament, not only to the European Commission, but also to our millions of citizens and, of course, to farmers and to all the agencies involved. I have no doubt that the European Community has a very important role to play in improving conditions under which animals can be fed, transported and slaughtered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The need to ensure that animal welfare is improved during transport as a matter of day-to-day reality and not just on the statute book is an important objective for me. I have long been aware of the unsatisfactory way that the current legislation on transport is being applied and of the apparent lack of priority given to this area of legislation by national authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The correct and full enforcement of animal welfare legislation is essential, as is the immediate improvement of the conditions of animal transport. This is why the Commission, despite its desire to do more to restrict transport-by-road times and reduce stock intensity on vehicles, accepts the presidency's step-by-step initiative in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We felt it was important to make the significant progress that was already within our grasp, rather than to defer the whole dossier to a later indefinite date. This, as I will point out later, is without prejudice – and I would like to emphasise this – to any improved future solution. In doing this, we have opted for much stricter rules, significantly improving current conditions, to be applied as soon as possible. They will cover matters such as long-distance transport or new, substantially upgraded standards for vehicles. These will be enforced in the shortest possible time within EU standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to point out that the vast majority of Parliament's amendments have been integrated and incorporated into the final text and I thank Parliament for its important contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no problem in admitting that it is unfortunate that there was no agreement on the issue of restrictions on the travel time and the transport density. There was no chance – and I have to be frank about this – of such provisions being supported in the Council, and the failure to reach agreement at the April 2004 Agricultural Council was a clear warning. But failure to reach agreement at the last Council would have meant an indefinite continuation of the existing unacceptable conditions and a significant delay in their improvement. This does not mean, however, that the Commission does not believe that all possibilities for reinforcing the provisions on travel time should and will be exploited in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly – and this is not the only possibility – the final text provides for the Commission to report back to the Council within – not after – four years of the date of implementation on the issue of travel time and loading densities and possibly to modify its approach on the basis of the experience acquired from the application of the new rules. However, in addition – and this is important – regardless of what the regulation provides, the Commission will carefully analyse the situation, including the prevailing political conditions, and will avail itself of its power of initiative. I <span class="italic">explicitly</span> retained this right when giving our consent to the compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly list some of the improvements that this new regulation will introduce in the near future. I have a list of four pages and I will not read them all. Before I do so, I want to remind honourable Members that the regulation states that Member States have the right to adopt and implement stricter rules within their territory than those provided for in the regulation. Therefore, this is a challenge for the Member States, and it is a challenge for you. If enough Member States adopt stricter rules then the political pressure – the peer pressure – on the rest would be much more evident and effective. However, we need the improvements in the existing regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a satellite navigation system will be used on road vehicles from 2007. There will be forced ventilation and temperature monitoring inside the trucks, with improvements in water facilities and drinking facilities, individual stalls for the transport of horses and other conditions in relation to horses. There will be stricter conditions for the training of drivers and a ban on transporting pregnant, sick and wounded animals. There will also be administrative provisions to ensure consistency between checks by officials in different Member States. This will apply to all journeys.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, the use of satellite navigation systems was promoted by the European Parliament last month and supported by the Commission. This represents an innovative and promising tool to monitor animal transport, and the Commission is ready to invest immediately in this. The proper use of this technology will contribute to the promotion of a more transparent and high-quality approach to animal transport in Europe, in tune with the wishes of our citizens but also enabling better enforcement. This is extremely important. It is not enough to regulate or adopt rules, we must have the means to enforce them and to supervise their enforcement. European citizens have pointed out on innumerable occasions and in many ways that the lack of effective enforcement has been an appreciable weakness of the current system. I fully agree with that. I am determined and committed to ensuring better enforcement of animal welfare rules and to insisting that Member States report precisely on the state of play of the controls carried out. We will continue to press Member States for this information and I am pleased that the new legislation will allow us to do so in a more efficient way.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, we stated in the Council that the Commission reserves the right to respond in accordance with the rules of the Treaty, with due regard to the welfare requirements of animals. Therefore, the Commission will continue to be vigilant and will closely monitor the situation on animal transport in Member States. We are prepared to take a legislative initiative at any time in the future should animal welfare conditions need further improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on two more issues. First, the improvement of animal welfare is a continuous process. It is not just a regulation, we are already working on other improvements on poultry and on microclimates within the transport vehicles. Therefore it is not the end, it is just the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I have looked at what the options were at the last Council meeting. They were not between the optimum maximum and the compromise, they were between the compromise and continuing indefinitely with the present situation, with all the unacceptable conditions that prevail at this point. I am certain you will understand that if one has the responsibility of taking a decision, one has to weigh the pros and cons and decide in which direction to go. I can assure you that the Commission's only concern on this issue was the welfare of the animals and how to make practical improvements as soon as possible. It was not just to insist on a principle which eventually would harm the animals, because it would not enable us to improve the existing conditions in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, the present compromise significantly improves the present situation without depriving the Commission of the right to come back to these very important issues. Believe me, it was a Commission proposal. We would have been much happier if these provisions were included and accepted in the compromise. But, unfortunately, there was no possibility of such an agreement. If I may, I suggest talking to the various NGOs. They were not happy but they accepted this compromise because they realised that it is a significant step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and I would be interested to hear your comments as I feel that Parliament will be a significant ally of the Commission in this matter – I can assure you that my intention is, before the end of this Commission's term and definitely before the end of this Parliament's term, to come back with a new proposal and have a new discussion. The Commission is committed to this. But, the big question and the big challenge will be to convince the Member States to accept this new proposal when it comes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have only just assumed your duties, and I think that your position at all events opens up the possibility of a very good future working relationship between Parliament and the Commission on this, too. I am saying this with good reason: you hit the nail on the head when you said just now that the main problem regarding animal transport in Europe is the lack of priority given to it by national authorities. This is our sticking point, and remedying it would represent tremendous progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to give an example by way of illustration. I note that, at the present time, the Austrian government, in particular, is doing a good job and is exercising good supervision. This is resulting in a large proportion of the international transport of stock for slaughter travelling to Italy by routes other than Austria all of a sudden. This is the kind of situation that arises when a number of other Member States neglect their duties. In that regard, the Austrian model should become the European model: with effective legislation and effective enforcement. This is the way to put an end to all the unpleasant debate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council has come to an agreement, and has made a corresponding amendment without giving prior notice to Parliament, which I find very disconcerting and also blameworthy on the part of the Council. On the other hand, I must add that we should have been even worse off without this initiative, because we cannot deny that the agreement does constitute an improvement on the existing legislation. You know Parliament’s line of thinking. I myself was rapporteur on the subject of a maximum journey time for stock for slaughter. This has now proved unattainable in the Council. Nevertheless, I note that the introduction of the satellite tracking system has become a reality, at all events, and that enforcement of the existing rules is to be improved. In that regard, I should like to hear how the Commission intends to enforce this at Member State level. Are other instruments necessary in this regard, including on the part of Parliament? I should also like to know how the Commission intends to support this in the context of improving training. Finally, I note that farm-to-farm transport has been liberalised. We should have liked to see 100 kilometres, but this was evidently unattainable in the Council. Nevertheless, we have taken a small step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention two other points. First of all, there is still a great deal of criticism of the means of regulation of the transport of breeding stock and the rest periods stated for this. Animals must be transported as quickly as possible, and introducing the minimum possible number of rest periods for the transit of breeding stock, too – which is undertaken in the main in very favourable conditions – would be a step forward. This means that animals can also be transported over medium distances. The same goes for the roll-on/roll-off system on ferries. Telling Member States in plain language that this is normal rest time would also be a great help. All this would represent another few steps forward in improving the quality of animal transport.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former rapporteur, I am a little disappointed that no maximum journey times for stock for slaughter have been agreed. Nevertheless, I see that this package as a whole does represent a genuine step forward. I am extremely curious to hear what proposals the Commissioner intends to make before 2009 for the establishment of a good working relationship with Parliament, and also, in particular, for making Member States comply with the European rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share his disappointment over the Council’s compromise. It brings no improvement in the journey times for animal transport, none in the rest periods and none in the maximum stocking density, and that could endure for years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish the Council every success in attempting to explain this compromise to the European public. It is an extremely bad one, including for the image of the whole sector, and one that is unacceptable from an animal welfare point of view. I therefore support the proposal by my fellow Members to limit the maximum journey time to eight hours. Only a decision of this nature would demonstrate that Europe is really serious about sustainable agriculture, one of the priorities of which must be animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is built in small steps, as we all know, and indeed that is a very good thing, in many cases even the best way. Whilst the EU is taking excessively small steps here towards improving animal welfare, animals in Europe are being dragged back and forth for thousands of kilometres in atrocious conditions. It will be nice and reassuring for them to know that they are being watched by satellites all along. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very important issue. I also agree that the EU has played an important role in regard to the way that animals are fed, transported and slaughtered. As the Commissioner stated, the EU has ensured many improvements in animal welfare during transportation. Some of them have been mentioned already: proposals for satellite tracking systems, ventilation and temperature monitoring, stricter conditions for driver training and a greater number of official inspections in different countries. Progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to nail my colours to the mast because I am an MEP who represents a constituency that is both rural and urban. Agriculture continues to play a very important economic role in the north and west of Ireland. Indeed, the agriculture business has for many years been well supported by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Live animal exports are a hugely important, legitimate business for Ireland. We export 90% of our animals and about 10% of those, or 200 000 live cattle, are exported every year to markets in France, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. This trade is worth over EUR 150 million annually. Therefore, a vibrant export trade is essential for Irish agriculture and for the entire livestock sector. I believe we must have access to the single market. There is an important market for Irish weanlings in Europe and I believe this market should not be hindered. Surely, free access to the market is one of the cornerstones of EU policy. We also need to balance animal welfare with market access and support for agriculture, not just in Ireland, but also in the EU as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, I agree with the Commissioner. We need enforcement and no one has a problem with that – consumers or farmers, it is in all our interests. Another issue regarding live export is that the trade provides competition in Ireland. This is another cornerstone of EU policy. I believe we have made progress; there is probably further to go, but the Commission is doing useful work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of technical improvements were at the cost of up to six years’ blocking of the issue of protecting our animals. This would mean that, throughout their periods of office, neither Parliament nor the Commission would be given an opportunity to improve the conditions of animals, a state of affairs that is quite unreasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council decision departed so completely from the proposal that I even doubted its legality. Mr Kyprianou, I hope you realise your ambition of coming back with density figures and transport times as soon as possible. I also hope that you make use of the Treaty’s articles concerning transport, consumer issues or health as a legal basis so that Parliament can participate through the codecision procedure. We could then together break the Council’s resistance to providing animals with reasonable conditions. Unfortunately, the Council listens more to lobbyists than to opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The maturity of a society is shown by the way in which it treats those who are defenceless. If the rules governing the transport of animals are an indicator of Europe’s maturity, we are unfortunately still barbarians. I invite all ministers to travel, together with myself, between Stockholm and Brussels under the conditions that apply to the transport of animals. They might then understand what they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are regarded as 75-kilo sheep, there will be ten of us in an area as large as a double bed. If we are regarded as chickens, we shall see how faeces from those above fall down onto those below. If we are regarded as pigs, we shall, in accordance with the Council decision, be given nothing less than electric shocks if we refuse to move. We shall also be given water only after 14 hours before continuing for another 14 hours. We must also try to ensure that, in accordance with the Council rules, the temperature is kept above five degrees Centigrade during the journey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Yet again, animals have lost out when there is a choice to be made between protecting them or the profits of the firms that fatten them up. I will nonetheless concede that the Commission has made an effort, and I will not deny that a number of changes have been made for the better, but the underlying principle has remained the same as it was before.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those of you in the Council who have decided not to have a limit on transport times for animals and that the permitted density should not be specified, and I am absolutely convinced that you would be quick to introduce other rules if your domestic pets were to be transported the length and breadth of Europe. If we want to defend the right to life and the rights of animals, then we need to approach this from a different angle.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the GSP satellite navigation system does, of course, achieve something; it means that checks can be better carried out. There is no disputing that. Likewise, if it is ensured that the animals are given water and improved ventilation, that is of course a small advance, but it does not solve the problem. If you want regional development, this is a real opportunity to demonstrate it, for you can raise animals, fatten them up, and process them on the spot or within the local area without having to organise these transports from one end of the European Union to the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I really cannot understand how Mr Maat can describe this as tremendous progress. I cannot see it as such. It patches things up, without doing anything to deal with the main problems and remove the main causes of the torment these animals undergo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I venture to suggest it has given rise to more concern than the plight of the millions of children dying of starvation or living in unacceptable conditions in contemporary Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">If the humanitarian organisations acting in the interests of those individuals had shown the same determination as their counterparts promoting the cause of animals, something could probably have been done to help the European children dying day after day.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall be more specific. Parliament has issued two opinions on animal welfare in transit over the last three years. I do not believe it is appropriate to devote any more time to the matter, as fortunately it was finally settled this November, following the agreement reached in the Council of Ministers of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the compromise proposal tabled by the Irish Presidency was better. It contained a reasonable restriction on journey times, taking account of both the animal welfare and the question of freedom of movement of goods within the European Union. I would remind the House of the times in question, namely nine hours of journey time plus twelve for rest and a further nine hours of journey time. The agreement reached today under the Dutch Presidency does not imply any change to existing regulations on journey time. The decision on this crucial issue in the debate has been postponed for six years.</p>
<p class="contents">The postponement is due to the differences of opinion that still exist between the Member States. It amounts to stalemate. Nonetheless, I would like to clarify one aspect I feel many of those following the debates have overlooked, and which should be brought to the notice of the citizens.

The Council was not going to agree to anything more at this stage. However, it is extremely disappointing – as everyone has said – that we could not get something on journey times, one of the key issues; or on stocking densities. Member States can adopt tougher legislation. We in this Parliament want a bigger say on these issues, but at the moment we do not have it. I will certainly press my own government to go further on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased, Commissioner, that you mentioned enforcement. That is one area where this legislation has fallen down in the past. You will be aware of the NGOs that have given us video evidence of how this legislation has been by-passed and ignored. You said that in four years you are going to come back with more legislation. I hope that you do. I hope you will keep Parliament informed of what happens in the interim. We want to hear about what is happening with regard to reinforced monitoring. I can guarantee that Parliament will back you when you bring forward your legislation. We already have a written declaration on journey times.

It could, of course, be transferred to health and consumer protection because it would then be Commissioner Kyprianou who would be responsible for the matter, which sounds more reassuring.</p>
<p class="contents">In Denmark, it is the Justice Ministry that is responsible for this matter. We regard animal protection as legal protection, but Article 37 is exclusively about increasing production and earnings. The poor animals must suffer heaven knows what kind of mistreatment when protection itself is subject to greed. It is actually grotesque that export subsidies are paid when horses, cows and sheep have to be sent out of the EU. Animals that are to be slaughtered should only be driven to the nearest abattoir and for a maximum of eight hours. We have a majority in favour of this view in Denmark. Animals that are not to be slaughtered should only be transported for eight hours without rest, food and a change of air, and the accommodation must be in order. That is also something favoured by a majority in Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the previous Parliament stated this too, and it has to be asked why the Commission did not go to the Council and insist on these conditions being respected. When we obtain the new Constitution, Parliament will have the right of codecision and, if animal protection had no longer been subject to Article 37, Parliament would now already have had this right.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding another matter – namely transparency – our Ombudsman expressly stated that the provisions of the new Constitution could properly be used when there was such large support for doing so, so there is a double opportunity for involving Parliament in this procedure right now. What has happened is that a strategy has been chosen whereby a decision has been hurried through, almost as if it were a question of keeping both people and Parliament remote from the decision-making concerned over the next six years. We, indeed I, have noted that the Member States must implement decisions that go further ...</p>

For this reason, it is a matter for the European Commission and the European Parliament. For years, Parliament has been inundated with petitions from people rightly calling for attention to abuses in animal transport. This applies in particular to horses that come to the end of their useful life in the East but are destined to be slaughtered and eaten in the South. Many animals spend a very long time in transit in lorries, with little to eat or drink, foul themselves, start to panic and suffer injury. The only way to prevent this is to drastically reduce the distance and time permitted for the transport of live animals. At the start of 2004, the dispute in this Parliament was a question of eight hours versus nine hours of continuous transport and of limited, cheap protective measures versus further-reaching, more expensive measures. At that time, Parliament made a very moderate choice, but even that went too far for the governments of a number of Member States. As a result, there is still scope for allowing those abuses to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The key question is whether we accept this unnecessary animal suffering in anticipation of a resulting reduction in the costs of the livestock trade and of road transport companies, or whether we consider this suffering to be completely at variance with our civilisation and our responsibility for the welfare of our fellow creatures. My choice is emphatically in favour of civilisation and responsibility. What the Commissioner is now announcing is the failure of decision making in the European Union. We have shown ourselves to be unable to do what is urgently needed. National economic interests are taking precedence over our shared civilisation and responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Listening to Commissioner Kyprianou speak, I have no doubt as to his good intentions. I support his announcement of new initiatives by the European Commission. I also agree with his view that it would be better to start quickly on the basis of a woefully inadequate result than of no result at all. Satellite monitoring is cold comfort for the animals. Let us not trust solely in new technologies, but rather build on the political will to genuinely eliminate this abuse. That is what is important. I hope that we are able to achieve real results by the end of the term of office of this Parliament and this Commission, because what is currently taking place is an absolute disgrace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Another matter that gives rise to concern is the reports on financial fraud issued by OLAF at regular intervals.

<p class="contents">There is a failure of implementation, not a failure of regulation. In fact, in many cases we have over-regulation but also non-implementation. This has led to problems for farmers and those engaged in what is a very legitimate trade. One of my Irish colleagues has mentioned the importance of this trade for Irish farmers. The new agriculture support system urges farmers to opt for market-led farming. There is a legitimate market in mainland Europe for young cattle from Irish farms. Are we going to tell farmers that they cannot engage in this legitimate trade? I do not think we can, because it is vital for the success of Irish farmers. However, animal welfare must of course also be a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">One colleague raised concerns about Lebanon. Irish cattle go to Lebanon. Again, it is a case of implementing the regulations that are there. If we stop that trade, animals will still move to Lebanon, perhaps from Australia and other areas. If our concerns are for animals, we must have concerns for animals across the world and not just European animals.</p>
<p class="contents">As for reducing journey times and stocking densities, I urge that we be guided by science and not emotion, because this debate has been too much guided by emotion.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to refer you to independent research carried out in Ireland on the transport of animals from Ireland to Spain. I shall read one paragraph from the report: 'The study concluded that transport had no adverse effect on animal welfare based on the physiological, immunological and haematological measurements made'.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just support Mrs Herranz Garcia, who spoke of human welfare concerns in this House last night. I raised the issue of over half a million people in the Sudan who are starving. The issues are not linked, but we need to put our priorities right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this agreement has one very positive aspect. It postpones the most controversial issues until 2011. I refer to the issues instrumental in the failure of negotiations last April, namely journey times and stocking densities. Some of the honourable Members present today will recall the debate in the last Parliament with Mr Maat. It emerged then that, as Mrs McGuinness just stated, there is no solid scientific basis regarding the two issues of journey time and density. In addition, larger Member States and the peripheral ones were seriously penalised. All this economic background was presented as an animal welfare issue, as if Members from large and peripheral countries were not concerned about animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe the political agreement makes good many of the shortcomings identified in current provisions. This is its most positive aspect. It improves control systems, it introduces technological features facilitating control, it provides for a clear and transparent system of registration and it improves systems of cooperation between Member States. In addition, it spells out the duty of setting up training systems that will also improve the transport of animals. I particularly welcome Article 32, because it lays down clearly the basis for future reviews of these provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, therefore, I am bound to congratulate the Council for moving the issue forward, and I look forward to successful implementation of the new text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That this should be so certainly has to do with the subject matter, but also with the fact that what we are dealing with here is a never-ending story. This is not the first time, not the second, and not even the third, but perhaps the umpteenth time that we have had to give this our attention. For well over ten years, we have sought to make improvements in this area, and there has always been talk of progress, but the crucial progress has not materialised. We will, I believe, achieve a real breakthrough only when this House acquires the right of codecision in agricultural matters as well. I believe we are more likely to get that than the satellite navigation system. It is there that I have greater confidence in our ability to get our way.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the matter in hand, I would like to say that this is, of course, also about transport times, but what is of the essence is whether the conditions are right, that is, whether the animals are carted off in torment or whether they travel as our fellow-creatures. If someone goes to the Middle East and buys an Arabian stallion for stud purposes, they do not need to worry that it will arrive here in a poor condition. Likewise, if our animals travel to the Olympic Games, they will arrive in a fit and proper state. It follows that it is the conditions that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters, I think, is that we should comply with what the consumers want. In Germany, we have set up programmes for quality meat in which transport time is among the quality criteria. Organic farming is another example, with the nearest slaughterhouse being the one that is used. Where that is a measure of quality, it will also become accepted practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Animals suffer from human callousness and thoughtlessness, and improving their fate is a challenge to our humanity. It is not merely sensitivity to the harm done to animals that makes action necessary, but also the awareness that it is only a small step from cruelty to animals to cruelty to humans.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation under discussion moves in the right direction. It introduces higher standards for the protection of animals in transport, although these standards are still inadequate, and it leads one to hope that animals will suffer less. As an MEP whose voters include Polish farmers, I am delighted at this. In Polish family-owned farms, which are mainly small, animals are treated with great affection, and even as individuals. It breaks farmers’ hearts when the animals they cared for are treated brutally after being sold.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation we are discussing will bring progress, but it is not a solution to the problem. Legal regulations must be accompanied by effective implementation, which can be fraught with difficulty. Poland, for example, is a large transit country and it experiences problems with the transport of horses. Legal standards have been put in place, but the monitoring bodies, police and veterinary inspectors are often helpless when faced with the problem of what to do with illegal transports, carrying injured animals for instance. There is a need for a network of stopover points where transported animals could be provided with food and drink or given necessary veterinary care. In urgent cases, the animals could be put down at these points if necessary. The European Union should provide financial support for the setting up of such a network, and Poland at any rate requires such assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, a genuine breakthrough in the transport of animals will only come about when long-distance transports are fully abolished. Animals should be slaughtered close to where they have been bred. Humanitarian considerations are not the sole reason for this. Sanitary considerations are also at issue. I would remind you that as shown by the recent report of the Court of Auditors, control is practically lost over animals transported abroad. Ladies and gentlemen...</p>

Last year alone, one animal protection organisation collected 500 000 signatures in Denmark, that is to say half a million signatures in a country with only just over five million inhabitants. All the more reason for criticising the way in which this proposal has been hurried through. As a Member of the European Parliament, I could not obtain access to the proposal until a few hours before it was in actual fact adopted. It might well actually have been the case, Commissioner, that if there had been a little more time in which to debate this issue and if there had been a public debate surrounding it in the individual countries of Europe, the ministers would have been rather more amenable. I actually think you should be serious about the statements you have made in this House today. I think you should have the matter put on the agenda again as quickly as possible so that we can have a public debate and so that the politicians and ministers can be put under pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The big problem in this case is that we think too much about the internal market. The internal market is of course a splendid and commendable thing but, once in a while, we must also pause and bear some ethical considerations in mind. We are now treating animals as if they were commodities. Animals are not commodities. Animals are living beings and must, of course, be treated as such.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also question whether the proposal that has now unfortunately become legislation is at all tenable in purely legal terms. In purely legal terms, can there be any defence of Parliament’s being deprived of influence, as it has been? When this legislation is revised, or in other words re-examined, it will be possible to bypass Parliament. As I see it, that alone is a good enough reason for investigating whether this decision is at all sustainable in legal terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know it is not, and I think you know it is not, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a great shame that the Council is not here to be held to account. I have to say as well that I am disappointed that my own government voted in favour of this shabby deal; because a few technical improvements are now completely overshadowed by the failure to make any progress on journey times and stocking density. As a result, it seems this shockingly cruel practice will continue for many years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I notice, however, that you explicitly reserve the right to bring forward better proposals. I welcome that, and strongly urge you to do it as soon as possible, and in particular to introduce a maximum eight-hour journey time for both slaughter and further fattening animals. You can be sure that Parliament will be an ally on this, even more so if we have codecision. It is crucial that we send out a strong signal to all Member State governments that support for live exports is unacceptable in a civilised society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share most of your concerns and most of your views. However, as I have already said, the Commission felt that there was a need for immediate action. Some of you said that this compromise has been rushed through. But at the same time, some of you said that this has been pending for more than ten years. I believe, therefore, that we had an obligation to find a solution as soon as possible, without just saying that we would not continue these efforts for improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that Member States can do more. They can adopt stricter rules, not just for animals originating from their territory but also for transit animals. So there could be, through this, a possibility of stricter regulations covering a much wider area and affecting much more transport.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the subsidies are concerned I must remind Parliament that even though we do not have the right – because of various international agreements – to legislate on movement of animals outside the territory, nevertheless the European Union has linked the export subsidies to animal welfare requirements during transport. Therefore to link the two is a substantial step as it brings compliance to a great extent, even though not through immediate legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that implementation is very important. We will put greater emphasis on the issue of travel times, including all the other improvements that need to be made. We will gather enough scientific evidence to be able to convince even those who are reluctant at this stage. Therefore we will continue to monitor the situation and get this evidence that can be used in a future proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">On the staging point, this regulation has increased both the welfare situation and the bio-security situation. Even though I understand and share the disappointment of many of you with regard to this regulation, at the same time, we must not, through this emotional approach, disregard significant improvements that have been made to the regulation. Travel times are very important – that is why they were included in the Commission proposal; but conditions during travel are just as important. They are being improved and dealt with in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission examined the legal problems referred to in the way in which the decision was taken. I can assure you that we checked with the legal services and everything was done in a proper legal way.</p>
<p class="contents">While I share your concerns, we feel that this was a good compromise. It has gone the right way. Some of us might have wanted to go one step further, or take one step less, but it is nevertheless going in the right direction. The Commission will continue to monitor and follow the implementation. Implementation is in the hands of the Member States. Agreement on any future proposal coming from the Commission will again, in the final analysis, be in the hands of the Member States. Therefore it is something on which Parliament and the Commission have to work together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the first time I have addressed the plenary of this Parliament and it is satisfying that the first proposal that I am dealing with is focused upon the protection of deep-water coral reefs – an issue of great importance to us all. Doubtless, we will have many an occasion in future, both within this plenary and within the Committee on Fisheries, to discuss issues not only relating to conservation and the preservation of fish stocks but also relating to issues such as deep-water coral reefs.</p>
<p class="contents">Having studied the scientific evidence and considering the irreversible damage that certain fishing gear can cause to these unique habitats, we propose in this regulation to ban the use of bottom trawls and similar trawl gear in the areas concerned. With this proposal, we fulfil the commitment given at the Fisheries Council of 23 October 2003, when the new 'western waters' regulation was approved to ensure protection for these habitats. I am happy to note that the rapporteur recommends that Parliament approve these measures, as does the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the adoption of measures to minimise the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems. They show our determination to work for the integration of environmental concerns in the common fisheries policy, as envisaged in the reform of 2002, and as repeatedly called for by public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn briefly to the amendments proposed in the report before us. I can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3. However, I have difficulty in accepting Amendment No 4, since it is not in line with the legislation on the mandate that is given to regional advisory councils. These councils are to be consulted on the development of proposals for legislation, but consultation of them is not envisaged on the implementation of such legislation. As for Amendment No 5, the Commission has difficulty accepting the substance of this amendment as it is currently worded. The Commission is bound to review all proposals in the light of new scientific evidence. Hence, obliging the Commission to do so in a specific timeframe could also work against the spirit and purpose of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we need to be conscious of the fact that the production of scientific evidence is very much dependent on the Member States and, therefore, the Commission is not in a position to guarantee its availability as prescribed in the amendment, that is, within a specified timeframe.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 6, the Commission notes that while it could find such an amendment acceptable, it is not really necessary since the geographical application of the regulation is well known and already established.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Amendment No 7, in accordance with scientific advice, the main threat to the very fragile deep-water habitats is bottom trawling. Damage caused by other gear, in particular specific gear such as gillnets and longlines, may be real, but is very minor compared to the erosion effects of trawls.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, extending the prohibition on trawling throughout the European economic zone would appear to be excessive, i.e. would appear not to be proportionate since the majority of this area does not have submarine features threatened by fishing. In these circumstances, the Commission is not in a position to accept Amendment No 7.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has difficulty accepting Amendment No 8, because it would create a duplication of effort. Comprehensive revisions of the status of deep-water features are currently being carried out by the International Council for the Exploitation of the Sea, ICES. This is considered to be sufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ribeiro (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process of drawing up, discussing and voting on this report in committee was quite a surprising learning process, showing that it is never too late to learn and to carry on learning.</p>
<p class="contents">I tackled an activity with which I was only superficially familiar and, in particular, I supplemented all the theoretical knowledge that documents and studying could provide. By contacting and receiving information from those connected with the activity, those who make it their difficult livelihood, those who study it thoroughly and seriously and those who have responsibilities within it, I learnt a lot and I know that there is still a lot to learn.</p>
<p class="contents">I started with the idea that we need to protect the environment, which is subject to attacks that are likely to get worse, and I found three questions taking shape: which predatory activities should be moderated or banned? Within what limits? Under what jurisdiction? After much listening and considerable thought, I became convinced that a ban on bottom trawling would not be enough to protect coral reefs and other formations, among which I would highlight thermal vents. It was proved to me that bottom gill-netting was equally predatory or even more so. That is why I explicitly included it. Why is there such resistance to its inclusion? Is it because powerful interests use that method? The Commission argues that it is because there is insufficient scientific evidence to prove the evils of the technique. Even if that were so, however, the precautionary principle should apply. The delimitation of the areas to be protected is defined in the Commission’s proposal by the criterion of degrees of longitude and latitude. I consider this option to be political and not technical, or at least not only technical but with a strong political meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">Not using the criterion of miles offshore means that the connection with national exclusive economic zones can be ignored or minimised as something to be forgotten. In view of the negotiations, after the period that ended in November 2003, to change the regulatory limits from 200 to 12 and then to 50 and finally to 100 miles, the failure of the Commission proposal to consider the situation created in the zone between the 100 and 200 mile limits is, in my view, serious and needs to be remedied.</p>
<p class="contents">All that brings us to the key issue of jurisdiction, starting with the simple omission of the national jurisdictions of Spain and Portugal, which was not omitted even in the previous proposal dealing with the United Kingdom’s jurisdiction over the reef formations of the Darwin Mounds off the Scottish coast. Might that mean that jurisdiction is attributed to the United Kingdom but is denied or forgotten – or hidden – in the case of Spain and Portugal? We are thus arriving at some really sensitive, fundamental issues, of the kind that life imposes when we get down to practicalities.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of the European Union’s exclusive competence over the conservation of marine biological resources is thus enshrined in this proposal even before the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty. Such a decision is highly debatable and, for us, unacceptable, insofar as it represents the replacement of national and regional competence over part of the national territory, albeit under the sea, with exclusive Community competence.</p>
<p class="contents">The points that are clearly under discussion here are as follows: firstly, the balance between the exploitation of resources and their conservation. Secondly, this balance was achieved when and where fishing was not industrial and predatory and the conservation of marine biological resources was under national and regional jurisdiction on the basis of proximity, and there are therefore no grounds to replace this jurisdiction in order to remedy incorrect or lax practices. Thirdly, there are two kinds of fishing – costal fishing, which is, more or less, or still is almost traditional, and industrial fishing. The former is penalised, with a terrible impact on society and the regional economies, by the predatory nature of the latter, which, because of its economic and political power, will more easily continue its activities. Fourthly, the negotiations that are starting on total allowable catches and quotas are an indictment of equal treatment for what is different and a refutation of strategies which, on the pretext of protecting the environment, help the ‘big fish’ to swallow up the ‘little fish’ – and the word ‘fish’ can be replaced with others such as ‘boats’, ‘fleets’, ‘interests’ or ‘countries’.</p>
<p class="contents">My report and the draft amendments that I have submitted to the House for approval have the same intention as I have tried to make clear in this speech, in the hope that this House will vote for it. I am grateful for your vote and I am also grateful for all the help and collaboration that I have had in tabling this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we discuss this issue, we need to imagine how it would be if the destruction taking place on the sea bed were instead to happen on land. Imagine if forests were to be uprooted, if all the animals in them were to die and if the birds were to become silent. People would be up in arms. We would all drown in letters from anxious people demanding that the forests be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, this is happening on the sea bed. The forests of the sea are coral reefs at the bottom of the sea, among fish that are unable to cry out. We here in Parliament must therefore speak on behalf of these bio- and eco-systems without a voice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has tried to express this voice in the form of amendments. I wish therefore to emphasise that the House should support Amendment No 8, which was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety but which, unfortunately, was rejected by the Committee on Fisheries. We must investigate what other deep-sea habitats need to be protected so that we might obtain a complete list of these. We must, of course, do this in cooperation with the ICES to avoid duplication of effort, but we must take responsibility for this list’s being compiled.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to speak up for Amendment No 7, which picks up on the important aspect of there being equipment other than trawl nets that can damage the sea bed. That is why the rules should, of course, cover all equipment that may damage the sea bed, and it is wise to use the precautionary principle in these sensitive areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that we should retain the Commission’s proposal concerning zones and thus vote against the second half of the amendment. The zones have a scientific basis we are able to accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">According to the Commission, protection is given to the areas around Madeira, the Azores and the Canaries, outermost archipelagos where the traditional fishing methods that have been used for centuries up to the present day have made it possible not only to preserve species but also to maintain thriving fishing communities.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are witnessing growing concern about the maintenance of fish stocks and when various recovery plans are being set up in areas devastated by overfishing, the sustainable fishing practised in those archipelagos deserves that we should all encourage it and adopt a position to support and safeguard it. Besides, we are talking about areas where there is no continental shelf and therefore the places where fishing is possible are confined to small seamounts generally associated with those deep-water corals.</p>
<p class="contents">It can be said that there is a lot of water around those archipelagos but there are not many fish or fishing areas. It is therefore essential to safeguard and protect those areas from the destructive – highly destructive – activities of industrial fisheries. The emergency measures put in place are already a help but we have to have lasting solutions, and for that reason this Commission proposal is laudable.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the proposed amendments to widen the ban on nets to include bottom gill nets make complete sense to me. Because of the anchors used and the risk of loss, they can cause ghost fishing and also seabed erosion, threatening the ecological balance of the deep-water corals.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the proposal for a ban should be widened to include gill nets and also to include the 200-mile zones, because this proposal is based on maintaining what existed until very recently. With my knowledge of the situation, I can guarantee that by adopting these proposals we will be helping to protect the environment and the sustainable kind of fishing that we think should be based more on prevention than on <span class="italic">a posteriori</span> cure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having read the documents produced by the Commission, which are quite specific in indicating that bottom gill nets are extraordinarily harmful and damaging to the environment, we are at a loss to understand why the Commission wants to impose this practice in the Autonomous Region of the Azores, where it has never been allowed. That is a backward step in nature conservation imposed by the Commission and by the European institutions, which makes no sense at all and is totally unacceptable.

The first concerned reefs off the north-west coast of Scotland, the Darwin Mounds, for which I was fortunate enough to be rapporteur. As with that report, it is essential to appreciate just how important deep-water coral reefs are for the marine ecosystem.</p>
<p class="contents">They can maintain hundreds of different species of wildlife, including many species of deep-sea fish, and they are a vital focus for fish reproductive cycles. In the case of deep-sea fish, gestation periods are extremely long and thus any negative impacts on the habitats will have serious effects on stocks, both in the short and the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still gathering research on the full impact of trawling on deep-sea coral reefs, but it certainly appears that in the short span of time since deep-sea trawling began, hundreds or possibly thousands of seamounts and coral reef systems may have been devastated.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALDE Group therefore fully supports the proposal and the amendments adopted in committee, particularly Amendment No 4 emphasising the role of regional advisory councils. We commend to you the other amendments as adopted in committee. We endorse plenary Amendment No 8 as well, since it is important to examine what other areas of deep-sea coral within the EU should be closed to harmful fishing methods.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also support Amendment No 6 and the first part of Amendment No 7, since that fits with the precautionary approach. After considerable thought, we cannot support the second part of that amendment because it could have the effect of leaving some of the coral unprotected. That is with real regret, since the motivation of the whole of that amendment is essentially one of conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope very much that the Commission and the Council will both appreciate the seriousness of the concerns being expressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we all know, the impact on these environments – and this is also true for all types of marine environment where indiscriminate fishing methods are used – affects not only pelagic and edible sessile species, but also inedible sessile organisms and, more generally, it seriously damages key breeding environments. This leads to resource depletion and a resulting loss of economic potential, with serious consequences for local communities, particularly small-scale traditional fishing businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the reasons given in the international agreements referred to in the report, the protection of such environments is therefore an important way to achieve not only environmental protection but also stable social and economic prospects for the communities which persevere in the areas in question. This is true in general for all regions where fishing is a traditional resource which, as such, ought to be safeguarded, not only by limiting the industrial catch by fleets from other countries, but also by ensuring the continued existence of breeding habitats.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, it is vital to involve the local communities, and especially those people involved in the sector. I therefore believe that the authorities, local firms and associations in the sector, with the help of the Community institutions, in addition to watching over the protected areas should also be responsible for the regular scientific monitoring of habitats, as well as for providing eco-friendly information and ensuring the professional conduct of those involved in fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">It would certainly also be a good idea to encourage the productivity of small traditional businesses by giving them modern tools for researching, identifying and catching their resources, so as to promote greater catch selectivity in the marine environment and to make it possible for businesses like those to survive competition from industrial fishing fleets, particularly Japanese and US ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should now like to make it clear that our group will support the Commission’s proposal, namely the Ribeiro report, as it was adopted in the Committee on Fisheries. We shall be voting against the amendments tabled, for the reasons I am about to give.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to the inclusion of bottom set gill nets because, as everyone is aware, these are static nets. By their very nature, they do not erode the sea bottom. The amendment concerned refers to a possible biological disaster. At most, this could be linked to the loss of these nets and subsequent so-called ghost fishing<span class="italic">.</span> As the Commissioner stated, there is no scientific data relating to areas or species. This is why I think it is somewhat flippant and a bad precedent to ban or attempt to ban gear of this kind in the areas in question. Indeed, to follow the arguments through, the gear would have to be banned from all Community waters. It would be interesting to see if those who are in favour of a ban in this case would also be in favour of a more general ban.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the second amendment. On the basis of criteria derived from marine geology and biology, this amendment calls for the protected areas proposed by the Commission to be replaced by the 200-mile political criterion. It should be pointed out that, rightly or wrongly, that criterion is no longer relevant to fisheries management under Community law. I must emphasise once again that coral reefs are not located exclusively within a 200-mile radius from the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores. The scientific community accepts that coral reefs are generally found around a 1 000 metre bathymetric line. In accordance with the precautionary principle, the Commission has therefore gone up to the 1 500 metre bathymetric line<span class="italic">.</span> These lines do not of course tally with political and administrative demarcations. In addition, in this particular instance, the zones designated by the European Commission extend beyond the 200-mile limit in some cases. International waters are affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these are the reasons why our group will not support the amendments tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was because, along with the whole House, I believe it is important to protect deep-water coral reefs. I am bound to say, however, that I have been very surprised at some of the comments made by the rapporteur subsequently. I endorse what Mrs Fraga has just said, and can only hope that little flags similar to those evident elsewhere in the Chamber do not suddenly appear in front of Mr Ribeiro.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise that we do not support either the first or the second part of Amendment No 7. We certainly support the Commission’s proposal, but we cannot agree to the addition of bottom set gill nets without any scientific justification. The Commission’s proposal makes a reference to bottom set gillnets or similar gear. We believe that the addition of bottom set gill nets with no further qualification could be very detrimental to certain fleets. It could also act as a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not support the second part of the amendment either.

According to the United Nations, deep-water coral reefs are a vulnerable habitat which require special attention. ICES advises that the only way to protect cold-water habitats from fishing damage is to map the habitats precisely and to close those areas to the forms of fishing that cause damage. The only way to protect deep-water coral reefs is to prohibit the use of bottom trawls and similar gears.</p>
<p class="contents">It was early this year that this House recognised deep-water coral reefs, when the Darwin Mounds, off the north-west coast of Scotland, were given special status as an area of conservation. Now we turn to the other deep-water coral reefs off the Canary Islands and around Madeira and the Azores, and I hope there will be continuation of protection to those areas on a permanent basis. Deep-water coral reefs should not be destroyed by bottom trawling, but should be protected for future generations to enjoy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ensuring the sustainability of marine biological resources is also the best way to protect the most threatened of all species in certain parts of the Union: the human species itself. Many of the fishing communities in some coastal areas of the Union, such as the Azores or Madeira, do not have any other alternatives at all for their livelihoods or their survival. In this case, it is the Commission itself that acknowledges that we are dealing with very sensitive ecosystems that are highly endangered and require urgent protection, particularly since there is a considerable lack of information about them.</p>
<p class="contents">The simple acknowledgment of such facts is more than enough reason to adopt any preventive measures that might stop the destruction of those habitats.

<p class="contents">On the possible damage by fishing other than trawls: according to the ICES 2003 report, trawls are the main cause of damage to deep-water coral reefs. There is little evidence of passive gear damaging coral reefs, although ICES mentions some of these effects. The Commission is ready to amend its proposal if there is new scientific evidence or if the Member States agree on such an amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the point concerning the extension of the protective zone to the whole EEZ, I would underline that the proposal delimited an area that includes most of the submarine mountains that have been kept in good condition. Extending the zone of prohibition would add insignificant protection and would therefore run counter to the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I would also refer to the question of the exclusive competence of the Commission with regard to marine resources, which is found in the Constitution and to which reference has been made. This is a principle which was already established by European Court of Justice case law, and all the Constitution does is to codify it. However, the Commission does not deny the rights of Spain and Portugal over their European Economic Zone. It is just that there is no need to mention these rights of jurisdiction since the area of prohibition is delimited by topography and by geographical features.</p>
<p class="contents">On the point made by Mrs Attwooll concerning the role of the regional advisory councils, there would be a legal problem and in order to accept that amendment the regulation on RACs would itself have to be amended.</p>
<p class="contents">On another point made by Mrs Attwooll, the Commission has recently tabled a proposal on conditions for deep-water fishing, which will lend protection to these important resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Socialist Group in the European Parliament was opposed in principle to this procedure, it being our belief that the Commission should first present its programme, with Parliament then stating its position with respect to it. We did not manage to get this accepted by the Conference of Presidents and the procedure was adopted. Up to a certain point, we were able to support the wording of the resolution as it stands; it also includes many points that we can live with and accept.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, a number of essential elements in this text that lead us in this Group – after a long debate yesterday evening – to believe at present that it is the Commission that should first state its position on these points rather than Parliament. We therefore want to adopt the procedure that is normal in every Member State, under which the government first presents its programme and the parliament then states where it stands on it. That is what should be done in this instance too, and so we now expect the Commission to present its programme. We will not be participating in this vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are very disappointed that the PSE Group has withdrawn its name from the joint text, even though it was negotiated by two of their vice-chairmen. We also hope that the PSE Group realises that by voting against the compromise it is taking the risk that Parliament will not have a position on the new Commission's strategic policy objectives. Does the PSE Group really want this to happen and spoil the reputation of the European Parliament?</p>

<p class="contents">It helps to clarify the responsibilities of those political forces which deal out criticism but do not match it with action. I therefore regret the rejection of the rejection.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for rejection is appropriate, because this is the first full year of the enlarged EU, with its additional cohesion requirements, and a key year in the debate on the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013. It is therefore unacceptable to produce a Community budget for 2005 that has only been set above 1% of the Community GNI (by thousandths of a per cent) for psychological reasons, while it hides its clear concordance with the objectives of the signatories to the ‘Letter of the Six’ to continue the 2004 budget, the lowest in relative terms since 1987.</p>
<p class="contents">It is consistent, because we previously tabled a rejection of the budget for 2000 at the beginning of the current financial framework, and five years later our criticisms have been confirmed: insufficient funds for economic and social cohesion; underfunding and a lack of suitable programmes in the employment, social, environmental and cooperation fields; problems of execution and lack of transparency; and especially a budget subordinated to the dictates of the Stability and Growth Pact and to making ‘savings’, so as to finance enlargements as well as other priorities, such as war and propaganda, with the same financial resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Portugal’s priorities are taken into account financially in 2005. There is greater provision for regional and cohesion policy, as well as for the common agricultural policy with its pilot projects, and there are more funds for concluding agreements on fisheries.</p>

In that time, the flexibility instrument has been used five times in a row, thereby justifying the Portuguese Communist Party’s proposal to review the current financial perspective.</p>

One thing the Treaty of Amsterdam did was to transfer legislative powers in this area from the Member States to the EC, thus taking it out of the hands of national parliaments; another was to hand it over to the Council exclusively, and hence to the assembled national executives, with Parliament’s involvement limited to the stating of positions. In an area such as this, with such considerable implications for fundamental rights, it is untenable that the executive should make law in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">This draft Council decision on the adoption of the codecision procedure is thus a long overdue step towards giving Parliament a greater say in legislation. At the same time, though, the Council is planning to reserve again certain areas exclusively to the executive. This is precisely what the Bourlanges report criticises, and that is why I endorse the report.</p>
<p class="contents">What I see as problematic about this report, however, is that it insists upon a provision in the Constitution whereby Member States can unilaterally bar third-country nationals from gaining access to the labour market. When I was a member of the Constitutional Convention, I was critical of this rule, which was introduced into the Constitution by the German Government. Not only does it reflect national egoisms, but also – and this is a much more serious matter – it runs counter to the principle that workers should enjoy freedom of movement in a common Europe. In my judgement, this provision is one of the first things that should be submitted to scrutiny after the Constitution has entered into force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was an addition to the proposal for a Council decision, in that several areas of Title IV, Part III of the EC Treaty (visas, asylum, immigration and other policies concerning the free movement of persons) would then be governed by Article 251 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already argued on other occasions, I think that the Union should gradually consolidate its competences and practices rather than try to satisfy a constant appetite for new competences. Every proposal deals with sensitive material, and the report’s addition suffers from the maximalism typical of a centralising Europe, even though that path does not enjoy popular support.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not sure that the proposed revocation would strengthen the legal protection of European citizens and third country nationals in the slightest, as Mr Bourlanges claims it would. I believe, rather, that it would have exactly the opposite effect. I think Parliament would do better if it confined itself to supporting the proposal for a decision as presented – which in itself represents a major, ambitious advance for the area of freedom, security and justice – and if it could refrain from embarking on this unhealthy, voracious pursuit of ‘what lies beyond’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The scale of some disasters often overwhelms national response capacities. Mechanisms at European level, such as the one created by the current programme, are therefore becoming increasingly justified. The proposal takes a step in this direction, providing for an increase of EUR 1.5 million in 2004 to EUR 2.4 million per year in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this development, which forms part of the strengthened cooperation in the area of civil protection, which the EU began to address in the first Community Action Programme in the field of Civil Protection adopted in 1997, the most significant development of which was the creation of the Solidarity Fund for major disasters in November 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The Monitoring and Information Centre is very important, as it provides Member States or third countries with somewhere to send requests for assistance. A permanent network of contacts has thus been set up within the Commission aimed at establishing uninterrupted contact between the civil protection centres in the participating countries and at promoting the exchange of information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I applaud the Commission for tabling this proposal, because in so doing the Commission is keeping its promise to propose an amendment to the technical measures in force in the Community aimed at banning the use of bottom trawl gear up to at least 200 miles around the outermost regions of the Azores, Madeira and the Canaries, with the aim of protecting ecosystems in some of the most sensitive areas located at the ‘seamounts’ outside 100 miles.</p>
<p class="contents">The deep-water habitats that the Commission’s proposal is targeting were until recently protected from trawling (use of bottom trawl or similar towed nets operating in contact with the bottom of the sea), due to the special access regime laid down in accession negotiations. This regime ceased to apply in August 2004, and so it was essential to guarantee the continuity of the protection of these areas as part of Community legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Along with various Members of this House, I have campaigned for it to be reinstated and adopted in plenary. It is well known that this kind of net is extremely harmful to ecosystems, particularly given the overwhelming probability of ghost fishing. In the particular case of the Azores, the risk is all the greater given the volcanic nature of the seabed.

It is a country rich in natural resources and rich in the resources of its people. Both are being devastated by the political tyranny of the Mugabe regime.</p>
<p class="contents">People are suffering from hunger and health problems as a result of food and medical aid being withheld from areas that are covered by the opposition parties. Some 9 million people, 75% of the Zimbabwean population, are now said to be living below the poverty line, but the World Food Programme is only able to provide food for 1.6 million people this December. That is the first reason why this is an urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that on 3 March there is supposed to be an election in Zimbabwe. That election, on the present prospects, will be neither free nor fair. It is not up to us to decide who the people of Zimbabwe should elect. That is entirely for them, but they must be free to elect whomsoever they wish.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to the neighbouring countries of Africa and to the African Union to make sure that international standards of democracy pertain throughout Africa and throughout the country of Zimbabwe. It is up to the European Union to make sure that we support the monitoring of those elections, giving technical support and financial support, so that we can play our part in the international observer missions. That is also why it is an urgency today.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason is the intolerable attack on the liberty of Roy Bennett, one of their members of parliament, a man who has suffered, whose family has suffered and whose workers have suffered over the months. Mr Bennett pushed a government minister because he was making racial remarks about Mr Bennett and his family. He was then sent to prison, not by the courts, but by a vote in the parliament based on the political division.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge that the AU and the EU act today to bring a semblance of justice to the people of Zimbabwe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is interesting to note that the situation on the ground does not appear desperate. However, according to the statistics, the situation is probably worse in other parts of the country which I did not visit.</p>
<p class="contents">When debating such countries as Zimbabwe, where human rights are not even discussed because of fear of repression, we must consider the right attitude to take in order to try to influence the powers that be. We know we are dealing with a regime that is not democratic, that has taken tried to use almost all its powers to take away the democratic and fundamental rights of part of its population. On the other hand, we have seen recently that there is a silver lining. The courts, for instance, are striving from a very difficult position to try to retain some form of impartiality.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes I wonder whether a carrot-and-stick policy might be more appropriate and more fruitful than just passing motions of condemnation. We may pass this motion but what effect will it have? Very little, I think, with a regime like Mugabe's. We must start to think in different terms if we are to be effective when dealing with a regime of this sort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my constituency in the north-east of England, there are Zimbabweans who fear summary death if they are forced to return to their native land. I hope that Member State governments like my own, which think it is safe for asylum-seekers to be returned to Zimbabwe, will take note of the resolution tabled here this afternoon and revise their position.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Zimbabwe is getting worse, not better. On 9 December 2004, the Non-Governmental Organisations Act came into force. This Act bans foreign human rights organisations and gives the government powers to intervene in the operations of any NGO in Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, the quality of life for Zimbabweans has plummeted. Life expectancy is now 35 years. Zimbabwe could be self-sufficient in food, but last season it produced only a third of the maize it needs; yet the Mugabe regime is interfering with the international distribution of food.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this deteriorating situation, it is high time to tighten up targeted sanctions against the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">A final point: as we have heard, next March Zimbabwe is due to hold a general election. There are worrying indications that this election may not be held in free and fair conditions. Electoral legislation passed earlier this month did not meet international democratic standards. Good observation of the elections is going to be a vital part of ensuring that they are free and fair. Therefore I hope that we in Parliament, and the Council and the Commission, will provide the maximum possible support for election-observer missions at all levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For me, though, as an East German, it is always striking how often leaders who take office full of lofty ideals then, so to speak, distance themselves from their own original goals and visions and take less and less account of the people’s interests the longer they are in power.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe does, of course, even today have massive problems to contend with. I believe that the only thing we can recommend to Zimbabweans today is to look around them and see how their neighbours have managed it – to look at what South Africa is doing, at what Namibia is doing, at how Angola and Mozambique are trying to establish a balance between the various vested interests in their countries. If there is to be peace, there must be an attempt at mutual understanding, with the use of peaceful means and every interest, even the most diverse, taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe needs land reform, but there are other ways of going about it. The European Union should not always be, as it were, making recommendations to all and sundry on the basis of our values. Very often, that goes wrong; perhaps you all still recall the European Union’s staunch support for Russia’s President Yeltsin at a time when he was an alcoholic.</p>
<p class="contents">In this actual instance, we can be confident that the SADC will have influence and find opportunities, and that the African Union can act to move things forward. I am convinced that we, if we support these countries in their efforts to influence Zimbabwe, will be very likely to be able to help the elections scheduled for March to be fair and democratic after all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example, the Zimbabwean authorities have forced two newspapers expressing critical views to close in the past 18 months. In addition, Mugabe’s supporters have made, and continue to make, life as difficult as possible for the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly with a view to the approaching parliamentary elections in March 2005, the Mugabe regime is increasing the pressure on independent organisations, judging by the Non-governmental Organisations Act adopted in Harare exactly a week ago. In future, these shall no longer be permitted to receive any funding from abroad. If a Zimbabwean civil liberties or human rights organisation has so much as one foreign employee on its staff, it is henceforth termed foreign. Pursuant to the new Act, foreign NGOs cannot be registered and will therefore be banned in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this new legislation is clear. After all, numerous Zimbabwean civil liberties and human rights organisations rely on foreign donations. It is obvious that the intention of the Zimbabwean Government is to silence them. According to reports, the NGOs concerned are unwilling to submit to the Government’s attempt to gag them. That is an extremely courageous attitude. The Council and the Commission will have their work cut out to advise and assist them in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This tells us two things: firstly, that the situation remains serious and, secondly, that the measures that we have adopted have not been working.</p>
<p class="contents">What we must first condemn is the destruction of a country by an appalling authoritarian regime. As has been mentioned in this House, the poverty statistics are increasingly shocking; Zimbabwe used to be a country that, if properly managed, could not only have fed its entire population, but could also have helped to solve the problems of hunger and need on the African continent and in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mugabe regime, however, despite warnings from the EU and from further afield, continues to increase political oppression and we view the elections scheduled for March with great concern. Either the country undergoes a rapid transformation and offers even the slightest opportunity for debate or those elections will not be free and fair and one doubts whether it will even be worth observing them. Such is the case of Roy Bennette, of persecution perpetrated against Tsvangirai after his visit to this House, of the negative influence – and I wish to draw your attention to this – that the regime can have in the region, where regimes can choose to follow the path of democracy or to slip back into authoritarianism. I was recently in Mozambique, for example, where elections have been taking place. The count has yet to be completed. We became aware, however, that during the election campaign Mozambican voters voted abroad and that opposition parties – those opposed to FRELIMO – were persecuted in Zimbabwe. The conditions are in place, however. Zimbabwe’s destiny can decisively contribute towards consolidating the democracy that we hope for in the region, following the example of South Africa, thereby consolidating democratic aspirations in Mozambique and Angola. It may, on the other hand, represent a step backwards into forms of authoritarianism.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to point out that we have put increasing pressure on neighbouring countries and that we have developed dialogue with the African Union. This demonstrates the important role that that organisation has to play in exerting its form of pressure on Mugabe’s appalling regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following independence, it was also an economically promising country. It is sad to see that around 60% of the population is currently in financial crisis and frequently lives below the poverty line. That clearly says something about the administration of the country and what has gradually gone wrong with it. The sad thing is that Mugabe and the ZANU-PF party, particularly Mugabe’s inner circle, are the perpetrators. There are many in the ZANU-PF party, of course, who are very well aware of the need for outside help, of the need for the economy to develop in a different direction, if the country is to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that neighbouring countries have produced many informal contacts and endeavours to achieve a solution, and I think that it is precisely with these that the opportunities for the European Union lie. With the support of the African Union, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), President Mbeki and all the other contacts, we must increase the pressure, because it is only via the African route and the European Union’s connection with this that we stand a chance of achieving any kind of result.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the March elections have largely fallen into and been shaped by the wrong hands already, and it will be very difficult to make them fair and open. This renders observation close to pointless. Nevertheless, it is in that democratic process and in civil society that strength is to be found. That strength is still great in Zimbabwe, still non-violent and still oriented towards peace and democratic solutions. I hope that, by using smart sanctions, by taking the path that we, the European Union, are taking, and in consultation with those other countries, we shall do our utmost to take that democratic step there. The alternative path, bloodshed, offers no prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that we can use all our diplomatic means to increase the pressure to such a degree that Mugabe is surrounded by people who set the dominoes falling. This is necessary if the democratic path is to stand a chance of success there. Indeed, it is my hope that Europe will make full use of all the means at its disposal to this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group supports the wishes of the black majority of the population for the return of most of the land to them. Unfortunately, that wish is being seriously abused by Robert Mugabe, the man once popular as the leader of the successful war of liberation against the colonial occupiers and the racist minority Government of Ian Smith. It was not until the electorate had almost lost its trust in him that he made the long-promised land reform a priority. For Mugabe, the expropriation of large farms is now principally an instrument to reward his old following of freedom fighters at last after decades of delay. Still more, it forms part of a campaign to eliminate political opponents by means of slurs, intimidation and coercion. If Europe isolates this regime, it must do so not on the basis of old colonial interests and old colonial arrogance, but because we want to help every country in the world promote human rights and democracy.

The Commission reiterates its attachment to the holding of free and fair elections in that country. The recent introduction by the government of Zimbabwe of a set of electoral reforms which are currently under discussion in the Zimbabwean parliament is an important step. It will have to be assessed whether this will lead to a genuine incorporation into domestic electoral legislation of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) principles and guidelines governing democratic elections, as unanimously agreed in the SADC Summit in Mauritius last August.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains deeply concerned about the current political and human rights situation and the respect for fundamental freedoms which at this stage would hardly allow for free and fair elections.</p>
<p class="contents">A specific matter of concern is the approval by the Zimbabwean parliament, on 9 December, of the NGO Bill, which heavily restricts NGOs' room for action and activities. The Commission fully supports the proposed EU <span class="italic">démarches </span>in Harare and other SADC capitals as well as the issuing of an EU declaration expressing concerns regarding the implications of the bill.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also worried about the risk of politicisation of the distribution of food aid, mainly in the context of the upcoming parliamentary elections. In the event of clear verification of partisan use, the Commission, together with its partners, including the WFP, may have to envisage suspending food aid operations.</p>
<p class="contents">After the March elections the Commission will reassess the situation. Any lifting or easing of EU measures against Zimbabwe cannot be justified at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the deliberate attempts by the Zimbabwean authorities to undermine the visa ban's credibility by multiplying their travels to Europe and has always advocated a strict application of the exemptions provided for in the Council common position of 19 February 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to explore all avenues to influence the government of Zimbabwe and to pursue an enhanced political dialogue with neighbouring SADC countries, notably South Africa. Continued international pressure on Zimbabwe and especially regional peer pressure is necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is precisely what has been going on in Congo for decades, with people dying in their millions, vast stretches of land lying waste, and the economy crippled. As was the case in the aftermath of the Thirty Years’ War, there will be no resolution unless – as happened with the religious groups then – the ethnic groups can be brought into a peace process that also involves all the neighbouring states.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we see it as important that massive pressure should be brought to bear on the states bordering this country of great lakes, and especially on Rwanda, in order that it may bring stability once and for all and may be deterred from active intervention in Congo, which is already suffering so much. We will not, however, succeed in that by words alone, and so Mr Langen and I have started to develop a holistic strategy which finally interlinks economic policy, foreign policy and development policy. Words alone will be no use to us in this situation; Europe will be able to use its weight only if it makes simultaneous and strategic use of the economic, political and diplomatic options available to it and really gets actively involved in this peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you might well ask yourself what the use is of having this debate on a Thursday afternoon in a Chamber that is not exactly full. I can remember a time when this House debated how Lithuania could become more than a colony subject to Soviet oppression, and today we have a Lithuanian Commissioner in our midst. Of that I am glad, and I am sure that you are well able to handle this issue of peace and human rights in Congo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The International Rescue Committee reckons that 3.8 million people have now been killed and over a million of those are children. Apart from those killed, 3.4 million have been displaced.</p>
<p class="contents">Congolese and foreign military groups continue to use violence to conceal the plundering of gold, timber, ivory, tin and other natural resources. Meanwhile, the fragile and ineffectual transitional Congolese government stumbles from political stalemate to military crisis. Both the transitional government and its international partners have failed to deal with the root causes of the conflict. Natural resource exploitation has funded and fuelled the instability in the country and, indeed, has fuelled instability and violence in the Congo for over a hundred years. What should have been a blessing to that country has turned out to be a source of deep sadness and regret and, indeed, a curse. The Congo's natural wealth has been a source of private funding for military and political elites instead of benefiting the vast majority of the Congolese population.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution rightly calls for a package of measures to tackle this situation. We must take action to ensure respect for the arms embargo; the UN Security Council must impose sanctions, travel restrictions, a ban on financial services, etcetera, on individuals who have participated in the pillaging of Congolese assets; the EU and its Member States must act against companies involved in exploitation; we need a peacekeeping force in the east of the country; and action must be taken to disarm all illegally armed groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Only if such measures are taken can we hold out any hope that the elections due next year will make any difference to the tragic situation in that country. The problem in the Congo is neither ethnic nor racial. It is about economics, and only if we tackle economics will we solve the problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The current situation in eastern Congo shows that the Congolese peace process is still very fragile. Indeed, there have been reports of new exchanges of fire yesterday. The ALDE Group warmly welcomed the initiative to draft an urgency resolution on the Congo. Ultimately, however, our group decided not to endorse the compromise resolution. We feel that the compromise text fails to identify the core problem of the continuing instability in the region and of the difficult relationship between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its neighbouring countries, especially Rwanda.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is this: since the end of the Rwandan genocide in 1994 a large group of extremist Hutus have been hiding in a remote area of the Congolese rainforest in the east of the Congo. After all these years they have still not been disarmed. The presence of these heavily armed militias is a constant threat to the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to security in the entire Great Lakes region. The massacre at the Burundian refugee camp of Gatumba last August was only one in a long series of provocative actions. MONUC, the UN Peacekeeping Mission in the Congo, was supposed to disarm and neutralise the rebels, but has failed to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Although MONUC's mandate has been strengthened and there are extra troops, they are poorly trained and there is a serious lack of information and technical assistance. We feel that the joint resolution does not acknowledge that if Rwanda is crossing the border into the Congo to put an end to the activity of the armed gangs, it is happening in the context of MONUC having failed to do the disarming.</p>
<p class="contents">We would suggest that the European Union and the Member States need to get more actively involved in the DRC and the Great Lakes region, focusing very much on rapid disarmament of the rebel forces. Perhaps European troops could be used to strengthen the UN peacekeeping forces. The troops from Pakistan, Nepal, Uruguay and other countries that are in the Congo at the moment simply do not have enough experience with military operations in sub-Saharan Africa. Europe has that experience.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to consider all the options in order to make disarmament happen. It is by far the most important prerequisite to get the peace process back on track.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, we feel that although the resolution has many points that we support, it is unbalanced. So, with regret, I will abstain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the report on asylum and sustainable solutions that Parliament adopted yesterday, one of the things we agreed was that the European Union's common foreign policy and common security policy needed to focus on conflict resolution and prevention, paying special attention to long-term conflict situations. This is exactly what we have in the DRC where, as has already been pointed out, the desire to control natural resources plays an absolutely key role in the massive displacements of people and in the massive numbers of deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">We stress the need for an effective means of arms control and an effective disarmament programme to be put in place. We would also endorse the call made for the UN to deal with those profiteering from the pillage of natural resources, not least through the freezing of bank accounts and actions against companies. We feel perfectly able to do this in the case of what we believe to be terrorist organisations, but seem totally incapable of doing it with those who cause massive numbers of deaths elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We also regret the need but welcome the fact that the UN Department of Peace-Keeping Operations has set up a special investigative team to look at the cases of sexual abuse and exploitation perpetrated by some of its own members in the UN organising mission in the DRC, particularly in Bunia. We know, since this Parliament has discussed it on many occasions, that rape is used as a means to demoralise opponents by demonstrating the people cannot even protect their own families.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has recognised on many occasions that victims of rape, child victims of sex abuse, are particularly vulnerable. So we consider it despicable that such crimes are also being committed by those sent to protect an already traumatised population. We look for the perpetrators to be brought to justice, as well as those profiteering from the tragedy in the DRC. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following a conflict that, during its six years, claimed three million lives, but that continues to claim 31 000 lives every month, according to the International Rescue Committee, the signs are that the situation remains unstable and unfortunately extremely unpredictable.</p>
<p class="contents">The ACP-EU joint parliamentary assembly recently met in The Hague. Our meeting opened, curiously, with the good news of the Dar-es-Salam Conference and of the commitment made there by all Heads of Government to end the conflict. By Thursday, however, when we ended the meeting, our joint Chairman, Glenys Kinnock, had brought us the sad news that the Rwandan army had crossed the border into the Democratic Republic of Congo. We must therefore be more effective in this area in order to stabilise the region. Mr Posselt’s comparison with the Thirty Years’ War was most apt and I hope that he is right, because if so the conflict will come to an end and those regions of the African continent will be as prosperous, stable and modern as Germany is today. This is what we strive for. The African continent must be stabilised in open and democratic societies.</p>
<p class="contents">What must we do in this House? We must acknowledge that we are not doing enough as regards the militias of the former government of Rwanda. They are a source of instability and an excuse for permanent instability in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and we must take stronger action to disarm them. We must make it clear that any invasion is unacceptable and that respect for a country’s borders is a principle that must be applied by all countries in the region. We must complete the democratic transformation of the Democratic Republic of Congo and do what we can to stabilise the country; the Congolese army must be reunified, for example. We must strengthen the resources available to the United Nations’ mission in order to guarantee genuine peace and stability in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and to succeed in creating conditions on the ground that do not take us backwards; in other words, conditions that lead all sides to honour the 2003 peace agreements, that lead all sides to honour agreements undertaken in Tanzania on 20 November of this year and that lead all sides duly to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder whether any debate, even one held in this House, can help to counter poverty in developing countries. Over 5 billion people in such countries live on one or two dollars a day, and a bloody children’s war is being fought in Congo, where over 300 000 children are fighting in military interventions which have killed more than 3 million people in recent years. Does such destruction of childhood through enforced labour, recruitment to the armed forces and sexual exploitation not demonstrate lack of responsibility and failure on the part of the various humanitarian and international organisations?</p>
<p class="contents">In order to take measures to prevent tragedies of this kind, it is necessary to begin by identifying their causes. The most fundamental of these is the long-term and wide-ranging exploitation of developing countries by a number of world powers, including European countries. The latter profit from such exploitation while the looted colonies are left even poorer. Congo is devastated, having become the victim of exploiters for whom the country’s abundant natural resources are more important than human lives. I believe that a person’s level of civilisation should be measured in terms of how responsible their attitude is to the weakest, and the same is true for those in power. Yet the weakest among us should not be provided with aid that is merely a sham, and takes the form of moral devastation, contraception and abortion. Much more is needed. Comprehensive care should be provided, and development facilitated. In addition, malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS, which are prevalent in the country, should be treated, and family units helped to develop soundly. I also believe that instead of sending armed forces and instructors to Iraq, we should take steps to ensure that peace finally prevails in Congo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, we are very concerned by the threats of Rwanda to use force against the territorial integrity of the Congo in order to neutralise the ex-FAR and Interahamwe troops, and by the multiple reports of military operations by the Rwandan army in the eastern Congo. The humanitarian crisis that these actions generate is an additional reason for our concern.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to the stability of the region that Rwanda withdraws without delay any forces it may have in the territory of the DRC, and refrain from any action or statement that contravenes international law.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission is deeply convinced that until the problem of the presence of ex-FAR elements in the eastern DRC is definitively solved, it will undermine peace and security in the region, be a source of instability and a threat to civilian populations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the European Commission is convinced that the local government should make use of existing mechanisms, including the Joint Verification Mechanism and the Tripartite Commission, to find a peaceful solution. Furthermore, the Congo should implement without delay its plan, established with the support of the United Nations Organisation’s Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), aimed at accelerating the disarmament and demobilisation of foreign armed groups. It should also speed up the integration and the training of its national army in order to effectively disarm the ex-FAR militias.</p>

The issues we generally debate are important, but they relate to financial perspectives, communications solutions and economic matters. These are all extremely important issues, but they are not tragic.</p>
<p class="contents">The three items on the agenda for today’s afternoon debate, and in particular the third item on Bhopal, concern one of the greatest tragedies to have occurred during the past few decades. This item relates to a tragedy in which a gas explosion caused the immediate death of several tens of thousands of people. The consequences of this explosion are unfortunately still being felt today. The institutions and persons to be named shortly are responsible for this sad state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">The organisations which are to blame for what happened have admitted their guilt, as they have paid out compensation for the deaths of 15 248 people. They have also paid out compensation to 554 895 individuals who have fallen ill or become disabled, whilst attempting to pay such compensation to as few people as possible. Broad estimates suggest that over 100 000 people have suffered as a result of the gas explosion in Bhopal 25 years ago, and millions are still suffering to this day due to environmental pollution. What happened in the aftermath of the event? Following an agreement and various court rulings, the guilty party, Union Carbide Corporation India, paid out USD 470 million in compensation. This would appear to be no mean sum, but the victims of the explosion received less than 10% of the money. The rest went to the lawyers. In passing, it is worth noting that even in Dickens’ tales of 150 years ago, in which he enjoyed describing predatory lawyers, there are no instances of a victim receiving virtually nothing. The money vanished, because in addition to paying the lawyers’ fees, large amounts were allegedly used to pay off corrupt officials.</p>
<p class="contents">It is intolerable that everyone has made money from this tragedy except its victims. We are witnesses to a conspiracy, and action must be taken to put things right. This is the aim of the motion for a resolution we are to adopt today. We must endeavour to reassess the damage, so that compensation is paid to those entitled to it. We must ensure that bodies are appointed which can resolve this problem fairly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we have heard, in the dead of night on 2 December 1984, a deadly 40 tonnes of known and unknown poisons leaked into the air. The people of Bhopal tried to escape the poisonous cloud. Their efforts were, however, futile and nearly 4 000 people died instantaneously; to date 25 000 innocent people have died.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the bare brutal facts and today the people of Bhopal are still suffering from this horrifying legacy. That is why we cannot just remember, but must act as a community to help another. We need to ask why after 20 years the pursuit of justice has been so difficult for the survivors. We need to ask why the transnational corporation involved denies any continuing liability, either for the state of the Bhopal site or the victims' health.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ask why the site has not been cleaned of toxic waste and continues to pollute the water the surrounding communities rely on. We need to know just how Dow Chemicals can close the door on what was one of the worst industrial disasters in this century.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to ask why so many people are still awaiting adequate compensation. I appreciate the issue of compensation is mired in endless arguments as to the calculations, but this is not a sufficient reason for the people of Bhopal to have to relive the experience day after day.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I support the major part of the resolution and the sentiment behind it, I do not believe the proposed amendments add anything constructive to this resolution. It is vital when we talk about disasters such as Bhopal that we do not descend into polemics and irrationality. The allocation of blame is all too often misplaced and we often condemn all agents without establishing all the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">As chair of Parliament's South-Asia SAARC delegation, I would urge you to keep all these matters in perspective, and the budget of each country is particularly relevant. We must recognise the limitation of certain countries, which may not yet have developed the technologies or know-how to deal with such disasters as quickly and as safely as we have come to expect in our own countries. We must also attempt to see each angle of an issue such as the Bhopal disaster, and we should acknowledge the work that has already been done by the Indian Government and the Madhya Pradesh Government with regard to medical care, economic and social assistance, environmental clean-up, and finally financial compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">This short list goes to prove that a lot of work has already been done. I feel it would be unproductive to vilify a government that has made efforts to remedy and address the plethora of problems stemming from Bhopal. Rather, we need to employ all our diplomatic efforts to keep the pressure on the Indian Government to maintain its current efforts in providing compensation and working on detoxification of the area. Nevertheless, if we demand that action is taken and money is spent, we should also be prepared to help in any way we can, including offering technical and financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not condemn without first examining what we, as a community, can do to help. We should continue to be constructive and offer the humanitarian, ecological and medical expertise we have to the Government of Madhya Pradesh. This is a role for the Commission, Member States and governments alike. I would urge you, therefore, to pressure all those who can bring any relief to those who have already suffered in Bhopal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than 7 000 people died within days, but inaction has seen 15 000 further deaths which could have been avoided. Even today, 20 years on, neither side seems to care about the suffering, only about their reputations. As many as 100 000 people are suffering chronic and debilitating illnesses, with 10 to 15 people a month continuing to die.</p>
<p class="contents">The survivors still wait for justice: compensation and medical assistance in many cases. The plant site, which continues to pollute, will cost an estimated GBP 15 million to decommission, compared with Dow's yearly sales of GBP 16 billion and India's GDP of GBP 320 billion. The Indian Government has also yet to spend USD 330 million of the original compensation given to them by Union Carbide. The pollution in the water supply in nearby slums is also 500 times above the maximum recommended WHO levels.</p>
<p class="contents">How can the international community, a multinational company and one of the world's main countries, stand by and watch this happen? Just now it should not be about who is to blame, but who is going to stop the suffering. Bhopal resident, Abdul Jabbar Khan, who runs the Bhopal Women Gas Victims' Industrial Association, said in the Guardian newspaper in the UK: 'In New York after 9/11 there was compensation, punishment and clean-up in just a few months.

They rely on the rich countries in the North for imports of expensive products based on new industrial technology. That makes these countries extremely dependent on imports and exports and results in a trade balance very unfavourable to them. Just like the time when European countries exerted administrative power through military force, this distribution is still leading to permanent poverty and underdevelopment in the Developing World.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to see, then, why the governments of these countries thought that all new industries were to their advantage, in particular large-scale metal and chemicals industries. These countries had held little attraction for this kind of industry in the past, not only because the workforce was still insufficiently trained, but chiefly because most customers were in richer parts of the world and transporting finished products was expensive. The only industry that took root originated from State-owned enterprises or served only the local market and the tourists.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for stronger industry in these countries was and is abused by industries from the rich North because, although these industries want to expand, the southern countries are still not very important as markets whilst their purchasing power remains low. Investment in the South does become an attractive prospect for them, however, if wages are low and, in particular, if environmental and safety requirements there are less exacting or very poorly monitored. This makes it possible for disasters in which many people suffer incurable illness or lose their lives to occur. This danger threatens not only the employees of those enterprises but also the people living in the neighbourhood. Where disasters do happen, enterprises are not willing to bear the costs. The gas explosion twenty years ago in Bhopal and the way in which this was dealt with have a great deal to do with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither Union Carbide nor Dow Chemical nor the Indian Government are willing to produce sufficient compensation for the 20 000 or more people killed, for more than 100 000 people left with permanent injuries, or for cleaning up the contamination of soil and ground water. A solution must be found, and disasters of this nature must never happen again. Let us Europeans take our responsibility, let us join in making payments if necessary, and most importantly let us lay down rules to ensure that this kind of error is not repeated by European enterprises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, its harmful effects and environmental pollution are still affecting the lives of thousands of individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">This leak killed over 7 000 people during the night of 2 to 3 December 1984. A further 15 000 people died later as a result of it. The leak is also responsible for chronic illnesses affecting more than 100 000 people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Indian Government and Union Carbide or Dow Chemical, the current owner of the fertiliser plant, have assumed responsibility for the impact of the accident on the lives of thousands of people and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">As stated in the resolution the House is to vote on today, an independent investigation of the current situation in Bhopal must be carried out. This could be undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights. Experts must be involved. They should visit India and consider the consequences of Union Carbide’s<span class="italic"> </span>activities and the Bhopal disaster in terms of pollution of underground waters and the environment. Clearly, this also has consequences for human rights in the affected areas and communities.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the tragic case of Bhopal highlights the need to require companies to assume the same responsibilities as states in today’s globalised world economy. Companies must be party to international agreements and conventions. Impact assessments need to be undertaken, both as regards respect for human rights and situations of armed conflict and tension.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the rationale underpinning the amendments proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. I appeal to honourable Members to study them carefully before deciding how to vote. I should also like to take this opportunity to publicise the proposal made by the School of Peace Culture of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Accordingly, I call on the House and the European Union to promote 3 December as an international day of corporate responsibility and human rights. The aim is for companies to commit to the promotion and protection of human rights the world over.</p>
<p class="contents">This special date should be an opportunity for states, international bodies and civil society, amongst others, to reflect on their shared responsibility. All international actors share the duty of creating a fairer and more sustainable world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They suffer from pains in the stomach, headaches, anaemia and gynaecological problems because they have no alternative but to drink from those wells.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the problem we are facing in Bhopal today, and we are facing it 20 years after that catastrophe, when so many people died. The figures range from 3 000 to 7 000 on one night; 15 000 later on and 100 000 people still suffering from debilitating diseases. We are talking about 15 years after the settlement which gave US$500 million to the Indian Government to disburse for compensation and rectification of that landscape. It is still a picture of desolation and danger for those people.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this Parliament do not do well when we seek to be judge and jury in these cases. That is why I cannot accept the Green amendments that have been referred to. The motion itself stands well because it calls on the European Union to work with the Government of India to use the money that is available to make sure that there is a clean-up of those sites, treatment of affected people and compensation to those affected; and now, not in another 20 years. That is our message to all those affected: to the European Union; to the Indian Government; by all means, to Dow Chemicals and its responsibilities and to the courts which will be looking at that. But today we seek justice for those people and renovation of the environment in that part of the world and the health of its people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To this day, some 25 000 have gone down in history as the victims of the biggest chemical accident ever recorded, and some 500 000 are still crippled as a consequence of it.</p>
<p class="contents">What, though, was done for the victims? Research has shown that, 15 years ago, compensation to the tune of USD 470 million was agreed on by Union Carbide and the Indian Government. So far, the 100 000 officially registered as victims have received USD 300 each. There are 2 500 houses for widows along with seven hospitals, and many facilities have been built, but what has happened to the rest of the money, some USD 400 million? I have to tell Mrs Gill that we really do have to ask who is to blame for that. The ground is still contaminated. The ground water is heavily contaminated with mercury, and that is not going to go away. Toxic residues are stored in the open air. Small wonder, then, that we end up with the situation that Mr Bowis has described, with chronic illnesses, brain damage, and children born with deformities. If there is to be any substantial improvement in medical provision for the victims, then the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Singh, will have to intervene, and the government should comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling and finally release the funds and enable full compensation to be paid out. Many chemical companies still have production operations in India and in other parts of the world where labour and environmental standards are far below those that apply in the European Union or the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs’ rapporteur on the REACH programme, I can do no other than reiterate the demand made in the working paper: if there is to be comparability, we need rules made by the European Union, and, in the same way, rules laid down as standards by the WTO. Those whose desire for increased profits leads them to allow the minimum environmental requirements without exception are accepting the likelihood of a second Bhopal one day, and that is something that none of us can afford. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, it is not enough to jog the memory, it is not enough to condemn what is often the unaccountable operation of multinational companies in developing countries, it is not enough just to state our humanitarian awareness in words. This sort of tragedy may be experienced again by people in some other part of the world if the international community does not move to introduce international mechanisms for controlling the operation of multinational companies, for protecting the environment and for protecting human rights and the rights of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where the role of the European Union within the framework of the UN and within the framework of other international organisations may be more efficient. The motion records the problems which still exist and numerous honourable members spoke about them in the area of Bhopal as a whole.

<p class="contents">As Ernest Hemingway once said, ‘never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee’. It is to be welcomed that the European Parliament is concerning itself with regions of the world that are far removed from Europe, and that it is doing so without regard to the requirements of political interest. On the one hand, the European Union has declared a strategic partnership with India, and yet on the other hand, Parliament’s resolution states that the Indian Government has done little to protect people from the effects of the Bhopal disaster. We are discussing the negligence of the Indian authorities, and rightly so, yet we should also make known our views on the liability of the US company that imposed savage nineteenth-century capitalism and failed to observe any of the safety requirements that were mandatory in the USA. The figures are as follows; 7 000 deaths in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, and up to 30 000 deaths over the 20 years which followed, with over 100 000 having fallen ill to date. Obviously these statistics cannot express the human suffering, and merely conceal the pain and tears.</p>

This mandate refers to the implementation of the military aspects of Annex 1A and 2 of General Framework Agreement of Peace.</p>
<p>The execution of EUFOR tasks is based upon the Operation Plan approved by the Council. The Operation plan details the rights and obligations of EUFOR. It also provides guidance with regard to all legal aspects of the EUFOR mission, including aspects relating to the implementation of internationally recognised standards of human rights and professional standards of behaviour. Member States and non-EU participating third States have the responsibility to train the forces to respect and abide by general international law, conventions and treaties applicable to the military operation.</p>
<p>Implementation of the guidance laid down in the Operation Plan is the responsibility of the EUFOR Commander. Exercise of jurisdiction is regulated through the status of forces agreements relating to EUFOR. As in any international military operation, the responsibility for investigation and, if required, prosecution of allegations of misconduct is the responsibility of contingent commanders and the competent authorities of the sending State.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0448"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council has underlined during the negotiations on the “Framework decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug traffic” the importance of taking a strong stance against drug trafficking at all levels and emphasised the need for a transnational and coherent approach in combating drug trafficking. Nevertheless, it is the Presidency's view that recently agreed pertinent texts on drugs such as the Framework Decision laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking and the EU Drugs Strategy, don't provide or imply that coffee shops in the Netherlands will be forced to close down within five years.</p>
<p>In the EU Drugs Strategy to be endorsed by the European Council (tomorrow) it is affirmed that the evaluation of the functioning of the above mentioned Framework Decision including its effect on international judicial co-operation in the field of illicit drug trafficking, will form an integral part of the strategy. In the strategy, it is also provided that the Member States will make efforts towards consistency of the standards of the prosecution practices in the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0451"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council exchanged views prior to the Kosovo Assembly elections on 23 October 2004 and</p>
<p>looked forward to the elections being conducted in a peaceful and democratic environment and in a</p>
<p>free and fair manner, with the widest participation of all communities. In fact, international observers agreed that the elections were conducted in line with international standards and in a calm and peaceful atmosphere. However, the very low turnout of Kosovo Serbs was disappointing. The Council had stressed the importance of the early formation of a functioning Government, fully committed to the Standards implementation which will be reviewed in mid-2005. Kosovo has established a new coalition government which received approval by the Parliament. The EU will look to the newly elected and now established bodies of the Provisional Institutions for Self-Government (PISG) for the effective implementation of the Kosovo Standards and full co-operation with the SRSG and other representatives of the international community.</p>
<p>Regarding the future of Kosovo, the Council, in the context of the Assembly elections, reiterated its commitment to a multi-ethnic Kosovo, ensuring full protection of minorities, contributing to the stability of the region and consistent with EU values and standards. The UN Security Council Resolution 1244 remains the basis of the international community's engagement in Kosovo and the lead and overall responsibility in Kosovo lies with the UN. The EU continues to fully support the efforts of the SRSG for the implementation of UNSC1244. It is clear that people of a multi-ethnic and democratic Kosovo will have their place in Europe and that the EU will be called upon to assume an increasingly greater role. The EU, therefore, intends to continue being actively engaged in the international debate about the future of Kosovo.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0453"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council informs the Honourable Parliamentarian that the implications of the current demographic trends for future economic and social policy goals are one of the issues being addressed by the Member States and the Council, and that the matter has recently been discussed during the European Council of 4/5 November in the context of the preparation of the Lisbon Strategy mid-term review. The European Council not only confirmed the validity and relevance of the Lisbon process, which identified the demographic challenge in the context of the EU medium term policy approach for economic growth and social cohesion, but also stressed the importance of the Mid-Term Review to be undertaken at the Spring European Council in 2005. In particular, the European Council took note of the letter of the Heads of State or Government of France, Germany, Spain and Sweden pointing out the importance of demographic factors in shaping the future economic and social development of Europe and calling for the elaboration of a “European Pact for Youth”.</p>
<p>This matter was also discussed later by the Council (Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs) on 7 December in the context of a policy debate on a new Social Policy Agenda from 2006 – 2010, on the basis of a Dutch Presidency's note based on the outcome of a series of events and conferences, in particular, the closing conference, “Social Policy in Europe: let’s deliver” held in Rotterdam on 8/9 November. The Presidency paper identifies six priority areas, or building blocks, for future action in the new Social Policy Agenda, which were broadly supported by all delegations. Member States are invited to develop comprehensive active ageing strategies by 2006, aiming at a radical policy and cultural shift away from early retirement towards longer working lives, and aiming at the participation of all. The Presidency also identified the need to activate Europe’s unused labour potential and the need for greater efforts by governments, social partners and individual employers and employees to achieve better possibilities for the reconciliation of work and family life.</p>
<p>In this context, the initiative for a European Youth Pact suggested by the French, German, Spanish and Swedish governments, was particularly welcomed, and the need to reconcile professional and family life stressed, as better care facilities and infrastructures for children and the elderly would improve participation in economic life.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0462"></a>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Parliamentarian is certainly aware, in the field of social security each Member State remains responsible for its own social security legislation including the benefits provided, the conditions for eligibility and the value of these benefits. However, Regulation (EEC) No. 1408/71 provides for Community provisions for the co-ordination of these systems. Such coordination ensures that migrant workers and members of their families do not lose their social security protection when moving within the Community.</p>
<p>A major principle of Reg. 1408/71 is that a person shall be subject to the legislation of only one Member State. In this respect, the Regulation provides for the application of the legislation of the Member State where the person is employed. A seaman employed on a vessel is subject to the legislation of the Member State whose flag the vessel is flying. Furthermore, Reg. 1408/71 requires that the basic principles of equality of treatment and non-discrimination are respected. Consequently, a seaman resident in one Member State but employed on board of a vessel sailing under the flag of another Member State is subject to the legislation and will be entitled to social security coverage of this latter on the same footing of any of its nationals employed on board of the same vessel.</p>
<p>Article 17 of this Regulation provides for the possibility to derogate from the principle of lex loci laboris as two Member States may conclude a bilateral agreement in situations where the standard rule may create - as pointed out by the ECJ in the Brusse judgment (case C-101/83) - administrative complications for workers, as well as for employers and social security authorities, thus creating obstacles to the freedom of movement for workers. However, it must be stressed that such agreements, which can be concluded for certain persons or categories of persons, must be in the interests of these persons.</p>
<p>In this context, it is for the Member States to ensure that any bilateral agreements derogating to the lex loci laboris principle are in the interest of the worker, such decisions being obviously open to challenge before the European Court of Justice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0477"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council has continuously followed the situation of the European Textiles and Clothing industry over the last years as it developed in the wake of the dismantling of quotas for the imports of Textiles and Clothing products from WTO Members.</p>
<p>The establishment and the expiry of the ATC (Agreement on Textiles and Clothing) are part and parcel of the results of the Uruguay Round, concluded in 1994. Since then, it was clear that "as from 1 January 2005, the textiles and clothing sector shall be fully integrated into GATT 1994" (ATC, Article 9).</p>
<p>China is a member of the WTO since 2001, and as such has benefited from the last step of liberalisation, the so-called third stage, and will fully share the benefits of the abolition of quotas. Nevertheless, at the moment of accession of China to the WTO, a protocol was agreed as well. Under this protocol, a specific safeguard for textiles can be activated until 31 December 2008.</p>
<p>It is before this background among others that the Council has quite recently again discussed the situation of the European Textiles and Clothing industry and has adopted, on 25/26 November 2004, a set of conclusions on this subject, in which, inter alia:</p>
<p>it stresses the important role of SMEs in the textile sector. There is a need to improve access of these enterprises to finance by using Community financial instruments to provide European leverage and support for SME financing, including their access to support for research and innovation;</p>
<p>it invites the Commission to regularly inform the Council on the developments in the EU textiles and clothing sector in the aftermath of the dismantling of import quotas from 1 January 2005 and in the light of the implementation of the proposed initiatives; it also invites the Commission to report on the outcome of the further discussions of the High Level Group; and</p>
<p>notes the Commission's readiness to use the available trade defence instruments, if the legal conditions are met and if and when they are effectively needed.</p>
<p>The Council on 13/14 December 2004 has adopted a regulation adopting EU provisions on imports of certain textile products in order to take account of the WTO Agreement and Clothing expiry on 31 December 2004. Among others, the new rules foresee:</p>
<p>the introduction of a time limited ex ante monitoring system for certain imports from China and a customs-based ex post monitoring system for certain imports;</p>
<p>an end-of-year shipment regime for products shipped before the expiry of the ATC but released for free circulation in the Community after that date.</p>

<p>(EN) The Council, in response to the question of the Honourable Parliamentarian which addresses the guarantees for the respect for fundamental rights in relation to the application of the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), intends to stress that fundamental rights were very much in focus when the Framework Decision was negotiated in the Council, and building on preexisting national experiences with extradition, found expression in the final agreed text.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Framework Decision is based on the principle of mutual recognition, which involves a high degree of trust between the EU Member States, based on their common sharing of democratic values and on their participation to the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights. Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) provides that fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the 1950 Convention and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to Member States, are general principles of Community law. These principles have been reflected notably in Article 1(3) of the Framework Decision, which provides that the Framework Decision shall not have the effect of modifying the obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the TEU. Recital 12 of the Framework Decision also addresses the issue of fundamental rights, specifying for example, that the Framework Decision does not prevent a Member States from applying its constitutional rules relating to due process, freedom of association, freedom of the press and freedom of expression in other media. The same care not to hamper the full respect for and exercise of fundamental rights was also very much in the focus when negotiating the grounds for refusing to execute an arrest warrant. Difficulties concerning human rights in the practical application of the Framework Decision have not been reported.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0484"></a>

The new challenges call for investment, and only an integrated approach to research and innovation can succeed. A bottom-up approach is one of the main preconditions for involving the public more in decision-making. Not only parliaments and the whole range of civil society but, in particular, towns and regions too must be involved in the Lisbon Process. Various federal states and the Netherlands too encourage regions to exploit economic potential and invest in regional economic strengths. In addition, in the forthcoming period it is advocated that funds be deployed more flexibly because the transition to an intensive knowledge-based economy requires efforts to bring about innovation with regard to markets and products. The Kok Report primarily stresses national action plans.

<p>(EN) The Council would inform the Honourable Member that, in response to the ways in which the European Union has developed since the Maastricht Treaty, resulting in a wider range of activities, in extension and strengthening of the role of the Secretary-General/High Representative for the CFSP and in an unprecedented increase in the number of Member States, the Council has embarked upon an ongoing adjustment and modernisation process, so as to be efficient and flexible enough to discharge its new tasks and responsibilities.</p>
<p>In doing so, the Council has come up against a number of administrative, technical, budgetary and even staffing constraints, with the entry into force of the new Staff Regulations on 1 May 2004, not to mention the institutional constraints imposed by successive amendments to the Treaties over that time. Such constraints, set to continue for the years ahead, have nevertheless marked out this six-month term as one of transition, which in any case makes it particularly difficult, premature though this be at present, to assess the results achieved. The Presidency can, however, already be seen to have made extensive use of the resources available to it, in all areas of EU action, in order to conduct Council business as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Institutionally speaking, the Council would remind the Honourable Member that, following the European Council meeting on 16 and 17 December 2004, the Presidency will be reporting to the European Parliament on the results of its six-month term, on 21 December 2004, before the Conference of Presidents of political groups, meeting in open session. To do so before then would be jumping the gun.</p>
<p>As regards the pension scheme for EU officials, on 22 March 2004 the Council adopted Regulation No 723/2004 (OJ L 124, 27.4.2004) amending the Staff Regulations of officials and other staff of the European Communities. The 28th, 29th and 30th recitals in that Regulation set out very clearly the reasons for a thorough overhaul of the Staff Regulations, particularly on pensions. Given the recent agreement on the Statute in March 2004, further reform in this area was not as such on the agenda of the Dutch Presidency.</p>
<p>With more specific regard to the scheme's actuarial balance, the Commission has recently, on 3 November 2004, proposed adjusting the level of contributions from officials and other staff, which will rise from 9,25% to 9,75%, with retroactive effect from 1 July 2004, in accordance with Article 83a(3) of the Staff Regulations and the implementing rules laid down in Annex XII to them.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0494"></a>

<p>To date, the policy of regulation has resulted in restrictions on the production of sugar. For example sugar mills in Poland have not been allocated the full production quotas they require to meet the needs of the national market. At the same time, the price of sugar has risen by 64%. It is generally believed that this policy favours neither technological progress within the industry nor the industry's competitiveness on EU and world markets. It raises living costs for the poorest sectors of society and also social costs, and, in the long term, generates a whole system of refunds subsidised by the EU, and protectionism. This situation is unhealthy. We are trying to compete in the export field on the basis of refunds instead of profitable production, which requires technological modernisation and improved organisation.

<p>(FR) As early as October 2003, the Council launched a debate on the reform of the CMO for sugar based on the communication which the Commission had forwarded to it on 23 September 2003, with the intention in particular of opening discussion on the objectives of the Community scheme for sugar in the context of the new CAP on the basis of the information contained in the in-depth evaluation of the impact on the European sugar sector and an analysis of the various reform options.</p>
<p>The Council continued this debate when examining the Commission communication accomplishing a sustainable agricultural model for Europe through the reformed CAP - sugar sector reform, presented on 15 July 2004. During the policy debate held at the Agriculture/Fisheries Council on 22 November 2004, all Member State delegations agreed on the need to reform the sugar sector but were divided as to the extent of such reform and the approach underlying the Commission communication. The very question of whether or not such a reform was advisable was raised, as postponing it until after 2006 might, where necessary, make it possible to take account of uncertainties at international level (position of the ACP countries, that of the LDCs in the context of the Everything But Arms initiative, outcome of the WTO Panel and the Doha Round).</p>
<p>The Council will have occasion to continue these discussions when the Commission presents its legislative proposal during the first half of next year. It is therefore too early at this stage to prejudge the outcome of proceedings and discussions that will be conducted in the Council in due course.</p>
<p>However, the Council will not fail to pay particular attention to the economic and social impact of reform. The Council, together with the Commission, and after consideration of the European Parliament's opinion under the consultation procedure, will make every effort to find a solution striking a balance between the different interests at stake.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0495"></a>

<p>The Cotonou Agreement is due to be revised at the end of 2004 or the beginning of 2005. The Commission is proposing to incorporate a specific reference to the Millennium Objectives declaration into partnership agreements with the ACP countries. However, the proposal is not clear on this point, whereas on the subject of action to combat terrorism and weapons of mass destruction the proposed clauses are already highly advanced and they would thus appear to have priority status. Experience has shown that the European Union has not succeeded in implementing its political discourse on the Millennium Objectives, which are not reflected either in the EU's political development priorities or in the budget allocated thereto.</p>
<p>How is the Commission planning to incorporate the Millennium Objectives into the Cotonou Agreement? How does it intend to measure the EU's efforts to achieve those objectives and at the same time to increase its partner countries' ability to do so as well? What proportion of the budget is it planning to allocate and how will it assess the impact of such aid?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Negotiators for both sides soon agreed that a reference to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) should be added to the preamble to the Cotonou Agreement. This was not a controversial issue; it involved the replacement and extension of the goal of reducing poverty referred to in the current version of the Cotonou Agreement. This revision must be seen as a simple update, adapting the Cotonou Agreement to the MDG process.</p>
<p>The Cotonou Agreement is not best suited to discussion of the ways in which specific commitments to MDGs may be implemented in cooperation with ACP countries. Being a multiannual legal framework, the Cotonou Agreement sets out general parameters for cooperation, and these are in perfect conformity with the Millennium Goals, but specific action is taken, and specific commitments made, in the context of the strategy documents for countries and regions.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that potential additional commitments by donors to the achievement of the Millennium Goals will be discussed over the next nine months as part of the preparations for the high level event on the follow-up to the Millennium Summit to be held in New York next September. In this context, the Commission has proposed that new potential action by the EU be concentrated in three areas : (1) funding, (2) the consistency of policies, and (3) Africa.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0452"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission wishes to observe that it is, through ECHO, its humanitarian aid service, the principal donor of humanitarian aid for the victims of the crisis brought on by the second Chechen conflict. Since the beginning of this conflict in the autumn of 1999, ECHO has supplied almost EUR 146 million in aid through non-governmental organisations, United Nations agencies, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>This aid is widely recognised as being effective and appropriate. All the humanitarian actors involved have hailed the leading role played by ECHO in meeting the urgent humanitarian needs of the victims of this crisis, which, unfortunately, tends to be forgotten by other humanitarian donors.</p>
<p>ECHO funds the distribution of basic and supplementary food aid to some 300 000 persons, which is an essential resource for vulnerable families, especially in the most remote areas of Chechnya. ECHO also funds the provision, using tankers, of drinking water to the inhabitants of Grozny and the operation of pumping stations. ECHO is also very active in the medical field, providing equipment, medicines and training to the main hospitals, in which it funds basic rehabilitation schemes. ECHO also funds, inter alia, the distribution of non-food products (children’s clothing, mattresses, etc.) and gives active support to programmes of primary education and psychosocial support for children, as well as vocational training programmes for school-leavers.</p>
<p>It is no easy task to supply humanitarian aid to Chechnya, which is one of the most difficult and dangerous places in the world, where humanitarian organisations work under conditions which are among the worst anywhere in terms not only of safety but also of monitoring. The hazards faced by humanitarian personnel – including being attacked, threatened, harassed and, in particular, abducted – are such that it is not possible for foreigners to be based in Chechnya itself. Operations are therefore carried out using a remote control system, with workers in Chechnya recruited locally and foreign staff visiting the interior of the republic as often as possible. In addition to this, consideration must also be given to the recurrent issue of how humanitarian organisations can gain access to Chechnya and to those they seek to help. The authorities are still restricting NGOs’ free access by requiring permits and other burdensome and random bureaucratic procedures; they also still refuse to allow humanitarian organisations to have access to VHF radios. It is for this reason that the Commission, whenever it meets with the Russian authorities, continues – albeit so far in vain – to raise this issue and to demand of them a less obstructive attitude.</p>
<p>ECHO supplies aid not only to people in Chechnya, but also to displaced persons living in Ingushetia and Daghestan. All the tent camps having been closed down, ECHO continues to give help to refugees living in makeshift conditions or in private homes. Together with its partners, such as the HCR and the ICRC, ECHO also ensures that these people are protected, thus enabling them to stay where they are and preventing their involuntary or enforced return.</p>
<p>Finally, ECHO has announced its willingness to meet any other need which might arise from new developments in the Northern Caucasus, such as in the immediate aftermath of the recent spread of the conflict to other republics and the tragic hostage-taking in Beslan.</p>
<p>At the EU-Russia summit in The Hague, the Commission again made Russia the offer of examining how, in addition to ECHO’s humanitarian aid, it might play a part in the restoration and reconstruction of Chechnya as soon as security was guaranteed. The first stage would involve the organisation of a mission to assess needs in the Northern Caucasus, and the Commission hopes to get this up and running soon.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0465"></a>

<p>(FR) Following appeals by the FAO and from countries affected by the massive invasion of locusts, the Commission has decided to support the fight against this plague to the tune of EUR 23.5 million provided by the European Development Fund, with the addition of EUR 2 million in the form of Budget lines for food safety. These sums, on top of aid granted directly to the states concerned, have made it possible, since the beginning of 2004, for some EUR 50 million to be raised for the fight against locusts in the countries of the Sahel.</p>
<p>The funding allocated to the FAO was intended to support various projects, including the purchase of pesticides and the identification and treatment of contaminated areas. Treatment with pesticide sprays continued up to the beginning of December. The countries of the Sahel are under less pressure given the onset of colder weather and the ascent of swarms in line with their natural migratory cycle.</p>
<p>Although good rainfall in most of the affected areas allowed the locusts to reproduce rapidly, it also proved beneficial to agricultural production and helped make good some of the losses. That having been said, the locusts have done considerable damage in some areas of the countries affected, particularly in Mauritania and its neighbours, endangering the security of the inhabitants’ food supplies.</p>
<p>The Commission is continuing to monitor the progress of the situation.</p>

<p>(FR) The Commission would begin by recalling that, since 1996, when the HIPC was launched, it has been (and still is) deeply involved in the international initiative to reduce the debt burden affecting the heavily indebted poor countries. To date, the Community has contributed more than EUR 1.6 billion to that initiative.</p>
<p>The Commission has also participated in additional initiatives with a view to adapting its activities so as to take better account of the specific needs of individual poor countries. As well as being involved in the HIPC Initiative, it has cancelled all repayments of the special loans granted to the least developed countries from the European Development Fund (EDF). It has also assisted specific countries, such the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and the Republic of the Congo, which were seriously in arrears with their repayments to international institutions, to regularise their financial situation. That has enabled them to secure total access to the HIPC Initiative.</p>
<p>The Commission welcomes the recent decision to extend the international initiative until 2006, since that will enable more countries to secure access thereto. It can also confirm that it is continuing its cooperation with the relevant international financial institutions.</p>
<p>The Commission is also seeking to act in accordance with a forward-looking, innovatory approach. To that end, it is giving special consideration to the situation of individual countries emerging from hostilities which are currently not in a position to qualify for aid. Together with the international community, the Commission is helping in the search for solutions appropriate to the specific problems faced by those countries.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is following with interest the establishment by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund of a debt-sustainability mechanism for low-revenue countries. That mechanism, when fully up and running, will enable poor countries to avoid falling back into a situation where they are excessively indebted, since loans will be replaced by gifts.</p>
<p>To that end, the Commission is endeavouring to secure, in a transparent and independent manner, the participation of governments, of civil society and of all partners in the development process with a view to devising the practical details of that mechanism.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0412"></a>

<p>(EN) At the end of 1994, the Essen European Council defined a Pre-Accession Strategy to prepare the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for EU membership. Pre-accession instruments have been and are being financed by the European Community to assist the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe with their pre-accession preparations. The Commission supports promotion of social inclusion and social protection in Bulgaria notably through Phare (reference document: Phare regulation 3906/89). As part of the pre-accession strategy, Bulgaria also participates in some Community programmes related to social inclusion and social protection.</p>
<p>Phare programmes and their financing are decided on the basis of Financing Memoranda agreed between the Commission and the authorities of each candidate country. They provide the legal basis for programme implementation and are accompanied by project fiches that list the detailed projects. Documents such as Road Maps and Accession Partnerships set the framework for each Candidate Country, establishing the overall priorities the country must address to prepare for accession and the resources available to help them do so.</p>
<p>Regarding social inclusion, the Commission and Bulgaria are finalising the Joint Memorandum on Social Inclusion (JIM) to identify key challenges and relevant policy responses to promote social inclusion. The JIM will represent an important step to prepare Bulgaria for the open method of coordination in the area of social inclusion.</p>
<p>Also in the area of social protection, there are no legal obligations to implement precise policy measures but a very important general obligation to co-ordinate the respective policies in order to develop a homogenous social framework in line with the principle and rules of the EU Treaty. For the EU an evolving co-operation to promote an effective system of social protection is an important component of the wider employment and social situation in the EU. While the organisation of social protection systems remain the responsibility of individual Member States, the EU requires that these systems have the capacity to develop and operate sustainable and universally applicable social protection systems in line with the Treaty objectives. The systems of the candidate countries, including Bulgaria, must also be capable of co-ordinating with those systems currently operating in the EU which are themselves developing in a very dynamic way and undergoing significant reform. In June 2004 a seminar has taken place in Sofia between the Commission, the Bulgarian authorities and stakeholders in order to prepare Bulgaria for the participation in the Open method of coordination in the field of pensions, a joint effort to promote reforms in the Member States that will guarantee both the future adequacy and financial sustainability of pension systems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0415"></a>

<p>(EN) The “raison d’être” of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) is to help the ACP countries to deal with the challenges of globalisation by developing strong regional economies. The Commission has therefore emphasised the need to place market opening in the context of national, regional and international policies. The EPA approach aims at developing regional markets with a common set of border measures, tariff and non-tariff, as an incentive for more local economic activity. Only in a second phase will a regional access for EU goods or services be discussed that will be consistent with the needs and constraints of ACP economies. Therefore such access does not need to match that offered by the EU neither in terms of product coverage nor of the calendar for tariff dismantlement. In other words, ACP may negotiate a slower liberalisation and even permanently exclude sensitive products. Current WTO rules provide sufficient flexibility for this asymmetric approach. Moreover EPAs will be accompanied by appropriate development support measures to help ACP business operators seize the opportunities provided by market opening (both in the EC and at the regional and international level). Therefore, while EPAs themselves will be mainly trade agreements, what could be called the “EPA process” will be broader and cover issues linked to development policy and support within the Cotonou framework.</p>
<p>Market opening of ACP regions toward the EU will be flexible and asymmetric. ACP countries can protect all sensitive sectors during a transition period that will be negotiated. Even beyond this timeframe, a substantial part of ACP imports could still be protected under safeguard provisions. In the EC view, this should be more than sufficient to cover for example infant industries and sensitive agricultural products. The alternative – lasting and indiscriminate protectionism – would only lead to further marginalisation and provide benefits for a few while incurring high costs for most in the developing countries concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0417"></a>

Such zones may or may not coincide with Euroregions. In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, it is for the Member States to decide whether those Euroregions that exist within the zones covered by Interreg III A programmes are to be involved in the implementation of these programmes.</p>
<p>Certain Euroregions function as managing or paying authorities or as the Joint Technical Secretariats of Interreg III A programmes. Others manage sub-programmes or measures under an Interreg III A programme or function simply as information points. Lastly, others carry out the evaluation of projects.</p>
<p>In this context, the new Pyrenees/Mediterranean Euroregion might, if need be, be involved in the implementation of such trans-European projects or programmes as the Spain/France Interreg III A programme or, indeed, other Interreg III programmes regarded as relevant to the region.</p>
<p>In its proposals for the forthcoming programming period, which will run from 2007 to 2013, the Commission continues to treat the principles of partnership and subsidiarity as essential. Member States, regions and local authorities will play an essential part in defining strategic programming priorities and will exercise greater responsibility as regards the management, monitoring and evaluation of projects part-funded by the Structural Funds. This process of greater decentralisation will involve strict adherence to the political and administrative structures of each Member State.</p>
<p>With more specific regard to cross-border cooperation, the Commission has proposed the creation of a new goal for intervention by the Structural Funds, termed ‘European Territorial Cooperation’, which is intended to give fresh impetus to cooperation across borders and between nations and regions. The Commission has also proposed the creation of an instrument facilitating the establishment, on Community territory, of cooperation groups with legal personality. Use of these groups would be optional and would make it possible to delegate specific tasks and powers relating to the implementation of cross-border cooperation programmes part-funded by the Community, such as those under the Structural Funds, and also to carry out cross-border cooperation operations initiated by Member States and their regions and local authorities, without any financial involvement on the part of the Community.</p>
<p>The establishment of these groups will have no effect on regional and local authorities’ financial responsibilities, nor on those of the Member States, in relation to the management of Community or national funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0423"></a>

<p>According to this analysis, the option proposed in the communication of 2004, 'Accomplishing a sustainable model for Europe through the reformed CAP - sugar sector reform', will require certain adjustments in the sugar sector in developing countries. The Commission has therefore undertaken to launch a structured dialogue with the ACP countries which are signatories to the sugar protocol, on the basis of an action plan to be drawn up by the Commission, with suitable flanking measures relating to trade and development.

<p>(FR) It is apparent from the various analyses carried out by the Commission since 2003 that there is an urgent need for in-depth reform of the sugar sector. It is also generally agreed that the likelihood of increased imports and hence of structural surpluses within the EU means that it is not possible to maintain the support system in its present form. The sector needs to be reformed as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>To be sure, negotiations currently in progress within the World Trade Organisation give rise to significant uncertainties about the sector’s future, and it would also appear opportune to await the final outcome of the sugar panel which is currently preparing proposals for regulations to be submitted to the Council and to Parliament. Moreover, the Commission has proposed for 2008 a re-examination of the price levels and quotas set out in its proposal for reform, in order to take into account those changes that will have been observed by then.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0491"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU’s first aim is to contribute to a high level of health protection and social cohesion by complementing the Member States’ action in preventing and reducing drug use, dependence, and drug-related harm to health and society. The EU aims also to ensure a high level of security for the general public by taking action against drugs production, cross-border trafficking in drugs and diversion of precursors, and by intensifying preventive action against drug-related crime through effective cooperation embedded in a joint approach.</p>
<p>A Eurobarometer opinion poll carried out in 2002 and 2004 at the Commission’s request on young people (15 to 24 years) in fifteen countries of the European Union, indicates an increase in the facility of obtaining drugs (in particular, in recreational settings) and a small increase in the early consumption of cannabis (29 % in 2002 and 33% in 2004), but a stabilization in the pattern of drug abuse of other substances.</p>
<p>On the basis of the results of the final evaluation of the EU Drugs Action Plan 2000-2004, the Commission will bring forward a Communication on a new EU Drugs Action Plan (2005-2008) early in 2005. The new Action Plan will set out specific interventions and actions to be carried out by the Member States, the Commission, the EMCDDA and EUROPOL. It will cover demand reduction, supply reduction, coordination, information, evaluation and research, and international cooperation.</p>
<p>The Commission Communication on coordination on drugs in the European Union<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> adopted last year stresses that isolated national responses will not suffice in tackling the drugs phenomenon and its impact on collective and individual health and safety. Given that this is a complex, multifaceted problem involving a large number of actors, effective coordination of all involved is necessary. Coordination both within and between EU institutions and the Member States must be improved in order to respond adequately to the social, economic, security-related and health-related problems posed by drug consumption.</p>
<p>One of the key points in any policy is the cost-effectiveness ratio. But it is very difficult to count the expenditure in drugs-related matters. There is no precise definition of what is included, and there are many different types of drug-related expenditure on aspects such as prevention, rehabilitation and health-care, measures against trafficking, organised crime, etc. Expenditure on drugs issues is almost entirely embedded in programmes and budget lines that cover a multitude of subjects and geographical areas. Much of the funding is allocated under different or indirect headings (e.g. the Public Health Programme, Research and Development programme, regional development, the AGIS Programme for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters etc.).</p>
<p>Reinforcement of coordination within Member States and in the EU could help to produce an estimate at national and European level of public drug-related expenditure, to measure the impact of the initiatives that are taken, and to give the public a clear view of the situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The EU's aspiration to transform itself into the most competitive economy in the world (Lisbon Agenda) calls for a significant increase in funding for European research policy. Research spending is strategic for the EU in the sense that it constitutes investment in its survival in a fiercely competitive international environment. However, the declared intention of developing an ambitious European research policy is difficult to reconcile with the restrictions imposed by the Stability and Development Pact (SDP), which prohibits Member States' public expenditure from overshooting a budget deficit of 3% of GDP.</p>
<p>If the Member States are to have an incentive to set aside 1% of GDP for public funding of research policy, that percentage should not be included in calculating the ceiling of 3% of GDP laid down by the SDP. Does the Commission agree that public spending on research constitutes top priority strategic expenditure for the EU and, as such, can justifiably be excluded from the criteria under the Pact? The argument that such a decision will pave the way for a host of other exceptions (e.g. military spending) is not tenable since the strengthening of research is an established European strategic goal which has no analogy with any other national or European objectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Enhancing the contribution of fiscal policy to long-term growth is a priority both in the EU fiscal framework and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPGs). In this respect, a comprehensive survey by the Commission in the report ‘Public Finances in EMU 2004’ shows that fiscal policy can make its best contribution to growth by (i) avoiding protracted budget deficits and (ii) by redirecting public expenditure towards growth-enhancing items.</p>
<p>In the context of the latter debate there have been calls to exclude public investment (a so-called golden rule), Research and Development (R&amp;D), education, health care and defence from the deficit reference value as specified in the EU Treaty. The Commission, however, considers that a golden rule for investment, or the exclusion of other expenditure items from the deficit calculation, would be inappropriate. First, leaving certain categories of expenditure out of the definition of deficits would, de facto, raise the 3%-deficit ceiling, thus leading to more public debt and higher interest rates in the long run. Sustainability would be more difficult to reach and the objectives of the EU fiscal framework - including its contribution to long-term growth - may be jeopardized. Second, it could be hard to achieve consensus of which expenditures should be left out from the definition of deficits, given that Member States may have very different expenditure needs and given large uncertainties in empirical estimates of growth-enhancing impact. Third, excluding particular items such as public investment or R&amp;D may create an incentive to reclassify public expenditure into those items and does not guarantee that all expenditure labelled as such is growth-enhancing; the wrong investment may be favoured. Finally, from a legal viewpoint, re-defining the concept of deficits to be used in the EU fiscal framework may involve a very complex procedure, since it may require changing either the Treaty Protocol (where the reference value for budget deficits is defined) or the system of national accounts (ESA95).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0449"></a>

<p>On 18 November 2004, the Commission received a WTO report which states that European designations of origin (DOs) can coexist with trademarks of products made in countries outside the Community and marketed under names which are the same as or similar to those of European DOs. If this were to be the case, many European products – such as sherry from Jerez or wine from Malaga, for example – would suffer as a result of unfair competition from copycat products that would not only adversely affect the European market, but would also mean a loss of selling power for genuine products which are popular precisely because they are traditionally made in certain places.</p>
<p>Could the Commission look into what the WTO report says about DOs? What is the Commission’s position on the dispute within the WTO between the EU and countries such as Australia and the US?

<p>(EN) On 16 November 2004, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) panel issued its interim reports in a dispute brought by the United States and Australia against EC Regulation 2081/92 on the protection of geographical indications (GI) and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently examining the interim reports, but as they are confidential under WTO rules, it is not possible to comment on their content.</p>
<p>All parties to the dispute have made comments to the panel on the interim reports and the panel is scheduled to issue the final reports confidentially to the parties on 21 December 2004.</p>
<p>The Commission is ready to answer to questions from the Member of the European Parliament once the final reports have been made public, which it is expected to be at the beginning of 2005.</p>
<p>It needs to be recalled that, following incorrect media reports based on leaks, the Commission press services rectified certain elements in order to provide a correct information to the public.</p>
<p>The interim panel reports largely vindicate the EC’s view that the system of GI protection is compatible with WTO rules.</p>
<p>Two key issues were at stake.</p>
<p>First, the US and Australia argued that the EC GI regime discriminates contrary to WTO rules, because it allows registration of GIs relating to areas outside the EU only under certain conditions (notably the conditions of reciprocity and equivalence) which do not apply to registration of GIs relating to areas inside the EC. Throughout this dispute, the EC has made clear that Regulation 2081/92 does not require the condition of reciprocity and equivalence for the protection of geographical indications originating in WTO members. The EU has also repeatedly stated that it would welcome applications for registration in the EC for foreign GIs.</p>
<p>Secondly, the complainants had challenged the EC discipline on the relationship between GI rights and prior trademark rights. The EC has always considered that the coexistence of GIs with prior trademarks as provided for by the Regulation is in conformity with WTO rules.</p>
<p>Despite what could be considered an attempt by the United States and Australia to use the dispute settlement system to divert attention from the need to enhance protection for geographical indications through negotiations, the EC will continue to pursue in the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) an agenda for the establishment of a multilateral register for wines and spirits, extended protection to other products and the end of current usurpation of GI names in third countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0450"></a>

<p>(EN) 1. The letter of 21 September 2004 sent to the Commission by ‘Women on Waves’ on the refusal of the Portuguese authorities to permit the Women on Waves ship, the Borndiep, to enter Portuguese territorial waters has been registered as a complaint by the Commission. A first reply on substance was sent to the complainant on 10 November 2004.</p>
<p>As announced by the Commission to the Parliament in its plenary session of 16 September 2004 in Strasbourg, during an oral debate on two parliamentary questions on this incident, a letter was sent to the Portuguese authorities on 14 October 2004 to request further information and their reply has been received on 23 November 2004.</p>
<p>2. The Commission recalls that under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) of 10 December 1982 and in particular Articles 17, 18 and 19 any party to this Convention is entitled to require that a vessel entering its waters limits itself to exercise its right of innocent passage as defined in Articles 18 and 19. According to Article 19 of this Convention, passage by a foreign ship is not considered “innocent” if such ship engages in any activity not having a direct bearing on passage (Art.19(2)(l)). Having said that, it should be emphasised that, even though the European Community is a party to the UNCLOS convention, the matter involved in the present case (measures relating to the exercise of jurisdiction over vessels) falls within those which are left to the competence of the Member States in their quality of parties to the same Convention. In this context, therefore, the Commission would not be entitled to intervene. Any action for alleged violations of the Convention were to be brought before the Portuguese law-courts and would be submitted to the rules and conditions provided for under Portuguese law.</p>
<p>In relation to the alleged violation of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966 and in particular of Article 19.2 on freedom of expression, Article 21 on the right to peaceful assembly and Article 22 on the right of freedom of association thereof, the Commission is not in a position to make an assessment on this point. It falls to international bodies charged with monitoring compliance with international human rights instruments - such as that established by the Covenant - to assess the lawfulness of action carried out by States with respect to such instruments. The same reasoning applies to the alleged violation of international documents concerning reproductive health that have been signed by Portugal.</p>
<p>3. In the letter to the Portuguese authorities the Commission recalled the principles of Community law in connection with free movement of persons. In particular it indicated that Member States can restrict this fundamental right solely where it is justified on grounds of public policy, public security and public health and that where a Member State adopts a measure refusing entry to its territory based on one of these grounds, it must respect the general principles of Community law and in particular the proportionality principle, and fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of information and expression. Member States must also respect the provisions of Council Directive 64/221/EEC of 25 February 1964 on the coordination of special measures concerning the movement and residence of foreign nationals which are justified on grounds of public policy, public security and public health as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Council Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, referred to by the Honourable Member replaces, among other texts, Directive 62/221. However, Member States have until 30 April 2006 to transpose it into national law. In any event this new Directive does not change Directive 64/221 substantially.</p>
<p>4. The Portuguese authorities have justified their decision on the UNCLOS and on the need to protect public health, safeguard the legal order and prevent abuse of rights. They esteem that the decision was not contrary to Community law on free movement of persons since the members of Women on Waves were allowed to go ashore and Portuguese citizens were permitted access to the vessel. They put forward that if it were to be considered as a restriction of free movement it would still be justified on grounds of public policy and proportionate.</p>
<p>5. On the basis of the above and of the Portuguese authorities reply, the Commission will decide on the follow-up to this official complaint in its next meeting on infringements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Parliament endorsed this Communication in its Resolution of 4 December 2003. Furthermore, the commitment of Member States is evident from the explicit inclusion of organised crime and corruption in the Den Haag Programme, agreed at the European Council of 4-5 November 2004.</p>

Work to develop a viable option, whether in the form of a separate EU mechanism, participation in the Council of Europe Group of Countries against Corruption (GRECO) mechanism, or a mechanism to evaluate and monitor both EU instruments and the UN Convention against Corruption, is continuing. In the meantime, the Corruption Perception Index published annually by Transparency International, a leading non governmental organisation in this field, is a useful reference point, as are the evaluation reports published by the Council of Europe’s GRECO Group, as part of its monitoring process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission first would like to recall that neither the Europol Convention nor the Council Act of 19<span class="sup">th</span> of December 2002 amending the Europol Staff regulations foresee any specific role for the Commission in the process of designation of the Europol’s director. This is in the hands of the Europol Management Board where the Commission sits as an observer and in the ones of the JAI Council where the decision has to be taken under unanimity.</p>
<p>After its failure, during the first half of 2004 to agree unanimously on one candidate, the JAI Council of 19<span class="sup">th</span> July 2004 has tasked the Management Board of Europol to submit a new opinion to the Council. On the 6<span class="sup">th</span> of August the Management Board, through a written procedure, decided to relaunch a new selection procedure. As prescribed in Article 4 (1) of Council Act of 19 December 2002 amending the Staff Regulations applicable to Europol Employees, the advertisement for this post has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU 2004/C 210 A/1 of 20<span class="sup">th</span> August 2004) and in other media, including national newspapers and specialised periodicals, to ensure maximum exposure in all the Member States. The deadline for applications was 18<span class="sup">th</span> of October (60 days after the publication in the OJEU,as foreseen in the Council Act of 19<span class="sup">th</span> of December 2002). The selection committee was set up by the Management Board during its meeting of mid September. A short list of candidates has been prepared by this selection committee that will be submitted to the Management Board in its meeting of 14<span class="sup">th</span> and 15<span class="sup">th</span> of December 2004. If an agreement is reached there among the members of the Management Board of Europol on a proposal to be made to the Council, a decision could be made by the nearest JAI Council. The Commission considers that this new selection procedure has been organized in the shortest delays that the legal provisions allow.</p>
<p>It has to be mentioned nevertheless that after the departure of M. Jürgen Storbeck, on the 1<span class="sup">st</span> of July 2004, the direction of Europol has been assumed by one of the three deputy directors, M.

<p>(EN) On the basis of the information provided by the Honourable Member, the incident, when in December last year a vessel lost dangerous cargoes off the Dutch coast, would not appear to have been due to inadequate safety standards of the vessel itself.</p>
<p>The Commission, through the Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) established by Council Decision 2001/792/EC Euratom, has been regularly informed by the Dutch authorities on the consequences of the accident, which happened under bad weather conditions.</p>
<p>The stowing of goods, as part of the transport operation of dangerous goods by sea, falls under international rules of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG Code) of the International maritime Organisation (IMO) to which Member States, but not the European Community, are signatories. Equally, the European Community has not incorporated the IMDG Code into the body of Community legislation, although this is not being excluded at some future point.</p>
<p>In view of the above, national rules, based or not on the IMDG Code, apply to the transport of dangerous goods by sea.</p>
<p>Moreover, the monitoring of vessels carrying dangerous substances is covered by Directive 2002/59/EC establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system which entered into force in February 2004. This text reinforces the obligation for the vessels carrying dangerous goods to report to the competent authorities and foresees the creation of a network for data exchange between the maritime administrations of the Member States.</p>
<p>This network, the so-called SafeSeaNet system, has been developed by the Commission and is now under the responsibility of the European Maritime Safety Agency for its operational implementation. In the case of the vessel Andinet, the European Safety Agency did not signal any problem or dangerous situation as foreseen in the EU legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0468"></a>

<p>Recent scientific evidence (BirdLife International, 2004 Birds in the European Union: a status assessment) shows that populations of farmland birds such as skylarks and lapwings have significantly declined in recent decades. How does the Commission propose to ensure that the objectives of the Birds Directive 79/409/EEC<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> are fully integrated into other policies, in particular the CAP, in order to reverse such decline?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the new report of BirdLife International on the status of birds in the EU, having financially supported its production. This latest scientific information has been the subject of detailed discussions at the recent conference on 25 years of the Birds Directive<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which took place in Bergen-op-Zoom, the Netherlands, in November 2004. The conclusions of this conference highlight the need for further integration of bird conservation concerns into the implementation of EU common policies, including the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).</p>
<p>The Commission has already been working with the Member States and stakeholders on finding better and more effective ways to achieve this objective. In this regard, the introduction of cross-compliance in the 1999 CAP reform followed by its strengthening in the 2003 reform as environmental protection requirements with regard to the market pillar of the CAP, has provided increasing possibilities for Member States to link support payments to the respect of the environment. Cross-compliance has been made a central and obligatory part of the direct support system in the 2003 CAP reform to apply from 2005. The Birds and Habitats<a href="#defann_49_3" name="refann_49_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Directives are among the legislation to be respected by farmers in receipt of such support. Cross compliance also includes the requirement to maintain land in good agricultural and environmental condition which, if fully used by Member States whose responsibility it is to define this in practice, should also contribute to reversing the decline in farmland birds.</p>
<p>In addition, in keeping with the growing understanding that farming has a wider role than food production, the CAP has been broadened, notably since 1992, to aid the delivery of environmental goals notably in this instance through agri-environment and since 2000 to a broader and planned approach to rural development. Agri-environment support is specifically given for actions going beyond good farm practice. In the Commission’s current proposals for rural development, there are several measures under the axis ‘Land Management’ which provide support for biodiversity both in the context of agri-environment and within the context of NATURA 2000 implementation.</p>
<p>It will be primarily for the Member States to apply these integration measures foreseen under the CAP. The Commission will continue to work closely with the Member States as well as farmers and other stakeholder groups to help achieve this objective. This will include strengthening ways to improve communication and dialogue with farmers and other land managers and owners, authorities and stakeholders in order to promote bird conservation within the new framework of Rural Development and in the context of the European model of multifunctional farming.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>It has to be clarified that the Council decides itself on the issues on which it wants to have conclusions, and that it is not for the Commission to make suggestions here.

<p>The Commission is very much aware that osteoporosis is one of the least recognized chronic diseases, despite the fact that one in three women, and one in eight men, will suffer at least one osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime. The promotion of lifestyles which can contribute to prevent osteoporosis – such as physical activity and a balanced nutrition – is amongst my main priorities for the coming years, and a series of activities in this area are under way or about to be launched.</p>

Finally, the 2005 Work Plan of the Public health Action Programme will again provide scope for the development of guidelines and best practice recommendations for osteoporosis prevention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0474"></a>

<p>(EN) This recent contamination incident has shown that the European Community has already in place the necessary comprehensive legislation to adequately manage such contamination incident.</p>
<p>Monitoring programs on dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in feed and food have been put in place across the EU. These programs have enabled the Dutch authorities to identify the contamination and to take the appropriate measures to eliminate its source.</p>
<p>Tracing and tracking systems are in place to identify potentially affected companies and farms. The necessary restrictive measures as regards these establishments have been taken to avoid that potentially contaminated feed and food could enter the food chain.</p>
<p>The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed acted with great efficiency in exchanging the information between competent authorities.</p>
<p>The established EU maximum levels on dioxins played a key role for the management of this contamination incident. Indeed they are a legal tool for taking decisions ensuring protection of public health.</p>
<p>It is in the Commission’s opinion unfortunately not possible through legislation to exclude completely any possibility of contamination of the food chain.</p>
<p>However, it is of major importance for the protection of public health that through monitoring any contamination is detected at a very early stage and that provisions are in place to remove and avoid further contamination of the food chain. Existing EU legislation provides already for this.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this contamination incident has shown that it is necessary to assess the safety of not only the ingredients of feed and food but also of all products used directly or indirectly in processing of feed and food.</p>
<p>The Food Law lays down that feed and food business operators are responsible for the safety of their products. The Commission will continue to stress this issue with the operators and will monitor the controls carried out under the responsibility of the competent Member States to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>As regards the grazing of animals near landfills, Community legislation has been enacted to ensure that landfills are designed and operated in a way that does not endanger human health or the environment. The Commission is taking all appropriate measures to ensure correct application of this legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0481"></a>

<p>(EN) Budget 2004 for CFSP (Common Foreign Security Policy)</p>
<p>The CFSP budget for 2004 of €51.5 million proposed by the Commission was slightly above the Financial Programming which provided for an amount of € 50 million. Following meetings between both arms of the budgetary authority (Parliament and Council) an agreement was reached on a CFSP budget of €62.5 million for 2004.</p>
<p>Budget 2005 for CFSP</p>
<p>For 2005 the Commission proposal of € 55 million for the CFSP budget respected the Financial Programming. In other areas of the External relations budget, few reductions from the programming were needed in view of the proposals to finance the reconstruction of Iraq at the tune of € 200 million.</p>
<p>Since these reductions could not provide the full amount to finance Iraq Reconstruction, the Commission also proposed the mobilization of the Flexibility Instrument at the level of €115 million to finance for Iraq reconstruction. Against this background there was no scope to increase the CFSP budget beyond the Financial Programming.</p>
<p>In short, although the CFSP amount proposed by the Commission for 2005 decreased compared to the 2004 CFSP budget agreed by the Budgetary Authority, it respected the Commission’s Financial Programming which foresaw an increase from €50 million in 2004 to €55 million in 2005, while taking into account the tight situation in the external relations budget.</p>
<p>However, in the budgetary procedure for 2005, Parliament and Council have agreed to an amount for CFSP of €62.5 million which this House is asked to confirm in this week’s vote on the budget.</p>
<p>Possible flexibility in 2005 within the CFSP budget</p>
<p>Significant frontloading at the level of €10.5 million is foreseen in connection with certain Joint Actions to take effect from 2005. This is to ensure continuity of operations from 1 January of the following year and to cover the running expenditure of the first months of the year.</p>
<p>An additional increase of the CFSP budget might derive from potential recoveries from previous years CFSP budget.</p>
<p>With the additional budget agreed by the Budgetary authority as well as the front loading operations for 2005 and finally the amounts which might be recovered from previous years budget, the Commission is of the view that there is potentially more flexibility within the CFSP budget for 2005 than may appear at first glance.</p>
<p>In the present circumstances the Commission is therefore of the view that the 2005 budget for the CFSP should be adequately financed to fulfil the EU’s political commitments for 2005 to which the Honourable Member refers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0486"></a>

<p>The Commission proposal on the introduction of a single fund to finance rural development with a view to the next financial perspective clearly places the competitiveness axis at a disadvantage by comparison with the remaining objectives of the new regulation on the operation of the second pillar of the CAP. Restricting aid for improving performance, marketing and processing to small and micro-enterprises will not only considerably reduce European Union support for making farms more competitive but will also jeopardise their future capacity to cope with the opening up of markets. Cooperatives, which already play a key role in bringing together supply in sectors such as fruit and vegetables, are excluded from such aid in the Commission proposal.</p>
<p>Can the Commission explain why it is specifically excluding medium-sized enterprises from these forms of support? Is there any reason other than saving money for the Community budget?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission believes that the proposal for a Council Regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (COM[2004]490 final) is balanced and does not discriminate against the axis relating to the agricultural competitiveness.</p>
<p>The proposed rate of 15% for this axis within the total EU funding for the programme represents a minimum. Member States can programme up to 60% of their total EAFRD allocation per rural development programme for the competitiveness axis, while still respecting the minimum rates for the other two axes.</p>
<p>As for the limitation of support to micro and small enterprises in the processing and marketing sector, the evaluations of support to processing and marketing show that bigger enterprises, which were granted investment aid, would have made these investments in many cases also without support. Focusing the support on the smaller enterprises, which often have less easy access to the capital market can reduce this “deadweight” effect.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0490"></a>

<p>The Commission's recent decision to initiate an infringement procedure against Germany with regard to its postal legislation is a welcome effort to challenge the scope of postal monopolies in Europe.</p>
<p>The EU Postal Directive (Directive 2002/39/EC<a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 97/67/EC<a href="#defann_59_2" name="refann_59_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> with regard to the further opening to competition of Community postal services) clearly states that postal services may be reserved to the 'extent necessary to maintain the universal service obligation'. As the Commission found, German national legislation seems to go beyond that objective, enabling Deutsche Post to abuse its dominant position and thereby prevent other providers from entering the market.</p>
<p>What specific action can the Commission take to curtail the dominant position of national postal operators like Deutsche Post which results from a monopoly larger than what is deemed necessary, limit Deutsche Post's acquisitions spree and require it to reallocate its funds to the genuine provision of public postal services?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The question of the Honourable Member raises two issues. The first concerns the extent of the postal monopoly in Member States, in light of the provisions of Directive 97/67, as amended.</p>
<p>The application of the provision of the Postal Directive referred to in the question should be seen in the context of other provisions of this Directive, in particular, of the harmonised timetable for a gradual and controlled opening up of the letters market to competition that the Council and the Parliament set forth therein.</p>
<p>Any decision regarding the extent of reservation required for ensuring the maintenance of the universal service involves an appraisal of economic facts and conditions which are both complex and liable to change. Member States enjoy for these reasons an important degree of discretion in regulating this matter.</p>
<p>In this context, the extent of the actual reservation of the different Member States compared to the Directive’s requirements should also be taken into account. In particular, the reserved area for certain postal items by weight in Germany has been, and still is, smaller than the maximum area allowed for in the Postal Directive and full opening of the market is set in advance of the proposed Community timetable.</p>
<p>In this respect the recent Commission Decision mentioned by the Honourable Member (Decision of 20.10.2004 on the German postal legislation relating to mail preparation services) was aimed at preventing the abuse of the dominant position by the German universal service provider which was incited by the German legislation, as applied by the German authorities, as well as to ensure the respect of the reserved area as set in Directive 97/67/EC, as amended.</p>
<p>The second issue raised by the Honourable Member’s question concerns the possible use of revenues originated in the reserved area for a purpose other than the financing of the universal postal service. In this respect the Commission will apply competition rules in cases of apparent abuses of dominant positions resulting from cross-subsidisation of activities in separate markets and, more generally, in cases in which universal service providers abusively leverage their market power into markets open to competition.</p>
<p>National competition authorities, which are under an obligation to apply EC competition rules to abusive behaviour contrary to Article 82 EC, are also active in monitoring and, if need be, bringing to an end dominant operator’s behaviour. The Commission works in close contact with National Competition Authorities within the context of the procedures laid down in Council Regulation N° 1/2004 concerning the European Competition Network.</p>
<p>Furthermore, national authorities in the postal field are required by Directive 97/67, as amended, to ensure that a proper internal cost accounting system has been introduced to monitor and prevent the existence of cross-subsidies between the reserved area and activities under competition which may result in competitive distortions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In specific relation to support for audio-visual projects, the Commission intends, in the first three months of 2005, to launch an appeal for proposals in the 25 Member States for subsidies for radio and television programmes with European subject matter. This would provide scope for candidates – or groups of candidates, for example, cross-border groups – to submit projects of relevance to this commemoration.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that another appeal for proposals, intended to "commemorate and preserve the memory of the victims of concentration and extermination camps and other places of mass-civilian martyrdom", to "explain to present and future generations why, how and what happened in the former camps" and to "improve the knowledge and dissemination of the history of the European peoples during this period", is currently being finalised<a href="#defann_60_1" name="refann_60_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
