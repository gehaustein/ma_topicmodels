Peace and stability are still a resource for the development of the Union and it is very important that these matters are also discussed. It is especially natural for the European Parliament to discuss the principles of peace and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">On 23 and 24 March this year, the Spanish Prime Minister gave the European Council an account of the announcement of a permanent ceasefire by the terrorist organisation, ETA. At the time the Council said that it was satisfied with the account given by the Spanish Prime Minister. Since then, the Council has not discussed the issue and abides by its statement of the time.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of security is a particularly topical one, and one that affects all Europeans. The Finnish Presidency is satisfied with all the actions that have been put in place to ensure that ETA ceases its terrorist activity and to bring about a peaceful solution within the framework of Spain’s democratic organs of government.</p>
<p class="contents">As we in this Chamber all know, the Union is active in weeding out terrorism and its causes. The Council once again expresses its support for the action which the Member States have implemented and are implementing to combat terrorism in accordance with the principles of the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrorist attacks not only endanger security but constitute an assault on the fundamental values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is strongly committed to the fight against terrorism and intends to continue working for the prevention of terrorism and the protection of our citizens and infrastructures by bringing terrorists to justice and by responding adequately to terrorist attacks in order to save as many innocent lives as possible. The specific measures that will be taken at European level are clearly outlined in the European counter-terrorist strategy and in the action plan on combating terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is obviously deeply concerned at the dramatic scale of ETA’s terrorism in Spain; four decades of terrorist activity have seen more than 800 assassinations and other attacks, with economic extortion and blackmail becoming common practice. Law-abiding citizens have learned to live in fear; many have been permanently threatened in their daily lives. The serious crime committed yesterday in the south of France – probably by ETA, according to the French prosecutor – is a source of concern. The attitude of Spanish society during all these years has been exemplary; indeed, its tenacity and conviction in combating terrorism through respect for democracy and the rule of law has paid off, leading to the increasing weakness of ETA.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, once again, pays tribute to all the victims of ETA’s terrorist attacks and recalls the importance of helping them and helping to make good damages suffered. In these circumstances, the Commission recalls the statement made in its presence by the European Council in March 2006, welcoming the report of the Spanish Prime Minister on the announcement of a permanent ceasefire by terrorist group ETA. The Commission also recalls the statement made by the President of the European Commission on the announcement by the Spanish Prime Minister on the launch of a dialogue with ETA, sharing the hopes of all those who look to a future in which Spain is free from the scourge of terrorism. The Commission is most hopeful that those announcements will result in the total disarmament and dissolution of the terrorist group.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission is aware of the complexity of the initiative, as well as the extreme sensitivity of the matter, but is convinced that Spain, through all its democratic institutions, will find the right path that will bring an end to ETA’s terrorism and restore peace, with full respect for the principles of democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not be divided today, since we shall not forget that the target of this debate is a common enemy of Spain and of Europe: terrorism.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans-Gert Poettering, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is one of the most noble tasks of a politician to work for peace. We all want peace on Earth, in Europe and in Spain. There are, however, often differences of opinion about how to achieve this objective. This is the case again today.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate is not about party-political tactics and gains, but principles and fundamental convictions. For this reason I ask that everyone here show great respect in this debate today and that we do not deny each other the mutual good will that sustains our conviction. We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would like to know how it is that we can trust that ETA and Batasuna want peace when they have not expressed a single word of regret or apology or made any kind of appeal for forgiveness to the families of the over 800 people that they have murdered. Until this occurs, we must expect that they will begin to kill again if they do not achieve their goals through negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, our sympathy, our respect and our solidarity are with the victims of the acts of terrorism and violence carried out by ETA and Batasuna. I can see from here our highly esteemed fellow MEP Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, whose husband, the then Chairman of the Socialist Party in the Basque Country, was murdered in 1984. Several attempts have been made on the life of Mr Iturgaiz Angulo, and seven of his political associates from the Partido Popular in the Basque Country have been murdered. We owe it to the victims to ensure that the murderers are punished. This is in accordance with the guiding and basic principles of our system of states under the rule of law. If it is to be credible, the process of reconciliation must begin with reconciliation between perpetrators and victims, including the victims’ descendants.</p>
<p class="contents">We call upon ETA and Batasuna to give your victims – who are surely on your consciences – a sign of conciliation and of apology. We would remind people that ETA and Batasuna are on the EU’s list of terrorist organisations. They have not surrendered their weapons. These weapons remain a threat to the constitutional order of Spain, as well as of France and thereby of the whole of Europe. The Commissioner has reminded us of the events of the day before yesterday in Nimes. A woman and two children were taken hostage and the French authorities have stated officially that this took place as part of an ETA weapons robbery. In other words, weapons remain an instrument of political argument. We have to ask ourselves what goal ETA and Batasuna are trying to achieve. A statement was issued on Euronews on 24 October from a high-ranking representative of ETA and Batasuna. The statement said that weapons would not be surrendered until the Basque Country was – in their words – independent.</p>
<p class="contents">MEPs have received a letter from Batasuna, which states in English, <span class="italic">‘Regarding the negotiation between ETA and the Spanish and French states it will be them who decide all about the demilitarisation of the conflict.’ </span>This form of words is a bad sign, since, if the negotiations fail, the blame is already being laid at the doors of the Spanish and French states.</p>
<p class="contents">What we in the PPE-DE Group, have to say to this is that we want dialogue. Spain and France are free and democratic states. They are not dictatorships, they are not tyrannies, against which one may express resistance through violent means. No, they are free states, and in free and democratic states it is democratic dialogue and not violence that must be used. As we share this conviction at the deepest level, our group, the PPE-DE Group, has tabled a resolution. It is not merely a resolution on the part of our Spanish allies in the Partido Popular, it is a common resolution on the part of the whole of our group, and we will defend it with solidarity and now, today, and in this debate, commemorate the victims.</p>

Terrorism is an attack on our values. Terrorism is always an attack on everything that we in this Parliament defend on the basis of our common European convictions. No terrorism, absolutely none, is justified. It is for all of us to find ways out of this terrorism because we are all – when it is our values that we are defending – victims of this terrorism too, every time a terrorist attack takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poettering, commendably, made reference to my colleague Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, who is herself a victim. We have many people with us in the public gallery today from the Basque Country who themselves were and are victims in that they have lost loved ones or in that they have personally suffered injury to life and limb. They are here listening to us today because they want to say ‘yes’ to the route of dialogue because it is only through dialogue that the spiral of violence can be ended.</p>
<p class="contents">I admire men and women who must have experienced the deep sorrow that these victims have been through and who nevertheless come out and demand an end to the death, to the violence and to the downward spiral. This moral force must be the impetus to reach a solution to the problems of violence, not only in the Basque Country, but everywhere else too. It is thus a European problem that we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">I admire the courage of the Spanish Government in choosing this path, a path that is controversial and fraught with risks. It is, however, a path that is best described by a quotation that I would like to read to you. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(ES) </span>For the sake of peace and your rights, we shall not close ourselves off but, rather, we shall open ourselves up to peace, hope, forgiveness and generosity and we shall do the best we can to ensure that peace is lasting with the help and hope of everybody.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> What I have just read out to you is a wonderful sentence that describes what this is all about. It is a sentence uttered by the Spanish Prime Minister who sent his Secretary of State off to negotiate with ETA. It is a sentence spoken by the Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar in 1998. That is the spirit that can form the basis for us all to reach a common solution to this problem of violence, since what the Spanish Government is doing today is in the tradition of all the governments before it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It would therefore be a good thing if we were able to attain a joint resolution. I do not always agree with Mr Aznar, which will not surprise you to hear, but on this issue he was right, dear members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and dear members of the Partido Popular, he was your party leader, after all. In this spirit we can agree, as one, that we are prepared, for the sake of such a fundamental right and through dialogue, to find a solution. Mr President, when Members of this House had to deal with terrorism in the past, they were always aware of the risks. When John Hume und David Trimble, Members of this House, set off together on the road to peace they were also aware that it is a road fraught with risk and that there is no guarantee of success. The gun heist in France yesterday – which we condemn in the strongest possible terms – shows that if you want to get out of the cycle of violence there is always the risk that someone will attempt to use violent means to block your road out of the deadlock. You cannot afford to be forced off this road, because what is the alternative? Remaining deadlocked means perpetuating the violence. The dialogue that has been entered into is thus a great opportunity, and I implore all of you, let us adopt this dialogue together on a common platform supported by all the groups.</p>

We must be concerned with the remaining conflicts at home, just as we are concerned with conflicts beyond our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not for us in the European Parliament to intervene directly between the Spanish Government, political parties and the long-running conflict in the Basque country, but nor can we turn a blind eye. We should encourage what may be the best prospect for peace in a generation.</p>
<p class="contents">I extend my solidarity and sympathy to all those families who have been bereaved of loved ones over the years as a result of the violence. But surely the most appropriate response that we, as democratic politicians, can bring to those countless victims is to ensure that there will be no more victims. It is for that reason that Liberals and Democrats lend their backing to the resolution before the House today. It is neither a time nor a subject for political point-scoring. It is my firm belief that all democratic forces who wish to see a peaceful end to violence and terror in the Basque country and elsewhere in Spain where atrocities have been committed should back the endeavours of whichever Spanish government is prepared to work to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year, this House welcomed the announcement of an ETA ceasefire. It is right that we now build on that and engage a process that entrenches it, without prejudging or commenting on the outcome of any political dialogue or settlement.</p>
<p class="contents">As with the Northern Ireland peace process, which is not identical but offers some important lessons for conflict resolution, it is occasionally necessary for politicians to take a risk for peace. I recall that our former colleague John Hume and his Unionist counterpart David Trimble were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998, following the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland. They took a risk for peace. This is not to hand a victory to the terrorists, as some would suggest, but rather to hand them a defeat. For there can be no dialogue among democrats if one of the parties still maintains the intent to kill.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not imagine that building the house of peace will be easy. There will be setbacks, such as the discovery of a cache of weapons in south-west France. But it is our duty to build the house of peace with the bricks of effort and the mortar of persistence.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why my group appeals to all sides of this House today to set aside party politics and unite for the prospects of peace, as much as we stand together in revulsion at acts of terrorism.</p>

At the same time we reiterate our profound solidarity and respect for all of the victims of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We support this process because it rejects violence, it leaves all options for a final solution open, it is not exclusive and it also gives the Basque political parties and Basque society in general responsibility in terms of putting an end to the so-called Basque conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Debating this issue in the European Parliament does not mean interfering in the policy of a Member State. It simply means promoting a process already underway and restating that terrorism and violence affects all Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">However difficult this process may be and however unsure its result, we support and we will continue to support those people who have decided to run the risk of taking a different direction to that of the Aznar Government, which quite clearly did not achieve any real results. As Gandhi stated, ‘There is no path to peace. Peace is the path’.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that it is appropriate to debate this process here and we have always been in favour of doing so, even when the People's Party was determined to bring this conflict to the European Parliament in order to gain support for its policy, a policy that we always believed to be mistaken, because it was based on the idea that, in order to defeat terrorism, it was necessary to divide Basque society rather than unite it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Basques and the majority of Spaniards are tired of this policy of confrontation. In our view, the key factors for the success of this process are dialogue, non-violence and respect for the citizens of the Basque country's right to decide. With these objectives in mind, we are going to support this process, as firm friends and allies in the fight against terrorism, against all forms of terrorism.</p>

We are in favour of political struggle, with the exclusion of all forms of violence. We see violence as reprehensible in all circumstances except where, as provided for by the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a population, in the absence of the rule of law is ‘compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression’. Even in this case, attacks on civilians are, in our opinion, to be prohibited. All the more reason for our having unreservedly and systematically condemned the attacks by ETA, which have killed hundreds of innocent people. We continue to remember these victims and express once again our solidarity with their loved ones.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time, we have been hoping that this chapter could be closed, once and for all. We were therefore extremely pleased to welcome the announcement of the permanent ceasefire by ETA. We therefore also greatly appreciate the open and responsible attitude with which the Spanish Prime Minister, José Luis Zapatero, has taken this opportunity to endeavour to achieve peace, in particular in his speech on 28 June 2005, by choosing the path of dialogue while taking care to respect the laws and legal procedures in force in his country. The European Parliament would be honoured to lend its support to this move.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit that the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left has united with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe through a joint resolution. I would add that we believe it would be a good thing for MEPs from other groups to also lend their support to a move that is nothing short of a reflection of the wishes of the majority of Spanish people, namely that a peace process be opened, based on legal grounds.</p>

But we must also look to the future and ensure that there are no more victims, because political solutions will be found to the differences in Spain, France, and the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is wrong to draw parallels or to say all processes are exactly the same. However, previous peace processes can act as a guide to what might happen, the kind of difficulties to be overcome and the challenges to be faced. If dialogue is to succeed, both sides must be open. You cannot talk about a future process with one hand tied behind your back. You have to ensure that those with whom you have a dialogue are committed to reaching a compromise and finding a solution. And the most important thing to remember is that when you go into a peace process you have to make peace with your enemies, not with your friends, and that can create a lot of internal difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The opportunities now presented to us by this process should be grasped, but it should not be predetermined that everybody gets what they want. It is most important that we do not point the finger of blame at someone else from the Popular Party or from the Socialist Party, but encourage the main forces of democracy in Spain to unite in finding a solution for all of the people of Spain and not to be driven down the road of division and dissension. That is not in any way to undermine or to ignore the suffering people have gone through.</p>
<p class="contents">Can any of us imagine what it would be like to lose a loved one because of a so-called political cause? We in Ireland know what that is like – there have been 3 000 victims of terrorist violence in Ireland over the last 30 years – and yet we could find a way forward and bring extreme opinions together. An opportunity does present itself if people genuinely want to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Opportunity comes to pass but not to pause. Let us seize the opportunity and give our support.</p>

Sometimes, they do not provide a clear answer. The right of peoples to self-determination is an inviolable principle. Every people has the right to chose its own fate. Every nation has the right to its own country.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, only around 10 to 12 countries in the world where people, nation and geographical unit combine to form a higher unit. Everywhere else it is a question of negotiating solutions that are respected by the different peoples and nations that share the same territorial unit. The EU does not interfere in the forms of government of the Member States. This is an area in which they themselves have competence, whether they wish to have a unitary state, a federal community or devolved arrangements or to be divided into multiple states. The states must protect minorities and respect human rights. National discrimination is not permitted. So what can the EU do in the Basque Country to end terrorism and ensure a durable solution with peace and tolerance? We can encourage our fellow MEPs from Spain to find a negotiated solution and we can provide an economic carrot – financial support for economic development, jobs, training and education instead of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from the border region between Denmark and Germany, where we have had wars and hatred for centuries. My grandfather was a German soldier with Danish sympathies. My father was conceived in Germany, but born in Denmark after Northern Schleswig rejoined Denmark following a referendum. Our national leader, Hans Peter Hansen, was a moderate who did not want areas that had German sympathies to rejoin Denmark, as Germany was on its knees after the First World War. What a stroke of luck! The reconciliation between Danes and Germans began, and now everyone recognises the border. Denmark grants the German minority more rights than it grants to Danes, and the same applies to the Danish minority in Germany, an example being exemption from the 5% electoral hurdle to qualification for parliamentary representation. Recognition, respected rights, special rights – these are the keys to understanding and lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">As a boy, a German-owned shop was not somewhere that I could buy things. Today, that seems incredible, and I now work with both the German minority in Denmark and the Danish minority in Germany. We drew up together the proposal for the protection of minorities in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I hope that the Basques and the other peoples of Spain will be able to reconcile their differences. The means of achieving reconciliation between Denmark and Germany proved to be a referendum on special rights. Referendums do not hurt as much as bullets and gunpowder. It is indeed possible to put the past behind you.</p>

ETA-Batasuna and IRA-Sinn Féin are both revolutionary Marxist-based organisations intent on foisting their will and ideology on a civilian population through vicious violence as and when required. It is not surprising that deep terrorist links have existed between them. Both, moreover, are expert in hijacking the language of peace, while glorying in past and even continuing exploits of terror as they adeptly dodge from one phase of struggle to another.</p>
<p class="contents">Learn from our mistakes. In 1994 the IRA announced a ceasefire, which proved merely tactical as 18 months later they launched the infamous Canary Wharf bombing attack and dipped in and out of terror as it suited. In 1998 they promised to decommission within two years, and yet it was not until 2005 that they made any notable delivery. They were foolishly and prematurely admitted to government in Northern Ireland, only to launch their ‘Stormontgate’ spy ring within that government. In late 2004 they purported to engage in genuine political negotiations while, at the same time, planning the biggest heist in UK history – the Northern Bank robbery – and weeks later IRA men murdered Robert McCartney. Now they want back into government, but think they should keep their Army Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, do not be taken in by mere proclamations of commitments to peace by those whose stock in trade is duplicity and mayhem! Test them long and test them hard, or you too will have your goodwill exploited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both the meeting of Heads of State or Government and the dinner organised after it were a great success. These informal meetings of EU leaders are an excellent way of building political consensus to take the Union forward with regard to its key challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">At the summit we focused particularly on external energy relations. We also discussed immigration and the situation in Sudan/Darfur. A separate working session was devoted to ways of promoting innovation policy to guarantee the Union’s competitiveness and economic growth. Developing innovation policy is crucial to EU competitiveness and our ability to keep good jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The open and thorough discussions during the working lunch enabled us to close ranks for the dinner, despite the doubts that had existed in certain quarters. The atmosphere over lunch was excellent and the solidarity among the Member States could definitely be felt. We attached a great deal of importance to speaking with one voice, and I would like to call this determination to reach consensus the Spirit of Lahti.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion over dinner with Russian President Vladimir Putin was very honest and frank. In addition to energy issues, we also discussed topical international issues and freedom of expression in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting of Heads of State or Government held a comprehensive and broad debate on energy. The atmosphere was excellent and the basic message, despite slight differences in tone, coherent. The main topics were the principles for developing EU-Russian energy relations and their execution, closer relations with strategically important third countries, the fight against climate change through energy policy; and more effective exchange of information through a network of energy correspondents.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to EU-Russian energy relations, we agreed that there is a need for closer partnership. It should be based on the principles laid down in the Energy Charter and the G8 Declaration, in particular openness, market-based solutions and reciprocity. These principles should already be applied now in practice and they should also be incorporated in concrete form into the forthcoming EU-Russia Agreement. At Lahti we laid down a common policy for EU-Russia energy relations.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also consensus at Lahti that we should continue and step up our efforts to forge closer relations with producer and transit countries in the Union’s neighbourhood by the end of the year. The goal is to apply the principles governing the internal market as widely as possible in neighbouring regions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change was referred to in many addresses as the most urgent international challenge. The EU must, in particular, demonstrate leadership in the promotion of sustainable energy. As regards innovations and technologies that relate to energy efficiency, European companies have a lot to offer. We shared the view that issues of energy and climate should in future feature prominently at EU summits with developing world countries, as they have during Finland’s EU Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">If a reliable supply of energy is to be secured, there needs to be huge investment in transmission networks and other infrastructure. Therefore, cooperation with international financial institutions must be stepped up in energy infrastructure projects. Energy security must be one of the criteria taken into account when European Investment Bank lending mandates are being granted to developing world countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for the Union to have comprehensive information on which to base its energy policy decisions and responses to external problem situations. We agreed in Lahti that we should try to make swift progress in the establishment of a network of energy correspondents by the end of the year. The details are to be agreed by the Council. Improving the way information is collected and analysed will help increase cooperation between the Member States and institutions, and make for greater solidarity on energy issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions at the summit on external energy relations will also prepare the ground for the next spring European Council, which is to adopt a prioritised Action Plan on Energy Policy for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">At the working session of the meeting of Heads of State or Government, we discussed how to move forward on innovation policy. The main topics were intellectual property rights, particularly patents, cooperation between the corporate world and the public sector, the European Institute of Technology, and standards. We agreed that the Union needs a clear strategy on intellectual property rights. The Competitiveness Council will provide the Commission with more details of what it would like to see in the area of intellectual property rights. At Lahti, we stressed that the Commission proposal should look in particular at the quality of the intellectual property rights system. The Commission will put forward its proposal before the spring European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the very strong messages from Lahti was that the European patent system must be made more cost-effective and easier to predict. Litigation systems also need improving. We need to try and move ahead quickly on this. Towards the end of the year, the Commission will issue a communication containing concrete proposals on the development of the European patent system. When it has received the Commission’s proposal, the Council will consider the various options.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of how to make the patent system more effective has been a difficult one for the Council, but it is vitally important for our capacity for innovation to develop the European system. I personally think that everyone should bear the common interest in mind, be prepared to show flexibility rather than stubbornness with regard to national positions, and agree to simplify the language regime, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agreed that we needed to promote cooperation between the corporate world and the private sector. The European Technology Platforms and Joint Technology Initiatives are good tools for developing key technologies. If we are to make progress, it is important that the EU’s Seventh Framework Programme be adopted without delay. The programme should also be a source of EU funding for Joint Technology Initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that the Lahti meeting confirmed that Artemis, one of the most advanced technology platforms, will be taken further, and that the Commission’s desire to implement it as a Joint Technology Initiative, is to be endorsed. Businesses in the sector are investing huge sums in the joint initiative. The Finnish Government too has set a good example here, promising to contribute EUR 70 million over a seven-year period. Over all, Artemis is one of Europe’s biggest Joint Technology Initiatives, in a very important and promising technological field.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the Commission put forward a legislative proposal concerning the European Institute of Technology. Lahti gave the go-ahead for a swift and detailed examination of the proposal by the Council. I see this as a very valuable initiative and I think that it could bring genuine added value to the development of research cooperation between universities and business.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly in this area, I would like to mention standardisation, a subject which we also touched upon at our meeting. As I have already stressed before, standardisation is very important in the lives of the Union’s citizens. For example, introducing the Europe-wide GSM standard phones made it possible for Europe to become the world leader in the field. If Europe cannot agree on good standards, others will set them.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that innovation can deliver success and growth, but the problem has been how to take concrete steps forward. The guidance we received at Lahti will now help us to make progress in creating the kind of environment that promotes competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Our discussion on immigration highlighted the commitment to cooperation and the matter of solidarity amongst the Member States in solving immigration problems. It is a matter that concerns the whole Union. While we require rapid, short-term action to deal with the acute crisis that we are seeing, our discussions also emphasised the need for a coherent and comprehensive policy on immigration. The policy should address both legal and illegal immigration. We also need to do more to help immigrants to integrate.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for close cooperation with African countries, as well as other countries of origin and transit, was particularly apparent. The best way of dealing with the pressure on people to leave their country is promoting development, in Africa and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting gave its full support to the work being done by the EU’s border management agency, and it was acknowledged that more resources were needed to bolster its work.</p>
<p class="contents">The meeting also spoke of the need to develop our decision-making system, to enable the Union to respond promptly and more effectively to urgent problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for the strong and thorough contribution you made at Lahti, Mr President. You made it very clear that the European Parliament wants more effective decision-making in the field of justice and home affairs. The Finnish Presidency shares this view fully.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The theme of immigration will be dealt with again by the justice and home affairs ministers and the foreign ministers. We will be returning to the issue at the December European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We also spoke in Lahti about the grave situation in Sudan/Darfur. We expressed our deep concern about the humanitarian situation and human rights in Darfur. As representative of the Presidency of the Council, I will be passing this urgent message on to the Sudanese President. We must keep up the pressure on the Sudanese Government to bring an end to the fighting, enable the UN to mount a peace-keeping operation and start negotiations with the rebels.</p>
<p class="contents">The informal discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin were extremely useful for the development of our strategic partnership. That involves eagerness to cooperate and being prepared to discuss all issues. The partnership should not be seen as static but as an ongoing process. We believe that a genuine and lasting partnership has to be built on common values.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to thank you too for your contribution to our dinner debate and for the support which you expressed regarding this crucial matter. Values are the foundation of everything.</p>
<p class="contents">In our discussions with President Putin, we talked about how we could promote the goals of energy cooperation through a new agreement. Our talks will also pave the way for the EU-Russia Summit in November. The intention is that an agreement will be reached at the Helsinki Summit on the commencement of negotiations on a new and comprehensive EU-Russia pact.</p>
<p class="contents">On international issues, we agreed with President Putin that we would try to establish closer cooperation between the EU and Russia. The need for closer cooperation has been demonstrated very clearly by recent events in Iran, North Korea and the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Over dinner, I brought up the shocking murder of journalist Anna Politkovskaya. I told President Putin that people in the Member States were worried that the situation regarding freedom of speech and expression in Russia had taken a turn for the worse. Speaking for the Union, I said that this murder, which had deeply shocked us all, should be investigated and those responsible brought to justice. I also mentioned our concerns regarding Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between Russia and Georgia were also brought up. I told President Putin that the Union was concerned about increasing tension and said that the Union was prepared to act to find a solution to the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We are building a strategic, tangible partnership with Russia on an extremely wide front within the framework of the ‘common spaces’. The most prominent themes during Finland's presidential term are: energy, the environment, transport, justice and home affairs and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be able to speak to its partners with one voice. Divided and disunited, we are weak. We will not be able to look after our interests or promote the values on which the Union is built. At Lahti, we succeeded in showing President Putin that the Union is determined and united in its opinions. Representing the Presidency of the Council as I do, I am proud of this achievement, and I think that we have taken a step forward in our relations with Russia. This does not mean that Russia agrees with us on everything. We actually had a long discussion, in which President Putin answered our questions in detail and also looked for weaknesses in the EU’s action. We are used to this with Russia; it is part of normal dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial question now, in the wake of the Lahti meeting, is how we translate words into action and move forward on the issues that we discussed. We are relying on the preparatory channels which we normally employ.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the work will be done in the Council on the basis of Commission initiatives. For many issues we will draw on the policy guidelines we have received in the remaining weeks of our presidential term. The European Parliament will also have a central role to play in accelerating action on what was agreed on at Lahti.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for this opportunity to present to you the results of the Lahti informal meeting of Heads of State or Government. I will be glad to answer any questions which my introduction to the subject may have given rise to.</p>

I should like to concentrate on a few points.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lahti summit should be seen as part of a process. As you know, we have been saying that we should drive forward integration through practical, concrete actions and we have been doing so, hand in hand with Parliament and the Council. We have set out an ambitious agenda, for example on security, on energy, on research, and now we must put that agenda into action. That is precisely what we did at Lahti.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, on innovation, everyone agrees that innovation is important and that Europe is lagging behind. There is a consensus on the need for more support and incentives for innovation and fewer barriers for innovators. That has been endorsed in the European Council and in resolutions from this Parliament. What we needed were some clear, practical steps to show that Europe was prepared to take a lead and that is what we got at Lahti.</p>
<p class="contents">On joint technology initiatives, for example, key projects such as the Artemis Programme on embedded computers were being held back by a lack of national funds. Now we have some clear commitments for direct support.</p>
<p class="contents">On procedures to set European standards for products, we have an agreement that these should be speeded up. I also believe that momentum is building up on intellectual property, including patents, and the Commission will push that further before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Importantly, the Commission received the green light on the European Institute for Technology (EIT). I am grateful for the support I received from all the Members who spoke in favour of the EIT in the part-session two weeks ago. There is a growing consensus that the EIT will offer European leadership on innovation. We are receiving enthusiastic support from all over the business and scientific community in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The attention given by Parliament to that important initiative has been of real help in developing the details of the proposal. Of course there will now be negotiations on details, including the budget. I look forward to working with you and the Council in order to move swiftly towards adoption of the regulation. I believe that the EIT can be a flagship of excellence in innovation for Europe. We should ask the EIT to make its first priority the great challenges of climate change and everything related to environmentally-friendly sources of energy. That is an important task for us as a society. We should ask the scientific community of Europe to help us solve these problems, so that we can maintain the lead in what is perhaps the most important challenge of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">The second main issue in the debate was energy. The Commission, working closely with the Presidency, had identified three practical steps forward, and we received support for them all.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the European Council agreed that we should step up our energy relations with our neighbours, especially producers like Russia, Norway or Algeria, and key transit countries like Turkey and Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Council agreed to create a network of energy correspondents, which will also make us better prepared for unexpected shocks to our energy supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Council agreed on a specific common approach to Russia. We made clear to President Putin our wish to have a close energy relationship with such a key partner, but that relationship must be based on the principles that Russia has already signed up to at the G8 hosted by Russia this year, as well as the energy charter: transparency, the rule of law, reciprocity and non-discrimination, along with market opening and market access. Those principles apply to energy, but not just energy. They are necessary elements in increasing the mutual confidence and investment essential to a long-term relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">That message was all the more powerful in that we were united. In Lahti there was a clear sense of solidarity, an understanding that the European Union will act as one and that Europeans should receive the same standards of reliability from our Russian partners, whichever Member State is concerned. Prime Minister Vanhanen spoke on behalf of the whole European Council, presenting the general issues regarding our broad relations with Russia, and I was proud to have been asked to speak on energy matters.</p>
<p class="contents">It was important for that meeting and for the success of the Lahti summit that the statements by the Presidency and by the European Commission were clearly supported by all members of the European Council. The idea of solidarity is more important than ever. Solidarity and coherence are more than ever the key words of our European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Going forward on energy, within the framework of our new global agreement with Russia, will help ensure that this common approach is maintained. In short, the message is getting through: energy is a European issue and needs European solutions. There is growing recognition in the Council of what you in Parliament have long known, i.e. that the European Union has a central role to play in creating energy security and, through energy policy, in tackling climate change. That bodes well for the energy package that the Commission will present in January.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must not reduce its relationship with Russia to energy. At the dinner with President Putin, the European Union raised other issues: human rights, trade, visas, culture and common international concerns. We covered sensitive issues like Georgia. Prime Minister Vanhanen repeated the European Union’s concern at the murder of Anna Politkovskaya, expressed so eloquently in our previous debate in the European Parliament. As we negotiate a new global agreement with Russia, this broad spread of issues must be maintained. That is the essence of a comprehensive agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, at Lahti there was a short but important discussion on immigration. Again, there was a clear understanding that this was a collective problem, demanding a collective response. I was able to explain that in the coming weeks the Commission will be making proposals on how to improve maritime control of the Union’s southern borders. We will also be updating the global approach on migration in the run-up to the December European Council and working to tackle the problem at source in the Euro-African Conference on Migration and Development next month.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is still much more that we could do in this area if the political will and determination is there to give us the tools and resources needed. In particular, we believe that our decision-making system should be adapted. We can already do that under the existing Treaties. We cannot go on waiting so long for decisions that are so often blocked because of the rule of unanimity. Let us be frank: it is completely absurd that in a common space of freedom of movement we still sometimes think in terms of 25 migration policies. We need a European policy on migration.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Darfur was also discussed. I remain determined that we will do all we can to prevent another humanitarian tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Lahti was another signpost on our collective road towards equipping Europeans for globalisation. We will not be diverted from this path. The expectations of our citizens for a Europe of practical results are increasing. We must continue to respond. I am grateful to Mr Vanhanen for his excellent chairmanship and to the Finnish Presidency for our close cooperation. May it continue to the end of the Presidency and beyond. That is the way to achieve practical results for our Europe.</p>

Things did not bode well for the summit. Many newspapers, the highly regarded Financial Times in particular, painted a very gloomy picture of the meeting in advance, saying that it was a big risk inviting Russian President Putin along, as the EU is divided and disunited on energy and Russian policy. It said that this would just be a victory for President Putin. Things turned out differently, however. It was good to see EU leaders acting in unison and speaking with solidarity over dinner.</p>
<p class="contents">In speeches I have given here, I myself have said that the EU should have a united, unanimous, long-term policy on Russia. Now the first steps have succeeded in being taken. This will also show the public that the EU can act in difficult situations too.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we have to acknowledge that we still have a long way to go before things become concrete and Russia ratifies the Energy Charter, which will open up the market and enforce compliance with common rules. Although this was a small step forward, it was nevertheless an important step towards a uniform, long-term policy on Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also important that we ventured to speak openly about human rights and the murder of Anna Politkovskaya and not dodge the issues. We cannot sacrifice human rights on the altar of energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion was frank as far as President Putin was concerned too, even though he did not change his views. Hardly anyone expected him to either. Cooperation can only be built on mutual trust and a common will. Now a path has been opened up for greater cooperation on energy and other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">What I missed at the dinner discussion with Putin was matters to do with the Baltic. This would have been an excellent opportunity to bring up with Russia the problems of the Baltic Sea. I understand, of course, that you cannot speak about everything over one dinner. In general conclusion regarding the Lahti Summit, may I say ‘Well done, Prime Minister Vanhanen’.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin Schulz, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PSE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with an observation about the Russian President Mr Putin, who featured prominently in Mr Vanhanen’s speech and, Mr President of the Commission, in your own.</p>
<p class="contents">The evening spent with him must have been a memorable one indeed. From the reports I hear, and from what I read, the meeting with President Putin was quite something. It is good, I feel, that Mr Putin is so frank. I have no problems with this and nor, for what it is worth, does my group. I would like, first of all, to say that when Mr Putin comments on the speech made by the President of this House, Mr Borrell Fontelles, he honours us. It shows that he has at least been listening. We never know, of course, if everyone is listening, but it does appear that Mr Putin has been.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, however, reject comments that Mr Putin has made in relation to the speech where these are of an offensive nature, as the President of this House speaks for all its Members, and we thank him for what he said.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say that, yes, it is indeed a good thing for Mr Putin to speak about what he thinks of Italy. It is indeed a good thing for Mr Putin to speak about what he finds worthy of criticism in Spain. I believe these to be good things because European society is an open one. In our society anyone can criticise anything. This makes our society distinctly different from Russian society, where not everyone can voice criticisms of anything.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore fruitful to have an open exchange of opinions with the Russian President. For that reason, we are also stating that what is happening in Chechnya is not right and that it must be condemned when human rights are breached and when people are degraded. I would also mention that Russian people too, including soldiers of the Russian army, are treated dishonourably there. It is, of course, completely obvious – we will be pointing this out in the resolution on the death of Anna Politkovskaya – that it is not possible to describe today’s Russia, where journalists have to fear for their lives if they air grievances about their country, as a functioning democracy. That much is completely obvious.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the open exchange of opinions on our part with Mr Putin and with all the Russians, and Russian politicians, that we come across is a part of our understanding of what it means to deal with people as partners. We do, after all, criticise what goes on in the United States. We reserve the right to criticise what goes on elsewhere in the world just as we ourselves may be subject to criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, then, also critical of the speeches made by Prime Minister Vanhanen and the President of the Commission, in which they promised many fine things. It all sounded so wonderful. You are, of course, aware of that, as I say it in every speech I make in relation to your remarks. Excellent! Superb! Once everything that you have described to us is implemented Europe really will be an El Dorado for technology, an El Dorado for training and qualification. We will be the knowledge-based society of the 21st, nay the 22nd, century. Superb! Onwards, ever onwards! I have to tell you, though, gentlemen, that the point will come at which you will have to deliver the goods!</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the announcements. Outstanding! Except for the fact that – and this applies not only to you, least of all, indeed, to you, Mr President of the Commission, you who in fact make the right proposals, and who also seek to work towards the goals you announce – you in the Council, you, Mr Vanhanen, and the other Heads of State or Government, you must all put into practice what you have described in relation to energy policy, and that includes implementing it in your national energy plans.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I have to tell the House that, if you do not wish to be dependent on Russian energy, you must put an end to the waste of energy in Europe, in the US and in the industrialised nations of the world. If you want to limit climatic disasters, you must reduce CO2 emissions, and that will be accomplished, not by using natural gas from Russia, but rather through greater energy efficiency, through greater use of renewable energy, through power stations that make use of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and through power plants with the highest level of efficiency. To do this, I might add, we will need more technology, and this is where we come full circle, back to the Lisbon process, for, if we want new technology, we need to invest in the minds of our people, in the universities.</p>
<p class="contents">All that is true. It is just that we debate this time and again from scratch. Time and again, the same old things once more. Time and again, the same statements, and time and again, the same speech from me. This speech is not new either. I have already made it in modified form on numerous occasions. I have no desire to bore myself – not even with my own speeches. So, I beg you, let the announcements by the Commission and the Council at long last be backed up by actions.</p>

But then again there were no conclusions to the summit. My point is not that such occasions are not worthwhile: on the contrary, such is the need for greater action at European level that the Union could and should have four formal summits every year, as foreseen in the Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">What was on the menu at Lahti? I refer not, Prime Minister, to the artichoke soup or the grilled goose that you served at supper, proving that you can supplant <span class="italic">prosciutto di Parma</span>, but to the EIT and the European patents, to energy security, to immigration, to relations with Russia – strategic themes which need serious reflection, but also strategic decisions which highlight the need for coherent policymaking.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the use of a European technology university producing innovative ideas, if as a Union we are not able to agree a quick and easy patent registration system? What is the hope for a collective climate change strategy if we are not prepared together radically to change our patterns of energy consumption and generation? And what are the prospects for a common immigration policy if we fail to devise development and trade policies to bring relief from grinding poverty and misery? Green Papers and action plans galore point the way forward but, like proverbial horses, Member States can be brought to water but not made to drink. That is why Europe is failing and that is why we need more, not less, Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My group salutes President Borrell and Prime Minister Vanhanen and the other Prime Ministers who raised the issue of Anna Politkovskaya’s murder. If the invitation to President Putin and the publicity he received leaves many of us feeling distinctly ill at ease, the Finnish Presidency and the Finnish President are not to blame. The mistake was made when President Putin’s country was invited to join the Council of Europe and the G-8, before anchoring the rule of law into its culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Putin, ‘mafia’ is not a Russian expression, but <span class="italic">organizovanniye zhuliki</span> is too often our impression of your country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should sign no partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia until freedom, transparency and the rule of law are established, along with the legal certainty for investors that flows from them.</p>

<p class="contents">We believe that supporting democratic Russia and those who, like Anna Politkovskaya, fought and continue to fight against the authoritarian drift of Mr Putin's system of power is perfectly consistent with the attempt to secure our continent's energy supply, compliance with the Kyoto protocol and the development of energy efficiency and renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">Casting a veil of silence over the massacres in Chechnya, the closure of more than 90 non-governmental organisations, the arbitrary trials, targeted killings and growing corruption in order to obtain gas is not a winning strategy. In this regard, our group congratulates President Borrell. Nonetheless, we still respectfully state that we disagree with the clear support that he and the Finnish Government have given to reviving nuclear power. Whether we like it or not, there is a clear link between the so-called peaceful use of nuclear power and the proliferation of nuclear armaments – as shown plainly by the situation in Iran. There must not therefore be a trade-off between rights and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Events in the Ukraine and those which have taken place in Georgia more recently illustrate that appeasement does not increase Mr Putin’s reliability, but only his determination to act in the sole interest of his power group. We have already lost much precious time on this issue; therefore we must not miss the significant opportunity presented by the expiry of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement at the end of the year. We would like to state now that we will be completely opposed to any attempt to remove conditionalities, and, in particular, the reference to the human rights clause of this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We must develop a strategy which aims to reduce the unsustainability of consumption and the terrible inefficiency of our transport, construction and electricity systems, and which also aims decisively for excellence in our enterprises for the development of renewable energy. This is the best route to reducing our dependency and upholding peace, disarmament and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to add a few words on another extremely important subject that has been discussed: the issue of immigration. I believe that in this regard, the barrier lies within the Council and between the Member States, because up to now they have not been able to tackle the issue of regulating legal immigration, to negotiate and provide funding at European level for serious cooperation agreements that can truly help developing countries not to be forced to send their best forces to our countries, and to guarantee that European policies, above all in the areas of fishing and agriculture, do not have a devastating effect that does nothing more than to drive even more people onto the boats along the coasts of both their countries and ours.</p>

This meeting will not have left any trace of these topics in EU history.</p>
<p class="contents">Russian President Vladimir Putin was invited to Lahti to play solo with the EU orchestra. People wanted to speak to him about energy. At the same time it was an opportunity to talk about the country’s human rights issues. Human rights and freedom of the media cannot be sidestepped when policy on Russia is being considered. It is nevertheless impossible to reach agreement with the country on these matters, just as it is impossible for a certain other superpower on the other side of the Atlantic to agree with anyone on ending the torture of prisoners of war or trying US citizens for war crimes in the International Court of Justice in The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">President Putin wants a strategic partnership for the EU and Russia. It reminds one of the strategic partnership between NATO and Russia and the institutional solutions adopted for it. Within this framework Russia is prepared to conduct a dialogue on energy and will even commit to a legally binding instrument. It remained unclear, however, as to whether this would then mean opening up markets on both sides or only in one direction. Moreover, if it were in one direction, which one would it be? Lahti did not provide the answer, and the next time it is discussed will be at the EU-Russia Summit in November. The Lahti Summit was a kind of rehearsal for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The country to hold the Presidency, Finland, receives gas from Russia more cheaply than other EU countries. Electricity for industry and households in Finland is among the cheapest in the EU. Harmonisation of the electricity markets in the EU would mean a rise in electricity prices in the country which Prime Minister Vanhanen represents, while in a few countries prime ministers would certainly rejoice over a common energy policy of that sort.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vanhanen’s Government used the Lahti Summit to obtain a show of support from the other EU countries for price hikes for electricity and for covering up the wretched state that democracy is in, so that the Finnish Parliament is compelled, on the government’s suggestion, to ratify a constitution that perished in referenda held by other EU countries. All the European federalists are enthusing about it, but that is not democracy. The EU elite may be speaking with one voice today but they are not listening to the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The majority in this Parliament agrees with and supports the need for the European Institute of Technology, but what arrangements are there to make it happen? We can speak about it again and again, but there must be positive action to get it up and running, to give a core element to innovation and research in Europe.</p>

Otherwise, all research money, all researchers, all the top graduates at doctorate level will move to the US, Japan or elsewhere, because that is where their ideas can be protected and there is bigger investment.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, those are the two key issues with regard to achieving the Lisbon Strategy for the future.</p>

Energy is the lifeblood of any nation state and, of course, I am sent here to represent a nation state.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is very difficult for the people of the United Kingdom to accept that their energy policy should be decided basically by foreigners. It is within living memory that we have had to fight the battle of the Atlantic and we have had to live on a knife-edge for freedom because continental countries seem to find it impossible to live together.</p>
<p class="contents">The thought, the idea or the concept that United Kingdom energy could possibly be controlled by some sort of arrangement with a gangster like Putin is absolutely ludicrous! It is absolute madness to expect anything from a piece of paper signed by Putin, any more than we would from one signed by Adolf Hitler. The man is a gangster. If you are expecting the people of the United Kingdom to make any sort of arrangement for their lifeblood, the very lifeblood of the nation state, and to base it on people who have no fundamental interest in the wellbeing of the United Kingdom, I can tell you that it will not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to start speaking the truth. There seems to be some sort of abstract concept here of renewable energy. It is a scientific fact that most of our renewable energy technology does not work. Wind farms are absurd. Any scientist independently retained will tell you that it is complete and total nonsense to expect the United Kingdom to produce the sort of energy levels that the European Union seems to require – which is 20% from a renewable source – by means of wind farms. We have to start telling people the truth. We do not yet have the technology for renewable energy. Let us be honest about it, but then honesty, of course, is something that we avoid in this Chamber! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This significant statement was also made on my behalf, and I feel it was also made in the name of all Polish MEPs, and indeed of all MEPs from the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">President Borrell, along with the President of Poland and the Prime Ministers of Latvia, Denmark and Sweden, defended Europe’s honour. We need to look our Russian partners in the eye when we speak of human rights. We cannot condone double standards, that is to say, we cannot insist on respect for human rights but only in the countries we do not happen to trade with. A united Europe is more than a question of economics and business. It is also a system of values that should be constantly uppermost in our minds, and not just when it suits us. As we conclude necessary and important business deals with Russia, we would do well to keep in mind the words of Lenin, the archetypal Russian politician, who said that ‘the capitalists will sell us the rope with which to hang them’.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, some Polish journalists asked me if the Lahti Summit would mark a turning point in relations between the Union and Russia. I do not know. It might. To date, individual Member States of the Union have preferred to deal with Moscow over the heads of the others. Mr Schroeder hugged Mr Putin, Mr and Mrs Blair had a lovely time with Mr and Mrs Putin, Mr Berlusconi sang the praises of the Russian leader, and President Chirac became misty-eyed as he spoke of the President of the Russian Federation. Enough is enough. The European Union must unite. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This partnership could be in both our interests. As the Prime Minister stated, we could be mutually supportive in achieving good diplomacy in the Middle East. If we shared principles of democracy, that would be the best guarantee of stability in our bilateral relationship. Furthermore, economically and in terms of energy, we both need each other. This partnership can only work if it is based on shared principles, balance and a basic trust. I want to make a few remarks on these matters following the informal summit.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be made very clear that the boycott of Georgia and the treatment of Georgian people in Russia are unacceptable. This forms part of a pattern of interference by Russia that was also seen in Belarus and Ukraine. It must be clear that European principles mean that our common neighbours have their own sovereignty in deciding where their future lies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the killing of Anna Politkovskaya is the latest incident in a long line of at least 19 journalists who have disappeared or been killed since Putin became President. I welcome the declaration by the Duma and the remarks by Putin, but the only thing that will really convince us is if the killers are tried and brought to justice. Further, the Duma and the President would be even more convincing if they agreed to measures to increase reduced press freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the question of economic cooperation was raised, a subject often discussed. Here, there must be reciprocity. We cannot have a situation where Russia wants to invest in our gas and oil infrastructure and even wants to buy a minority stake in Airbus, but where at the same time our companies like Shell and Mobil are kicked out of the energy fields in Russia. I say this because I think that Europe needs to unite on these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe showed strength for the first time in Finland. Putin was put on the defensive because of a united Europe. Let this be an encouragement to unite much more in the future, because this is the only way in which this partnership will be a balanced one that is in the interests of both partners.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, if we think, like Mr Schulz, that innovation is not going far enough, then we should support the President of the Commission, because he is trying, and we should put pressure on our national leadership to support the Commission in achieving real results.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I compliment Mr Blair and Mr Balkenende for their initiative on climate change. It deserves our full support.</p>

I hope that the spirit of Lahti that you invoked will – as Mr Schulz said – also bring real, concrete results.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you have made a foreign policy proposal in the field of energy policy that I very much welcome – you have my full support. I would just ask you to stand firm when certain countries once again shy away when they realise that perhaps they do not want these common energy and foreign policies after all. I would also ask Mr Vanhanen to say the same thing to the members of his Council. The decisions that have been taken here – and I have heard some very positive reports of the discussions in Lahti – now need to be implemented. It is the only way that we will be able to defend our interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Dependency on Russia has been mentioned, but we really should bear in mind that Russia is also dependent on the European Union, on its consumption of crude oil and natural gas, precisely because the pipelines almost all lead solely to the European Union. We should therefore go into these negotiations and discussions with pride and self-confidence, and not be afraid to bring up certain subjects. Particularly in this area, we should establish an interdependence, including, of course, those regions that you mentioned, Mr Barroso, and which we should not forget, such as Ukraine and other countries in the Black Sea region, particularly Turkey. We must draw up a joint policy with them, too. Then we will be able to establish a true partnership with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the disputes, we must not forget that, in our relations with Russia, particularly in the future partnership agreement, we also need a clear dispute resolution procedure. Conflicts may arise at any time, and we will not always be able to avoid them in future, so we must have a dispute resolution procedure like in the World Trade Organisation, so that we can ultimately resolve these matters mutually or through an independent mediator.</p>
<p class="contents">Our goal is partnership. As Mr Schultz has already said, it is quite clear that Mr Putin is a strong man. Many Russians see that as a positive thing, but when the European Union is united it is stronger than Mr Putin. Then we will really be able to achieve a good, appropriate and equal partnership.</p>

Nuclear is only 6% of our energy and it will divide Europe more than it will bring us together to speak with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I think you now have the historic responsibility to come up with a comprehensive energy review in January. In this energy review we need a CO2 target for Europe for 2020. If we do not have a CO2 target for Europe we will not have investment security for our industry; and what is better regulation about, if it is not about bringing energy and climate policy together in the document you bring forward?</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority of this energy review must be putting an end to the oligopolistic structure in our energy and transport sectors. European business, European citizens, are losing billions of euros because of the lack of competition, and these same companies are preventing the innovation boost which we could have in these sectors. And as long as these oligopolies are not dismantled, we need specific policies in sectoral renewables and so on. Such a strategy is the ground for a foreign energy policy and this is a peace project for the world, because these technologies will diminish pressure on resources and it is a business opportunity for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time, Europe remained silent and those parties remained silent, whereas now they are all supporters of human rights, and are putting Vladimir Putin's Russia in the dock.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is true that human rights must not be traded for economic interests, and I am completely convinced that it is, it is equally true that our focus and our determined defence of the values on which Europe is founded and which are today frequently infringed in Russia, but not only there – incidentally, I would like to hear the same pathos in speeches on infringements of human rights in Turkey, for example, a country which some would like to welcome enthusiastically, even immediately, into the European Union – must not close our eyes to a necessity. It is clear that as much as Russia needs us for energy collaboration, we need an economic partnership agreement with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that Mr Putin himself has stated that he does not reject the principles of the Charter, but asks that another document be drafted, taking these principles and amending them in part. This is therefore a clear opening. The question of the agreement with Russia is highlighted by geo-economic and geo-strategic issues. Such is the agreement before us, and it regards the economic future of our region. A sense of realism is therefore needed, without, of course, abandoning the protection of human rights, which nonetheless represent a means of applying pressure in this instance also, given that Mr Putin’s policy is turning towards an economic nationalism that is worrying for Europe, closing itself to collaboration and cutting contracts with Western companies. This is a realist policy that we need to support strongly and with a great sense of responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to focus my thoughts on the central issue at the Lahti summit: the issue of energy security in Europe and our continuing relationship with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent dispute between Ukraine and Russia on gas supplies gave us all cause for concern. Let us be in no doubt that the relationship between the EU and Russia is of vital significance and ways must be found to strengthen it. We will need Russia’s energy resources in the decades ahead and Russia, by the same token, will need access to EU markets if it is to develop its economic potential. The stakes on both sides are too high for diplomatic grandstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to note that President Putin has said he wants to build a relationship based on common values. Those values must include an unshakeable commitment by Russia to pluralism and democratic process. If that great nation is to be embraced as a strategic partner in the years ahead, then we in Europe need to be assured that it will pursue the same kind of values and standards on democracy and human rights as we do. At this time perhaps we should take Mr Putin at his word and encourage him to ensure that democracy flourishes in Russia. However, there are some who believe the democratic process in Russia has actually stalled recently. I hope that more movement will take place in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate President Barroso on saying that the relationship with Russia requires transparency, the rule of law and reciprocity. I hope Mr Putin was listening.</p>
<p class="contents">I was a little disappointed on human rights issues. I was disappointed that my own British Prime Minister, who had claimed that he was to raise those matters with Mr Putin, seems to have failed to do so. He must now find a suitable moment to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing to fear from frank debate on those issues. It is very necessary for a productive relationship in the future between Europe and Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the world of the imaginary, of dreams.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us imagine for a moment that the dream comes true. Europe is an economic giant. Even excluding trade between the 25 Member States, we are the world’s leading exporter. Europe is the leading destination for direct international investments. Not counting mergers and acquisitions, for 2005, the company IBM registered 8 000 investments in new production capabilities worldwide, including 900 in China, 600 in India, 1 200 in the United States and 3 200 in the Union, which thus takes 40% of world production investments.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Europe has lost market shares, but less than the United States or Japan. Yes, China has become our top supplier, but Europe has doubled the volume of its exports to China. In fact, 60% of Chinese exports in 2005 were carried out by foreign companies operating in China. The Triad countries sell the goods that they produce in China to themselves, for the greater benefit of our consumers and the shareholders of multinational companies. Yes, our unemployment rates are too high, even though we are creating new jobs. The lowest salaries can be found in sectors such as catering, caretaking and cleaning companies, small businesses and craft industries, which are not subject to global competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Europe could do better, if only the dwarfs who govern us would implement their own decisions and invest in innovation, research and trans-European networks. What we need is a real Union budget that would allow us to support the swift integration of the new members and so create an internal market in which we all experience more growth. Furthermore, if the leaders would honour their own signatures, we would perhaps arrive at a new energy treaty for Europe. Finally, if the summits were to stop taking speculative decisions, President Barroso could put in place a European Institute of Technology provided with real funding.</p>

The current energy negotiations with Russia have to be based on reciprocity, the rule of law and transparency. However, what is happening now in Russia in the field of energy is the very opposite of this and we need to take note of it. This also proves the absolute necessity of a common European energy policy, not only on security of supply but also for fighting global warming. Very soon we will be negotiating the emissions-trading system with Russia, which has signed and ratified the Kyoto Protocol. That will be the true test both of European Union unity and what Russia ...</p>

In Russia, contract killings are as much a part of life as the suppression of non-governmental organisations and the restriction of fundamental democratic rights. The Yukos case, the detention of Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev, and the war in Chechnya are still, with regard to energy policy and human rights, current examples of the despotism of Mr Putin's Government. The murder of Anna Politkovskaya once again made it tragically clear that, when it comes to crimes against critical journalists, Russia is second only to Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is currently standing at a crossroads between small steps towards democracy and authoritarian structures. Criticism alone is no longer enough: energy policy and human rights must be negotiated jointly, and must not be played off against each other. According to Mr Putin, there can be no reliable guarantees in energy security. Despite that, we must ensure reliable guarantees for our European system of values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we can now manage to speak with one voice on energy, that is a step along the path to speaking with a united voice on all foreign policy issues. Secondly, another indicator is whether and how we can influence Russia’s policies. When talking to the European Union about energy, Russia knows very well how to exploit our fears, while for our part we forget that Russia has an interest with regard to us – selling its energy profitably, easing the visa system, and making use of all that European civilisation provides, if we can put it in this way. This point should be used effectively, in order to achieve progress in the spheres of freedom of the press, democracy, human rights and investment equality. Thirdly, there is innovation policy. Currently, the potential of the new Member States is not being fully exploited. It is precisely in a new Member State that the European Institute of Technology should be set up.

Can we therefore formulate a new policy for cutting our American apron strings? I heard someone talking about the dwarves that rule Europe.

It failed to persuade President Putin to sign the energy agreement that should make better access to Russia’s gas and oil fields possible. EU enterprises investing in Russia still face major legal uncertainty, particularly in the areas of compliance and enforceability of contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">President Putin came to Lahti in the knowledge that the European Union would be unable to speak with one voice about the human rights situation in Russia and about Russia’s attitude to Georgia, for example. The lack of political unanimity is apparently as structural as is our dependence on Russian energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot imagine that the negotiation process with Turkey was not a talking point at the informal summit, given Turkey's refusal to comply with the current criteria and given a general worsening of relations with it, even though one third of its population is still in favour of EU accession.

<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that Europe has had the courage to speak frankly about its questions on freedom of expression in Moscow, even if it confined itself to more diplomatic remarks in front of the cameras. European integration is founded on the rule of law and respect for democratic values. We have a duty to promote these principles, both at home and among our partners. This does not mean, contrary to what the Russian President implied, that Europe believes itself to be perfect. Of course, we have our faults, but we also have a duty to express clearly our concern and our disapproval regarding worrying abuses. Europe is not simply an economic Community.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of energy, the Russian President has clearly stated that he does not reject the principles of the Energy Charter and that he would welcome a document that took up those principles while amending some of its provisions. In my opinion, this will be the overriding issue of the European Union-Russia Strategic Partnership to be negotiated shortly, as well as of the European Energy Summit proposed for next year by President Chirac.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding immigration, the various positions are still too far apart for us to achieve a swift definition of the common policy that we need so much. The Member States appear decidedly less hurried than Europeans are to take this issue forward in order to give consistency to the different national policies operating within the Schengen area, in particular in relation to illegal immigration. In December, the Finnish Presidency must draw practical conclusions on the issues that have been raised at this informal summit. However, without the political will of the Member States, a presidency is reduced to impotence even when armed with goodwill, such as that currently being demonstrated by Finland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU had a joint message for the Russian President on energy policy, democracy and human rights. The discussion must, however, be seen as only the start. Just as the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament Group, Martin Schulz, said, we now need concrete action. Whether speech is translated into deeds will be seen in the very near future, when we begin to negotiate the actual details of the EU-Russia agreement. It was important at the Lahti meeting to have spoken with Russia and not just about Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">It was good that the discussions on energy also included consideration of the future. Although it may seem that the most important thing in the short term is the availability of energy, it was good that attention was paid to the future. Fortunately, it was left over from the session on innovation on the Lahti agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Our challenges in the area of energy policy and the answer to the problems of the future lie with innovation and with how we can start to exploit renewable energy sources and develop technology to save energy to a substantial degree. We have to get to a stage where over the long term carbon dioxide emissions will be cut by 60-80%, and this can only happen if we have a genuine common will as Europeans to invest in renewable sources of energy and energy savings.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, a social Europe was on the agenda at Lahti, not on the agenda of the summit itself, but on that of a separate labour market meeting. Employment and improved levels of employment are a very important component of the competitiveness of the European Union, and should therefore be clearly visible at all meetings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These subjects are worthy of serious debate. This is particularly true because in the space of a year little has been achieved in these spheres. The guest invited to the event – the President of Russia – is proof of how serious the Presidency is about security of energy supply. The idea is to be welcomed in every respect, since it gave Heads of Government the opportunity not only to listen to the opinion of Russia’s leader on the chances of ratification of the Energy Charter and about the risk to Europe’s investments in the energy sector in Russia, but also Russia’s policy of pressure on Georgia and its understanding in the sphere of human rights. It was a useful prelude to the summit between the European Union and Russia scheduled for next month. We may allow ourselves to hope that this meeting has increased understanding among the European Union Member States that the most effective way of making Russia into a partner with an interest in Europe is to approach it as a united cartel of energy consumers. Russia’s current and future economy is built on the export of energy resources.

<p class="contents">When the Finnish Presidency presented its programme in July, I called in this House for illegal immigration to be treated as a priority issue. There has been little cause for optimism since then. On the ground, what is taking place on the shores of the Canary Islands is very serious. The Frontex system and solidarity amongst European partners in general have not been up to the task, but perhaps unilateral regularisations did not create the best possible climate for persuading the partners to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">Illegal immigration is a problem for all of us in an area without internal borders, such as the Schengen area. At European level this area is essentially dealt with by means of taking decisions and implementing them. Ideas and plans have largely been established, for example in the conclusions of the European Councils of Seville, in 2002, and of Thessaloniki and of Brussels, in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Those conclusions enshrine the principle that immigration should be integrated into the European Union’s external action and that cooperation is needed with third countries in the field of illegal immigration. There is also a mechanism for assessing the degree of cooperation of third countries and furthermore the assessment criteria are included. I believe, however, that this mechanism has been used little and in a very bureaucratic way.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to point out that decisions on illegal immigration no longer require unanimity in the Council, but that, during 2004 and 2005, this problem was relegated until the assaults on the fences in Ceuta and Melilla. The Union must not act in a reactive manner, in response to events, and then forget those issues that were previously priorities. We have been negotiating a re-admission agreement with Morocco for five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is not acceptable that we should only take terrorism seriously following 11 September 2001, the energy crisis only following the Russian-Ukrainian crisis, and illegal immigration, only after the deaths at the fences of Ceuta and Melilla.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will be judged by its results. I hope that there will be results in the remaining months of the Finnish Presidency and also at the European Council in December, and naturally that the progress made at previous European Councils be taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this was requested by all the countries situated on Europe’s borders, and in particular by the countries of the South. We are very concerned, because it is evident that the Member States are still dragging their feet with regard to drawing up a genuine common policy in the field of immigration. What is more, some people want to approach the issue of immigration solely from the point of view of cracking down on it. However, in my view, the urgency is first and foremost humanitarian. We must combat the exploitation of immigrants by networks seeking to lower labour costs and bypass labour laws and rules on social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament yesterday we had an enlightening hearing enabling us to observe that, on European soil, immigrants are considered as slaves. They are largely underpaid, forced to work extremely long hours and housed in terrible conditions. They are ill-treated. Some have suffered physical assaults. It is because it was confronted with these unacceptable living conditions and people without rights that Spain decided to regularise <span class="italic">en masse</span> all those working in its territory, and I pay tribute here to the immense courage shown by that country. Mass regularisation is not, and must not be, a solution. In this case, however, to act otherwise was impossible. It had to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">We must all now be vigilant in our countries in order to ensure that all working immigrants have rights and are considered in the same way as all other workers. That is what the credibility of the Union and its values requires of us. If we really want to be effective in the field of immigration, the Member States must finally agree to work together in order to put in place a genuine policy on legal immigration and, above all, a genuine co-development policy, as close to the people as possible. Member States must also take great care not to enrich dictators or fuel corruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would perhaps be wiser for us in European politics not always to bandy about grand speeches and then disappoint the people when we do not get results. I find Mr Barroso's proposal to undertake realistic projects and implement them bit by bit much more intelligent.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been an important development in energy policy on the subject of security of supply. First of all, the subject of security of supply has come to the forefront of energy policy, and has, I hope, perhaps helped us here in Parliament to stop discussing energy policy only from the point of view of climate policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Security of supply is a high priority. At least since the developments in Ukraine – since it became clear that Russia and President Putin are using energy policy as a political tool – we are all surely a bit more prepared, as was evident in Lahti to a certain extent, to take this issue more seriously. This is not just talk – there has clearly been a change in Russia. Anyone who takes Mr Putin seriously – and we must do so – must address these positions. There is also the fact that we are taken more seriously when we act together. To that extent, Lahti was a success, because we spoke with one voice. The next step would be for us to push harder for Europe to be given competences in the field of energy policy. Thirdly, we must be more consistent in the specific actions we undertake.</p>
<p class="contents">Security of supply has a foreign policy aspect, but also involves strengthening the industries involved in it. We must examine more closely whether our rules, regulations and inspections are really ensuring security of supply, or actually producing uncertainty. Those who negotiate for us, those who buy energy out in the real world, need to invest, and businesses only invest when there is a reasonable degree of certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, security of supply also requires a variety of energy sources. It would be idiocy to rule out nuclear power: it would do security of supply a serious disservice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without the Lahti Summit, the Russian president would not have used a more accommodating tone towards some Member States. I congratulate our Finnish colleagues; many countries could learn from Finnish diplomacy, which has always been able to continue the dialogue with Russia even during the most difficult times.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, there exists a mutual but asymmetrical interdependence in energy supply between the EU and Russia. We in the EU, as importing states, are more dependent, but Russia’s dependence must also be considered. Our aim is to reduce this dependence on Russian energy sources, but for most Member States – Hungary amongst them – there is no viable medium-term alternative. As far as renewable energy sources are concerned, Mr Barroso, the European Commission has no viable concept of any kind.</p>
<p class="contents">We criticise Russia on the rule of law, and rightly so. But can we speak of the rule of law, Mr Barroso, if there is no legal security within the European Commission? When, in the middle of the maize harvest, the Union changes the rules of intervention for maize? This is no rule of law nor legal security. We rightfully criticise Russia, but we too have to observe the rule of law. My congratulations on the summit, and I ask Mr Barroso to take steps, because otherwise Hungary will call on the European Court of Justice, as this is no rule of law nor legal security.

<p class="contents">In the discussion of the issues of safety and transparency in the energy sector, what happened on the Druzhba oil pipeline, when Russia stopped the supply of oil, took on more the character of a political accident than a technical one.

I, however, would like to focus on another important subject discussed at the summit, namely innovation and technological progress. I fully endorse President Barroso’s opinion that the more the Union focuses on practical tasks and on actions close to the citizens, the more it will be respected and appreciated by them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso’s promotion of a European Institute for Technology is an example of just such an action, that is to say, a specific venture which is bound to generate a positive response from European citizens. It was perhaps unintentional but, in a sense, highly symbolic that the planned Institute was agreed in Finland, which is the most innovative country in our Community. It is also very important, however, to involve the new Member States of the European Union in the process of developing cutting-edge technologies. The current level of investment in innovation in the aforementioned countries is far too low. The structure of the European Institute for Technology proposed by the Commission, namely a central core plus a network of Knowledge and Innovation Communities spread across the whole of Europe, will enable academic institutions in Central and Eastern Europe to be involved in the Institute’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Institute for Technology’s budget and sources of funding are a key concern that goes hand in hand with any discussion concerning the plans for the Institute. In my country, Poland, I have noted a readiness to devote structural fund resources to setting up the Institute. The Polish authorities are thus demonstrating their desire to link regional development aims to contemporary challenges. These mainly involve investment in knowledge and developing an economy based on modern technologies. In cooperation with the regional and local authorities, the Polish Government is putting forward the city of Wrocław as the seat of the Governing Board of the new European Institute for Technology. The Polish authorities also propose that Wrocław should become one of the main scientific research centres. I firmly believe that the city is ideally suited to this purpose. Wrocław, and the surrounding region, can offer a vibrant and innovative academic environment, with over one hundred thousand gifted and ambitious young students and considerable new investment in industrial development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the end, they managed to get Russia to turn its back on them on both energy and humanitarian issues.</p>

Fine, but then why did we cut the Frontex budget?

In order to address illegal immigration and inhumane trafficking in human beings, we need, first of all, a legal immigration framework. They bicker among themselves and refuse to adopt one.

In Russia, the vertical of power is organised down to the last detail, the Duma has been domesticated, governors are appointed, not elected, freedom of the press is restricted, and the work of non-governmental organisations, including political foundations for democracy and human rights, is getting harder and harder. Therefore, we cannot currently have a community of values with the Russian Government – it might be possible with the Russian people, but they were not in Lahti.</p>

Our heads of state and government showed unity and reflected our common values. As the EPP Vice-President, Michel Barnier, said a couple of weeks ago in Lyon, none of us can sit at the table of global decision-making as a national politician. This really is true and also applies to EU-Russia relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of speech is in great danger in Russia. In a very recent study by Reporters Without Frontiers – where many EU Member States held the top positions – Russia was placed 147th out of 168 countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I rarely agree with the President of Parliament, Mr Borrell Fontelles, but I have to say that he was right to emphasise strongly the question of human rights and democracy in Russia with President Putin. We must have a clear stance on human rights, whoever we might be facing.</p>
<p class="contents">An independent and efficient investigation to find and condemn the vicious murderers of the courageous journalist Anna Politkovskaya is a real test for freedom and the rule of law in Russia and for its relations with the EU. The democratic world simply cannot stay quiet when freedom is threatened and its strongest advocates are shot down.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not act now, we might lose another 30 years of freedom, as did our Hungarian citizens when the western world did not act bravely enough to support the people who rose up in revolution 50 years ago.

Therefore, the theme also holds true in relation to energy and the issue of our relationship with Russia, and a leadership causing increasing concern: Europe must be united and speak with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">If, as Mr Goebbels has said, the Lahti summit has produced only speculation, much now remains to be done, and for this we need an authoritative and bold Commission, capable of laying aside national self-interests and speaking on behalf of all, a Parliament capable of being the most authoritative exponent of Community interests, and a Council and governments which understand that interdependency among our countries is the key to increasing our negotiating power.</p>
<p class="contents">There are signs and examples of this, from among which I would like to cite the decision made by the Italian Government, which, on hearing the news of its seat from January on the UN Security Council, said straight away that this seat will be used in the service of Europe. This is a practical action representing an example of a contribution from one member of the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first messages from the Council's side are positive, as they are from Parliament's side. What I wish to highlight, Mr Vanhanen and Mr Barroso, is that we need a new and innovative tool which successfully combines education, research and innovation. We need a steam engine which will enable us to transform research into innovative products and services. However, we do not need an institution which will uproot the long-standing university tradition in Europe; we need one which will respect and make maximum use of it. It is therefore, for this very reason, extremely important for us to know what our universities, research centres and undertakings believe before we take a decision on this new institute.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous agencies have already submitted their opinions. At first glance, it would appear that the messages we are receiving are often contradictory on certain important issues. However, I consider that the positions are not set in stone; rather they express concerns. That is why it is also very important for us to give all the partners a great deal of our time in order to consult willingly and in a spirit of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The initial approach in the proposal for a regulation leaves open numerous questions on crucial issues, such as how will we safeguard viable financing for the ΕΙΤ? How will we persuade private individuals to invest in an unprecedented vehicle? How will we safeguard the fundamental participation of universities and convince them that the ΕΙΤ will not clash with them or weaken their activities? How will we convince them that research activities will not be fragmented, leading to the opposite of the result being sought?</p>
<p class="contents">We need to clarify all the details, because that is where the success of the endeavour will be judged; not in the general idea which is generally accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the press conference in Lahti last Friday evening, we all found out, to our great surprise, that nothing is happening between Georgia and Russia, and that instead there is a conflict between Georgia on the one hand, and Abkhazia and Ossetia on the other. According to President Putin, the situation is nearing the point of bloodshed.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, however, Putin informed Western journalists that if Kosovo were to be separated from Serbia, Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria would definitely break away.

<p class="contents">Mr President, we know that the conflict between Russia and Georgia is not about a provocation on the part of Georgia, but rather a new awakening of Imperial Russia, which is based on the one hand on inciting Russian nationalism, and on the other hand on the use of energy supplies for the restoration of the empire.

Under pressure from the media, European politicians have made it clear that they appreciate the importance of speaking with one voice when it comes to energy. I fear, however, that we have yet to achieve any actual unity and harmony when it comes to promoting energy issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This is evidenced by the fact that some EU Member States prefer to conduct bilateral negotiations on their energy security issues rather than on behalf of the EU as a whole. I must highlight the fact that the energy issue has environmental, economic and, above all, geostrategic implications. Europe is dependent on external energy sources. This inability to harmonise our interests and approach weakens our negotiating position in the global energy market, exacerbates our vulnerability and seriously weakens our authority as Europeans acting in a foreign policy context. Our ability to promote values such as democracy, the rule of law and market transparency around the world will be restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to call on the Council and the Commission to take practical steps to prepare and implement a European energy policy, which is a potential solution and which would prepare the ground for a common EU energy policy. Such a strategy would set out our goals in the area of energy, as well as the measures needed to achieve those goals, and would lay down a clear mechanism for joint decision-making on energy projects and for communication inside and outside the EU, strengthening our solidarity in energy issues. At stake here is our future in the globalised world and our ability to safeguard the continent’s stability and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that the energy issue will be a key test of the EU’s ability to act in an effective manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is as I would expect. However, it pricks European consciences, which would have been pricked in the same way if oil from Saudi Arabia, Iran or some African country had been at issue.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the issue is not that of knowing whether gas can be purchased from the Devil. Purchased it will be. The issue is, rather, that of how gas from the Devil can be done without. I think that, over the next few years – and in your case, Mr Vanhanen, over the next few months – it is independence that must guide us. In the next 10 to 20 years, oil and gas must be to our independence what coal and steel were to our peace.</p>

First of all I would like to thank the Finnish Presidency for organising this summit, since an informal summit is a good forum in which to talk about difficult issues. Secondly, I think that it was Mr Vanhanen’s steadiness and initiative that made it possible to achieve a unified stance, at least regarding energy issues. I would, however, like to draw your attention, gentlemen, to two subjects. Firstly, it seems to me that the provisions of the Energy Charter ought definitely to be included in the new partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russia. This is all the more important in that Mr Putin referred to it as a strategic agreement. What should we ourselves be doing, though? The sad experience of my country and my people is evidence that Russia has never shied away from using force and pressure when it has been able to do so. For that reason it seems to me that, firstly, we have to work much harder to create a unified gas and electricity network in the European Union. Secondly, we must work much harder on alternative energy resources. Thirdly, we must work on energy-saving programmes. Here I endorse Mr Schulz, who gave a very passionate speech about this earlier. There is one more question that was touched on at the press conference. Mr Putin said, in reply to a question, that the issue concerning Abkhazia, Georgia and South Ossetia was their affair. To put it mildly, that is cynical. We know very well that Russia’s army is also in Transnistria, that Russia supplied weapons and that the leading personnel in all those enclaves are officers from Russia’s official organisations.

In this respect, I believe that it will be easier for the Union to find a basic approach in its foreign energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is actually worth remembering that we did not begin the debate on foreign energy relations at European Council level until March this year, at a summit dinner during the Austrian Presidency. At the time we reached the conclusion that the Union also needed a foreign energy policy. During the subsequent presidency, Finland assumed the task of shaping a foreign energy policy in collaboration with the Commission, and that is what we are doing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission drafted an excellent paper for the Lahti Summit, and over lunch there we spent around three hours discussing the approach so thoroughly that President Barroso and I were able to speak for the group as a whole in the evening when we met President Putin. Over the months to come we also will be defining this foreign energy policy in terms of a Union approach, not just in respect of Russia, but all our partners and all third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite a number of speeches here pointed out that the Lahti Summit was a step or a first step in the right direction. That is how I also feel. I also sympathise with the comments that we must in practice show that we are also taking action. The next important stage will be in the next few weeks when the Council must reach agreement on the negotiations mandate, on the basis of which the Union is to commence talks with Russia on the future Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, or whatever name this new agreement should be given. At the EU-Russia Summit in November consensus will have to be reached and a decision taken on the commencement of talks. In this respect, the Lahti Summit was a practice run. The Lahti Summit, however, also let it be known to Mr Putin that at the meeting in November, at which President Barroso, High Representative Javier Solana and I will represent the Union, we will be speaking on behalf of the entire Union. This debate we have now had in Parliament will provide firm support for that. We might say that all the Union’s institutions are in the front line on this.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dependent on one another. This dependence must be made to benefit both parties through reciprocity. Dependence also needs to be based on common values, as has already been said so many times in the Chamber. This is a clear Union aim and policy. When we talk of cooperation with Russia, however, we should not make Russia or the Russians out to be monsters. They want cooperation, they want to improve their standard of living and prosperity, and they want to cooperate with us. This was also the strong message that President Putin was sending. He stressed that Russia and the Russians are in fact more dependent on Europe than Europe is on Russia. They particularly need cooperation in very many areas of technology to make progress in their own development work, and we must also be prepared for this.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to investment, I would like to remind everyone that European companies have already made investments in the Russian energy sector to the tune of many billions of euros. Some major investment projects are unfinished, some companies are having difficulties with the Russian administration, and some have seen their projects through to completion more smoothly. For that reason we need common rules to play by, rules which are the same for everyone. Similarly, the rules for Russian companies on Europe also need to be the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank you for this debate and the feedback. In December we will return to many of these subject areas, with some firm conclusions, and then we will also definitely be returning to the questions raised in several speeches here relating to immigration. On matters of immigration, whether it be legal or illegal immigration, we need solidarity amongst us and a common policy, and we will also definitely be returning to that.</p>

Allow me simply to return to a number of points you raised during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard, first of all, to the European Institute of Technology – and as Prime Minister Vanhanen pointed out – the European Council gave the green light – not the orange light, but the green light – to the initiative at the end of the Lahti summit. It now remains to implement it. That is why we have already presented a legislative proposal to be examined by the Council and Parliament and covering, for example, the issue of the financing that you mentioned during the debate. Our approach is that there must be financing not only by the Community institutions but also by the Member States that wish to support the initiative. It is a way for them to achieve the Lisbon objectives where innovation and research are concerned. We also await contributions from the private sector. On this subject, allow me to point out to you that, on the basis of our informal contacts, the private sector has a great interest in financing certain actions to be taken by the European Institute of Technology, a state of affairs that is, moreover, only to be expected since the same ideas are to be found in many of our Member States. Public-private partnerships do exist and, if initiatives on the part of the Member States manage to attract private investment for research, I wonder why we should not be capable of achieving the same at European level. I say that because we think it necessary to give a European dimension to support for research.</p>
<p class="contents">Where this very subject of research is concerned, the United States manifestly differs from Europe due, in particular, to the existence of institutions or networks covering the whole of the territory of the United States of America, for example the National Science Foundation, familiar to a number of you, or the National Institute for Health. In Europe, we have until now had practically nothing along those lines. A number of our countries have major institutions in the form of great universities, but it is only now that we have set up the European Research Council, which is an institution crucial to implementing the Seventh Research Framework Programme, and the European Institute of Technology, which is an institution specifically founded on the idea of networks with a view to giving a European impetus and perspective to innovation, research and teaching focused on excellence. That is why it is a great project, and I would thank all those who have spoken in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have asked for this Institute’s main priorities to include the fight against climate change and a leading role for Europe in the area of renewable sources of energy that respect the environment. I believe that we have a specific mission in this regard, and I shall address my remarks more particularly to those, including Mr Turmes, who have expressed concerns about this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Energy is, without a doubt, the issue of the future, and not only from an economic, but also from a political, point of view. I agree with the comment by Mr Poignant, who draws a parallel with the situation in the coal and steel sector. I do think that, where energy is concerned, there is a serious argument in favour of a federal approach. That is, moreover, why, a few months ago, we presented a Green Paper on sustainable energy, and we were very pleased with the support given by the European Council to the idea of a common approach to energy matters. It is, therefore, precisely along those lines that we are working, Mr Poignant.</p>
<p class="contents">That approach is very important if we consider our responsibilities to our planet and to future generations. Climate change is perhaps the greatest challenge of the 21st century. However, it is also very important from the economic point of view, so crucial is it for us still to be capable of being in the vanguard of the fight against climate change, providing it with its impetus. It is also very important as a demonstration of solidarity, especially with a view to the enlarged Europe. We have here an opportunity to show that solidarity needs to be real.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that we are concerned here with something very ambitious, and I can guarantee, in particular to Mr Turmes, that it is in this spirit that we are preparing the energy package to be presented in January. What is more, you have already seen an initial sign of what is to come in the form of the proposal on energy efficiency that we have just tabled. As Prime Minister Vanhanen has said, the Lahti Council has opened the way to the formal decisions on energy that we hope to obtain at the spring Council under the auspices of what will already be the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying that I share the ambition, and sometimes even the impatience, expressed by Mr Goebbels, Mr Swoboda, Mr Schulz and many others. Our role now is, as Mr Goebbels said, to convert the dream into reality. Indeed it is. However, the informal summits offer an opportunity to deepen the debate and to consolidate positions, as shown moreover by the Hampton Court summit. From this point of view, I can honestly say to you that the Lahti Council signalled progress. It was difficult, particularly because of our ever more complex relations with Russia. Where that aspect too was concerned, I had the sense of progress being made, with Mr Putin’s presence contributing to this. I had the feeling that the Heads of State or Government understood the need for coherence and solidarity. That is why I hope that now, with the vigilant support of the European Parliament, the conditions will be present, during the Finnish Presidency and beyond, to make progress in these very important areas of energy and innovation and also to make headway with our project of a more united Europe.</p>

He says that Britain’s ‘lifeblood’ should not be in the hands of ‘foreigners’, but how does he want to avoid us importing energy? Certainly not by renewables, which he dismisses out of hand as ‘nonsense’ claiming that wind farms are ‘absurd’ and that ‘no reputable scientist’ would claim that renewable energy can play a significant part in Britain’s energy mix.</p>
<p class="contents">So, no imports, no renewables, North Sea oil and gas running out, nuclear, if kept, catering merely for a small proportion of electricity, and the possibilities for expanding coal being somewhat limited, the UKIP vision of Britain’s future, untarnished by ‘foreigners’, is a dark one! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These nefarious plans have increasingly been coming from above. Take, for example, the words of Antonio Vitorino, strategist of the Portuguese Socialist Party, who, we hear, ‘now works for the Commission’. He says that the Portuguese Presidency in the second half of 2007 will have ‘the enormous responsibility' of ‘taking the first steps towards implementing the [so-called] constitutional amendment programme’ and ‘this will be a launch pad for the new [so-called] European Constitution’, thereby implementing a ‘programme’ previously defined by the German Presidency and to be concluded by the French Presidency in the second half of 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">The headlong rush towards capitalist integration that characterises the EU and the neoliberal, federalist and militarist integration that the so-called ‘European Constitution’ would reinforce in the legal and political spheres will once again, in spite of all the propaganda, obfuscation and authoritarianism, have to contend with categorical rejection by all those who are fighting for a Europe of sovereign, equal States, a Europe of social progress, cooperation and peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, at a time when our continent is subjected to an unprecedented wave of illegal immigration, the Heads of State or Government have not seen fit to devote more than half an hour to this problem. Nothing – absolutely nothing – is to be expected of the European Union in this area, and it is a matter of urgency to acknowledge formally that no immigration policy can be anything but national and no cooperation on the subject anything but intergovernmental.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Putin is quite entitled to retain a degree of sovereignty over his country’s energy resources and to refuse to sell them cut-price to hungry oil multinationals in the name of an economic liberalism to which he does not subscribe. As for the sabre-rattling about human rights, respect for which must form the basis for the EU’s relations with the rest of the world, this would be more credible if it were not so selective and if it were also directed at countries such as China.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are still waiting for the Council to condemn the Turkish authorities, who have tried to force the removal of one of our Cypriot fellow Members from a delegation of MEPs. It is less and less acceptable to negotiate the accession of a country that refuses to recognise the full range of Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was one of the first five judges whose appointments were agreed at the national Round Table held in Hungary in 1989, when that country and others found their freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">As President of the Constitutional Court, President Sólyom had a huge influence on the decisions that strengthened the young Hungarian democracy and institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Third President of the Republic of Hungary, Mr Sólyom has increased the weight and prestige of his country.</p>
<p class="contents">He is a defender of social and environmental rights. He commanded respect during the first year of his term in office, carrying out his duties with caution, but acting firmly when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">He is also a committed environmentalist. This has led him to create a European Group of Green Presidents, that is to say, of heads of state concerned about environmental problems, an original and creative initiative.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">You can imagine which group the Members applauding you belong to.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifty years ago, the uprising of the Hungarian people confirmed the strength of popular support for democratic principles and their will to dictate their own national destiny. We are currently remembering and celebrating a series of milestones.</p>
<p class="contents">It all began in 1989, when his country proclaimed its independence and in 1990, when the Hungarian Parliament declared 23 October a Hungarian national holiday, demonstrating that the legacy of the 1956 Revolution is still alive amongst us.</p>
<p class="contents">At its plenary sitting yesterday, the European Parliament commemorated the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; this Thursday we shall approve a resolution relating to it. Furthermore, this afternoon the European Parliament will mark this commemorative day by inaugurating the photographic exhibition ‘Hungary – Past and Future – 1956-2006’, to which I would like to invite all of the Members of this Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Sólyom, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Republic of Hungary</span><span class="bold">. </span> Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, Representatives of the Council and the Commission, Ladies and Gentlemen, Hungary and the world celebrate together the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and the fight for freedom. It is encouraging and elevating to feel that there is one commemorative event with which everyone can identify. There are no differences of opinion, no reservations. Everyone pays tribute to the memory of the Hungarian heroes of 1956. Now, after 50 years, with a historical perspective, and after the fall of the Soviet communist regime, we can clearly see the historic importance of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and the fight for freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is also an event when the world celebrates itself – and it has every reason to do so. We can re-experience together the former enthusiasm with which peoples took sides with the Hungarian Revolution. The world can now celebrate its generous sacrifice: Austria, which had just been liberated, opening the borders for 160 000 Hungarian refugees; the blood donations in Poland to help to rescue those wounded in the fight for freedom; the tens of thousands of Hungarian refugees who found new homes in various countries around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">But the real reason for this commemoration and joy is that Hungary today is an independent, sovereign and democratic State, with the rule of law, where the country can become a member of international organisations, such as the European Union, of its own free will.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to the credit of 1956 that the world looks upon Hungary with a positive mind. The heroic struggle of the Hungarian freedom-fighters against Soviet predominance has earned Hungary recognition and appreciation everywhere up to the present day.</p>
<p class="contents">It has become the custom, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, to present the Hungarian Revolution as a mortal blow to the Soviet world system. That is not how anyone saw it during the early years of the military compulsion and the years of terror dispensed by the Kádár system. At most, 1956 questioned the communist ideology and presented a dilemma to the left-wing, pro-Soviet section of the intelligentsia in western Europe, by making them face facts. These attitudes can still be seen as a measure of intellectual sincerity. But politically, the Soviet Union had learnt that it could assert itself in the region without hindrance or constraint: the Western powers had no direct security or economic interests there.</p>
<p class="contents">There was an ambivalence between the real political intentions and propaganda of the great Powers, and thereby an ambivalence in the expectations of the Hungarian nation. Neither the American nor the French or British Governments intended to intervene, or even query the integrity of the Soviet sphere of influence – they made this clear to the Soviet Union in October. But they left the Hungarian Government isolated and uninformed and the freedom-fighters and the population under a misapprehension, for the propaganda of the State-sponsored western radio stations urged them to trust in the arrival of liberating assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The communists could build the Berlin Wall in 1961 and use military intervention to crush the Prague Spring reform movement in 1968. What caused it to relinquish its sphere of influence in the Baltic and central and eastern Europe in 1989, and the collapse itself, was not 1956, but inherent systemic weaknesses and the Soviet Union’s inability to compete either economically or in the arms race.</p>
<p class="contents">From another point of view, however, the Hungarian Revolution and struggle for independence provided the first and weightiest evidence of the instability of the Communist regimes in the central European States, which possessed different historical, political, and cultural traditions from those of the Soviet Union. These States had traditions of democracy. National independence had become something of almost intrinsic value. The struggles in Poland and Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in Poland again, headed by the Solidarity trade union, from the 1980s onwards, were concurrently struggles for basic democratic freedoms and for limiting Soviet influence. These events and struggles led to the democratic transitions in central Europe in 1989-90.</p>
<p class="contents">A common feature of the 1956 revolution and the change of regime in 1989 is that both rejected party-state communism. Faithfulness to the revolution and the legitimacy of our claims to it depend on whether we allow the line between our free Hungary today and the Hungary we had before 1989 to blur.</p>
<p class="contents">The parallel lesson of 1956 and 1989 is that in both cases, history surpassed the aspirations that wanted more freedom within a socialist system. The greatness of Premier Imre Nagy lies in the fact that he recognised that. He stepped out of his communist past; he stepped out of the Soviet world system. He remained a left-wing politician, but he undertook an historic role, he accepted the fate that the revolutionary Hungarian nation offered to him. And he would rather die than retreat. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE)</span> On 22 October, the eve of the revolution, Heads of State, prime ministers and other distinguished guests took part in a gala event at the Budapest State Opera. Some of those invited were from the countries that, at the time, had taken in many Hungarian refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">By the end of 1956, more than 153 000 Hungarians had fled to Austria, and another 30 000 followed them later. Austria selflessly ensured that these refugees were accommodated and cared for, and organised the international aid that had become almost indispensable. This aid extended to advice, legal assistance, help in finding work and even to schooling and religious ministry. Austria also paved the way for emigration to third countries. However, a tenth of the Hungarians remained in Austria, a country to which Hungarians had always felt close.</p>
<p class="contents">Austria's aid was not, however, restricted to helping the refugees. Our neighbour did not just follow the events from close by, but had real empathy for Hungary. The occupying forces had only recently left the country; the Red Army had only recently moved out of Vienna. People in Austria knew what it meant to live in a country that was not free. They had experienced on a day-to-day basis how a lack of self-determination penetrated and damaged everything. We also shared experience of totalitarian regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also particularly grateful to the Federal Republic of Germany. The first Hungarian refugees arrived in Germany on 2 November 1956. When the government realised how many refugees there were, it decided to grant 10% of them asylum, even though they had initially, on 7 November, only wanted to accept 3 000. Although the refugees and exiles from East Germany were already putting a major strain on the German welfare system, the Hungarians were welcomed with great sympathy. The German Red Cross spent a total of DM 30 million on supporting the refugees. 20 000 Hungarian refugees made a new home for themselves in Germany. 1 200 students were integrated into German universities, and a bilingual secondary school was set up in Kastl.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Hungarian people, I would like to thank you for that. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(HU) </span>The commemoration of 1956 has to remember the liberation experienced at the time, with its sense of elemental and pure joy. This is what radiates from the faces of the demonstrators on 23 October 1956 visible on every surviving photograph and film. And this is what is mentioned by everyone who remembers.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with the words of a renowned writer. Géza Ottlik wrote: ‘If you were not there from the beginning to the end, no poetic imagination, no fervent revolutionary heart, not even the mind of a genius can grasp what it was like. I could not have imagined beforehand either the happiness of walking through the streets of Budapest, because I had not known, I simply had no idea that such happiness existed … No one values his wretched life – perhaps made too wretched – more dearly than the abstract honour of the homeland. See the faces; notice … their relieved sense of calm. For the main thing is this: not the brave resolve, not the heroic daring, but what shines in their eyes: a glad relief. They are marching, together or separately, facing tanks, cannons, and machine guns aimed at them, with a profound, happy serenity. Nothing is dearer to them than their regained human dignity.’</p>

<p class="contents">Having said that, I would also ask that we now find a process that will enable us to come to a decision. It would have been right if the first vote had been by show of hands, since that is the normal way of going about it. I then assumed you had called an immediate electronic vote on the grounds that you thought the results were so close together, but the normal way of voting would have been by show of hands. This voting process then had the regrettable result that some Members ended up voting a different way than they had intended.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the question as to whether the common text on which the groups agreed was put together properly and whether translations are available.</p>
<p class="contents">Taken together, all this adds up to a whole bundle of problems, and so I would like to appeal to your goodwill in order that we may repeat the votes before moving on to vote on the groups’ joint motion for a resolution.

In other words, whatever the President decides will be applied.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The sitting was suspended for a few moments)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, having consulted Parliament's services and having studied the aspects of our Rules of Procedure that relate to the issues that we have debated, I believe that we should proceed as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">- with regard to the Resolution presented by a series of political groups, the PSE, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups, I am told – and I have no reason to doubt it - that the text is available in all languages. I am also told that there were last-minute amendments to the text, yesterday, that the Bureau accepted them without subjecting them to any formal amendment procedure because it did not believe that to be necessary. The Resolution presented by the PSE, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups is therefore ready to be voted on in the version subject to the latest amendment for the purposes of incorporating it into the debate. We shall vote on it;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, it is very reasonable to believe that there has been some confusion and that some Members have voted the second time without being aware of precisely what was being voted on, despite the fact that I believe the Presidency had made it very clear. I believe, however, that the objections have been raised with the best of intentions and that there have certainly been errors in the interpretation of what we were voting on. Consequently, and in order to truly reflect this Parliament’s democratic will, I shall repeat the two votes.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Parliament rejected the amendment by show of hand, verified electronically)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The result of the second round is therefore the same as that of the first: the amendment has been rejected.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution by the PPE-DE and UEN Groups by roll-call vote)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The result is therefore exactly the same as the previous result, but I imagine that everybody will feel reassured and that the will of the Members will have been better reflected.</p>

The SIS II system is a central tool for law enforcement authorities and at the same time makes it possible to expand the Schengen area and abolish controls at internal borders.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time in the history of the European Union, we are creating a legislative basis for a massive information system in codecision with the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has, together with the European Parliament’s rapporteur, Mr Coelho, prepared a compromise that it is hoped will be acceptable to all parties at first reading. We thank Mr Coelho and his team for their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s position on the legislative package on SIS II was submitted to the President of Parliament in early October. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs voted on its position on 5 October. It did not approve the addition proposed by the Council concerning authorities’ access to the system. According to the Council’s position, all authorities that enter data in the SIS II system should also have access to that system. This would ensure full and indispensable cooperation between all authorities involved in the protection of the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The addition concerning access by authorities was proposed at a very late stage in the negotiations. Therefore, it is fully understandable that the Committee on Civil Liberties felt that it could not approve the addition without an opportunity to examine the issue in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency followed the plenary discussion on this issue on Monday with great interest. I hope that the European Parliament can approve the proposed text today. In the next few weeks the Council will discuss the outcome of the plenary vote by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we can reach a solution with Parliament at first reading. I want to emphasise that we are now very close to a solution for this important legislative matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title14"></a><a name="creitem14"></a>

I feel it is right that Parliament should issue its response to the Council’s statement through your rapporteur. If I may, Mr President, I should just like to make two very simple remarks. Firstly, I wish to congratulate the Presidency on its work on this matter, and, like the Presidency, I believe that Parliament can be pleased with the fact that the Act that we are about to adopt will help strengthen our external borders, and will help increase our citizens’ security.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency contributed a great deal to this process, but the Council, as such, did not. The Council did not honour its undertakings in the trialogue in May here in Strasbourg. I hope that the Council does not do to the Finnish Presidency what it did to the Austrian Presidency. Hopefully, it will honour its commitments and adopt the document in the form in which we are set to adopt it, because this is the only way in which we will have an agreement at first reading and in which the second generation Schengen Information System will enter into force without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title15"></a><a name="creitem15"></a>

<p class="contents">The ingredients of the process applied to the Basque country are as follows: firstly, the cessation of violence; secondly, the opening of a debate from which no one is debarred, given that we make peace with our enemies, not with our friends; thirdly, the proper conducting of a fair debate whose outcome is not pre-determined; and, finally, a result that, whatever form it takes, will have to be validated democratically.</p>

Many Hungarians, our compatriots, live as minorities outside the borders of Hungary. We have to affirm one thing: minority rights must be protected within the framework of the rule of law and European norms.

It is therefore unacceptable that every democratic process, which entails a change to the EU’s internal borders, based on the right to self-determination, should be condemned from the word go.

From 1830, two-thirds of today’s European states came about either by violent or by peaceful means, as a result of the democratic fight for government and education in the people’s own language. Of the remaining multilingual states, Spain and Belgium have adopted a federal form whose administration recognises the difference in language and culture. Unfortunately, within Spain, the Basque country is still split between the three major Basque provinces that form one region together, along with the region of Navarre, of which only the western half has a Basque majority.</p>
<p class="contents">The demands of the Basques are comparable to those of Catalonia, which have now largely been met. The response to their demands should not be military or judicial oppression of the kind meted out by former Spanish governments and advocated by the present Right-wing opposition. We rejoice to see that the independence movement and the Spanish state are finally seeking a peaceful solution together and that most groups in this House are backing this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I turn now to my explanation of vote. Like my colleagues in the Union for French Democracy (UDF), I voted in favour of the resolution in support of the peace initiative in the Basque country, adopted by the Spanish Parliament. Through this vote, we wanted to declare our solidarity with the democratic authorities in Spain at a time when a delicate process is being entered into to eliminate violence and re-establish civil order in the Basque country. However, we only voted in favour of this resolution because the new wording of paragraph 6 – which Mr Vidal-Quadras rightly called a substantial modification of the initial text – points out very clearly that this issue falls exclusively within the competence of Spain. It would not have been right for the European Parliament to have set itself up as a supervisory authority for the Spanish Parliament in a matter that has to do with national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the European Council are, however, playing their full role by giving the Spanish authorities the moral and political support that they are entitled to expect. In this connection, it is, to Parliament’s ear, illogical, to say the least, for Spain’s People's Party to denounce international interference in their country’s internal affairs while proposing a resolution outrightly and unequivocally condemning the vote in the Cortes. In supporting the decisions taken by Spain’s legal authorities, Parliament is certainly showing more respect for Spanish sovereignty than it would have done in condemning those decisions, as it was asked to do by the Spanish opposition. Rather than try to intimidate French MEPs in the centre of the political spectrum, as he did in this morning’s <span class="italic">Le Figaro</span>, Mr Rajoy would have done better to have questioned the coherence of his own approach and of the approach of his party in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Incidents such as the kidnapping in Southwest France by the ETA organisation are a test of the process. There may be other such incidents before the process is concluded. In these circumstances, it is a matter for the government of Spain to judge whether such incidents indicate a deliberate breach of the ETA ceasefire and to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to bear in mind the sensitivities of the victims of terror and their families during the process and in its conclusion. But the process is primarily about preventing further killing and destruction. Those victims of terror who support the current peace process are to be congratulated for their generosity and courage.

<p class="contents">First of all, it is unacceptable, in my view, that (these or any other) initiatives aimed at putting an end to ETA's terrorist activities are referred to as a ‘peace process’. The choice of words is biased and disingenuous. There is no war. Rather, what we have is, on the one hand, a free, democratic country that respects autonomies and, on the other, a people that has suffered from the indiscriminate, unjustifiable violence of a terrorist group.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I cannot vote for a resolution that fails to acknowledge clearly that it is impossible to negotiate with a terrorist group that refuses, prior to those negotiations, explicitly to renounce violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I feel that it is for Spain and the Spanish people to resolve the issue of Basque terrorism as they see fit, but I refuse to support a resolution in Parliament on this issue that makes no reference to ETA’s unjustified and indefensible motives. In addition to the methods to which they resort, namely terrorism, this organisation is worthy of our complete, unreserved condemnation. In this case, we must condemn the substance of the terrorists’ claims, and should give them no succour in terms of a democratic vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been made abundantly clear by the association that represents the overwhelming majority of the victims, which has referred to the process initiated by the Spanish Government as capitulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The very title of the resolution inaccurately suggests the existence of two legitimate sides engaged in a peace process, when what is actually at stake is talks between a government and a terrorist group responsible for murder, persecution and extortion, of which hundreds of Spanish citizens have been the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">It must not be forgotten that, following the cease-fire declared by ETA, its Members have issued threats, no weapons have been handed in and news has come to light of attempts at re-arming.</p>
<p class="contents">To open unconditional dialogue with terrorists who not only fail to condemn but actually justify the armed struggle and who show no remorse for the innocents they slaughter is tantamount to an incredible surrender on the part of the political authorities of a democratic country.

Attempts are made to bring the citizens closer to the European institutions, but these will never be successful as long as policies are being adopted which, in some areas, are diametrically opposed to what the majority of the people actually want. One example of this is enlargement policy, and, more specifically, the possible accession of Turkey. A programme such as Europe for Citizens can be credible only if the European Union does something about the democratic deficit and the lack of accountability towards the European citizens. What has now been approved by Parliament does nothing to change the essence of the problem, and is therefore yet another way of wasting money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We very much reject quite a few of the positions adopted by Parliament’s Committee on Culture and Education where this programme is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The work on this matter has primarily proceeded from an attitude of incomprehension regarding the low turnout at the 2004 elections to the European Parliament and regarding the fact that the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands. The ‘Europe for Citizens’ programme has no contribution to make to changing the political situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The work involving local amateur sport organisations within the framework of this programme is redolent of contempt for Europeans. We also note that it is important for the peoples of Europe not to neglect their memories in relation to dictatorships and tragedies in the histories of their countries. However, this should be done at national level. It is not something for Eurocrats in Brussels to get involved in.</p>

<p class="contents">What this means is that all the computers in the world could collect as much personal data as is available without altering the fact that the main source of the problems of illegal immigration, lack of security and trafficking of all kinds is the lack of effective control of the European Union’s internal and external borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One simple action which could be taken is to minimise the wait from tests to diagnosis. From talking to women with breast cancer, it is the waiting which is the most worrying. We must do all that we can to help and improve the treatment of women at that most concerning time. Member States must do more to share best practice.

<p class="contents">It may well be the case – as the critics of the punitive customs duties suggest – that we will lose for good the European shoe industry, in which, for years, fewer and fewer workers have been taken and more and more workshops have moved to countries outside the EU, but, that notwithstanding, we surely cannot look on and do nothing while a whole industrial sector heads for destruction.</p>

It is quite clear, however, that this globalisation is far from being a 'win-win' situation, and that so-called 'fortress Europe' is full of holes, but that it allows the construction of real fortresses all over the world, particularly in the most promising markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem, as Mrs Muscardini's report explains, is that the European Union's responses to the improper trade protection practices of certain third countries towards the EU, which are nothing more than disguised, unfair protectionism, are weak, inappropriate or completely lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Muscardini quite rightly emphasises the need to strengthen the EU's trade defence, but the specific solutions put forward are not up to the challenges, so unshakeably dogmatic is people’s faith in the benefits of ultraliberal globalisation and in the virtues of multilateralism. This system has now reached its limits: the WTO is no longer the solution, but the problem.</p>

Its entire ethos is one of a battle for market quotas in the name of competition, rather than one of cooperation, in which trade has a role to play in development but is not the be-all and end-all.</p>
<p class="contents">Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are tantamount to interference in the internal decisions of each country and threats that could be imposed by the WTO. The losers are the developing. and the least developed, countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also defends the WTO and the dispute settlement mechanism, and seeks to speed up all of the most offensive (anti-dumping) and defensive (safeguard) trade defence mechanisms. Speeding up the dispute mechanism and giving it more power will serve to beef up the influence of the major powers in the WTO, because they are the ones with the strength to impose rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The crux of the matter is that trade liberalisation runs counter to the idea of fair development. Each Member State should have the right to decide its economic and social development model, to industrialise and to protect its industries. This is an alienable, sovereign right, which calls into question the approach of promoting exports and free trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paula Lehtomäki, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span><span class="bold">.  </span><span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, recent developments in Moldova’s geographical and political situation have had an impact on the basic state of the Transnistrian conflict. Ukraine’s initiative to resolve the conflict in Transnistria since the Orange Revolution, the involvement of the European Union and the United States in the peace negotiations, and the activities of the EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) have strengthened Moldova’s unity. Transnistria has reacted to this by holding a referendum on 17 September. According to the Transnistrian authorities, the referendum resulted in overwhelming support by the people for independence and joining Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community, including the European Union, has not recognised this or the earlier referenda in Transnistria. This was expressed clearly in the declaration by the Presidency on behalf of the EU on 18 September, and also in the EU's positions stated at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in September and within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in July. In its declaration, the EU condemned the referendum, regarding it as contrary to Moldova's regional integration and its internationally recognised sovereignty. Moreover, the EU openly cast doubt on the idea that the outcome of the Transnistrian referendum actually reflected the will of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has also discussed the referendum with Russia on several occasions. Although the public statements made by Russia have given rise to other interpretations, Russia has assured the Union that it respects Moldova's territorial integrity and has denied supporting the referendum.</p>
<p class="contents">The activities of the EUBAM are an example of how the Union can best lend real support to the conflict resolution process in Transnistria and bringing the control of the Moldovan-Ukrainian border closer to European standards in general. Both Moldova and Ukraine have shown gratitude for the transfer of know-how to their border authorities. It is essential for efforts to resolve the conflict that the EUBAM should have helped to steer the supervision of Transnistrian foreign trade in the direction of the Moldovan authorities. This, too, contributes to Moldova’s national unity. The decision by Ukraine to start implementing the Ukrainian-Moldovan customs cooperation protocol in March has done much to improve the EUBAM's prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the parties themselves which have the key roles in the Transnistrian peace process. The European Union hopes that the parties to the peace process will return to the negotiating table. The EU's chances of making an effective contribution to the process are bolstered by the Union's Special Representative, who participates in resolving the Transnistrian conflict in accordance with agreed EU policy objectives and in close coordination with the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan between the EU and Moldova is the instrument that will enable the Union to lend purposeful, long-term support to Moldova. Ultimately, Moldova's development towards a politically and economically stable state may be the key to resolving the Transnistrian conflict. To achieve this, Moldova must, for example, improve its capacity for administration, extirpate corruption and foster a climate for investment. Moldova must make itself attractive to both foreign investors and Transnistrian businesses. The EU is committed to supporting Moldova in these efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I will move on to the other topic of our debate. It has to be said that the European Union is extremely concerned about the tense relations between Russia and Georgia. This crisis is also affecting the situation in the separatist conflict zones in Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. At the informal summit in Lahti last Friday, President Putin even warned that the situation might escalate into bloodshed. He blamed Georgia for preparing for war. In its conclusions of 17 October, the EU appealed to both Russia and Georgia to do their utmost not only to improve their bilateral relations but also to concentrate their efforts on finding a peaceful settlement to the conflicts. The Union also urged the parties to comply fully with earlier agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation in South Ossetia is tense. On 12 November a referendum will be held in the region for the purpose of consolidating the region’s independence. As with the referendum on independence in Transnistria, the European Union does not recognise this referendum. It may increase tension in the region further.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the international community are aiding the resolution of the conflicts in Georgia in many ways. Through its observer status, the European Commission has an important role to play in the Joint Control Commission, the conflict resolution mechanism for South Ossetia. On many occasions Georgia has expressed the wish that the EU's role should be further strengthened. It also wants the JCC format to be changed by involving the EU and the United States of America, following the Transnistrian peace process 5+2 model. More recently, Georgia has called for the peace negotiations to be continued bilaterally between Georgia and South Ossetia.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, Georgia is demanding that the Commonwealth of Independent States peacekeepers, who in practice are all Russians, be replaced with an international operation both in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, with special emphasis on police activity. The view of the Georgian Parliament and Government is that these troops are not fulfilling their mandate and that their continued presence is questionable.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is at present discussing internally the question of strengthening its role, but Georgia may have unrealistic expectations of the Union. The EU is encouraging the Georgian leaders to show restraint. Hasty decisions on the peace processes in South Ossetia and Abkhazia are best avoided, for they might be a risk to the presence of the United Nations and the OSCE in the region. This, in turn, would create a vacuum in the regions. Georgia should undertake not to resort to force.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Member States and the Commission made a significant contribution to the Donor Conference on Economic Rehabilitation for South Ossetia, which was held in Brussels in June. The conference was held on the basis of a needs assessment conducted by the OSCE. A significant international programme on economic rehabilitation will be started in South Ossetia this autumn, using funds collected at the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia has an important part to play in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Support from Russia is needed in order to achieve results in the peace processes. The latest espionage scandal, however, has acutely exacerbated the already strained relations between Georgia and Russia. The EU has on many occasions sent strong messages to the leaders of the two countries, most recently to President Putin at Lahti, on the importance of normalising relations, and it has also offered its services to help reopen their dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of October, the EU will discuss internally the progress of its role in the resolution of the conflicts in Georgia. Special Representative Semneby will have an important part to play in maintaining political dialogue between the EU and Georgia. He may also be able to promote the re-establishment of contact between Georgia and Russia. During its visit to Tbilisi on 2 October the EU Troika also stated that the EU is prepared to help Georgia resolve its conflicts by means of the European Neighbourhood Policy. A joint ENP Action Plan between the EU and Georgia has just been drawn up, which the EU-Georgia Cooperation Council will adopt formally at its meeting in Brussels on 14 November. The ENP Action Plan also contains a separate section on the resolution of the conflicts in Georgia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I visited South Caucasus in early October as a member of the Troika, when the ENP Action Plans with all three countries were finalised. They will now be officially signed and adopted in November. I think that this is a basis for strong operational cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I talk about EU support, I think it is important that we also recall the impact of our relations with Russia. During recent months, we have seen gas price increases for Moldova, import bans on Moldovan and Georgian wines and water, the de facto support given to Transnistria in the referendum, and the strong reaction to Georgia’s expulsion of Russian military officers.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues were addressed with President Putin in Lahti and I personally raised some of these issues with Foreign Minister Lavrov only a few days ago in Moscow. The forthcoming Foreign Ministers’ Permanent Partnership Council on 3 November and the EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki on 24 November will enable further discussions to be held on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also mention that the OSCE played a very helpful role in refusing to observe and recognise the referendum in Transnistria and also in returning the Russian officers from Georgia to Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now say a few words specifically about Moldova and Transnistria, and then on Georgia. I would also like to highlight the very successful EU Border Assistance Mission, EUBAM, which has played a very important role in introducing a new customs regime between Moldova and Ukraine. This programme was allocated EUR 20 million for two years and over 70 customs officials and border guards were seconded from our Member States. All major Transnistrian companies have now registered in Chisinau and are working under this new regime. Combating customs fraud will thus crucially cut the illicit revenue currently enjoyed by the Transnistrian leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are happy that high-level talks between Russia and Moldova have recently resumed, we have been concerned about Russia’s support for the Transnistrian leadership. In a recent statement, Minister Lavrov called for ‘political recognition of the results’ of the referendum in Transnistria, which neither the European Union nor the OSCE recognised. I think this could complicate the task of finding a solution to this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also worried about the insistence by Transnistria and Russia on the need for a so-called transit protocol between Moldova and Transnistria that would recognise the latter as an independent international economic actor. This issue is the stumbling block in the settlement talks which resumed after a silence of more than six months, albeit not in the full 5+2 format, but with only mediators, with each of the two sides separately, in other words 5+1.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach is unacceptable, as we have made clear to Russia on several occasions. More than that, developments on the ground, with all major Transnistrian companies now working legally with Chisinau, show that such an approach is increasingly out of touch with reality. We were also worried that the new Ukrainian Government would change track on this issue. I was very pleased when Prime Minister Yanukovich assured me of the ongoing support of the Ukrainian Government. We will continue to stress the importance of Ukrainian cooperation at the forthcoming summit in Helsinki in a few days’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">Some have pointed to the ongoing discussion on railway issues between Moldova and Ukraine as further proof that Ukraine might abandon its earlier position. The facts, however, do not bear this out. We therefore strongly encourage both sides to find a mutually advantageous solution to this situation as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Our presence on the ground through the EU Border Assistance Mission provides us with an excellent instrument for following the situation and giving advice and assistance to both sides. Let me add that under the new ENP instrument, Moldova will see a substantial increase in our funding. It will also receive a grant under the macro-financial assistance programme to help it address the shocks caused by increased energy prices and the Russian ban on Moldovan wines.</p>
<p class="contents">We are highly concerned about the crisis in relations between Georgia and Russia, especially the continuing tensions between the two countries. We are particularly worried by the expulsion of large numbers of Georgians from Russian territory, which appears in direct contradiction to Russia’s commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights and to the 1975 Helsinki Final Act. I also raised this issue recently with Mr Lavrov.</p>
<p class="contents">Georgia also bears its share of responsibility. During our recent visit to Georgia in the Troika mission, I urged President Saakashvili to display moderation and encouraged him to rebuild trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a final word on South Ossetia. I think it is disappointing that the recent meeting of the Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia was inconclusive. We understand Georgia’s wish to renew and review the Joint Control Commission’s composition, but existing peace mechanisms should be fully utilised until new ones are in place and the recent Needs Assessment Study and the June 2006 international donors’ conference show that there is scope for a constructive dialogue. We are pleased that this rehabilitation programme is continuing despite the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made a significant financial contribution to assist a peaceful settlement, including a EUR 9.5 million economic rehabilitation programme in South Ossetia. Funds for rehabilitation have also been earmarked under the new EC financial assistance programme for the period from 2007 to 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the European Union as a whole has a very important role in supporting any peace settlement. But the most immediate need is to get relations between Russia and Georgia back on a normal track, on a diplomatic track. We will certainly continue our efforts to achieve that objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know that Moldova is the poorest country in Europe. In September a so-called ‘referendum’ took place in the Moldovan region of Transnistria, aiming at the region’s possible unification with the Russian Federation. This referendum and its outcome were not accepted by the international community and the conflict between the separatist authority of Transnistria and the central government of Moldova has largely contributed to the instability of the whole country and its economic and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year we also witnessed the failure of negotiations concerning the status of Transnistria in the 5+2 format as the Transnistrian authorities withdrew from these negotiations. We are also aware of the fact that the so-called Russian peacekeepers are still in Transnistria.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we, the European Parliament, should denounce the so-called referendum in the Transnistrian region, which contradicts the internationally recognised sovereignty and territorial integrity of Moldova and can be seen as provocation, which increases the existing tensions and jeopardises the chances for a peaceful settlement of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also call on Russia to discontinue its support for the Transnistrian regime, which threatens Moldova’s territorial integrity, and to fulfil the OSCE Summit decision of 1999 to withdraw its troops and arms from the territory of Moldova.</p>
<p class="contents">We especially regret the lack of significant progress in the EU talks on visa facilitation and the readmission agreement with Moldova. The Council and the Commission should speed up the procedure, leading to the conclusion of a visa facilitation agreement with Moldova and ensure its implementation, as the current situation is unfair and discriminatory when Transnistrian citizens holding Russian passports are benefiting from the possibility to travel to the EU more easily than Moldovans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it is apparent to us that, years on, we are nowhere nearer resolving them, despite the EU’s commitment to a negotiated political solution in a multilateral framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We view recent developments in that region with great concern, since a possible escalation cannot be ruled out. On 17 September, there was a referendum in Transnistria on separation from Moldova, while, last week, the tension between Georgia and Russia surrounding the status of South-Ossetia escalated into a diplomatic crisis of the first order. Both events are incompatible with the commitment to finding a political solution to these conflicts within the framework of the OSCE. I think that the EU should hold firm to a plan of negotiations in a multilateral framework whereby the territorial integrity of Moldova and Georgia should be taken as read.</p>
<p class="contents">We emphatically condemn unilateral steps, such as organising a referendum or so-called referendum, because we have not seen any evidence of a democratic plebiscite in a free and open environment. The use of threatening political rhetoric back and forth, or the unilateral announcement of sanctions are just as counterproductive. They do not bring us any closer to a solution and counteract the effort which the international community is making to encourage the parties to sing from the same hymn sheet. It has to be clear to all players that a sustainable solution can only be based on a political dialogue, with respect for democracy in the countries and regions involved.</p>
<p class="contents">For the European Union, it is a necessary investment to give this process a shot in the arm. The European Union cannot solve these conflicts on its own. As long as we decide in favour of multilateral strategy, we can reasonably expect the other parties involved to move within these boundaries and to adhere to previous agreements, such as in Istanbul in 1999. Moreover, we can expect Russia to exercise a certain degree of caution, since it plays a crucial role in each of these conflicts. The active support Russia is giving the regime in Transnistria and the referenda, as well as the support to the separatist movement in South-Ossetia and Abkhazia do not, unfortunately, fall within this category. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The unconstitutional and internationally unrecognised referendum on Transnistrian independence which was recently held in that province was a serious step backwards for all parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">On 10 October, Transnistria rejected a compromise plan put forward by the OSCE, under the leadership of the Belgian Foreign Minister, Karel de Gucht. The proposed plan envisaged granting the whole of Transnistria a relatively independent or semi-autonomous status within a Moldovan Federation. I personally regret the rejection of this compromise because an opportunity to create peace and stability throughout the whole of this unstable region has been lost. Instead, the deadlock between Transnistria and Moldova will continue to threaten both political and economic stability in this part of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With the accession of Romania to the European Union in 2007, the borders of the European Union will extend as far as Moldova, so it is in our vital interests to invest the necessary time, energy and commitment in future negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to call on the Council and the Commission to bring their political clout to bear on fresh negotiations. Likewise, I call on Tiraspol to sit back down at the negotiating table and put an end to its delaying tactics. At the same time, I also call on Moscow to espouse more progressive policies in settling this dispute, because a more constructive approach on its part would demonstrate that Russia is serious about establishing a responsible and reliable partnership with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, as we know, Georgia is experiencing difficulties in resolving conflicts with its separatist regions, and the escalating provocations from both sides are certainly not helping to resolve those conflicts peacefully. What is worse, armed intervention could embroil the entire Caucasus, which is something of which we are all conscious. That is why we must strongly urge the Georgian authorities to take a conciliatory approach and to constructively relaunch the peace process in South Ossetia.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are extenuating circumstances in Georgia: its neighbour, Russia, is not playing the conciliation game. For example, when, in Lahti last week, he compared South Ossetia to Kosovo, Mr Putin was adding fuel to the flames in the Caucasus, at the very time when he was expected to re-establish trust by normalising relations with his neighbours in Georgia. Whatever Russia may say, it certainly is involved in this conflict. Did it not issue Russian passports to the Georgian population of South Ossetia? How valid can a referendum be if 80% of the participants were Russian citizens? How neutral can we expect the peace-keeping forces in South Ossetia to be when they are predominantly Russian? I will not even mention the unilateral Russian embargo or the ongoing deportations of Georgians in Russia, which are evidence of a desire to destabilise Georgia.</p>
<p class="contents">So, then, the neighbourhood policy and greater cooperation with Russia are, of course, tools for us, but you will forgive me if I cannot share the Council's position on the replacement of the peace-keeping forces. I think, ladies and gentlemen, that we really do need to ask ourselves how the neutrality and impartiality of these forces can be guaranteed. We should perhaps – or should I say, definitely – be prepared to make a contribution, should it prove necessary, to the replacement of the peace-keeping forces.</p>

That much is abundantly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Transnistria has always been a part of the Republic of Moldova, it follows that it is absolutely justified to demand of our Russian partners – with whom relations are far from poor – that their troops should be withdrawn from the region.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not want matters to get worse, it naturally follows that we must promote trade – and with trade, change – rather than imposing bans on exports or imports. The Commission and the European Union have taken the line that we insist on the 5+2 negotiations being continued in full, or, indeed, on their resumption, and from this line we must not deviate.</p>
<p class="contents">Fair partnership – and I am talking here about ours with Russia – also involves being able to tell one’s partner, to their face, with what one is happy and with what one is not. It may well be that, in the past, thinking of certain of the European Union’s own interests, we did not always do that with the necessary firmness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The hysterical tirades directed by the Moscow media against Georgians living in Russia mean that they do not feel safe on the territory of the Russian Federation.

Therefore, 2007 offers us an opportunity to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of that unfulfilled European commitment by Russia – one of many, of course. That could be a good time to write and publish a big book of Russia’s unfulfilled international commitments. That is my first proposal to this House as it strives to obtain new commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia’s policies in partitioning its smaller neighbours have caused loss and suffering to the people and several nations are still asking us to help. Can we continue to utter empty mantras in the style of the United Nations, while washing our hands of the hordes of refugees expelled from Abkhazia by invading Russians?</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting here the small note in Security Council Resolution No 1666 of 31 March 2006, on the eventual changes in the mandate of the CIS peacekeeping force in Georgia. In reality, the force is Russian and has little to do with peacekeeping, but is helping in the annexation of a population given en masse the passports of one foreign country before the land is subsequently annexed. If you really want peace in that part of Europe, we need real, possibly European, peacekeepers in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The alternative should be to rename these current peacekeepers ‘criminality keepers’. That is my second proposal to Parliament: to make a choice between real peacekeepers and official ‘criminality keepers’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is not what we want to do, but we do want to make it quite clear to Russia that we should try to resolve the problems that present themselves to us, ranging from energy to the neighbourhood we share, that we should do this together, and that Russia should confirm its commitment to multilateralism.</p>
<p class="contents">When criticising America, we are often united when it comes to the unilateralism of that country's actions, but, when a country takes action in its own backyard, it needs to do so multilaterally, and Russia has recently opted for a different approach, and that is absolutely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we do, of course, need help from the countries involved. As we said the last time we visited it, we would like to see Georgia sign the commitment to non-violence. It is surely not enough to say ‘we want to be able to defend ourselves’, for that, of course, is something everyone is entitled to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we would like to see a definite offer made as regards the reintegration into Georgian society of the people of South Ossetia, and of Abkhazia too, for, while we are committed to the concept of a single, undivided Georgia, we do believe that that has to involve specific things being offered to these sections of its population.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, the main responsibility lies, just as it did before, with Russia. I find it incomprehensible how Russia has still not yet grasped that you do not make friends by supporting small separatist movements, some of which have been infiltrated by criminals, but rather by helping your neighbours to maintain their stability, and that is something that Georgia would surely be equally willing to do.</p>
<p class="contents">What we absolutely must reject, though, is the expulsion of Georgians from Russia; Arguing along the lines of 'yes, but they're illegals' has a cynical ring to it. Expelling the Georgians – especially at a time like this, considering the things that have happened – is every bit as inopportune in terms of timing as the energy price rises in Ukraine before the elections and in Belarus after them. It is absolutely indefensible and unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is an urgent need to calm things down, and my group backs the appeal to both Russia and Georgia to soften their language and their actions.

That Georgia has threatened to resort to violence is also unacceptable.</p>

Contrary to our expectations, Russia is not playing a stabilising role in the region. The opposite is actually the case. The more political power Russia wields, the more conflicts, tension and even wars there are. Does all this amount to a policy that is acceptable to the European Union? Is it possible to develop an unconditional strategic partnership with a country that stoops to these methods?

Georgia – which is a member of the Council of Europe – fell victim to Russian or Soviet colonialism on two occasions, the first time under the Tsars, and the second in the 1920s, when Soviet troops smothered the nations of the Caucasus at birth.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have today is a post-colonial situation in which Russia is unwilling to make restitution for what it did to the region in the days when it was a colonial power or when it was the totalitarian Soviet Union, and is instead engaged in a post-colonial policy of dominating nations and extorting their raw materials from them, which involves it in either exploiting conflicts between nationalities or, to some extent, artificially creating them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that there is only one response; as Mr Landsbergis said, we have to be prepared to have a structured, peace-keeping presence – be it international or European – wherever in the world conflict arises, whether in Transnistria or Abkhazia, South Ossetia or Chechnya, so that the situation can be brought under international control once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">If Russia has an interest in allowing transparency to prevail, then that is the right solution, but that is not what Russia wants. What Russia wants, now as in the past, is for its policy of dominance to be carried on in the shadows, and that is why I, too, find it regrettable that this report is being held after the summit rather than having been held before it, as we had wanted. What Mr Putin wanted was for the spotlight to be upon him as he nurtured illusions, and, now, in the shadow of the summit, we are sweeping up the pieces.</p>
<p class="contents">All I can do is to appeal to the Council and the Commission to at length get round to talking about Russian policy in an unambiguous, frank, and rational way with explicit reference to human rights. Let no bones be made about the fact that that sort of forthright talk is the only language Russia understands.

The problem is in stalemate, but it is in Russia’s power to solve it, but if it is to do so, it must implement the promise it made at the OSCE Istanbul summit in 1999; that is, to withdraw its troops from Moldovan territory. This is something it should have done as long ago as 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Good friends must be bold and forthright. In Russia such friends are valued. We here have been fearful and have beaten around the bush. Thus, as of 1 January we will acquire a serious source of instability right beside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate three facts about Transnistria. First of all, the Transnistrian regime does not seek independence, but rather union with Russia, which lies 800 km away. The region has belonged to Moldova and Ukraine, but never to Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the inhabitants of Transnistria are not a uniform ethnic group. Most of them are Moldovans, making up 40 percent of the population, with Ukrainians at nearly 28 percent, and the Russian ethnic group occupying third place.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the inhabitants of Transnistria would certainly enjoy more democracy and freedom under the government in Chisinau than they do at present. Chisinau has never persecuted the non-Moldovan population of Transnistria.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia will take no action without pressure from us. We should not be afraid of exerting pressure.

The European Union has an interest in finding a peaceful solution to the conflict between Russia and Georgia. To that end, firstly, since CIS peace-keeping forces in South Ossetia are not able to carry out their task, they should be replaced by international peace-keepers. Secondly, Russia ought to refrain from military exercises in the close vicinity of Georgia’s territory. Thirdly, there must be an immediate end to violations of the rights of Georgia’s citizens, which are beginning to verge on ethnic cleansing, and also the blockade on Georgian goods. Fourthly, respecting the integrity of Georgia’s territory, the lawfulness of the issue of Russian passports in Abkhazia and South Ossetia should be reviewed, in order to prevent a repetition of the Transnistria scenario. Finally, both states should refrain from activities and statements which might foster any worsening of relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us be clear: these quasi-breakaway regions, or frozen conflicts, are being systematically used as leverage by the Russian Government to retain its influence over the post-Soviet neighbourhood. Without the continued presence of Russian troops – as has been stated by my colleague, Mrs Mikko – the conflicts we now have to deal with would probably have disappeared. Part of the problem seems to be fear of the possible spreading of ‘Rose revolutions’ and fear of genuine democratic change in Russia itself, which is long overdue. We therefore need to react to acts by the Russian Government which defy all norms of international behaviour, such as cutting off communications, economic blockades and launching waves of xenophobia in Russia itself. The EU of 25 should declare such acts absolutely unacceptable, especially by the country currently holding the Presidency of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament’s resolution we call on Russia finally to accept the new realities that have emerged after the end of the Cold War and to stop thinking and operating in terms of exclusive zones of influence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moldova is a country whose problems are due to historical factors, its geopolitical position and its current situation, which has arisen as a result of the balance of power within the country as well as external influences. It should be clearly understood that the problems relating to Moldova’s security in its broadest sense, and also to its development, cannot be resolved by Moldova’s efforts alone. A joint effort is needed, involving not only Moldova’s neighbours, such as Ukraine and Romania, but also vital aid from the European Union and the United States. Of course, Russian goodwill is essential, too. Clearly, the imposition of an embargo on the import of agricultural produce and the problems concerning the energy supply are clearly related to Moldova’s positive stance with respect to integration with the European Union. Therefore, we cannot abandon Moldova. Morally, it is entitled to our aid and we can certainly afford to provide it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to express my admiration for the Georgian nation, which desires to independently decide the direction of its own foreign policy. In this matter, it should and must rely on the solidarity of the Member States of the European Union. The Georgian authorities are rightly demanding that the rights of their small nation be respected by the large Russian nation. However, it would be good, and here I differ somewhat from the previous speakers, if these authorities also turned their attention to upholding the rights of minorities within their own country. I have in mind religious minorities, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to refer to the recent attacks on Catholics in Tiblisi. There is no other way to describe the assault by 60 individuals on a brand new church built to serve the Assyrian, that is to say, the Chaldean Catholic community. This assault was the work of members of the Orthodox Church, who mostly identify with Russian culture. In another area of Tiblisi, members of the Orthodox Church are putting pressure on the authorities to prevent the opening of a Catholic church.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, there have been many instances of religious intolerance in Georgia in recent years. The victims have included not only Catholics but also Baptists, Pentecostalists, and Jehovah’s Witnesses. I trust the Georgian authorities will take strong action against these acts of violence that are damaging Georgia’s reputation on the international scene. I am sure that most political groups in this House will be of a similar opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been talking in this Chamber today since the morning on relations between the European Union and Russia. The sheer scope of these relations is reflected in the fact that now even at this point in the proceedings it is EU-Russia relations that have figured prominently in Members’ speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between the European Union and Russia have a valuable feature: these days we are able to discuss everything round the table, including the difficult areas and the commitments made by Russia. The next excellent opportunity for such discussions is in November, when the Permanent Partnership Council meeting of EU and Russian Foreign Ministers is held, and after that at the end of November at the EU-Russia Summit. The summit held between the EU and Ukraine the day after tomorrow in Helsinki will undoubtedly feature talks on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in my opening speech, Union action on Moldova and Transnistria is specifically intended to aid and firm up Moldovan unity. In this the European Neighbourhood Policy is a crucial instrument. As part of this cooperation we in the Council are expecting a Commission proposal to begin talks on visa flexibility before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between Georgia and Russia were last discussed yesterday on the COPS Committee with reference to the proposals by the Special Representative to find new means of supporting a peaceful solution to this difficult situation in the best possible way. Fortunately, there are encouraging signs that dialogue between Georgia and Russia is to get under way, as the countries’ Foreign Ministers intend to meet in Moscow at the beginning of November. That is a very positive start to what will hopefully be the resumption of talks.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic principle that the European Union will endeavour to promote a peaceful solution to the crisis between Georgia and Russia and can do so in many ways applies to this crisis in just the same way as it does to many other crises around the world. Unless the parties themselves actually commit to a peaceful solution, however, they cannot be forced to do so from the outside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thank Members for their comments, which we shall, of course, take into account as much as we can.</p>
<p class="contents">I think Parliament could enhance its efforts and thus complete and complement what we are doing concerning Moldova, with its counterparts in the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee. We need to continue to encourage Moldova to press on with key reforms on democracy, the rule of law and human rights and to improve the business climate. We must help Moldova to become more attractive for the population, even in Transnistria.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the question of macro-financial assistance, we have just prepared a package of EUR 45 million that will be allocated to Moldova, because it is highly important that we give them special assistance. Let me say that since 1991 the whole assistance programme has amounted to some EUR 230 million. Our annual assistance budget has increased over the last few years and will increase further under the ENPI.</p>
<p class="contents">On visa facilitation for Moldova, we are just working towards the proposals for negotiating directives and also for the readmission agreements. We have encouraged the Member States to set up a joint visa application centre in Chisinau. Once established, this should be an effective facilitation mechanism for Moldovan citizens, who would then no longer need to travel to neighbouring countries to apply for visas.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that if there is a possibility of coming up with a mandate at the end of this year, then the visa fee would stay at EUR 35 and not go up to EUR 60, which would be very important for the very poor people of Moldova.</p>
<p class="contents">On Georgia, we had a lengthy discussion with Foreign Minister Lavrov. The most important thing is that both sides tone down their public rhetoric as a first step and then both sides try to come up with diplomatic dialogues –again, back to normal. The Georgian leadership must avoid any actions that could heighten tension. That is what we told Mr Saakashvili. With the help of our special representatives and, of course, all of us, we hope that the situation will return to normal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the country to hold the Presidency of the Council, Finland believes that it is very important that this regrettable event be looked into thoroughly. Once again the world is made aware of the serious threats posed by moving waste to the developing countries. This is a problem that has to be addressed through decisive action. The European Union has stated that it is prepared, in collaboration with the United Nations, to help protect human health and the environment wherever the effects of the incident are particularly serious.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events in West Africa have also been a reminder to us of how important it is to implement agreements on transboundary movements of waste and the supervision of waste management effectively. These are essentially the Basel Convention and the amendment to it tabled in 1995, the Marpol Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, and local maritime conservation agreements. The amendment to the Basel Convention banned the export of hazardous wastes from EU and OECD countries, as well as Liechtenstein, to other countries. It is obviously just as important to monitor compliance with these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement and Management of Hazardous Wastes is to be held at the end of November in Nairobi. The European Union’s position at this conference is at present being drafted by the Council in respect of all the issues on the agenda. These include illegal movements of waste, the unloading of ships, funding the agreement, synergies between the waste and chemicals clusters and monitoring the strategic plan to implement the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of this preparation work took the form of a wide-ranging debate by the Environment Council on 23 October, that is to say the day before last, at the end of which the Chairman gave his conclusions on the EU’s preparations for the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention. These take the view that it is important to intervene decisively and effectively in illegal transboundary movements of hazardous wastes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that, in addition to the countries that have now ratified the amendment regarding the export ban on hazardous waste, as many other countries as possible do likewise, so that it might enter into force worldwide as soon as possible. As you know, the ban is already in force in all the EU Member States, because it was implemented in its entirety with the Regulation on movement of waste. Almost all the EU countries have also ratified the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The reformed EU Regulation on the movement of waste, which comes into force next July, also contains provisions which may help improve cooperation on the implementation of the Regulation at both Member State and EU level. A directive has also been issued on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues, compliance with which may also be relevant to the <span class="italic">Probo Koala</span> case.</p>
<p class="contents">In a debate the day before last, Ministers of the Environment also highlighted the fact that effective implementation of existing legislation is a primary aim of the EU. Crucial to the prevention of illegal movements of waste is increased harmonisation of laws on the environment and navigation, especially at international level, and enhanced cooperation between authorities. What is most important is that all types of waste are treated in a way that is environmentally acceptable, regardless of where this takes place. This must be the priority goal too when vessels are scrapped.</p>
<p class="contents">The Chairman’s conclusions also stressed that developing countries need external help in their endeavours to implement the Basel Convention and manage waste in a way that is environmentally acceptable. Developing countries also need to make waste management part of their strategies for reducing poverty and for sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Environment Council meeting the Presidency also met a delegation from the Ivory Coast, which gave an update on the situation. The magnitude of the catastrophe is staggering: in addition to the loss of many human lives, there is a huge number of urgent health problems. The disaster also has major implications for the ecology, livelihoods, human habitation and community action. At present, the key areas of importance are the cleaning up of polluted areas and sewage networks and attending to the damage caused to people and businesses. In the Ivory Coast an international and national report are being compiled on what took place, including a criminal investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in certain countries, such as the Netherlands and Estonia, a criminal investigation has been started with a view to taking a thorough look at the circumstances connected with the <span class="italic">Probo Koala</span> case.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now move on to deal with the oral question put by Karl-Heinz Florenz, Chairman of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States of the European Union think it important that laws and cooperation should be developed within the EU framework to prevent and investigate environmental crimes and enforce penal responsibility. Environmental crimes are by nature international, because the effects of illegal emissions extend a long way across national frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">As the honourable Member says in his question, the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 13 September 2005, however, overturned the Council Framework Decision of 27 January 2003 on the protection of the environment through criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">On 25 November 2005 the Commission submitted a communication to the European Parliament and to the Council on the consequences of the judgment passed by the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court’s judgment and the Commission’s communication were discussed at the informal meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs held in Vienna in January 2006 and they were examined by the Council in Brussels on 21 February this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In these discussions the Commission said it wanted to think more about how to proceed with regard to the framework decisions taken earlier by the Council, decisions that might need re-examining in the light of the decision by the Court of Justice. This line of reasoning would also apply to the Framework Decision that was overturned by the Court already referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, the Council is awaiting a reaction from the Commission. It may deliver an amended version of the proposal it put forward in 2001 and of the proposal for a directive it amended in 2002 or it may put forward an entirely new proposal</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, the United Nations and the authorities in Côte d’Ivoire, is seeking in various ways for the damage caused to be restored and for suitable action to be taken to combat the illegal activities which may have taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">When the incident occurred, representatives of the Commission – and special teams from the Member States – visited the scene in order to assist the victims and help to protect the natural environment. The Commission is closely monitoring developments in Côte d’Ivoire and is in constant contact with the country's authorities. On Monday I and the Presidency met the delegation from Côte d’Ivoire, which included three ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutions and the Member States of the European Union need to examine every possible means of supporting the victims in Côte d’Ivoire and of doing the best they can to eliminate the pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Criminal investigations are being carried out at the moment in various Member States, with which we are in contact. I personally, following the return of the Probo Koala to the European Union, went to the port of Paldiski in Estonia on 28 September in order to support these investigations and obtain the latest information.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look beyond the incident in Côte d’Ivoire, we shall see that there is a serious vacuum in compliance by the Member States with the European Union regulation on movements of waste. This regulation contains clear rules banning exports of dangerous waste to developing countries. These rules are to become even stricter and, as of July next year, the Member States will be obliged to conduct on-site controls and inspections and to cooperate in the event of illegal movements of waste. However, the mere fact that rules exist does not mean a thing if they are not also correctly applied in practice. The legal loopholes must be plugged with strict complementary measures pertaining to its proper application. Environmental crime is one of the most serious problems which the Community is called upon to combat. The environmental damage which may be caused is huge. It is often part of international organised crime, which makes it difficult but imperative to stamp out. Provision for effective sanctions, including criminal sanctions, is necessary for the proper application of Community environmental legislation. That is precisely why urgent action is needed at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001, the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive on environmental protection through penal law. The objective of this proposal was, on the one hand, the introduction throughout the Community of a minimum number of criminal environmental offences and, on the other hand, the punishment of such infringements with effective criminal sanctions in all the Member States. It is a sad fact that the Council did not adopt the Commission proposal. The proposal was based on Article 175 of the Treaty and was to have been approved under the codecision procedure. The Council did not agree with the legal basis and decided to issue a framework decision on the basis of the third pillar, rather than the directive we had proposed. In the opinion of the European Commission, this choice of means was not legally correct and would have made it impossible to control the transposition into national law of the framework decision and the application of it by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In clear opposition to the Council, the European Parliament fully supported the Commission proposal and also supported the Commission in the matter when it was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Communities. I wish to highlight the particular importance of this good cooperation between our institutions and I trust that we shall continue in this way as the matter develops. With the ruling by the Court of Justice, it has now been clarified that measures of a penal nature needed in order to safeguard the effective application of environmental policy may be adopted within the framework of the first pillar. The Council's framework decision infringed the Community's powers on the basis of the Treaty and had to be reversed. The European Commission is particularly satisfied with this ruling by the Court. This is not a ruling regulating a simple technical point; it is of decisive importance in clarifying the rules of the Treaty as far as the dividing line between the first and third pillars is concerned. It has major institutional repercussions, because it clarifies that the measures at issue must be taken under the codecision procedure, which means the full participation of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, within the framework of the first pillar, national application measures come under the control of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which does not apply to third pillar measures. A directive on environmental protection through penal law – within the framework of the first pillar – will provide better environmental protection and, at the same time, is a more democratic method in the legislative procedure. Unfortunately, in the meantime, valuable time has been lost. Environmental crimes are still being committed and we must adopt the necessary legal measures to combat them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have analysed and discussed in the Commission the various options for following up the Court ruling. We examined two options in particular: for the Commission 2001 proposal to stay as it is and for us to call on the other institutions to continue the codecision procedure or for a new Commission proposal to be submitted. We preferred the second option, in order to take account of the Court ruling. The initial proposal dates from 2001, since when numerous changes have been made to environmental legislation; consequently, the proposal needs to be adapted accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there have been new developments in the field of European cooperation on penal law matters, which also need to be taken into account in the proposal. We must ensure that the proposal is in keeping with other penal acts adopted at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are at the state of preparing the new proposal for a directive on environmental protection through penal law. The first step was, as I said, to examine in detail the Court ruling and its repercussions and for a detailed comparison to be made of the various acts which already apply. We then prepared an impact study comparing the pros and cons of the various options. Following that, the proposal will be finalised and I hope that it will be approved before the end of 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karl-Heinz Florenz (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the dumping of toxic waste on Côte d’Ivoire is not only scandalous, but also a truly revolting act, and we are, of course, at liberty to do no more than commiserate with the victims and lament the serious injuries caused to people, but if we do not, in the same breath, ask questions as to what lies behind this, that is no more than hypocritical, and you can count me out. That is why I want there to be no doubt about the fact that this is a humanitarian and environmental disaster and scandal. I never cease to be astonished that, while we in this House have introduced the ‘name and shame' principle to apply to others, for example to those engaged in the production of meat, so that, if someone misbehaves, his name is made known and appears in the newspapers, the same does not happen with the Member States of the EU, and that is most remarkable.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council did, of course, put these things in their proper chronological order, while it was Commissioner Dimas who explained why Europe’s legislation does not work, the actual reason being that the Council is too timid, and when I say that I certainly do not mean the President-in-Office or her country, but I do mean to say that, in matters affecting more than one country, one must – as she has rightly recognised – summon up the nerve to take cross-border action with the aim of prosecuting and punishing offences. If, then, the Commission makes a proposal to that effect, whilst the Council is graciously pleased to cast doubt on the legal basis for it, and both the Commission and this House are subject to it, since the Council, with its blocking minority, does not allow the law to come into effect, that is something that a representative of the people, that is to say one of those who are meant to keep an eye on what governments are doing, cannot but find extremely vexatious. That must not be allowed to happen, and there must be no more timidity from the Council in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I really do implore you to tell your colleagues that the chairman of the committee is very angry, for complaints after the event are of no avail if we have not done our homework beforehand – which we have, yet you have, so to speak, drawn a line right through it. That is not acceptable. I think the Council would do better in future to concern itself once more with the transposition of European regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I have now been a Member of this House for a very long time, and in that time we have discussed and adopted a very large number of things, but when it comes to actually implementing them, we seem to lose our nerve. I live on the border with a neighbouring country, that loveable place called the Netherlands, and it took us an incredibly long time to come to an agreement as to how we might catch criminals. We have, fortunately, moved on from that, but, where the prosecution of waste crime is concerned, we have not yet emerged from Noah’s Ark, and that, Madam President-in-Office, is something you must not be content with. You need to use the last months of your presidency to get seriously stuck in to supporting the Commissioner and motivating him to do something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many areas in which implementation and transposition are lacking. I would very much like to know whether the country in which the toxic waste was dumped actually gave its consent to that being done, for if it did not, this poisonous stuff ought not to have been brought there in the first place. There are so many rules and regulations applicable to this, and all that is needed is for us to implement them with courage and understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worthy of note, by the way, that this is a scandal not only as regards health and the environment, but also in terms of competition. If we do not close this loophole in our own laws and in the Basle Convention, we will thereby be encouraging people who are less than particular about compliance with the law to make the contamination of the environment an exportable commodity, and to do so is hypocrisy, for while we in Europe talk about our high standards, we also open up any number of loopholes that make it possible for this stuff to be exported, and it is Commissioner Dimas – the poor chap – and, with him, the Commission, who has to carry the can for it, even though I have to tell the President-in-Office that the Commission, in this instance, is quite utterly blameless.</p>
<p class="contents">Our two institutions were on the right track. We would ask you to act on the suggestions that the Commission and this House have made in this matter, for they are good ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That ship unloaded 500 tonnes of chemical waste into trucks which dumped it in 15 separate sites around Abidjan, a city of 5 million people.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations Environment Programme has said that this is clearly a crime, although they say they do not yet know who was responsible, or the actual nature of that crime. What we do know is that the Basel Convention should have stopped this crime and has failed to do so, and we need to know why. The Ivory Coast is a long way away; most countries in Africa do not have strong laws to protect human and environmental health from the effects of hazardous waste, but that is no reason for us here in Strasbourg to walk away from this case and its lessons. We want safe disposal, not toxic parcel-passing. We want – and I say this directly to you, Commissioner – those countries that have not yet ratified that convention, to ratify it; they include Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta and Slovenia. I hope you will pursue them and I hope the Council will pursue them, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Crime and responsibility and judgment are matters for the courts, but investigation and the plugging of legal loopholes are our responsibility; so is helping ACP countries to meet high standards in hazardous waste disposal; so is helping the victims of these appalling events – we think particularly of the children in the Ivory Coast who have been made to suffer because of them; so is ensuring that the Commission and the Dutch authorities and the EEA and the Government of the Ivory Coast all do their best to identify and pursue the perpetrators of this crime.</p>
<p class="contents">If the law is defective, then it must be amended. If the law is adequate, then it must be enforced. We know, though, that the law is flouted in too many cases. We know that it is too easy to avoid the cost of responsible safe disposal by dumping, by going outside OECD countries and by using national and international cowboys, and that is what we must ensure is brought to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How is it possible that the <span class="italic">Proba Koala</span> was not stopped from causing so much pollution? Although this incident should have set all the red lights flashing, the Dutch Government, which should ultimately carry the can, is instead washing its hands in legal innocence. It refuses to honestly admit to mistakes, is reluctant to set up a fund for the victims in Ivory Coast, is passing the buck, and is refusing to take moral and financial responsibility. This is how the disappointing conduct of the Dutch Government can be summed up. That is why I would ask the Commission whether it is prepared to bring pressure to bear on the Netherlands to grant legal support to Ivory Coast and also to ensure that, in consultation with the UN, an emergency fund is set up for the victims of this disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">My African parliamentary counterparts have the feeling that the Netherlands and Europe, despite the Basel Convention, failed to guard them from this criminal behaviour. It is apparently acceptable to use Africa as a dumping ground. This creates a sense of inferiority which undermines a credible partnership between Africa and Europe, and has dealt our relations a huge blow. What steps do the Finnish Presidency and the Commission intend to take in the direction of Ivory Coast and the African Union?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission prepared to draft proposals for measures to put an end to this dumping if possible, and where rules apply, to get them implemented? Is the Commission prepared to draw up a black list, annually, of countries and transnational companies that are involved in the illegal dumping of chemical waste in developing countries? Are the Commission and Council prepared to make legislative proposals in order to plug the loopholes in the Basel Convention, among other things, with the obligation on ships leaving Europe to leave their bilge water with the responsible authorities in the last EU port at which they call?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, is the Commission prepared to take the necessary steps to assist developing countries in the identification of harmful substances and to guarantee that bilge water that is produced at sea is processed safely? I count on the Commission’s support and I hope that the Council will call the Netherlands to account about its responsibility; the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was right to do the same with the Council. We have had plenty of fine words, now we want to see them translated into practice, and the laws enforced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How do we pursue these objectives? What we want is the growth of developing countries, environmental protection and reduction of the greenhouse effect, but what do we do to this end?</p>
<p class="contents">Due to toxic waste pollution in Ivory Coast, 85 000 people suffered ill-health and eight died. Toxic substances were shipped from Amsterdam by the Dutch company Trafigura Beheer BV. They, in Amsterdam, were aware of the waste’s toxic nature; nevertheless, due to high costs, the cheap alternative of disposal in Ivory Coast was chosen.</p>
<p class="contents">Most African countries have no regulations concerning the protection of the environment against hazardous waste. Used computers are stored in Nigeria, radioactive waste in Somalia and chlorine in Cameroon, despite the regulations adopted by the EU in 1994 and 1997 to prohibit the export of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, this House approved the Directive on the Protection of the Environment through Criminal Law at its first reading. However, the first reading was also the last. We must therefore resume debate on the Directive as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Netherlands must investigate the case of Ivory Coast, find the perpetrators, eliminate the effects and pay compensatory damages to the victims. Without serious measures the EU development cooperation policy for the support and sustainable development of developing countries will be hard to implement, and the EU stands to lose face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ever since 1997, we have had a ban on exports of hazardous waste to countries outside the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It is time to ensure that it is properly implemented. It is unacceptable that the Dutch authorities should not have taken responsibility when they had the chance to stop the vessel. All credit to Estonia, which did what needed to be done. I wish to thank Commissioner Dimas for quickly having realised how serious the situation was.</p>
<p class="contents">A proposal by the Commission is now needed quickly in the interests of more stringent compliance with the rules. We need to make sure that every time someone undertakes to transport hazardous material, there is someone to take personal responsibility and to sign an attestation of liability. The board of directors and managing director must also be given greater personal responsibility. Otherwise, traditions with unclear and complicated conditions of liability will make it difficult to get to grips with irresponsible transporters and shipowners.</p>

What came to pass in Ivory Coast with the waste from the ship <span class="italic">Proba Koala </span>is appalling and should never have happened. What is beyond doubt is that this involved the illegal transport of waste. The Basel Convention contains an express ban on the transport of harmful waste to non-OECD countries, which has thus been flouted. That the adherence to current legislation concerning the transport of waste substances is leaving a great deal to be desired comes as no surprise. Random tests in Great Britain and France show that rules are flouted in 75% to 100% of all waste transports.</p>
<p class="contents">For the European Parliament, whilst effective enforcement and stricter controls were a tough bargaining point during the negotiations in the run-up to the new resolution on the transport of waste substances, our wishes have only partly been granted. At the moment, we are not so desperate for fresh rules or a European minimum penalty for infringement, as Commissioner Dimas suggests. What we need first of all is the enforcement of existing rules.

<p class="contents">Generally speaking, what is known as the Basle Convention appears to be working reasonably well. Officially, we are told that there has been a considerable reduction in exports of toxic waste to Africa, but that is contradicted by spot checks carried out in European ports, in which half of all the declarations of the non-toxicity of loads of waste turned out to be false, and so what is called for in this area, if the problem of the black market in toxic waste is to be got under control, is more checks and more cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also have to grapple with the problems surrounding the burgeoning trade in electrical waste and maritime wrecks, for which as yet no international conventions exist. In order to deal the ultimate blow to the waste mafia, we will no doubt have to have a blacklist of the businesses that are involved in schemes of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And if we call it a crime, there must be guilty parties and punishments, but so far impunity and apathy are winning the day.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the EU has legislation on the transport of toxic waste – the export of such waste has been banned since 1997, under the Basel Convention – but up to now this ban has been systematically flouted. This laissez-faire attitude is criminal, and the dead of Abidjan are its victims. The Union now needs to act, and act fast, to put a stop to the irresponsibility and the impunity. It must enforce the existing legislation, in particular the directive of July 2006 that requires the Member States to establish inspection networks. It must strengthen this legislation where necessary, to enable fast and effective sanctions, as both the Commission and the European Parliament have been demanding since 2001. Finally, it must help countries in Africa to draw up protective legislation.</p>

The few citizens who take an interest in our debates will find it very difficult to understand why, this afternoon, we are mixing up a debate on pollution in Ivory Coast with another on a judgment that tramples over the subsidiarity principle. The fact that the judgment of 13 September 2005 was issued on the subject of an environmental directive does not change the fact that it is actually worded as a judgment on the principle of the communitisation of criminal law. This is tantamount to a constitutional revolution, because, as we know, at least nine other competences are in the process of being absorbed by the European Union, with no treaty, including criminal law on immigration and intellectual property law.</p>
<p class="contents">There certainly is pollution, ladies and gentlemen – the Court of Justice’s judicial pollution of the European treaties. In this confused and ill-thought-out judgment, there are no textual references and no clear legal principles. Far-fetched and poorly explained considerations of questionable relevance lead to a hasty and slipshod conclusion. We know how it works: fuzzy conclusions demand the indefinite extension of the European Union's competences, then justify the interpretation of the Commission, which, finally, legitimises the transfer of powers from the States to the Court. Those who, like us, were wary of the substantial extension of the EU's objectives in Article I-3 of the draft Constitution were quite right to be concerned. The Commissioners and the judges have no intention of bending to the will of the people, and have decided to disregard their refusal to ratify a draft Constitution that transferred criminal matters into the ordinary Community legislative procedure. This judgment is a distortion of the will of those who signed and ratified the European treaties. It is a judicial coup d'état.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are coming up to some important deadlines. Our people are watching us and will soon be calling us to account. Will there be any sincere democrats here to stand up to this shameless tyranny? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ban does not, however, apply to normal ship’s waste and bilge water, but it is equally clear that the bilge water on the <span class="italic">Proba Koala </span>was not normal. The fatalities, thousands of injured and the enormous upheaval in Ivory Coast are testimony to this. It was already clear in Amsterdam that its bilge water was not normal, because someone had collapsed and there was an unbearable and unusual stench.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the ship with its contents should never have left Amsterdam without warning the authorities at the next European port, which was in Estonia. That is why a judicial inquiry is currently underway in the Netherlands, and rightly too, in order to find out how it was possible for the toxic ship to leave the Netherlands in the first place, and whether the port authorities or inspectorates are in any way to blame. What we should now focus on, though, is the question as to how disasters of that kind can be prevented from happening in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three questions I would like to put to the Commissioner. In Estonia, you stated that the dumping of toxic waste in Ivory Coast was only the tip of the iceberg. What was the basis for this statement? Secondly, would you agree that ships that leave the EU should be obliged to surrender their waste water and waste at their last EU port? Finally, what measures is the Commission able, and willing, to take in order to tighten up checks on the export of harmful waste? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, the need should be emphasised for information for the public, internal agreement and information between the departments involved and the operation of the register for recording qualitative and quantitative data and quantities of waste moved and produced.

This is the very reason why we have insisted on legislation with regard to criminal law if we want to enforce environmental policy effectively.

That is how we would like to go forward.</p>
<p class="contents">A legislative proposal was submitted six years ago. At the same time, the Council produced its own framework decision, which the Commission and this House suggested should be thrown out, which is exactly what happened a year ago. Last Monday, the Commissioner announced he will produce a fresh proposal, but perhaps the Commissioner could be more specific as to this proposal’s exact content, for this was left a little vague last Monday. I should also like to know from the Council – as I used to be rapporteur – whether the Council is happy to accept a fresh proposal to address environmental crime, for that is the most important question on the agenda here.

The Council takes a very serious view of illegal movements of waste and the risk which they pose to the immediate environment and people’s health.</p>
<p class="contents">The prevention of such illegal movements is a very demanding task, as has been made very evident in this debate. It requires very diverse sorts of action and effective cooperation at many levels, the limits of competence exercised by the authorities notwithstanding. We must also honestly recognise the fact that there is much room for improvement in the way movements of waste in the European Union and away from it are controlled, according to the surveys that have been conducted.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to remember that, as regrettable as these individual events that attract so much public attention are, the recent incident involving the <span class="italic">Probo Koala</span> in the Ivory Coast being a case in point, we must remember to give attention too to the everyday incidents and situations that cause harm to health and the environment, of which there is still an abundance. An example is the scrapping of ships in unsatisfactory conditions in developing countries. Work is to continue with regard to these important questions at the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention in Nairobi at the end of November.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also see, recognise and acknowledge that there are considerable differences in national criminal laws on the environment between the Member States. In some Member States there are some very up-to-date penal provisions for environmental crimes, while in others there might well be a need to review such provisions to reflect the current risks and counter them. Actually, one might say that there is still a lot to do in all the Member States in the area of implementation of these penal provisions and, especially, increasing the likelihood of catching offenders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council takes a very serious view of environmental criminality and its prevention. As for the proposal being drafted, it is obviously difficult for the Council to take a position on something that does not yet exist. We first have to look at the proposal and then adopt a position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to add to the list of nationalities that Mr Bowis referred to. This was a Greek-owned ship, under the flag of Panama, but it was time-chartered to a Dutch company, which operated it from Switzerland, with a Russian crew, financed by British and international banks and with a variety of nationalities on the board of the company and as shareholders. Happily, it was blocked by Greenpeace in Estonia and the Estonian authorities thoroughly investigated the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to assure the rapporteur that first proposal, which contains a minimum level of penalties, will be merged with the framework decision of the Council and basically it will be along the lines of what you proposed, with certain amendments at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the question of whether a ship carrying hazardous waste is allowed to leave a European Union port, if the waste is hazardous it is not allowed to go to a destination outside the OECD. That also applies to slops – the ship’s own waste water – that contain hazardous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">I will continue to follow closely all developments in the criminal investigations and proceedings that are currently being conducted in the Netherlands and Estonia regarding the toxic waste dumping in Côte d’Ivoire. The Commission is also in the process of collecting any information available in other Member States concerning the vessel <span class="italic">Proba Koala</span> and its journey. I hope that we will soon be able to draw conclusions from that and find the best way forward in preventing such incidents in the future. We must keep in mind that the tragic incident in Côte d’Ivoire is just the tip of the iceberg. We know that is so from inspections carried out in Member States by their network of implementation and enforcement agencies, IMPEL. In 2005, 51% of the waste shipments checked were found to be illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the cases do not make big headlines but they can, nevertheless, pose a serious risk to the environment and human health. We must make it very clear that our society does not tolerate environmental crime and that we are determined to take all possible steps to fight it. But legislation that we have adopted to better protect our environment and the health of our citizens will not achieve its objectives if we do not take the necessary measures to ensure that it is properly enforced. I can assure you that the Commission is determined that environmental legislation should be properly applied throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already taking a number of specific initiatives in order to ensure that the European Union waste shipment regulation is correctly applied and illegal waste shipments are prevented and reduced. This includes the preparation of guidelines to be adopted in connection with the application of the new waste shipment regulation next year and the organisation of awareness-raising events in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission meets representatives of national authorities responsible for waste shipments on a regular basis. This takes place within a well-established framework and includes multilateral meetings in Brussels, as well as bilateral contacts, but these initiatives need to be supplemented by measures to establish effective sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the many measures taken by the Commission for this purpose was to propose a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law. As I have already said, it is regrettable that the Commission’s proposal was not taken up by the Council, due to a difference of views on the correct legal basis. Now, however, the Court of Justice has confirmed that the Commission’s views were correct.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is preparing a new proposal for a directive which will give effect to the Court’s judgment and should be adopted soon. It has taken some time to produce the amended proposal, because the Commission has very carefully analysed the Court’s judgment and made a comparison of the original Commission proposal as amended after Parliament’s first reading and the Council’s framework decision. In addition, an impact assessment is being carried out to analyse the various options for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission thinks it is necessary to amend its proposal of 2001 after the Court’s ruling, to ensure that all criminal law measures necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the Community’s policy for the protection of the environment are included in the proposal. The Court has made it clear that the parallel adoption of a directive and a framework decision, as was done in the past, is no longer possible. Also, after five years, the Commission’s proposal needs to be adapted to legislative developments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to clarify that the Commission does not want to harmonise national criminal laws fully. The aim is that only those steps which are necessary for the effective implementation of environmental policy should be taken at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to emphasise again the importance of good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in the forthcoming codecision procedure for the adoption of the directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law. We have the same goals, namely to protect the environment by establishing minimum standards for the sanctioning of environmental offences and to try to eliminate the possibility of safe havens for environmental offenders in the European Union. Acting together, we can take a big step towards achieving these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the ratification of the Basel Convention, I have sent letters to more than 50 countries around the world asking them to ratify the Convention. To avoid any wrong conclusions, I should clarify that the Basel ban is mandatory, legally binding, for the European Union Member States, even those that have not ratified the Convention, because we as the European Union have signed and ratified the agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This environmental crime will once again create the view that the rich North regards poor Africa as a suitable dumping ground. I welcome the Commissioner’s statement which tries to counter this view, but statements are one thing: only action will convince Africans that we are serious about dealing with this. Apart from all the other issues that have to be investigated we need to know how it was possible for this ship to leave Amsterdam. Are the Dutch authorities reviewing their inspection methods?

In this Parliament we are often at the forefront of the campaigns for better environmental protection. We are fond of stating that pollution does not respect borders. And yet, in 2006 we are witness to a situation in which 500 tonnes of toxic waste is transported from an EU Member State and dumped upon the long-suffering people of Côte d’Ivoire. The immediate impact has been a number of deaths and tens of thousands of people needing medical attention. We have all seen the grim estimates of what the longer-term impact could prove to be.</p>
<p class="contents">If our grand statements on environmental protection are to mean anything, then the Commission and the Dutch authorities must make a full investigation in pursuit of the culprits in this crime. Clearly current legislation does not offer sufficient protection against unscrupulous people who care nothing for the people of Côte d’Ivoire and other African states. In the EU, we must act to ensure that our legislation on toxic waste is such that we can guarantee to people in Africa that their countries will not be dumping grounds for our hazardous waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU-Syria Association Agreement is the missing piece in the Barcelona process, but it is also the Godot of the European Parliament: continually heralded, but never concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations on this agreement started in 1996, before Syria withdrew from Lebanon. They were difficult, but they nevertheless resulted in a much-revised draft that laid down, for example, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the fight against terrorism. The agreement was signed in the Council in October 2004, but the ratification process was interrupted by the appalling assassination of the former prime minister Mr Hariri on 14 February 2005. We all know what happened next. People in Lebanon and all over the world immediately pointed the finger at the government in Damascus. An investigation, led initially by Mr Mehlis and now by Mr Brammertz, was carried out <span class="italic">in situ</span>, and Resolution 1559 called for the withdrawal of Syrian troops and secret services from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">The presumption of innocence is one of the pillars of our legal systems, but we must also bear in mind the precautionary principle. Although Syria made haste to withdraw its troops from Lebanon, it was initially hesitant about cooperating with Mr Mehlis. Europe therefore cautiously distanced itself from the Damascus Government. Is this caution still acceptable today, when various events both on the international stage and within Syria's internal political system should encourage us to reopen dialogue? The Council will be the judge of that, but I, for my part, am in favour of dialogue and the Committee on Foreign Affairs supported me in this by a large majority. This dialogue could ultimately lead to the signing of the agreement, but that question is still premature and is not the purpose of the recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">So, then, what are these events? First of all, there is the renewal of effective cooperation with Mr Brammertz's investigation, as attested to in his latest report. Next, it has become apparent that our isolation of Syria has been counter-productive in terms of democracy within the country, and has failed to weaken a strong government. Our empty-chair politics have contributed to destabilising a reforming tendency that was cautiously raising its head. What is more, the voice of Europe, which in the past has been raised to defend activists and political prisoners, is now hardly to be heard. Finally, and this is my third point, the tragedy in Lebanon has been a terrible lesson. The war between Israel and Lebanon was proof, if proof were needed, of the danger and uselessness of force. It demonstrated the need to work politically with all those involved in this conflict, and we know that, behind the two protagonists, other influences are at work: the United States without doubt, but also Iran and Syria. As Europe closed its doors, Syria found other allies, notably Iran, which provided not only oil but also a war-like ideology that does nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has now made a strong commitment to the Middle East, and there have been successive diplomatic missions on a regular basis. Support for the reopening of dialogue with Syria regarding the association agreement forms part of this preventative strategy, because another conflict in this region could be even more devastating. Let us be under no illusions. Syria will not break off from Iran in terms of trade, but its highest authorities claim to be prepared to distance themselves from Iran in terms of the Middle East peace process. This is an important step. This is a country with a strong and hardline government, where human rights are not sufficiently respected, and my report discusses these problems quite unambiguously. Having said that, Syria is a great and civilised country that must be treated with respect, dignity and honesty. It could be a stabilising influence in the Middle East and we need it. When Mr Siniora was here, he put forward the scenario of a solution to the problem of the Shebaa farms, and there are other possible points of conciliation. I would advocate that we open up all avenues. I would like to thank my fellow Members from all parties for their valuable assistance in drawing up this recommendation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council shares many of the concerns expressed in it with regard to Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs De Keyser says in her report, Syria may have an important role to play in the Near and Middle East ‘as a link between the parties in the peace process and a facilitator of a resolution of the regional conflict’. For this reason, the Council too decided in August to authorise High Representative Javier Solana and the Finnish Presidency to be in contact with all relevant parties that may influence finding a solution to the crisis in Lebanon and the situation in the Middle East more generally. Unquestionably, these parties also include Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the dramatic events of the summer, it has been important to stabilise the situation in Lebanon and regions close to it. When Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja met with his Syrian counterpart at the end of August the message to Syria was a clear one. We expect Syria to work to implement Resolutions 1559, 1680 and 1701. Syria should support the national reconstruction process in Lebanon and do its utmost to stabilise the political situation inside Lebanon. Equipping armies other than the Lebanese and the question of arms smuggling have a fundamental impact on whether a ceasefire can be built on a sustainable basis. There are also questions that remain unanswered with regard to the demarcation of the border between Syria and Lebanon and the establishment of diplomatic relations. Solving the complex problem associated with the Shebaa area will likewise require Syria’s cooperation. Syria must also continue to show a desire to cooperate with the Brammertz commission which is investigating the Hariri assassination.</p>
<p class="contents">A question that is outside the scope of Resolution 1701 but important for stability in the region is the activity of Palestinian organisations with their headquarters in Damascus and Syrian support for them. Furthermore, Syria’s relations with Iraq and Iran and its activities with regard to these countries have direct implications for the general situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is also closely following progress in human rights in Syria. Especially worrying were the arrests in the spring of those who are defenders of human rights and who signed the Beirut-Damascus Declaration. The fact that some of them were recently released is obviously welcome news. The EU will be closely observing how, for example, freedom of gathering in a public place and freedom of expression are being implemented in the country. Obviously, Syria must also act in accordance with the principles of international human rights. The reopening of the Civil Society Training Centre, which has EU support, is an important objective. The centre was shut in the spring just a week after it had opened.</p>
<p class="contents">Continual links with Syria are being maintained, especially via Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. The meeting of Foreign Ministers in Tampere in November, which Syria has also been invited to attend, will provide an excellent forum for discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria is an important actor in the Middle East. It can choose: it can either be a troublemaker or a constructive partner. Syria’s historically strong ties with Lebanon mean that it has an especially important role to play in implementing the UN Security Council Resolutions with respect to the situation in Lebanon. The Union has continually stressed that Lebanon’s right to self-determination, territorial inviolability and political independence must be respected. In order to bring stability to Lebanon and the entire region it is important that arms smuggling to Lebanon be prevented. Syria needs to watch its borders to achieve this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has said that it is willing to improve relations with Syria, if the country’s behaviour seems to favour this. The ball is now in their court. Given the right circumstances, the Union could, for example, reconsider the possibility of signing the Association Agreement. This would of course promote cooperation between the EU and Syria, especially financially, as well as reforms that are essential for Syria’s development, which is the assumption also made in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, first of all I think this is a very timely discussion. Thank you for putting it on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">I have followed closely the discussions in the AFET Committee on Ms De Keyser’s substantive and comprehensive report. The report is a fair account of the internal and regional challenges facing Syria. I welcome this reflection by the European Parliament on the way forward with Syria. After the conflict in Lebanon and in the new context of United Nations Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), it is indeed the right moment to reassess where we are with our current policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria is a long-standing partner under the Barcelona process and is a potential candidate for the European Neighbourhood Policy in the medium term. I share your view that we have a strong interest in bringing that country closer to Europe. Syria, as we all know, is an essential player for stability in the Middle East. It is a key part of the puzzle when it comes to finding a long-term solution to the conflicts in the region and also in the implementation of resolution 1701 in full. In this critical moment for the peace process, Damascus has the power to be part of the solution and not part of the problem. This means that we expect Syria, as you have stated in the motion for a resolution, to pass the right messages to Hezbollah and Hamas, to prevent arms shipments into Lebanon, as our colleague from the Council has said, and to help with the settlement on the Shebaa Farms. As I have indicated, I believe that re-engaging with Syria should be part of our strategy. A different issue is then whether and how far we can re-engage here and now. The first thing we need in order to re-engage with Syria is for its leaders to show their commitment and their interest in moving forward and taking positive steps on a number of issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As you well know, lately we have gone through difficult times in our relationship with Syria. Ms De Keyser’s report addresses a number of the political divergences. Overcoming the political deadlock depends on the leadership’s ability to translate some of its words of goodwill into deeds of goodwill. Syria has a new opportunity at this critical time for the peace process to demonstrate that it is serious about contributing positively to regional stability.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of an association agreement, we have limited scope to tackle matters of concern. Nevertheless, we have tried where we can, and where we feel it is of interest for the people of Syria. We have tried to continue programmes in those areas that directly benefit the citizens of Syria. For example, on human rights, the European Union uses diplomatic channels to address the most serious violations, including, for instance, the cases of prisoners of conscience. We have also reacted to the limitations on freedom of expression and the wave of arrests that accompanied the publication of the Beirut-Damascus declaration last May. But it is not by cutting off contacts that we will achieve much progress. With no dialogue, we have no influence.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore turn the situation around, give a positive perspective to relations with Syria and set out the areas where we expect progress. We do so in part through our cooperation programmes. Syria now seems to be well engaged on the road to economic transition and we welcome the approval of Syria’s national agenda for reforms sponsored by Deputy Prime Minister Dardari last May. Support for the implementation of the reform process, including progressive steps to political opening, could be the focus of our action in the next few years, if things go well.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation under the ENPI – the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument – will allow us to give Syria the medium-term prospect of full participation in the Neighbourhood Policy. The ENP will then bring additional benefits and, we hope, a more interesting package for them, when the time is ripe.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the association agreement, it is still on the table. We have finalised all technical preparations and we have initialled the agreement. Now, it is pending a decision on signature from the Council. Signature is a process. So far, political circumstances have not been right. Member States still expect Syria to take more positive and credible steps to make signature possible, including on regional issues such as Lebanon and Palestine.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria’s recent statements to facilitate the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 may be encouraging signs in this respect, as are President Assad’s calls for resuming peace talks, which have had some positive echoes in Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the European Parliament, the Commission is a strong believer in dialogue. Therefore, I very much hope that the positive messages that we have received from Damascus lately will be transformed into deeds and that we will be able to restore a strong relationship with that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that it is important for us to consider and place this debate within its most appropriate context, Mr President. That context, as the Commissioner has said quite rightly, should be an assessment of the situation, on the journey towards an Association Agreement, without forgetting that we must also promote dialogue, parliamentary dialogue in our case, with Syria, given that country’s strategic importance within the region's complicated context, as others have emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that it is also important to stress – and the text of the resolution makes this very clear – that this is not the time for Parliament to pronounce itself in favour of the Association Agreement. The resolution – the draft recommendation – states quite clearly that the conditions have yet to be met: there must be very clear progress in a number of areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria's conclusion of a defence agreement with Iran is not good news. There must be substantial progress in terms of respecting the European Union’s traditional thinking in the field of democracy and human rights. The United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the territorial integrity of Lebanon must be respected and Syria must cooperate in clearing up the assassination of ex-Prime Minister Hariri. It must also make progress in relation to the abolition of the death penalty, respect for religious minorities, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe, Mr President, that there is still a long way to go. There is some good news, such as Mr Dandari's appointment as Deputy Prime Minister. I had the privilege of meeting him following a mission in Lebanon. I believe that only on this basis, as the Commissioner said a moment ago, must we turn this list of good intentions into concrete actions, so that the European Union can give the green light to this important Association Agreement between the Union and Syria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Syria is not a straightforward country, but a problematic one in a problematic region. If, though, we want to establish stability and peace in this problematic part of the world, we need Syria to cooperate with us. Where Lebanon is concerned, it really ought to dawn on Syria, once and for all, that a politically stable and economically strong Lebanon is to its own benefit and does not constitute a danger to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to Iran, we have no objection to make to friendly relations between that country and Syria, for such is only right and proper among neighbours, but this friendship should bear fruit in a constructive contribution, in a peace process, rather than in a blockade.</p>
<p class="contents">I do indeed understand that Syria is demanding that Israel return the Golan Heights, but Syria must acknowledge that Israel has security interests that it cannot renounce, and should help facilitate peaceful developments in Palestine and, in particular, in the Gaza Strip, not only in the shape of peace between one Palestinian and another, but also between the Palestinians and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vitally important that we engage in this dialogue, and in that connection I should like to remind the House of an expression that the Commissioner used, namely ‘leadership ability’. I would like to see the President of Syria pay less attention to those whose whisperings in his ear have caused Syria, over recent years, to be led into isolation, but rather to those of his advisers who want to take his country back to a dialogue with the international community, especially with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Observers regularly denounce the arbitrary arrests, the acts of torture, the blatant discrimination against minorities, the barriers to freedom of expression and of association, and the harassment and imprisonment of people who work peacefully to enhance freedoms in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer in particular to Michel Kilo, Anwar al-Bunni and Mahmoud Issa, who are still being detained for having signed in May the Beirut-Damascus Declaration calling for the normalisation of relations between Lebanon and Syria. Michel Kilo should have been released on 19 October, but a further charge has resulted in his prison term being extended. Mr Issa was released on 25 September but was re-arrested just two days ago. These examples, among many others, demonstrate the lack of a genuine desire on the part of the Syrian authorities to undertake the necessary democratic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances – as you said, Mrs De Keyser – there is no question of the European Union concluding an association agreement with Syria. As the Resolution states, an improvement in the human rights situation and respect for democratic values must be a prerequisite for the conclusion of any agreement. Moreover, it is also important to put in place an effective control mechanism as part of the application of the ‘human rights' clause. This approach should also be applied, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, to Russia and to Turkmenistan, and to a good many other countries too. The same goes for the consistency of the positions adopted by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We see the Association Agreement as a part of this political process. I stress the word ‘political’ because, from an economic point of view, the Agreement is much more beneficial for Europe than for Syria. The suspension of relations with Damascus was a political mistake. Europe should not have blacklists and should not blindly follow North American ideas on the axis of evil. Regardless of its regime, Syria is a country that is vital to peace in the region. Europe must learn to respect the complexity of Syrian society and the many shades of opinion there. The regime is politically authoritarian, yet has a liberal attitude to the economy, religion and customs. Pluralism is stifled and constrained, yet it exists in society and in the institutions. The less the western powers intervene in the region, the more pluralism will be allowed to flourish.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity that the final version of the report suffers from shades of the colonial era on a number of issues. For example, it is not up to us to say who is and who is not trustworthy, because we ourselves, rightly, do not accept such opinions from third parties. It would also be better if it did not cast far-fetched aspersions over non-existent relations between Damascus and Al Qaeda and Sunni fundamentalism. This ignorance does us no favours. We owe it to ourselves to be consistent, as well. Diplomatic relations cannot hinge on the outcome of a criminal investigation. Evidence pertaining to the crime of the horrific assassination of Rafiq Hariri must be heard in court. Otherwise, our policies run the risk of violating the principle of the presumption of innocence.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the report is clear on the important issue; it seeks normal relations and that is a good thing. It is good that the issue of human rights should be at the heart of this normalisation process, but Europe needs to apply the same policy to all other countries, including Israel. Lastly, it supports the restitution of the Golan Heights to Damascus, an area Syria has never resorted to violent means to recover; this is a proposal supported in UN resolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Anyone in this House who advises the Council to conclude an association agreement with Syria is giving support to a ruthless minority regime about which it is sufficient to say that the only entities it regards as strategic partners in its region are the Islamic Republic of Iran and Hezbollah. The present resolution misjudges once again the true nature of the Assad regime where literally everything revolves around the preservation of power. As a consequence, the rapporteur has succumbed to illusions of possible positive effects of the association agreement on Damascus’ internal and external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If I could catch Mrs De Keyser’s eye, I should not like to keep from you the opinion held by a recognised Syria expert from my country who has made many visits to that country over the years; he told me, only the other day, in plain words, that ‘democracy is considered to be a deadly threat by those in power’, and that this is something that has become obvious to him in recent years in discussion with sources within the regime, including with the oh-so-liberal Mr Dardari.

This is a country concerning which we have a great number of objections and reservations. There is no mistaking that Syria is directly or indirectly involved in the smuggling of weapons to terrorist organisations. There is no mistaking that Syria has close links to Iran. It is a fact that we have very serious concerns about the standard of Syria’s respect for human rights and civil rights. The question arises as to which instruments the European Parliament and the European Union should use. Will this agreement promote democracy? Will it make the instruments at our disposal for bringing pressure to bear on this government more efficient, or will it weaken our position?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that mutual understanding and the possibility of exerting pressure will strengthen our position and that the agreement in question should be supported. I believe this should be based on the premise that our stance and our opinion as the European Parliament requires respect for human rights and civil rights. This must be made abundantly clear at every opportunity. Ceasing to support terrorist activity has to be a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span>.

Syria is a Sunni and secular state, with relatively little in common, ideologically speaking, with Shiite fundamentalists.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what would make it possible for us to make use of an association agreement, provided that improvements are made in the observance of human rights and a solution found to the question of how we and it can join together in combating terrorism. What is certain is that supplies of weapons to the Lebanon cannot be wholly stopped without Syria’s consent, and that must be seen to be a factor. Such a solution is also conditional upon the problem of the Shebaa farms being resolved. That is of the utmost importance if Hizbollah are to be denied the excuse that they need to have weapons in the area, since it is Israeli-occupied territory. For all these reasons, both the situation within Syria and that country’s relations with the European Union need to be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiative on the part of the Mrs De Keyser and the Committee on Foreign Affairs – of which, it is my impression, both the Council and the Commission take a sympathetic view – makes an important contribution towards Syria being offered the opportunity to secure its own interests and thereby make a constructive contribution to the peace process in the region. It is evident that the Syrian regime is no friend of democracy, that it violates human rights, that people – both Syrians and others – must be set at liberty and that a stop must be put to the cooperation with the military arms of Hizbollah and Hamas; even so, I do believe that a dialogue of this kind is possible and that the offer of an association agreement, within this framework, can be an effective means to that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conclusion of an association agreement between the European Community and Syria would constitute a very encouraging political sign in terms of establishing peace in the Middle East, which is something that we all so earnestly desire. Association agreements are an excellent way to put pressure on countries. Thus, in return for our economic and commercial cooperation, we must ask Syria to become a democratic country that respects fundamental freedoms; to stop interfering in its neighbours' affairs; to strictly delimit its border with Lebanon; and to stop supporting the Hezbollah militias or the Hamas fundamentalists that it is sheltering. Syria must release the intellectuals, human rights defenders and political prisoners that it is holding in its prisons. It must also respect the right of the minorities living on its territory, especially the Kurds, to whom it must offer citizenship, since they do not have it.</p>
<p class="contents">If Syria renounced its Greater Syria project and if it turned to allies other than Iran, the entire region would benefit. Syria, more than any other country in the region, is able to play the role of governor and peacemaker, particularly in relation to the Iraqi and Palestinian issues. Europe must make every effort to include Syria among its strategic allies in the Middle East. If the wind of change rose in Syria and if the country practised a policy of openness, then all of the populations in the Middle East could finally start to free themselves from the yoke of dictatorship and theocratic populism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Isolated Syria has for some time been helping Iran launch a combined pan-Islamic offensive on Israel, and Syria seeks to keep the Lebanese Government weak by strongly backing Iran’s proxy Hezbollah, which Syria believes will also help re-establish its influence in Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Syria has one redeeming feature: it is a secular country that recoils from Islamic fundamentalism, and parts of the ruling Ba’ath elite worry about Syria’s deepening defence alliance with theocratic Iran and Islamist Hezbollah. Syria no longer needs to cosy up to Iran in its old alliance against their common enemy, Saddam Hussein’s Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, hopes are now fading that the EU can deal directly with the Palestinians under an intransigent Hamas, which refuses to recognise Israel or forswear violence. The time is therefore now ripe to offer assurances to Syria that blocking Hezbollah’s re-armament, stopping jihadi fighters’ passage into Iraq and improving Syria’s appalling human rights record would bring valuable benefits, including the eventual ratification of the strengthened association agreement with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU, as a member of the Quartet, can also help broker an acceptable peace agreement between Israel and Syria over the Golan Heights and the Shebaa Farms where the US may be unwilling. Israel would gain much by talking to its enemy, Syria. Conscious of its vulnerability to rocket attacks, Israel knows that it needs a defensible state, safe from external aggression. Removing Syria as a threat is a key element in achieving this strategic objective.

Furthermore, as the latest decision on Iraq has shown, the USA does not have a serious policy in the region, either. The end of the policy of playing off one side against the other has undoubtedly served to strengthen Iran. Iran is the only player with a relevant, active policy. Iran’s intermediary is Syria. Parliament cannot take any relevant steps in relation to Iran. That would require a joint approach from the EU, the USA and the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">What we in this Chamber can do is to try to draw Syria out of its submissive role as an intermediary. That is the strategy. The tactic is to offer incentives of an economic or international nature, and to do this as a matter of clear, common and uncompromising European policy. We must make demands from Syria in a similarly clear and uncompromising way. This is not a matter of appeasement. The key issue is for Syria to sign up to a gradual lifting of martial law, to the creation of a civil society with full freedom of expression and to respect for minority rights and a transition to a democratic political system based on an open market economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria must of course cooperate on the investigation into the assassination of Hariri. It must engage in constructive moves towards solving the peace process. It must stop arming Hezbollah and supporting armed Palestinian groups, it must comply with Resolutions 1559 and 1701 and it must also complete the withdrawal of all armed forces from Lebanon and establish diplomatic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not own the Association Agreement. What is needed is for Syria to take ownership of it. Our task is to establish, through the Agreement, a Syrian road map towards transition. I should like to call on the Commission and chiefly the Council to give active support both to our strategy and to our tactics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This objective has been implemented successfully in recent years, and there are already Association Agreements in place with almost all of the countries of the Mediterranean basin, except, of course, for Syria, for various, understandable reasons. The EU has always been mindful of the events of recent months. It must make a genuine commitment to proper negotiations with Syria, with a view to securing the country's firm desire to conclude the Agreement. Accordingly, Syria will hopefully develop into a democracy that respects human rights and religious freedom, that helps in the fight against terrorism, and that promotes dialogue and lasting peace in the region. To this end, the Syrian Government must take action to end the state of emergency at the earliest opportunity, with the EU lending all possible assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria is in a geostrategically vital location and has a crucial role to play in the Middle East peace process. The EU must, once and for all, make clear its belief that strengthening democracy cannot be achieved by means of a policy of bombing or isolation.  </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Breaking off all dialogue means isolating the country and carries the risk of the regime becoming more radical. It means pushing Syria even further into the arms of Iran, whose only aspiration is to destroy Israel and to destabilise the region.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to resume talks with Syria now, though, we must be very cautious and lay down firm conditions in advance. We must demand that Syria respect Lebanon's sovereignty and that it comply with the Security Council resolutions calling on it to step up controls at the Lebanese-Syrian border and to stop supplying weapons to Hezbollah. We must make respect for human rights and civil liberties a prerequisite for the signing of any agreement. We must demand that it take concrete action in following up the conclusions of the investigation into the assassination of the former prime minister, Rafik Hariri. I would point out that this is also a prerequisite for the continuation of the negotiations. Finally, it must clearly outline to the international community the measures that it is taking to effectively and practically combat the proliferation of weapons and terrorism in the region. By that, I mean that it must also stop all support to the Hezbollah and Hamas militias.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union plans to re-open negotiations with Syria, it must do so only if the latter accepts and respects these conditions. Today, conditions for the signing of any association agreement have not been met, which is something that I deplore. We must call on Syria to abandon its closed-shop mentality and confront this country with its responsibilities in a region in which all of the actors must work on establishing peace and stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can hardly imagine the European Union, being a Union of values and standards, concluding a cooperation agreement with a rogue state such as Syria. That, though, is the reality, when one considers the links with Hezbollah and Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">The only option is to use a cooperation agreement, and the associated negotiations, as an opportunity to prescribe a number of minimum conditions in the area of human rights, because there is increasing oppression against trade unions, journalists and religious minorities in Europe. Syrian citizens belonging to religious minorities, as well as Assyrian Christians returning to Syria, are put behind bars almost without exception. There is therefore every reason finally to bring the EU’s immigration policy and return policy to Syria into line with each other at European level, and to suspend return policy to Syria for the time being. That appears to me to be a first step.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must demand firm guarantees for religious freedom; the Syrian Government must stop interfering with religious minorities in Syria itself, for the various religious communities and ethnic groups are having a particularly hard time at the moment because of the way Syria is managing their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has, in this respect, a reputation to lose, because the European churches are based on the earliest churches that have spread their faith from Syria also in the direction of Europe. This means that the European Union has the onerous task of ensuring, should a cooperation agreement prove to be the solution at this point, that firm guarantees are demanded for improvement in all these areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During it, it became clear that the same phenomenon is evident in this Chamber as in the international community and among the moderate Arab countries too, that there are slightly different views about what kind of policy on Syria is the best and most effective to make the country once again a constructive member of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has come to the conclusion that isolation will drive Syria in the wrong direction, and the Council specifically discussed this and laid down new policy on the matter at the start of August, so that we would be in contact with all the relevant players to resolve the Middle East question. Syria is one of the relevant players. Consequently, I can say, for example in reply to the hope expressed by Mr Swoboda that the Presidency must listen in particular to those that aim to build robust dialogue with Syria, that that is what we have also done. One example of that is the approaching Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Ministers in Tampere, to which Syria has also been invited.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also certainly valuable to build and activate dialogue between parliaments, as Mr Salafranca mentioned in his speech. The right circumstances and also the right timing are very important in the rewarming of these relations. Obviously, in the measures that we ourselves are taking we will aim specifically to give Syria the opportunity to play a positive role.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very apparent from this discussion that in the search for a solution to the situation in the Middle East everything affects everything else. Accordingly, over recent months we have actively tried to find a comprehensive, long-term and lasting solution to the Middle East question. The search has been a very active one. High Representative Javier Solana is in the region today in fact, and he intends to visit not only Israel and the Palestinian territories, but also Beirut, Jordan and possibly other places too. In other words, contact with the various parties is very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this was a very important debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to answer a few very specific questions. One was on human rights. In the absence of an association agreement in force, the European Union has no platform for an in-depth dialogue on human rights with Syria where it could also discuss critical issues – and there are many to be discussed – such as the abrogation of emergency rule, the amendments to the laws on politically partisan NGOs, the granting of citizenship to stateless Kurds or the setting-up of a national council on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think we should make total progress on human rights a precondition for signature. However, we – meaning the representatives of the Commission and the Member States in Damascus especially – use our political instruments such as démarches and political declarations to denounce the most severe abuses of human rights. For instance, we raise with the Syrian authorities the situation of prisoners of conscience, detainees, on a very regular basis; and we also systematically observe the trials at the state security court. In addition, through our cooperation programmes we are supporting the emergence of an open civil society in Syria.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore launched six micro-projects in January under the European initiative for democracy and human rights. These target Arab lawyers, women’s organisations, refugee organisations, the Kurdish minority and the media, and also promote women’s and children’s rights. However, in the present situation of tightening control by the security services, those projects and most training activities have had some difficulty in getting off the ground. The authorities challenge the legality of these projects in Syria, political NGOs are sometimes tolerated but not always authorised, and we are therefore investigating solutions to these problems. Of course, we have also raised individual cases directly with the Syrian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to questions of assistance, EU financial assistance has not gone to supporting the regime, as was mentioned earlier by some colleagues here. It has gone, for example, to supporting the private sector and also the small and medium-sized enterprises. We have helped the people directly, for instance through health programmes, and we have targeted help at getting reforms to open up the economy and trade, competition and investment – things that will be very important for the future development of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to reiterate a point I made earlier. We are in favour of a dialogue with Syria with a political and economic perspective. We are trying to maintain a positive perspective, building on progress that has already been made, for example in supporting the reforms the government is undertaking to open up the economy that I have just mentioned to and decentralise power. But at the same time, as I said before, we will be looking at practical action on regional issues such as the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701, and playing a positive role, for instance in Palestine. This will determine how fast we can proceed with our future engagement, and I see that a great majority in this debate also seems to lean in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under the Regulation, the Council is given information concerning the Agency’s action programme, the general and special risk analyses that it prepares, an annual general report and the Agency’s budget. Measures to amend the Regulation’s provisions may only be proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is primarily the task of Frontex’s Management Board to approve measures relating to its organisational structure, staffing policy and action programme, and the Council takes no part in it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still the responsibility of the institutions of the EU to evolve Community policy on the control of external borders and relevant legislation. Close coordination between the agency and the institutions must therefore be assured, and there are arrangements in existence for this purpose under the Frontex Regulation. Regarding this, I would refer you to the relevant Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams. Its purpose is to enhance operative activities undertaken by the Agency and promote solidarity between Member States and the Community during a crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council proposed last December that the Member States, the Council and the Commission should take certain measures before the end of the year to improve practical cooperation among the Member States. These included strengthened control and monitoring of the EU’s southern maritime border and the Medsea study on the Mediterranean Coastal Patrols Network, which Frontex has now completed.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months the Council, for example in its session on 24 July and at the informal ministerial meeting in September, has been paying particular attention to improving operative cooperation between the Member States and Frontex, and, in particular, the situation in the Mediterranean region and Africa. On these occasions such themes as Frontex’s role and its participation in operative activities, especially in the Mediterranean and with regard to the African situation, were discussed. The Council was satisfied with the measures implemented by Frontex and the Commission and stressed that operative cooperation should continue to be developed further.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of October the Council also adopted its conclusions on strengthening the external maritime border in the south. In its conclusions it urged Frontex to promote a feasibility study on the establishment of a European Surveillance System which, in its initial phase, would cover the whole of the southern maritime border of the Community and the Mediterranean Sea. The Council also asked Frontex to consider setting up regional centres with links to one another, which would be at Frontex’s disposal in operational matters in different maritime areas or sections thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, however, does not have to propose that appropriations should be granted for Frontex’s budget for additional action.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Article 33 of Council Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and the Hague Programme, the work of Frontex will be assessed with reference to a Commission evaluation before the end of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most recently it was discussed by the criminal case cooperation team in October, just a week ago. An examination of the initiative also forms part of the discussions which the Council working groups are holding on other proposals, such as that for a Framework Decision on taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings and that for a Council Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States. There are thus two other proposals for framework decisions on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim which these instruments have in common is to create structures to ensure that details on someone’s criminal background are available generally and readily. When all the Member States have eventually implemented these acts in their national legislation, it should be easier to prevent a convicted individual from working with children or committing crimes against children once again. The Council is therefore continuing to debate these proposals for framework decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Regulation, which was made as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, has been in force since January 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">To correct the problems which emerged in the implementation of this Regulation, the Commission put forward a proposal in September 2005 to replace the Regulation with a new one. In March of this year the Council adopted a general approach on the Commission proposal. In June the European Parliament adopted its position at first reading, which contained 85 amendments. On the basis of this, the Council achieved political consensus on the proposal on 12 October. The adopted text is to be formally reinforced as a common position in a future Council session and submitted to the European Parliament, so that consensus can be swiftly reached at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">In consideration of the security problems experienced by the United Kingdom in August this year, the Council hopes that the institutions will reach consensus on the new Regulation as quickly as possible. The impact of the new security measures recently introduced by the Commission and its committee for civil aviation security should, in addition, be monitored continually. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Council asked for the necessary measures to be implemented as soon as possible, so that the Agency could be set up and so that it could start operations on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the European Council conclusions, the Finnish Presidency held a number of bilateral meetings in July, August, September and October with the aim of resolving the main question still unanswered, namely extending the work of the Agency to areas covered by the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union. At a Council session in early October the Presidency presented a review of the talks that had been held and asked for support for the idea of extending the work of the Agency to areas covered by the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union, but in a more restricted format than in the Commission’s original proposal. The majority of the delegations that presented their view supported this approach by the Presidency, although some wondered whether a proper legal basis for the move would be found. The Presidency is continuing to look at the options and will put forward an interim proposal to the delegations in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Agency’s competence, the aim of the Agency is to provide advice and expertise on fundamental rights to Community institutions, bodies and agencies when they are applying Community law, and in this way help them guarantee a respect for fundamental rights when they implement measures or determine policy within the context of their competences.</p>
<p class="contents">There is general consensus that establishing such an agency would create added value for EU policy on human rights and increase its coherence. The Agency will also be the main point of contact in the European Union for matters relating to fundamental rights. It will discharge its duties, complementing the work of the Council of Europe and in synergy with it, if the decisions on establishing it are taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Improved relations will mean progress in all the problematic issues, among which are human rights, terrorism, Iran’s attitude to the peace process in the Middle East and local matters there, and Iran’s nuclear programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In the matter of Iran’s nuclear industry, the Council has many a time said it was committed to a diplomatic solution, which would take account of the international concern about Iran’s nuclear programme, but at the same time confirms Iran’s right to the peaceful utilisation of nuclear power in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Regarding this, the Council stated on 17 October that it greatly valued the perseverance with which High Representative Javier Solana has since June encouraged Iran to respond to the demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s governing board and the UN Security Council and continued talks on long-term arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU views seriously the IAEA’s evaluation that it has not been able to make any progress in almost four years of continued close monitoring in its efforts to confirm the accuracy and scope of Iran’s announcements regarding the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is also very worried that Iran has not ended all its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, as the IAEA’s governing board and the UN Security Council have asked. The Security Council stated in its Resolution 1696 that it intended to implement relevant measures under Article 41 unless Iran complied with the demand. The Council accordingly is of the opinion that, if Iran continues its uranium enrichment activities, the Union will have no other alternative but to back talks on these sanctions. The Council this month stated that the door to the negotiating chamber was still open for Iran, and urged the country strongly to opt for the positive approach that had been proposed for it.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s High Representative put forward to Iran on 6 June proposals drawn up by six countries. These far-reaching proposals would form a basis for a long-term agreement and would give Iran everything it needs to develop its current civil nuclear energy sector, and they also take account of international concerns. Opting for this positive approach would prepare the way for new relations with Iran, which could be based on mutual respect and extended cooperation in politics and economic matters. The Council hopes that progress can be made along this enlightened path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my report on EU-India Trade and Economic Relations (<a href="/doceo/document/A-6-2006-0256_EN.html">A6-0256/2006</a>), I called on ‘both India and Pakistan to further reduce administrative impediments to implementing trade-related confidence-building measures and for the EU to offer technical assistance, if required, in this regard’.

<p class="contents">In its conclusions in February 2004 the Council repeated that it supported efforts to promote regional cooperation within the framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and especially the agreement on establishing a free trade zone in South Asia by the year 2006. The EU is pleased with the recently signed South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), but understands that some Member States of SAARC still have unresolved bilateral issues. Resolving these would give the Member States of the Association the opportunity to derive full benefit from the agreements they are signatories to.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, the EU still supports all the efforts being made to facilitate trade in multilateral contexts as they are an important way to strengthen trade and investment links between the different countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision by the SAARC ministerial council to confer on the EU the role of observer is a splendid opportunity to develop cooperation between SAARC and the EU. Cooperation between the two was discussed at the Seventh EU-India Summit in Helsinki on 13 October.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU wants to improve the practical support it gives to SAARC. The Commission has already drafted a programme on economic cooperation with SAARC. The programme covers facilitation of trade, standards and cooperation between new businesses. The aim is to promote trade within the region by aiding the implementation of SAFTA, and this, it is hoped, will provide the impetus for improved political relations in the region. The SAARC Secretariat and the Member States of the EU intend to adopt this programme in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is encouraging broad dialogue between India and Pakistan and hopes that trading and other relations will develop favourably, because that would promote stability in the whole region. We welcome the fact that there have been moves to increase trust between India and Pakistan recently, as a result of which freer contacts between people, direct bus and train connections and visits by members of parliament and sports teams have become possible.</p>

There were also Member States which applied a period of transition in the previous round of enlargement, but no longer do so in this new round. The reason is the perception that it is still better for a workforce to move within the framework of common European rules than create arrangements for derogations. As I said in my answer to a previous question, equal treatment of the workforce is very well regulated, but of course we have to pay more and more attention to implementation and supervision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Conference of Presidents envisaged that Question Time would last one and a half hours; then the President reduced it to an hour. Several Members protested at this, and there was no vote on it, and so I have worked on the assumption that we have available to us for Question Time the hour and a half that we are rightly due.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask whether the Council might remain for another quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, or is there a trade union for Council presidencies that forbids them from answering questions after seven in the evening? Questions to the Council used to begin after 9 p.m, and that worked like a dream, with the Council staying until the following day. To sum up, I think there is something wrong with this way of going about things. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore only natural that the conference should focus on the needs of developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will stress in particular that combating climate change may be combined with fast economic development and, furthermore, that policies to reduce emissions must be incorporated into decision-making procedures in crucial sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of the economies of the countries of Asia, Africa and South America, a secure energy supply and improved air quality are, for example, important – parallel – benefits of actions to combat climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that improving the understanding, at international level, of the dangerous repercussions of climate change and the show of interest in addressing the needs of developing countries will increase the potential for us to reach an agreement on the period after 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has four specific priorities in Nairobi. Firstly, to achieve agreement on the institutional framework for the Adaptation Fund. The fund will be financed from levies on the clean development mechanism and is expected to disburse more than EUR 350 million between 2008 and 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to achieve agreement on the list of activities within the framework of the five-year programme of work on adaptation. The programme contains a series of activities aimed to improve our adaptability, such as further improvement of our knowledge about the negative repercussions of climate change, its socio-economic repercussions and the weak points of our economies and societies to climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, to facilitate greater access to the clean development mechanism by the poor countries of Africa and other areas of the planet. We need to address the question of the fair distribution of projects under the clean development mechanism, because only a small percentage of all the projects are destined for Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the debate on the period after 2012, which will continue, without being completed in Nairobi. I truly believe that we still have a great deal of work in store. There are various opinions as to what should be done. The developing countries do not feel comfortable with the prospect of having to step up their efforts to combat climate change. At the same time, numerous developing countries continue to hesitate to take the necessary measures to reduce emissions which are required in order to help limit the average rise in temperature on the planet by two degrees Celsius.</p>
<p class="contents">In Nairobi, the European Union will justifiably continue to maintain that the fight against climate change and the millennium development goals, are not only mutually compatible but also mutually dependent.</p>
<p class="contents">In Nairobi we hope to secure, on the one hand, a clear, specific and balanced approach and stable progress in the ad hoc working party on Article 3, paragraph 9, on the dialogue being held within the framework of the convention and, on the other hand, agreement on how the Kyoto Protocol will be revised on the basis of Article 9. However, we need to look beyond Nairobi, given that Europe needs to step up its efforts in order to persuade its partners throughout the world to continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very positive that 10 members of Parliament will be joining the delegation and I personally look forward – as over the last two years – to close cooperation with them. I shall ensure that they are fully informed and shall pass all the available information on to them immediately. We shall address the media together and I hope that the Members of Parliament will have contacts and dialogues with delegates from other countries during the conference. In this way we shall be able to transfer to a global audience our ambition and joint vision for a sustainable future for mankind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am delighted to be one of the ten MEPs in the European Parliament group in the EU delegation. We are all members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and we will be led by our colleague, Mr Blokland, as our vice-chairman.</p>
<p class="contents">I had expected my colleague, Mr Florenz, to be leading on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but I do not see him. Part of his question was to put down yet again a marker in the sand about the fact that the members of the European Parliament’s delegation, as part of the EU delegation, will be treated as second-class citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I know the Commissioner will tell us the tale about interinstitutional agreements, the Council, the Commission, precedence and practice. Frankly, we are all sick of hearing that and we do not want to hear it any more. The Commissioner is always excellent on these occasions and gives very generously of his time, as do his officials. They brief us extremely well after the event, outside the door, but we are never let in, not even as observers at the high-level meetings. I should like, on behalf of my PPE-DE Group colleagues and, I suspect, all colleagues, to be treated on a par with both the European Commission and the Council delegates who will be there. If the Commission calls it an EU delegation, then the three EU parties who are present should be treated equally.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner told us at a recent briefing that he does not expect spectacular breakthroughs. This will be another interim COP, COP 12-MOP 2 if you like, but it is very important, as this is the first meeting on sub-Saharan Africa. The Commissioner mentioned the need to extend CDMs. At the moment only 2.5% is spent in Africa in this area and that is mainly in Morocco and South Africa, and none in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa as such. A lot of work needs to be done there. I am very interested in looking into the creation of a carbon fund for Africa, as the Commissioner has suggested, and where that will take us.</p>
<p class="contents">Who will finance the Adaptation Fund? The argument is about whether GEF will be the main source of funding and where that is going to be. In Montreal it was agreed that there would be two tracks in the negotiations: one for the UNFCC framework and the other for the Kyoto Protocol. I believe this clarifies where different countries stand. Together we can make progress, bring in more of the developing countries and persuade more of our friends in the United States in particular to join us in the very important task of reducing carbon emissions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The climate is changing quickly, more quickly than expected. Ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising and we will soon reach the point of no return. That is when a political answer is expected. We should not simply cry in Al Gore’s arms, but also start looking for a solution. Nairobi presents us with an opportunity for meeting this challenge head-on. When we discuss the energy crisis and climate problems, we should not be overcome by pessimism, because solutions are possible. Where can we find these solutions?</p>
<p class="contents">First of all by trusting our own measures. I should like to take this opportunity to express once again my support in favour of the emissions trading system, even if it is far from perfect. I am, above all, talking to the Commission, who should ensure that the national allocation plans are credible and that over-allocation is a thing of the past. In the longer term, we must consider auctioning emission rights as an option, because this is how we can prevent the windfall profits in electricity companies and the all too generous allocation of free emission rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would argue in favour of a large-scale investment in the development of new, clean energy. Apart from existing initiatives, there is much scope for innovation. There is the blue energy, harnessed by mixing salt and fresh water, that can produce energy. Or the ladder mills with high-level kites that work as windmills and generate energy. Other alternatives include energy-producing greenhouses and houses, geothermal energy and solar mirrors; so much can be done. We must capitalise on these possibilities by means of technological innovation. This must be funded by governments but, in time, also by auctioning emission rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must be pro-active in cooperating with countries such as China, which opens a new power station every month and needs clean coal technology, which we must supply. Thanks to the transfer of technology, China may well take on board obligations after 2012. If China joins in, participation from the US will also be more likely.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must invest generously in the adjustment fund. Europe has the historical responsibility of climate change, and it is up to us to help the developing countries to adjust to its implications. Climate change is not always a popular subject in developing countries. A leader of a developing country – Mr President, I had been given an extra minute, because Mrs Ferreira had generously given me her speaking time, which gives me a total of three minutes – once said to a Dutch environment minister: ‘First, we will become as rich as you, and only then will we worry about climate change as much as you do.’ I think that things could be done differently. They could become rich without CO2 emissions. Europe has the duty to help them achieve this, and we must, in Nairobi, show them that we really mean it.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am looking forward to an excellent group effort during the Nairobi conference. Needless to say, I wholeheartedly support Mrs Doyle’s appeal. I think that we must be involved in all negotiations as much as possible and have maximum access to the meetings, and I know that you will do your level best in this respect. I should like to close by repeating that I hope for good cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You suggested before that this conference of the parties in Nairobi is a bit of a marking-time sort of meeting, that the lateral events might be as important as the main ones. But we have often heard that, with every month that passes, the problems become greater and more difficult to resolve. So perhaps we cannot afford to have any more intermediate events: the stakes have to be raised and you have to try and extract everything you can from every possible meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise three particular issues. First of all, transport emissions within the European Union. According to current figures, five of the major car manufacturers are going to reach the voluntary agreement target of 140g of CO2 by 2008, but 75% are not on target to reach that. Just remember what that means. They signed a voluntary agreement with the Commission, with the European Union. In their own private boardrooms they have looked at the figures and recognised that they could make more profits out of SUVs and four-wheel drives, and they have deliberately decided that they are not going to fulfil that commitment. They have torn it up, they have not shown good faith and it is now time for the Commission to clamp down really hard.</p>
<p class="contents">We know from the five who are meeting the target that there is nothing special about 140g. You need tough action, and I hope that will be forthcoming in the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the national allocation plans. I know that you are sending the national allocation plans back to the Member States and saying that a 15% margin between allocations and real CO2 emissions is far from good enough. This is an impossible situation. You know that this is the most important instrument. You need to be tough and to use every resource the Commission has at its disposal to emphasise that national governments have to act on the fine speeches they make in Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, looking ahead to the post 2012 emissions trading scheme, how are you going to make it work in future? Free allocations were a good start, but proved pretty weak in practice. Auctioning will still give windfall profits to some of the major power generators. You think you have to start looking at benchmarking, which is very difficult. But you need to tell industry now across the whole of Europe that we are going to reward best practice and it should start investing now in making a difference to our planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are approaching a threshold, past which major disasters are unavoidable. That is what British Foreign Minister Margaret Beckett said and she went on to say we are heading for climate chaos. At the same time the economic analyses show that very ambitious emission reductions are very reasonable in terms of cost and they will of course be a lot cheaper than letting climate change run riot.</p>
<p class="contents">Public awareness of this is growing, reflected, for example, in the opinion expressed by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) that Europe must reduce its emissions by 75% by the middle of the century and it cannot wait about for the others to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Even in the United States of America public opinion is changing. That is evident from the huge success of Al Gore’s film, long articles in the big newspapers on climate change and its possible solution, and, most recently, the latest issue of Scientific American on energy without coal.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation what we really need is leadership on the part of the EU. In the United States too, those who desire responsible climate protection look to Europe, and what Europe does encourages them. We must be worthy of this trust. Neither can we be content in the context of international talks with waiting and wasting time. We have to draft our own constructive proposals on what the world should do after 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">Within Europe too, we have to make our own emission reduction commitments and take action in line with the aim to prevent the world from heating up by more than two degrees. We also need to implement our own commitments under Kyoto, and, with regard to that, the emissions trading system is very important. I urge the Commission to be strict. It is not enough that emissions are traded; emissions trading must also result in a reduction in emissions in the way described in the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Business also needs European leadership. So that it can invest wisely it needs long-term emission reduction targets. The wrong investments will become very expensive. The lifetime of a power plant is 40 years. Power plants that are hostile to the climate should no longer be built at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The average temperature is rising every year, and this year, unfortunately, was no exception. That is why last week, Prime Ministers Balkenende and Blair wrote a letter to the Council Presidency requesting for practical action. I quote from their letter: ‘We only have ten to fifteen years to take the steps that are needed to prevent us from going beyond the point of no return’. I should like to find out what steps we can expect very shortly, as time is pressing.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner for the energy efficiency action plan that was published last week, although I should like to add in this connection that the target percentage of 20% is, first of all, too low and secondly, will never be met if it is not combined with reduction targets for the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Doyle and Mrs Corbey have already said, the delegation from this House insists on the climate conference pledging that we finally be admitted to all the meetings that are organised by the EU delegation. Commissioner Dimas knows this and we count on his support in order to achieve this. We are an official EU institution and are therefore just as much entitled to attend those meetings as are the others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that we are proud of the progress we have made so far, but what is the outcome in terms of overall emission reductions? The world needs efficient climate policies that deliver and not unfounded complacency. We all know and agree that we need to move from one-sided EU climate politics to a global front, as only truly global action will lead to efficient emission reductions. Therefore, for the sake of the climate and to really win the battle, let us be honest when analysing the problems arising from the Kyoto Protocol, as well as from the EU ETS preparing for Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that the headlines have already been written: ‘Nairobi was a success and the EU leads the way’. But is this the right way? Understandably for the EU, it is politically important to stand in the front line and to show a good example, encouraging others to follow sooner or later. However, unless the front cannot be widened, the EU efforts will be like taking a few drops out of the ocean or having a haircut to lose weight.</p>
<p class="contents">What makes this especially challenging is the effect that one-sided efforts have on the markets. In the global markets, this means giving the competitive advantage to the polluter, as the cost of environmental investments and emission rights cannot be included in the prices. The temptation is for the international capital of the global markets to be invested where there are neither emission restrictions nor environmental norms. A pollution shift is not a pollution cut.</p>
<p class="contents">Interestingly, the last conference on climate change in Montreal was publicly described as a victory. Looking at the results, however, there is not much reason to celebrate. In terms of emission reductions, not a single step forward was taken in Montreal. There is no implication that the mitigation front would be widened. With the Kyoto Protocol, only a quarter of global emissions are controlled. That is not enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As is the prospect of a countdown to unprecedented catastrophe for further generations if the present unacceptable situation continues.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come for brave and bold decisions that will bring about drastic measures which can secure significant results. The EU has in the past taken a leading role in this field, and the UN Nairobi Conference presents our opportunity and our duty to press for concrete and effective action. We no longer have the luxury of waiting for those who still need convincing, or continuing to tolerate those who simply do not care. In my view at least, the following two points must be included in our Nairobi strategy: firstly, strict emission reduction targets must be set and severe penalties must be envisaged and implemented for those who fail to meet them; secondly, the international community must isolate those countries that have not signed the relevant conventions and are not willing to cooperate in the joint fight against climate change. Here I am referring particularly, of course, to the United States, which alone is responsible for one third of global carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The stance of the USA is represented by the extraordinarily selfish and inconceivably arrogant way the US State Department’s spokesman, Adam Ereli, commented on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by Russia in 2004.

<p class="contents">If Nairobi is a success, it will mean that we have made the right decisions and the right agreements. The Commission recognises the need for the European Union to maintain its leading role in not only international but also domestic efforts to fight climate change. I agree that it is important to assist developing countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and to help them in deploying sustainable technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days ago, the Commission proposed the new Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund. The anticipated total initial funding from public and commercial sources is EUR 100 million. This new initiative aims to boost climate-friendly technologies in Africa in particular. In addition, we have the Adaptation Fund. We hope it will be agreed in Nairobi to make this operational. The fund will be financed by 2% on the proceeds of the clean development mechanism. We expect about EUR 350 million to be available for investments in developing countries and in Africa for the period 2008 to 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union can only be credible in its leadership role when it achieves meaningful reductions in domestic emissions and complies with international commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. The second national allocation plans of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme will be a decisive test. If Member States put more allowances into the European market than companies are likely to emit collectively, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme would fail. Mr Davies said that collectively the first 17 plans notified propose a total allocation that exceeds 2005 emissions of these Member States by about 15%, which is really a lot. I am determined that we shall not permit the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme to fail and the Commission will assess all the National Allocation Plans in a consistent and fair manner. All the Member States will have to contribute to the success of the Emissions Trading Scheme in the period 2008 to 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that we should try very hard with our public relations and the possibilities for influencing our governments, but also your involvement and action is important in this crucial phase of the Emissions Trading Scheme. I would ask you that together we ensure that, in all the capitals of the Member States and in Brussels, this debate on the allocation is about how much more we should reduce, rather than how much more we can emit.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next few days, a communication on the Emissions Trading Scheme should be adopted by the Commission, launching a review of this important scheme. This will address its scope, how to make it simpler and more predictable, strengthening compliance and linking up with Emissions Trading Schemes elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards tackling transport emissions, which contribute to about 22% of the emissions in the European Union, this year the Commission will put forward a legislative proposal to include the aviation sector in European Union emissions trading. Also this year, the Commission will review the possibilities for further reductions of carbon dioxide emissions from cars after 2008-2009, with a view to meeting the Community target of 120g of carbon dioxide per kilometre by 2012. That will, of course, require legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also exploring options for a legal framework in the European Union to allow the safe capture and underground storage of carbon dioxide from industrial installations, provided that that is considered appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also intends to promote adaptation measures, helping the regional and national decision-makers to deal with increasingly evident impacts of climate change. On the basis of a Green Paper on adaptation to climate change, to be launched at a conference in Brussels on 1 December, the Commission will begin a public debate on the need to adapt to unavoidable climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly, we will have to further frame the international debate after 2012. Next January, the Commission is planning to release its energy package. A core part of the package will be the strategic European Union energy review. This will put forward an alternative energy scenario for the European Union that is in line with the European Union’s long-term climate change objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Close to the adaptation of the energy package, the Commission will also be releasing a Green Paper on the European Union’s views on further action to tackle climate change. This Green Paper will respond to the European Council’s request to develop a European Union strategy to limit global warming to 2°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. It will identify concrete proposals, both within the European Union and internationally, for achieving that objective. One of our main objectives will be to bring on board the United States and other fast-developing countries like China and India in a common but differentiated way, as provided for by the United Nations Convention on Climate Change.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will ensure that the energy package and the Green Paper put forward a climate and energy strategy for the European Union that is coherent, coordinated and sustainable. I believe that since last year in Montreal there is a certain new momentum in the international debate on climate change. While we need to keep up the pace in domestic efforts, in the international process we will have to remain patient and continue to build trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that Al Gore has really helped a lot in raising awareness in the European Union and I had the honour to introduce him to a packed theatre in Brussels about a month ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament is your ally, because inland waterway transport must be given a prominent place on the European agenda. Our report has received unanimous support from the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I should like to extend warm thanks to my fellow MEPs, the shadow rapporteurs, as well as the staff for their efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Vice-President, although Parliament backs your goals, we do think that more ambition is called for if they are to be capable of being achieved. In the report, Parliament underlines, above all, the importance of reliable inland waterways. This is, after all, the key to their success and to their expansion. Reliable inland waterway transport hinges on sound infrastructure and transhipment facilities, and the current maintenance backlog of the inland waterways infrastructure in Europe is one of the most urgent problems to be resolved. In this respect, the new Member States, with their specific problems, must receive special attention. Prime responsibility lies, of course, with national or regional authorities, which give too little priority in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">This House also wants to see more funding within the framework of the TENs, especially where priority projects are concerned, and we are still waiting for the appointment of a TEN coordinator. Could you promise that you will come up with a proposal shortly? Parliament would also like greater priority and a higher preferential rate of 20% for all inland waterway projects of common interest, which will make it possible to back many small infrastructure projects, for the bulk of the funds have, so far, in fact been diverted to rail and road, which has to change if we take the NAIADES Programme seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">River information services projects must also be considered for a contribution from the multi-annual programme. This is something Parliament will be voting in favour of tomorrow, and is also what the Finnish Presidency has proposed in the Council. If you can give it your backing therefore, things are bound to fall into place.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is also ambitious where the environment is concerned. We hope that the Commission will present regulations for cleaner fuel as quickly as possible. Last Friday, we received additional information from your offices, for which we are indebted. Clearly, much research has been done, also into the technical and economic impact. The results appear promising, and that is why I should like to ask you to table a sound proposal when the directive is reviewed. It is important not to lose track of the prospect that IWT will be just as clean as road transport. This is also something the sector itself is in favour of. I have read in the paper that the sector believes it could achieve more via the Central Consultancy Register, since the Commission is said not to want to rush things. I hope you will be able to put my mind at rest about this.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said about the innovation fund, which, in my view, is a wonderful instrument to flesh out this fine Action Programme. The sector has good ideas of its own, and EUR 40 million have been set aside in Brussels. This House is of the opinion that the Commission and Council should also show commitment and should match the same amount, so that EUR 120 million would become available. The Council has produced little in the way of concrete commitment, but would you be in a position to convince them? Even more importantly, would you be prepared to make these EUR 40 million available over the next few years? I consider this to be a test case to demonstrate whether you really want to implement the Action Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Action Programme contains various other points we are very happy to endorse: a funding manual, guidelines for state support and the announced screening of existing legislation, which is desperately needed in order to trim down the administrative burden. I should, in this connection, like to draw your attention to problematic environmental legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not for no reason that I have left the institutional issue to last, something for which I have set out a clear course in my report. We must focus on cooperation, take into consideration the current competences of all participating parties and capitalise on the expertise of international organisations. A battle over powers will only have a delaying effect. We must start implementing the Action Programme as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission will also need to show a real commitment to action. By rolling up their sleeves, the Commission will prove that it is really taking inland waterways to heart and only then will the time be right to consider, if necessary – and I am not convinced of this yet – the institutional relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Resolution shows that there is broad agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the promotion of inland waterway transport. Inland waterway transport is safe, low-polluting and energy efficient, and offers great reserve capacities. Despite the advantages it offers, inland waterway transport is under-used: it represents scarcely 6% of the total overland goods transport in the Union, even though, in a few Member States, its modal share stands at 40%.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Europe has 36 000 km of inland waterways. We are talking here about a genuine trans-European network. We need a European approach in order to promote this mode of transport. It can achieve a far greater modal share if, as you just pointed out, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, our approach is accompanied by concrete action.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Parliament for the support that it has given me via this report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool. I am going to confine myself, Mr President, to a few remarks about the main points, starting with the improvement of market conditions. We must develop new multi-modal, innovative services, so as to enable inland waterway transport to play its role among the large seaports and the big cities in the Hinterland. More than 70% of the inland navigation sector is made up of small businesses, often owner-boatmen. We need to create conditions that will help strengthen their position in the market: for example, improved access to funds through the removal of any regulatory and administrative barriers and clear indications as to what State aid is available. The Commission is going to start work on State aid for this sector. These guidelines will be published in 2008-2009. That is all I have to say on market conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the modernisation of the fleet, inland waterway transport must improve its logistical efficiency and its performance in relation to the environment and safety. Innovations must be focused on the construction of boats – for example, the engine and the propulsion system – and on information and communication technologies for what are known as river information services. A regulatory framework already exists, but we must ensure that the system is actually implemented. That also applies to the standards applicable to fuel intended for inland navigation. Stricter standards, which we should propose by the end of the year, will enable us to further improve the environmental quality of inland waterway transport.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the promotion of employment and skills. Inland waterway transport suffers from a dearth of crews and a worsening shortage of candidates to take over businesses. The strategy must be focused on an improvement to onboard working and living conditions and on professional training. I plan to propose harmonising the requirements relating to crew members and to boatmasters’ certificates in 2008 via the mutual recognition procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the image of waterway transport, we must correct the one that inland navigation currently suffers from. We must make people aware of the real potential of inland navigation by implementing a network to promote inland waterway transport, as exists in certain regions.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to waterway infrastructure, there are, within the network, bottlenecks that curb the competitiveness of inland waterway transport. We must therefore remove the existing obstacles. That is primarily a responsibility of the Member States, but the Community can help thanks to the trans-European networks. In this context, the Commission prioritises the development of the two major waterway routes: the Rhine-Meuse-Danube route and the Seine-Scheldt link.</p>
<p class="contents">In the new financial regulation submitted for Parliament’s approval, we have proposed a 30% rate of support for the waterway projects and the inclusion of these projects in the multi-annual programme. I hope that the Council, like Parliament, will support our proposals. The contribution of intelligent transport systems is vital. We are preparing to implement river information services, by which, in practical terms, we mean a system for managing information concerning inland waterway transport, which will enable boatmen to plan their journeys better, to reduce the time they wait at locks and to constantly monitor transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wortmann-Kool, you mentioned the appointment of a TEN coordinator. I must say that we welcomed the positive results obtained by the six coordinators who have already been appointed. Mr Costa, for his part, has also called for the appointment of a coordinator for both inland waterway transport and maritime transport. I can tell you that my intention is indeed to select two coordinators over the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The NAIADES programme provides for a range of very different actions: harmonised legislation, strategic promotion and coordination measures. All of these actions will only be effective, however, if the institutional framework is suitable. The fact is that, today, we are faced with fragmented resources and efforts spread over different levels. We therefore need to adapt the framework to the demands of an enlarged European market. We are in the process of analysing different options. The results of this analysis will be discussed with all of the parties concerned, with the Member States and with the international river commissions.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, we need this NAIADES programme to be a success and, to that end, we need to be able to rely on the support of decision-makers at every level: national and regional authorities, river commissions and businesses. I am grateful to Parliament and to you, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for sending out, with this report, a strong signal in favour of the promotion of inland navigation, which Europe needs now more than ever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Speaking from the perspective of Parliament, we consider this parliamentary report, prepared by Mrs Wortmann-Kool, to be a worthy statement and report on this wide-ranging programme. On this matter our intentions perfectly match those of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">From among the various strategic ramifications, I would like to underline a single issue, that of infrastructure. Recent floods have demonstrated that in terms of infrastructure, and within that, specifically with regard to trying to improve navigability, we have to proceed cautiously in order to guarantee navigation on a permanent basis. Floods render navigation unreliable and unpredictable; therefore, the most important goal of the NAIADES programme is paying close attention to flood control. I would like to stress the programme’s environmental considerations – which require special emphasis – such as the creation and conservation of floodplains. I believe that we have to act with care and in harmony with respect to environmental and navigational requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a brief comment on another point. For the navigability of the Danube, it is important to be able to count on high quality shipping conditions along its entire length. Among the third countries concerned, I would like to highlight Serbia. For Serbia, the value of the Danube as a waterway has increased considerably, and therefore, I suggest close cooperation on this matter among the future Member States of Romania and Bulgaria as well as the Black Sea region. All these proposals are put forward in the report, for which I express my thanks to my fellow Member, Mrs Wortmann-Kool. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Then they will say that transport is only of interest to men. Perhaps NAIADES inspires us, and perhaps the Commissioner should take note and appoint two women coordinators for NAIADES. Let us return to serious issues though, and the report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, we formally support the Integrated European Action Programme for Inland Waterways, known as ‘NAIADES’, and the idea of giving it a greater political profile. It is true, and we have noted this, that the use of inland waterways varies a lot throughout Europe, from 0.1%, in countries like the United Kingdom, Italy, and even a little less in my country, to 40% in the Netherlands, which has a greater number of these waterways. Unfortunately, in some cases canals and rivers have been abandoned.</p>
<p class="contents">Admirable attempts at recovery are being made, however. In my country, due to its mountainous nature, canals and rivers are used more for carrying irrigation and drinking water than for transport, but we nevertheless are aware of and support the initiatives relating to the navigable stretch of the Guadalquivir from Seville to the sea, which is also hoping to be included in the trans-European network. Furthermore, I am also delighted by the current efforts of my city, Zaragoza, which will host Expo 2008 and which, within that context, wishes — and this has been proposed within the context of the objective of promoting water and sustainable development — to restore the navigability of the River Ebro. We are therefore pleased to be able to include ourselves in this European project.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about sustainable development when we refer to inland waterways’ potential to help reduce the impact of CO2 emissions by up to 75% compared to roads and also — and this is why it is so important — to promote this inland waterways network at European level and to support new formulae so that this sector can be more competitive and efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wortmann-Kool has done an excellent job as rapporteur, and we are eagerly awaiting the Commission’s coming proposals to enhance the economic and competitive impact of this new sector. We particularly support the strengthening of infrastructures. That is to say, for thousands of kilometres of inland waterways and hundreds of inland ports, with lock infrastructures, etc., which have already been named, to finally become a connection network that strengthens regional and territorial cohesion. To this end, some of the amendments that we presented in committee and which have been included propose greater inclusion of this sector in the trans-European network programmes. We have also proposed supporting river information services, which we believe will very much increase the efficiency and safety of the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we believe that it is an excellent idea to obtain greater economic support for the sector’s potential for container traffic, although there are still great deficiencies here. In the report on logistics, which I hope to be able to present to this House, I will clearly also include Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s proposals on improving logistical aspects and innovation and technological progress for reducing operational costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has to be said that the greatest deficiency in this area is the lack of intermodal nodes; if transport links – including these means of transport – are to be developed, the first thing to be done is to establish ports and terminals.</p>
<p class="contents">In other transport sectors, innovation has made great strides; here, though, it is limping along behind. There is still a lot of lost ground to be made up where fuels and materials are concerned, and this programme should provide an opportunity for that to be done, but we must also – as my colleague has already mentioned – give very serious attention to the environment, and I attach particular importance to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask you to support an amendment that we have tabled, which has to do with the transport of hazardous goods on waterways, which must be subject to regulations every bit as stringent as those applicable to road and rail, for an accident with hazardous goods on a waterway can do enormous and irreparable damage.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the threat of flagging-out – the re-registration of vessels under flags of convenience – which poses a risk to social standards, among other things, and that is a danger we absolutely must take into account from the very outset.</p>

Nowadays, everyone across the party-political boundaries welcomes the fact that the water-borne transport of goods is coming back into fashion. This consensus conceals different opinions, as was evident in this House during the debate in February 2003 on the subject of the White Paper on transport 2010. To my group, as to some others, water-borne transport is an alternative to ever more and widening motorways. It is a way of being economical with space and the environment. This is in contrast to another view, which wants more of everything, including, therefore, even more motorways.</p>
<p class="contents">By creating overcapacity, entrepreneurs are given more freedom to make fresh choices within this overcapacity to decide which mode of transport is most advantageous to them at that particular moment in time. An example of overcapacity is the expensive Betuwe line that has been built as a TEN project for transport of freight by rail in the Netherlands alongside the rivers Waal and Lek, that are perfectly navigable, at the lower reaches of the Rhine. More pressing projects than these projects that are probably underutilised include the widening of the narrow canals that connect Northern France with Belgium and the Netherlands, or returning the ever dwindling transport across the Danube between Hungary and the Black Sea ever since the bombardments of 1999 back to its original level.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is opposed to overcapacity. Even in the case of waterways, this is at the expense of space, nature and the environment. The adjustment of rivers impacts on flood plains, biodiversity, the supply of drinking water and flooding surrounding low lands. In addition, water-borne transport is not a <span class="italic">panacea </span>that magics away all the risks of polluting and harmful substances. Their transport entails risks not only for the rivers themselves, but also for the residential areas and areas of outstanding beauty that are located downstream. We need more than just cleaner engines and sulphur-free fuel. Together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we would propose infrastructural levies in order to promote fair competition between different modes of transport, a better environmental impact assessment of European development plans, a tightening of legislation for the transport of dangerous substances and preventing inland waterway ships from being put under flags of convenience, because this adversely affects social, security and environmental standards. Only when our water-borne transport meets quality requirements of this kind, is its growth a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the other speakers, I should like to express wholehearted support for the NAIADES Programme. Inland waterway transport can, provided it is correctly backed by flanking policy, substantially contribute towards solving the problem of transport. I am pleased that this message is also being sent to the national, regional and local governments. Both old and new Member States are urged, in their economic and planning policy, to give due consideration to the scope that inland waterways offer in order to meet the transport needs of enterprises, not only for bulkier, but also for slimmer, flows of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the recommendation for active improvements in the fleet’s environmental performance also receives my unqualified support. As in road transport, incentive schemes for the introduction of the reduction of emission and energy-saving measures in inland waterway transport also help make the fleet more environmentally-friendly.</p>

It is a report on the promotion of inland waterway transport. Inland waterway transport most certainly needs aid. This might not be the case in the Netherlands, where the report’s author hails from, but it is certainly true of many other European Union countries, including Poland, my home country. The Oder Programme was adopted a few years ago in Poland, and was initially called the Oder 2006 Programme, but was later extended to last until 2015. However, all these schemes amount to empty words, because nothing is actually being done.</p>
<p class="contents">The virtue of the report we are currently debating is that it sets out to deal with European inland waterways as an autonomous field, and here I emphasise the word ‘autonomous’ which means not treating inland waterways as a complement to road and rail transport, as an unimportant addition to them. Instead, inland waterways are perceived as an independent, autonomous whole. This is very significant, because the forthcoming accession of Bulgaria and Romania will provide a unique opportunity to create a European network of inland waterways.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to tell the House about one of my dreams. It is a dream I think many members of my committee share, and it involves a journey along the old and new inland waterways in Europe. It may be an old-fashioned journey, but it is a very beautiful one. In order to be able to undertake it, however, further significant investment is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is worthwhile recalling a couple of significant ideas that have formed part of the aspirations of far-sighted politicians over the centuries. One of these is the plan for a canal between the Oder and the Danube, which would create a link between two important bodies of water.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the European Commission not to end the studies, but to continue working on a European network of inland waterways. Studies in this field should be continued, and I wish the venture every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This makes inland waterways an important subject for us Austrians, as we are connected by water to the West, to the Rhine-Main-Meuse system that is to be found there, but also, and above all, to the south and east. </p>
<p class="contents">We in Austria know how important it is – not only for our own country, but also for Europe as a whole – to have a better, by which I mean above all better-functioning system of waterways. Although reference has been made to the environment and technological dimensions, and to much else besides, we also know that it is above all for the sake of the new and future Member States of the EU that alternatives to roads are needed, for without them, we really are going to end up as roadkill, and what better alternative could there be than a well-developed and therefore well-used infrastructure in Corridor 7 of the Trans-European Network? I am glad that the Commission is willing to attach greater importance to this mode of transport, and I can do no other than agree with much of what Vice-President Barrot has said today. While, though, we do need plans and programmes to be set out, they also need to be implemented, and as soon as possible.</p>

NAIADES is a means whereby we want to change that. We want internal waterways to make headway in terms of job creation, on the markets, in terms of infrastructure and the fleet as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">These depend, above all else, on the reliability of internal waterways and on the availability of multi-functional inland ports, not least with regard to multimodal transport links, and I would, in this regard, like to do as Commissioner Barrot has already done and highlight the importance of RIS as an important contribution to the use of inland waterways, and would argue that its potential ought to be used to the full by its being incorporated into the TEN programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Back to NAIADES, though. The report on the subject highlights the need for tighter emission limit values to be laid down across the Community, particularly by promoting the use of low-sulphur fuels. So far, so good, but I see it as counterproductive if more stringent emission limit values were to oblige the internal waterways sector, most of the operators in which are, of course, small and medium-sized enterprises, to pay out a great deal of money that they cannot afford for refits, and so we have to work towards incentives, provided not only by the Commission but also by the Member States, for a more rapid introduction of environmentally-friendly engines on ships.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me as important that the planned European Waterway Transport Innovation Fund be established subject to conditions agreed on with the inland waterways businesses themselves, and that the Fund should be able to help with the funding of communications offices.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the Commission’s initiative for the production of information source on financial issues, in the shape, for example, of a funding handbook, what is also needed is a European development plan containing an up-to-date inventory and more detailed information on European waterways, which must draw on existing expert studies and reports, as well as on the experiences gained by the coordinators. It would, after all, be wrong to keep on reinventing the wheel, and, since, additional bureaucracy is undesirable in the implementation of the action plans, we have to take particular care that it is avoided.</p>

<p class="contents">Let us begin by focusing on the innovation fund: the Commission services, together with representatives of the profession and the Member States, are currently looking into the possibility of creating a fund for innovation in the field of inland waterway transport. This fund would be an important instrument for implementing the NAIADES programme. We are examining different options, such as how this fund can be sustained by the inland navigation sector, the Union and the Member States. The Commission will draft a report on the state of play and on the results of the assessments in 2007. You did in fact place great emphasis on this innovation fund, Mrs Wortmann-Kool.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of pollution from ships, it is true, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that we must think about reducing the level of sulphur in the fuel used for inland navigation purposes, but we must not go too far. The idea is to bring this level of sulphur down to the level of the diesel fuel used in road transport. This reduction in the sulphur level is key to reducing air pollution. We are carrying out a review of the directives on air pollution with the aim of substantially reducing this sulphur level. However, I have taken full note of what you said about the investments required to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lichtenberger, you asked me about the monitoring of dangerous transport. On this point, I should like to make it clear to you that a proposal is currently the subject of an interservice consultation and is due to be adopted before the end of the year. As a general rule, the improvement of infrastructure, Mr Meijer, will be accompanied by impact studies, in order to reduce as far as possible any harmful effects of infrastructure works.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, I would say to all of the speakers that infrastructure obviously requires investment. This investment is the responsibility of the Member States. Nevertheless, it is true – and I am addressing you, in particular, Mrs Ayala – that we have proposed in the financial regulation to prioritise inland waterway transport by providing for a 30% cap. May I call for Parliament’s help, Mr President, in adopting this financial regulation? I am well aware that there is some reluctance on the part of the Member States, but I am sure that Parliament will give priority to the inland waterways.</p>
<p class="contents">There are undoubtedly other solutions to propose, but my aim with these few answers was to tell you that my intention was obviously to act. As you pointed out, we, in Europe, have several magnificent waterways, such as the Danube, and I have taken note of your comments about the need to involve all those who live along the Danube. I must say that we are aware, Mr Rack, of the importance of these waterways and of the major role that they can play in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say to you, in the hope that we can carry out this crucial work together and accord Europe’s waterways the full importance they deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have tried to strike a balance between two powerful opposing parties – the business associations and the local government associations – which put forward their no doubt legitimate interests in a forceful manner.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have to say at the beginning of my speech I wish to address to them. What I want to say to the businessmen is that, despite all that we have heard, I want to make it clear that we in this House take it as self-evident that local authorities should engage in economic activity, and, indeed, that returning certain activities to them is reasonable and legitimate. What I would like to say to the local authorities is that invitations to tender, whether at the national or European level, do not absolutely have to be arbitrary, but offer the transparency that is needed to benefit the public and prevent corruption. I get the impression from the debate that their respective associations did not always see it that way.</p>
<p class="contents">I have attempted, by means of my report, to strike a balance that would secure more guaranteed competition for the private sector and would give the public sector, in the shape of the local authorities, more scope for inter-municipal cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, then, we will be deciding where this House stands as regards future mandates for action by the Commission, which – or so my group believes – should, wherever possible, be in the form of legislation. What this is about is the legal and political aspects of the way in which our municipalities organise services of general public interest. That they do, of course, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, which we here in this House also take very seriously; after all, many Members of this House have strong links with local authorities, having been active in municipal politics before they came here.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also, though, asked how we, as the convinced Europeans that we are, would shape the internal market, and there is a plethora of rulings from the European Court of Justice and from other courts at the national level. Complaints and Commission proceedings make municipalities and investors nervous about making investments at home and initiating projects, and so it is necessary for the European Union to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">What, for example, is the substance of European procurement law? What clarifications or additions need to be made to the institutionalised PPPs and in-house transactions? We see ourselves as having the vitally important function of considering how to proceed. My group takes the view that legislation is needed, that it is not enough for the Commission, attempting as it does so to bypass this House, to act by handing down interpretive communications or other instruments of that kind.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore once more appeal today to the Members of this House, when they vote by roll-call tomorrow, to cast a vote for this House’s right to govern its own affairs. We want neither a great laborious enterprise, nor an opening-up of the last procurement directive, which was not transposed in all the Member States – it was not, for example, in Germany – but what we want to see is clarifications and additions, and they must not be made without reference to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be quite frank in saying that we have no solution to the problem of inter-communal cooperation, which was – as you will see from the amendments – the most controversial area. The line we take is that it cannot, as a general rule, be excluded from the scope of procurement law, but nor should it be subject to general tender. What that means is that we need an intelligent solution to this bone of contention, for intercommunal cooperation makes sense for the communities from which we come, and will certainly be useful to them in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">That this House is supportive of this instrument is shown not least by our willingness to use money from the Structural Funds for it; I am sure that it is not common knowledge just how much effort we have put into getting that.</p>
<p class="contents">Given our sympathy for European local authorities and the expertise of my fellow-Members on the Committees for the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am convinced that we will end up with a law that everyone can support and accept, and one that will be proof against rulings from the European Court of Justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time when public budgets are limited, there can be no doubt as to their importance for the European economy. This is particularly true in the area of infrastructure, and especially in that of transport infrastructure, with which I am very familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to guarantee that these partnerships are totally effective and that public money is spent better, it is important to choose private partners on the basis of fair competition. Thus, the choice of private partner must be the result of a competitive and non-discriminatory procedure and must enable the partners to get all of the added value out of such a partnership in the long term. However, many interested parties believe that the regulatory framework that governs which private partners are selected to create these partnerships at Community level is incomplete or unclear.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Weiler’s report presents a balanced assessment of the main challenges that we must take up. You have provided some good answers to the problems presented, Mrs Weiler, and I should like to thank you for your work as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to mention what are, in our opinion, two crucial aspects, which I should like to cover before tomorrow’s vote. I shall begin by talking about concessions and then about mixed public-private companies, which are referred to as ‘institutionalised PPPs’.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, concessions: a concession gives a company the right to use facilities that have been built or services that have been provided in return for building infrastructure or providing a service. The construction and maintenance of roads and airports and waste management are two such examples. In November 2005 – a year ago – the Commission outlined in its communication the reasons why it thinks it useful to legislate on concessions, particularly on service concessions. The aim of this initiative is to guarantee equal treatment and legal certainty in relation to the granting of service concessions – as is the case for public contracts – while making a clear distinction between public contracts and concessions. In this regard, I am sure that Parliament will confirm the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. It remains very clear, however, that the choice of the legislative path should not deprive the public authorities of the room for manoeuvre that they need in order to choose the best private partner and, if necessary, to adjust the concession over time, in line with the objectives targeted by the partnership for the long-term future of the PPP.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, a step by step approach is called for. To begin with, the Commission will look more closely at the costs and benefits of a binding initiative on the granting of concessions and will examine other measures that will enable us to deal with the problems at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the results of this impact study, the Commission will then – most probably next year – decide whether the cost-benefit ratio warrants such a legislative initiative. If it does, then we will prepare a legislative proposal. That is what I wanted to say about concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">We now come to mixed capital companies, namely institutionalised PPPs. Public bodies are increasingly choosing private partners for public service companies set up in conjunction with the public sector. This is what we call institutionalised public-private partnerships. This type of partnership raises some specific questions: should the Community non-discrimination principles be applied to the choice of private partner, as the service provider's fellow shareholder, to the choice of service provider, or indeed to both these levels?</p>
<p class="contents">This question has given rise to some lively debates in Parliament. The main issue is actually whether we should create a new set of rules or whether we should simply make the existing legislation clearer so that we can deal with the problems that arise. The Commission has expressed a preference: for the time being, it does not want to draft new legislation on the matter, and this is for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in most of the Member States, the creation of public-private entities for the purposes of providing services of general economic interest is an altogether new and very innovative opportunity. Non-binding clarifications in this area would enable us to provide the necessary guidelines, without stifling innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in 2004, after several years of intense debates, Parliament, the 15 Member States at that time and the Commission reached a compromise and adopted the current directives on public contracts. Many Member States only implemented these directives this year, and some are working towards implementing them. In order to legislate on mixed public-private partnerships, we need to review the 2004 compromise, renegotiate a new text with 27 – and no longer 15 – Member States and, in the event that a new compromise is reached, once again force the Member States to amend their national laws and their practices in relation to public contracts, even though the current rules are not yet well established. That is why we think that it is better, at this stage, to choose a non-legislative path, just as most of the interested parties are requesting.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the point that I wanted to make on behalf of my colleague, Mr McCreevy, but you would be right in thinking that the Commissioner for Transport is also very much affected by these provisions. I am now going to listen carefully to the various speeches made by the MEPs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all agree on the line we take, although we do have our differences about such things as paragraph 5, which Mrs Weiler has reinserted by way of Amendment 20. In the event of a legislative declaration, we will handle it by way of the codecision procedure, as provided for by Article 251. This was a typical case for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in which we found the exact wording only after a vote during which we had sought out a compromise. We should do things the other way round, and then there will be no differences after the vote either.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the position that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted, I would opt for Mrs Weiler’s Amendment 21, and my personal view is that we should incorporate this amendment, which envisages the possibility of these criteria being incorporated into Community law, and is therefore preferable to Amendment 20.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we would be doing the right thing by sticking to our line according to which there would be no new areas excluded from the tendering procedure, with the alternative route of supra-regional communal undertakings being cut off, and no extension being permitted to in-house businesses. We would, however, like the Commission to clarify the issues thrown up by the ruling in the case of the City of Halle, among other rulings from the ECJ.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want, then, Commissioner, is not only a proposal for concessions, but also clarification of the outstanding legal issues relating to institutionalised public-private partnerships. You, Commissioner, have told us where you stand. That was clear – laudably so by the standards of a Commission that has again and again avoided taking a decision in recent years – and so we will find an agreed solution that will enable us to move on.</p>
<p class="contents">As I finish, I would like once more to thank Mrs Weiler for having done everything she could to achieve an across-the-board position, one that will enable us not only to withstand the rulings of the ECJ, but also to stand firm in the vigorous debates with the associations representing various interests.  </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, public-private partnerships are perhaps the only way that private investment can be involved in creating this infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason I would like to raise just two points. Firstly, as stated in the report, we need a legislative initiative on concessions, including concessions for construction and management. There is a real need for legal certainty and for defining relations between public concessionary authorities and private concessionaires. On the one hand, private concessionaires need to have the guarantee that contracts will be respected for as long as they are in force, and, on the other hand, the concessionary authorities must be able to rely on having fixed- or limited-term contracts, which can then be adapted to production conditions over time and put to the test of competition. These are the two pivotal points on which I hope that the proposed legislation in question will be based.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a need to encourage new forms of innovative financial engineering, such as the guarantee funds already provided for by the regulation on the funding of trans-European transport networks, so that they can be used as leverage and ensure that many more public-private partnerships also prove to be efficient and effective funding instruments for infrastructure which we all need and with which I am sure you are very familiar, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We ought, therefore, to support the use of private money and know-how to promote development, instead of creating obstacles and difficulties. The European Union should give absolute priority to the widespread dissemination of good practice in the area of public-private partnerships. That is the bare minimum. At the very least, the Union should invest in an Internet site, in the 20 official Community languages, which would be accessible to the general public. Such a site would contain a description of the PPP system and its effects. It would also provide examples of model PPP projects, enabling every municipality in Europe to have easy access to accounts of successful experiences. This would allow municipalities to learn from the past and to make use of that knowledge as they plan their own way forward. I call on the European Commission to request such publicly accessible information from the European Investment Bank. The EIB is currently preparing a purely internal, intergovernmental information system on PPPs that would not be accessible to the public in the Member States. This is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, however, all agreed that, as the Commissioner so wisely said, there is no need to tear up existing legislation on public procurement. Public-private cooperation must favour competition and, above all, contribute to new thinking and increased efficiency within the public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must now solve the problem – that being the aim – without legislating more than is necessary. We do not, however, have closed minds on this point and, just as Mr Langen said, we thus support Amendment 21 by Mrs Weiler.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made a request for legislation on concessions, and the Commission has responded positively and quickly to this. We are agreed about respecting the threshold values and about the need for normal legal principles to apply beneath those values where public procurement is not a requirement. We do not wish to reduce the scope for public procurement. Moreover, we unambiguously call on the Commission to propose solutions to the problems that exist in Germany, France and other countries when it comes to cooperation between local authorities, but not to forget less wealthy local authorities that wish to cooperate in sparsely populated areas in Member States such as Finland and Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Commission were not to carry out this task, it could no doubt expect heavy pressure to be placed on it by Parliament. I am convinced that the Commission will do an excellent job of fulfilling this task, and we wish to give it time to consider our views on the Green Paper and to come up with proposals. All the parties concerned should be involved in the continued process. The committee can certainly be of help in increasing the level of knowledge in this difficult area.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraphs 45 to 47 already guarantee more legal certainty and show that local authorities can cooperate. In the future, we shall also have a clearer and more detailed view of how things are to work.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish sincerely to say a big thank you to Mrs Weiler for the splendid work she has done, as well as to the great many other people who have been involved. Thank you very much. We are obtaining a more competitive Europe with greater legal certainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us hope that the text will be adopted tomorrow. It is quite simply a question of protecting the exercise of subsidiarity for PPPs, instruments that are very familiar to our local authorities, and have been for a great many years.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Commission plans to legislate on concessions, which have been mixed up for too long with public contracts. However, I shall state in this Chamber that I believe that legislation is also required for institutional public-private partnerships. It is wrong to say that these are recent entities: semi-public companies have been around since 1955 in France and the <span class="italic">Stadtwerke </span>have been around for a very long time in Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that subjecting them to two forms of competition today means putting an end to them. What private partner would agree to work with a local authority that makes it compete twice over? Furthermore, I would draw the Commissioner’s attention to the risk run by inter-communal structures, which are in danger of being mixed up with private structures even though they are an entirely public means of organisation for local authorities that aspire to be large enough to be able to fulfil increasingly demanding obligations and public-service missions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Competitive tendering is a fit and proper way of determining the most economic way of providing public services, and, over and above that, mandatory Europe-wide tendering does something essential in terms of opening up the internal market to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, Mrs Weiler has done a fine job of steering us, together, through the public procurement dossier – which is a difficult one – in an exemplary way. It is thanks to her that we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have already managed to come up with plenty of workable compromises, so it is only right that we should take this opportunity to express our gratitude and particular appreciation to her, and both I and the other Members involved are certainly willing to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">I have advised my group to hold fast to what has emerged from this vote, and wish only to say something about the few contentious points. In so doing, let me start with institutionalised public/private partnerships, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, the development of which should not be unduly restricted by legal regulation, and it became clear from the public consultation that people do not want it to be.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore recommend that we go no further than an interpretative communication and guidelines that are comprehensible not only by lawyers but also by those who take decisions at the municipal level, which will not only afford greater flexibility than does legislation, but also – and above all – hold out the prospect of a rapid resolution to the legal uncertainties that are very definitely still there. This is where the Commission needs to act as promptly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to inter-municipal cooperation, the second contentious point, I believe it to be self-evident that the municipalities should not in any way be hampered in their management of their own affairs, but equally self-evident, too, that this cannot mean that public/private partnerships should be generally exempted from the obligation to put work out to tender.</p>
<p class="contents">Although public authorities are not obliged to hand over to third parties the performance of functions for which a market exists, should they decide to entrust third parties with the performance of a service, they must be bound by a public tendering process, as is indeed clear from Article 295 of the European Communities Treaty, which requires neutrality in the application of internal market rules to public and private undertakings. That, by the same token, makes cooperation between municipalities possible in principle, albeit subject to the restrictions that are so well stated in what is now paragraph 45 of the Weiler report, namely when cooperation between municipalities is for the purpose of administrative restructuring or where real in-house monitoring is provided for.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might be permitted to add something as I close, namely that people in Europe have had very varying experiences of public/private partnerships, and so I am certainly very glad to see that a start is to be made on an exchange of good practice, which will bring in its train more good examples of working PPPs.</p>
<p class="contents">I might also add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is intercommunal cooperation, in the shape of intercommunal undertakings, that we see as the most important point, and I would like once more to make it clear – not least in response to those who have already spoken – that they have nothing whatever to do with the devolution of functions to third parties, but have to do rather with the municipalities deciding to perform services for the community. It is lack of funds in public coffers and an ageing and numerically declining population – particularly in rural boroughs – not to mention greater critical awareness of the issues and the costs involved on the part of the public, that makes this form of cooperation the best for many local authorities in Europe, and often the only way available to them of modernising the services they provide. So it is, then, that administrative services, water supply and drainage, playschools, schools and many cultural amenities are operated jointly, sometimes, indeed, across borders, examples of which can be found in the pre-school projects run together by French and German communities. Europe should not be putting this sort of thing at risk, but rather enhancing it, so let me therefore commend to the House’s support our Amendment 45, which is a compromise put together by Members from various groups, and which I hope will gain majority support tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point has to do with concessions. I dare say that I am more sceptical about public-private partnerships than are most of you, but I do, all the same, think it wrong to send out the message that public-private partnerships are being promoted and then demand that concessions be put out to tender in the same way as contracts, the performance of which was, of course, the basic rationale for the PPPs being set up in the first place. I do not believe it is merely fortuitous that Parliament and the Council did not explicitly include concessions for services in the directive on the award of contracts, and I hope we will come to agree that what we do not want here is a requirement that they be put out to tender in the same way as contracts. Services concessions are something different and need to be regulated in a different way.</p>
<p class="contents">As for ‘in-house’, what the European legislator really should have done about this was to clarify the conditions. I do not regard a figure of 100% as sustainable. What is needed, I think, is threshold values, and high ones at that, which must then actually be complied with. It is, though, the legislators that should define them and not the ECJ. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These successful projects provide sufficient justification for Parliament to take up the topic as well, and I welcome the Commission’s communication on PPPs, which includes specific proposals drawn up on the basis of public consultation. At the same time I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, on her well balanced report highlighting the need for legal certainty in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Under PPP arrangements, private enterprises transfer their know-how to the public sector. In my amendments, which have been incorporated into the report, I have therefore emphasised the need for establishing transparent mechanisms for private investors. Investors should be given guarantees that their legal and financial interests will be safeguarded for the life of a contract and also that the terms and conditions of public tenders will remain unchanged during their period of applicability.</p>
<p class="contents">Due to lack of experience, the new Member States in particular are apprehensive of using PPPs. Information gathered from the implementation of successful projects will help them to avoid repeating errors and procedures that have in practice ended in failure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that PPP projects will be able to attract the desired capital only if the interested parties within EU Member States are well informed and conform to the quality regulations and transparent rules of the Community. These regulations and rules will help them build up infrastructure, the development of which has lagged behind due to underfunding. This form of cooperation may also prove instrumental in helping bridge regional disparities and ensuring the sustainable development of Europe’s poorer regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The legal uncertainty resulting from the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the case of the city of Halle shows just how necessary it is that legislators should do something about them, and it is surely not acceptable that the Commission should act without reference to anyone else in giving guidance as to the manner in which this problem should be addressed. On the contrary, it is for the co-legislators, namely the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission together, to reach a joint decision as to how we in Europe are to deal with these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to address briefly is inter-municipal cooperation, and this is where I have to disagree with Mr Lambsdorff, for it has been going on for a very long time; there is a very long tradition of it, not least in the Federal Republic of Germany, and it is something we should maintain. Cross-border inter-municipal cooperation is at present a delicate shoot, and one that we must not destroy by declaring that these things should be left to the free market. If they are, we can pack it all in on the spot, for we will have no further need of municipalities, and that is surely not the sort of Europe that we want to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is, as I see it, a clear correlation with the discussion we had about the services of general economic interest, on which we took a decision in the previous plenary part-session. In both cases, it was about the way in which decentralised authorities, service providers and citizens can be given more legal certainty, which can sometimes create conflict between the internal market rules, on the one hand, and the general interest which authorities need to serve on behalf of their citizens, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">It is often the case that the Court of Justice has to be called upon or that the Commission gives interpretations of its own. The important message in both those files has been that we, via the codecision procedure, really want to take political decisions in this area, and that it is also important that we ask the Commission, and really insist on this, to present legislative initiatives on which we can decide in codecision with this House and with the Member States and their parliaments.

Concessions are all too often mixed up with public contracts: the latter concern the purchase of goods consumed by local authorities, while concessions offer public authorities the opportunity to delegate the completion of part of their tasks to a third party. Therefore, we should have a law on these concessions and not a mere interpretative communication.</p>

<p class="contents">I am going to try to respond to some of the questions asked, without claiming to respond to them all. I shall first respond to Mrs Cederschiöld, to Mr Lambsdorff and to Mrs Rühle. When a local authority grants certain services to another public body in return for payment, these are in principle services that have been the subject of a public contract. The public body benefiting from the contract is competing with private companies and possibly with other public bodies offering the same service. A general exclusion of all forms of public-public cooperation from the scope of the Community rules on public contracts and of the rules on concessions would therefore be unacceptable. The Court of Justice case-law is very clear in this regard. Conversely, not all forms of public-public cooperation are covered by Community law. The Commission recognises that clarification is required in order to determine the extent to which Community law applies to the delegation of tasks to public bodies and which forms of cooperation remain outside the scope of the provisions on the internal market. We are working closely with all the parties concerned in order to provide this clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I shall respond to Mrs Rühle and to Mrs Gebhardt on the issue of public-private partnerships and on the ‘in-house’ concept. The ‘in-house’ concept excludes the application of the rules governing public contracts when a public body grants a contract or a concession to a third party over which it exercises some control. The Court has outlined the circumstances in which this derogation may be applied. You will understand that the Commission wants this exception to the rules on granting contracts to continue being monitored. In particular, it seems extremely doubtful that a public contract or a concession would be granted in a discriminatory way to a company that represents certain private interests, while other private companies concerned are pushed aside. That is why we think it necessary at this stage to keep to the current definition of the conditions for application of the ‘in-house’ system: where authorities exercise the same control over the service provider as they do over their own services, and where service providers carry out the bulk of their activities with the authority concerned. For these reasons and also so as not to have to start from scratch with the new public contract rules, which are scarcely at the transposition stage in the Member States, we think it appropriate to legislate on mixed public-private companies and on the ‘in-house’ concept. An interpretative communication is the most suitable means of explaining the way in which the rules regulating public contracts apply to the selection of private partners for these partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Savary, who raised the question about the two calls for competition, I would say that we are aware of this problem and, as you pointed out, I referred to this in my speech. I should like to make myself very clear: we do not require two calls for competition simply because we believe that that is unnecessary. We explained this in the 2004 Green Paper on PPPs and we plan to clarify our position in the texts that we are due to present in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am well aware that I have not responded to all of the questions asked, but I should like now to conclude.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of concessions and of a possible legislative initiative, it is important not to rush things. To begin with, the Commission must look more closely at the costs and benefits of a binding initiative on the granting of concessions, and at other measures suitable for dealing with the problems at stake. On the basis of the results of this impact study, the Commission will then – most probably next year – decide whether the cost-benefit ratio warrants such a legislative initiative and will, if necessary, prepare a legislative proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the message from all those who work in the area of PPP start-ups is clear: they are calling for practical guidelines on the way in which to apply the rules on public contracts to the creation of these partnerships. The Commission intends to provide these guidelines in non-legislative form for the reasons that I indicated in my introduction.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt as to the importance of PPPs for the European economy. I hope that Parliament’s report will help clarify the Community rules on public contracts and concessions so as to offer partners transparent and fair conditions of competition. It has become quite clear to us, in this debate, that Parliament's emphasis was on legal certainty, but you, for your part, will have also understood the Commission's preoccupation, in an area as vital as this for European investment, with retaining some room for manoeuvre, such as to enable it, while guaranteeing legal certainty, to invest more money where it is really needed. Moreover, several of you rightly stressed that these are absolutely vital tools.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, those are the answers that I wanted to give, and I thank Parliament once again for the quality of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At its heart is the principle of the same minimum wage or the same minimum conditions for the same work in the same place, which enables it to establish fair competition conditions for businesses on the ground. If, though, the Posting of Workers Directive is to be successfully transposed, it demands committed effort by all – on every side and at every level.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, at this juncture, to thank those Members who worked with me on this report for their dedication, and, above all, for their inexhaustible patience with the negotiating process, as well as the staff of the committee’s secretariat, in the Tabling Office, of the groups and Members’ private offices, for their dedication and the innumerable extra hours they were required to work.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is a joint effort. It enjoys support right across the groups, and the reason why that is so is that all concerned have met others halfway and arrived at compromises for the sake of the matter in hand. It is out of its commitment to the Posting of Workers Directive that this House repudiates the Commission’s attempts at guidelines limiting the Member States’ opportunities to exercise control, for the Member States have the particular function of ensuring, by means of their control measures, that the minimum working conditions for the posted workers are actually complied with, and they must be able to continue to do so in future, and without exceptions being made.</p>
<p class="contents">Our criticisms of the guidelines will come as no surprise to the Commission, for it is using them for no other purpose than to reintroduce through the back door the substance of Articles 24 and 25 of its original draft of the services directive, which this House had, by a large majority, deleted, and to that deletion the Council consented, for neither employers’ nor employees’ associations, neither governments nor members of parliament, want the freedom to provide services at the price of workers’ fundamental rights. The reverse is true: there is a broad alliance of people who are convinced that this European Union of ours can succeed in combining the two, and that doing so will bring into being what we call the social Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our expectation of the Commission is that it should take seriously February’s unambiguous vote on this report as a guide to how it should proceed. That also means that we expect it to take into account this House’s views when evaluating the questionnaires that it sent yesterday to the Member States. It is unacceptable that the Commission should make demands of the Member States with the ultimate object of jeopardising compliance with minimum labour standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I might also add that the ECJ has made it clear that requirements needed in order to secure minimum labour conditions do not run counter to the freedom to provide services, and that, precisely, is what is made clear in this report. So it is, for example, that it has been demonstrated in practice that, contrary to the Commission’s interpretation, wages documents can also be needed in addition to certificates of time worked in order to secure workers’ right to their minimum wage, and the consequence of that is that, in future, legal counsel will be indispensable as parties in the wages negotiations described in Article 3(8) of the Posting of Workers Directive, or as representatives to make such negotiations possible by being available for the effective delivery of official documents. If the directive is to be implemented, then action will need to be taken to clarify matters in advance and to provide information on compliance with minimum employment standards.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with that in mind that I hope that the commitment of so many to this report will pay off and that the Commission will now, without any reservations, allow ‘the same pay for the same work in the same place’ to be established securely throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The objective is to ensure that basic freedom of movement is upheld for both workers and services, and that the social legislation aimed at protecting employees is complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years on from the adoption of this directive difficulties remain in applying it. First and foremost, workers and employees are insufficiently informed about their rights and obligations. A further problem is the lack of administrative cooperation between countries of origin and host countries, which in turn could be viewed as something of a lack of mutual trust. Lastly, the inspection measures imposed by some Member States have led to fears of protectionism.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorities in the host countries have been granted some right of inspection, although this too has its limits. These inspections must be carried out appropriately, without discrimination, and without obstructing the freedom to provide services within the framework of the internal market. In clarifying this point, the Commission deemed it appropriate to adopt the main principles on 4 April.</p>
<p class="contents">National bodies must provide posted workers and service providers with effective ways of obtaining information on the work conditions applying in the host country. They must also work together in a fair way. In this regard, the Commission feels it must remind the Member States of their obligations, and calls on them to implement more effective resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that the debate in Parliament on the posting of workers has been a complex one, and that a wide range of opinions has been expressed. This demonstrates the difficulty of striking a balance between safeguarding the protection of workers on the one hand and the freedom to provide services on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that in the report on which Parliament has voted, I found many points of convergence with the position expressed by the Commission in its 4 April communication. There are a number of points, however, to which I should like to pay special attention and on which a clear position should be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot agree with the view that the Commission will try to include deleted Articles 24 and 25 of the original services directive by means of its communication. That is not the case here. In its communication, the Commission interprets the law in question, but does not introduce new laws, because communications from the Commission cannot do such a thing, not even formally, as this is a matter of legislative process. This assertion does not correspond to the reality of the Commission’s interpretation. I wish to stress again that in its communication the Commission is not establishing a new law on which to base these articles, but is interpreting current law, which includes significant rulings of the Court in Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">The rulings of the court referred to in the Commission communication prohibit the national bodies from requiring that service providers posted in other Member States have an office or a representative in their country. According to case law, a Member State that is hosting foreign service providers may, in order to comply with the principle of solidarity, stipulate that there must be documentation available at the workplace relating directly to the work concerned, and especially work reports or documents relating to health, safety and work protection in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">In its interpretation, the Commission in no way restricts the Member States’ capacity to carry out effective inspections, and none of the aforementioned articles have that intention. It is my view that the Commission tried very hard in its interpretation to find and understand the true substance and spirit of individual court rulings. The Commission attaches great importance to the proper implementation of the directive and has broadened its scope beyond this implementation. It has already started work on a report assessing the situation a year after publishing its guidelines. To this end the Commission has sent a questionnaire out to the national bodies and the social partners. It has also created a website dealing with legal and practical issues relating to the posting of workers, on which it recently created a forum where every European citizen can offer suggestions and comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, under the aegis of the Commission, a group of national experts has developed principles of best practice, establishing a number of rules in the area of administrative cooperation and a single form enabling us to simplify the exchange of information between contact points. The Commission takes account, of course, of all of Parliament's opinions and the report before us is an important document for the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry to have to say, however, that unfortunately the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs did not take account of what I believe were the main findings which were voted through in my opinion on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. In addition to this, in Group B, we had no opportunity to exchange information on important issues or to discuss them.</p>
<p class="contents">In her report, the rapporteur included many worrying and often contradictory elements. Today, I shall focus on the most significant problems. They are not new problems, and had already been widely discussed during work on the Services Directive. Regrettably, it was decided that the solutions to these problems would not be contained in the Directive, only in the Commission’s Guidance on the Posting of Workers. I believe these guidelines are useful, because they deal with the problems thousands of entrepreneurs encounter daily as they post their workers.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these problems is the requirement imposed by the host country to set up legal representation, instead of simply posting a worker who could act as the employer’s representative. This requirement has far-reaching implications, because setting up legal representation falls under the principle of freedom to establish an enterprise, and not that of freedom to provide services. In addition, it represents a considerable financial outlay for employers.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the host country requires the provision of various quantities of documents is also a problem. In practice, entrepreneurs complain that the host country’s authorities abuse this requirement, insisting on documents that are not relevant to the work undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">The requirement pertaining to the supply of information declarations on the posting of workers represents yet another problem. Some countries insist on receiving this information many months before the start of the posting period, and it is often the case that these declarations are treated as authorisations. Such practices are very burdensome for the service providers.</p>
<p class="contents">The final important issue I should like to draw attention to, and which is often highlighted by entrepreneurs, is the very strict control of Polish enterprises …</p>

<p class="contents">She has also pointed out the useful work done by a large majority of Members of this Parliament during the debate and the vote on the Draft Services Directive. It was useful because, in voting in favour of crucial amendments guaranteeing absolute respect for the competences and subjects covered by the Posted Workers Directive, Parliament safeguarded the vital role that this directive must play at a time when we, in the Union of 25, are witnessing and are going to witness a large increase in the provision of services, as well as a rise in worker mobility. The text also safeguarded – and I believe that this was the unanimous opinion of the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – our powers over the subjects that are rightfully ours.</p>
<p class="contents">A directive that has been understood properly, applied properly and that has properly controlled effects should ensure that the right balance is struck between fair competition and guaranteed respect for workers’ rights. The ground rules must be strict and fair regarding this issue. They must also guarantee transparency and security for workers, in terms of both service provision and freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">For a directive to be understood properly there needs to be a major effort in terms of providing explanations and information and of simplifying administrative matters. A directive that has been applied properly must clearly ensure that the right to free movement and the principles of equal treatment are respected and must pursue objectives relating to the harmonisation of working conditions and of social systems. A directive with properly controlled effects is a major tool in the fight against the anti-European feelings that may be stirred up by the presence in the population of workers who are treated as mere commodities moved about at will and exploited under the most abject conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can tell you at this stage that my group considers this to be a balanced report. Commissioner, with this report, my group would, above all, like to encourage you to take action to get the Posting of Workers Directive complied with on the ground. We do not ask you to review the directive, because the legislation itself is fairly sound, but we all know that in practice, employees who temporarily work in other countries are often brutally exploited, and we think that this exploitation should stop.</p>

This hinders international trade and the free movement of capital and labour.

According to the directive on the posting of workers, the host country is solely responsible for ensuring the protection and the rights of posted workers. To this end, the country concerned is required to adopt measures to prevent minimum standards from being circumvented. This gives rise to genuine discrimination affecting all workers, both the posted workers and those from the host country.</p>
<p class="contents">Reality has shown us that this directive is ignored on many sides, despite countless complaints, either by Parliament, or in reports of specific cases, such as we have issued on a number of occasions. There are still examples of non-compliance that need to be resolved, and we accordingly do not accept the Commission’s proposal to restrict in certain important areas the minimum requirements imposed by the Member States on businesses, which followed on from the proposed directive on the creation of an internal market for services.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, whilst we support the report, we must express our disappointment at the pressure exerted, and the proposals put forward, by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, following their attempts to block clarification of important aspects of the implementation of the directive. They tabled various amendments, for example, aimed at removing points in the report before us, with the attempts at removing Amendment 13 and parts of Amendments 26 and 29 from the report being of particular concern. As far as we are concerned, we want the rapporteur’s work to stand and would urge the Chamber to adopt a number of other proposals aimed at enforcing the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This compromise sounded the death-knell for all hope of equal opportunities on the common market as outlined in the initial draft of the Directive. The European Commission’s Guidance on the Posting of Workers was one element of the deal that might have inspired some hope in the new countries. In presenting today’s report to us, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is aiming to completely do away with even that small and non-binding opportunity. With this report, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is aiming to preserve the complete <span class="italic">status quo</span> concerning the services market, even though protectionism and plain chauvinism are rampant throughout that market.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the European Trade Union Confederation, for example, the benefit of this chauvinism, is that it is worker-related and has been established under the aegis of the unions. Personally, I doubt it has anything at all to do with the genuine good of working people. Essentially, strict administrative and social requirements only serve to deprive people of jobs. That was what happened in the Vaxholm case and also in the case of the Polish company Zojax. Both companies were forced to withdraw from the implementation of projects, and this resulted in losses and redundancies. Swedish trade unionists were very complacent, however, because those made redundant were foreign workers, namely Latvians and Poles. I would remind Swedish trade unionists, and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, that the said foreigners are citizens and companies entitled to their full rights, who had been promised equal rights within the common market when accession took place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the requirements laid down in Article 3 of the Directive are minimal, but does the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs not feel that it is high time to set upper limits for such requirements, both for cases of requirements based on law and for those based on collective agreements? Does the committee not feel that these requirements are usually mere smokescreens for plain and simple protectionism? The requirement to register, to set up legal representation in the host country and to make social documentation available <span class="italic">in situ</span> are all used by the authorities as a pretext for making things difficult. They all serve one single purpose, namely to protect the national market against bricklayers, bakers, wood polishers, and many other kinds of workers who are now, quite rightly, feeling let down. Their expectations concerning equal rights within the Union’s market are being shattered by harsh reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Adopting the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as it stands will send out a clear signal to the Member States, namely that they take whatever action they like on the common services market. It will also amount to going back on the delicate compromise reached on the Services Directive. That is why I am appealing for support for the amendments tabled by a group of Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and from the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, because the report does not deserve our support without these amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I am all in favour of posted workers – but not this way. The report says in paragraph 19 that this will not be achieved by huge bureaucracy, but some 35 out of 49 paragraphs include references to laws, rules, infringement procedures, ECJ cases, enforcement by penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">If this proposal is anything to go by, I am not surprised that the Enterprise Commissioner is behind schedule in his drive to simplify EU laws! For yet again we have a proposal carrying a raft of rules and regulations, backed up with so many references to penalties and infringement procedures that the rapporteur must be at her wits’ end trying to make a proposal which is easy to operate, fair to all, but effective.</p>
<p class="contents">When this was debated a while ago in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Members were horrified to hear cases of blatant exploitation of posted workers. This must be stopped, but what were the Member States doing? What were the trade unions doing? After all, it is highly likely that local workers were also being abused. Were posted workers employed because local workers refused to accept the conditions on offer?</p>
<p class="contents">The key lies in recital L on page 5 of the report, which talks about preventing the circumvention of national standards. Since national standards are emphasised this way, why do we need an EU directive at all? Why is it not left to Member States, if it is their rules that control the situation? An EU directive will be a burden on all sides and produce delays, when all we want is people in work. After all, this is not a new situation. Posted workers did not come about because of the EU. They existed before there was an EU. My own brother, English like myself, was an engineering draughtsman. He became self-employed, took up a contract with Volkswagen and worked in Germany for several years. He had no problems at all, but that was before the UK joined the then EC.</p>
<p class="contents">So I repeat, we do not need this directive. Member States are perfectly capable of managing their affairs within the existing regulations of the European Union – in short, subsidiarity. Do you remember that? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The posting of workers is one of the important issues that the EU must resolve if it is to meet its target of completing the internal market with the free movement of persons and the freedom to provide services on a cross-border basis. I feel honoured to take the floor in front of hundreds of my fellow MEPs at this significant time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication is aimed at liberalising the provision of services and the posting of workers, and removing the unnecessary restrictions and protectionism prevalent in some Member States. Mrs Schroedter’s report, however, takes the opposite approach. The rapporteur places undue emphasis on protecting workers and in turn establishes protectionist measures that work against the freedom to post workers. The current practice places workers from the new Member States at a distinct disadvantage. Businesses from the old Member States are permitted to provide services anywhere in the EU market, as well as in their country of origin. Businesses from the new Member States, on the other hand, are not allowed such access or are subject to time restrictions and a series of administrative barriers and protectionist measures that in reality prevent their posted workers from being competitive and from providing services freely on the market under the same conditions as workers from the host country. In this Chamber we still hear fears expressed about the Polish plumber and all he symbolises.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schroedter’s report rides roughshod over the fundamental values on which the EU was founded, and in no way leads to the achievement of our shared aim, which is to complete the single internal market. I should therefore like to call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As many others have said, this is an important directive not only for freedom of movement but also for the protection of workers. There are quite a number of deficiencies – we know this from the surveys - when it comes to information, cooperation between Member States and the ability to carry out checks.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to state that we are in favour not of protectionism but of open borders. We are in favour of competition on equal terms between companies, but we are also in favour of the equal treatment of workers. That is what we are concerned with here – equal treatment. Some of the Members who referred to the Vaxholm case have left now. That precise case was about the need for Latvian workers not to be treated worse than Swedish workers. They were to enjoy precisely the same treatment – not worse, but precisely the same, treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue on which there has been disagreement between ourselves and the Commission is that of the importance of having a representative. You propose that it would be enough to have a link with someone in the other country with whom to negotiate. That would be incredibly bureaucratic and enormously difficult. A representative must be able to act as a channel of communication in those countries that take care of the negotiations, so it would be necessary to have someone with a negotiating mandate. He or she would also have to be able to communicate with, for example, authorities responsible for occupational health and safety. Anything else would be quite impossible. There is no case law that contradicts what I am saying. The Arblade case was about something else. It was about documents that had to be kept for five years under Belgian law and is therefore irrelevant to what the Commission is saying.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless hope that we shall get this Posting of Workers Directive operating successfully in society. In that case, it will, however, have to include the parts to which I have referred. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because of time constraints, I shall concentrate on the Irish experience only, but it is certainly relevant to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner stated that Ireland has not adopted specific transposition measures and was not conforming to the criteria established by the case law of the Court of Justice. So, apart from all the other difficulties highlighted by the rapporteur – and I do not have time to list them – it seems that we in Ireland do not have the legal certainty to comprehensively enforce this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events in Ireland have shown how much we need full implementation of this directive: with GAMA, a Turkish construction company, ripping off some of its foreign workers; the Irish ferry scandal, where existing workers were simply replaced by mainly foreign workers on half the wages and with inferior working conditions – I might add that this is one of the reasons I support a directive on ferries; and today in Ireland the mushroom industry admitting that some of its members are paying half the minimum wage to their foreign workers.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that it is not just posted workers who suffer: it is all workers, including Irish workers, who will pay a price down the line, as minimum wages will be undercut and suspicion and distrust will replace solidarity between workers. The Commissioner said earlier that it is difficult to protect workers while ensuring free movement of services; but, regardless of how difficult it is, we must do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Posting of Workers Directive was a cause of constant controversy in the past, and has remained one to this day. The country from which I come was not the only one to be unwilling to extend the directive’s scope to cover the economy as a whole, and, in Germany, it still applies only in the building industry and to occupations associated with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to steer the debate on this report towards three aspects of it. One is the emphasis that the rapporteur puts on the need for the social partners to be strengthened if the standards laid down in wage agreements are not to be undermined. That should not, however, be taken to mean that these agreements, reached between the Member States and the two sides of industry, actually do guarantee living wages. There needs to be examination of the degree to which minimum standards actually do meet the need for ‘decent work’ in the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schroedter, with some justification, also points out that it is difficult to distinguish between the employed and the self-employed, but, necessary though it is to define them and clarify the status of those who are termed the ‘putative self-employed’, we should not forget that we are talking here about the people who are most on the margins and earn less than anyone else, that they must be accorded a status that secures them rights, including the right to a fair and living wage.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of the relevant directives to enforce the freedom to provide services is always justified by reference to – among others – the argument that, at the end of the day, there has to be something in it for the consumer. At first sight, the Posting of Workers Directive would appear to have little to do with the protection of consumers, but I am sure that just how much the two are connected will become clear when we gain a sense of perspective, for the consumer’s interest is no longer only in the quality of the goods themselves, and that is why, today, consumers are protected against imported goods produced using child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">The exchange of goods and services is meant to have a social dimension to it, and those who participate in it must be entitled to minimum standards that guarantee them a living, appropriate working conditions and the protection of their livelihood. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We were thereby able to ensure the more effective combating not only of illicit labour but also of wage dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few months, the Commission has sustained losses, and now it is trying to use the Posting of Workers Directive as a back door through which to resubmit the rejected positions, in certain cases – by way of guidelines on which we are allowed to do no more than state an opinion – going beyond what the ECJ has stipulated, and it is doing so by means of guidelines on which we can do no more than give an opinion. That is deceitful and amounts to robbing the people’s representatives of their powers. Guidelines will no doubt be drawn on by the ECJ when arriving at judgments, and they will thereby be made binding in law.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Federal Government, our political parties, social partners, employers’ and workers' associations, will not tolerate the planned restrictions on our posting of workers legislation, and other European countries have similar misgivings. In Poland, for example, there are hardly any Poles to be found on building sites, but instead loads of manpower from non-EU states. Necessary though it is that mobility within the European internal market should be permitted, it is above all necessary that justice and fairness should prevail, and that is what effective controls make possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Every host country must be entitled to demand documents and check employment conditions – such things as income, working time, rest periods, safety and health protection. Those who claim that fewer forms and documents are needed, and that bureaucracy is to be avoided, do not in fact want there to be any controls and are making illegality possible; it must also be possible to serve notices on those who have broken the law, and so the posting enterprises must be represented by persons who are fully authorised under the law of the host country.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Mrs Schroedter’s report; she has included my proposed amendments in compromises. On one point, though, I do not agree with her, and that is with regard to the definition of ‘workers’ which is adapted in such a way that the economically dependent self-employed are categorised as fictitiously self-employed. I hope this position will gain majority support tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What I should like to underline is that we very much considered the problems mentioned by her and by many group colleagues which the new Member States are facing and that we obviously recognise that unnecessary bureaucratic barriers to the free movement of services and the free movement of employees should be removed. I also have sufficient experience, however, of what is happening within the labour market legally, illegally or partly-legally to know that people are indeed exploited and that it is the scope for posting workers across the border that is used to circumvent the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I should like to spell out once again that we must not throw out the baby with the bathwater, but that we must strike a good balance instead; I should once again like to impress on Mr Clark, who is apparently oblivious to how these rules work, that there is such a thing as the principle of subsidiarity, that it is the rules of the working country that apply in labour law, that Member States have complete autonomy in this and that this Posting of Workers Directive is only intended as an exception to this rule in order to cover the situations where employees are posted across the border and are allowed to work under their own conditions temporarily, provided there are a number of minimum protective provisions in place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely because of the control procedures in this respect, and because they are so complex, that rules are needed in order to create scope for monitoring, better scope for labour inspectorates to collaborate, which means that this balance is needed.

There is no doubt that the state of the Union's economy is measured in terms of the state of its enterprises, particularly its small and medium-sized enterprises. The 1996 Directive was mainly intended for SMEs, and aimed to simplify the principles allowing them to compete and carry out their economic activity outside their country of origin. Internal competition is essential if the Union is to cope successfully with competition at global level, where it faces competition from the economies of the United States, China and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for venturing to tackle an issue of such importance for the future of Europe. I have studied her report carefully. Unfortunately, I am bound to say that I fear the document is not quite in line with my vision of freedom to provide services on the internal market, which is so dear to my heart. Having read Mrs Schroedter's draft report, I have come to suspect that its <span class="italic">de facto</span> aim is to make it difficult for companies to post workers in order to undertake a specific task and, accordingly, it sets out to sanction the protectionist practices Member State governments put in place to protect themselves from the effects of competition. I should like to state clearly that I am referring to the positive effects of competition. At the same time, I support the efforts by the European Commission, and the Commissioner's own personal efforts, aimed at ensuring better implementation of the Directive in practice. I hope that there is no reason to change it, or replace it with a new legal act. I trust Commissioner Špidla is of the same opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need an effective directive to protect workers posted temporarily to an EU state. This is essential to prevent a race to the bottom. However, we have a directive that is full of legal black holes and is not applied at all in some states.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the best efforts of Commissioner Špidla, I do not believe that guidelines will solve these failings. Many of our states are resisting the necessary legislative changes. The consequences are scandals of the kind already mentioned, such as the Irish ferries debacle. While ships’ crews are excluded from the posting of workers directive, the Irish Government also resists the implementation of a ferries directive, which would protect those workers.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need a legal framework to effectively prevent a race to the bottom, unfair competition and, indeed, the ugly emergence of xenophobia. We need clarity and certainty on definitions of workers and an end to false self-employment. We need the right to apply clearly established higher minimum standards, sufficient inspectors to ensure compliance and enforceable penalties for failure to comply with EU legislation. I believe, also, that we need protection for whistle-blowers, for those who reveal the abuses that take place under the existing regime.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind those who would criticise the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and myself over this issue that I represent a state that opened its borders to all ten new Member States, fully and freely. We have now been forced to close our borders to Bulgaria and Romania because of the abuse of migrant workers and the consequent effect upon Irish-based workers. This is not an easy question to resolve and it is certainly not an attempt to create protectionism in the 15 ‘old’ Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ability of businesses to post some of their workers to other EU Member States for the purpose of temporary work has made a further contribution to this increased mobility. The experience until now, however, has left much to be desired. In the case of Portugal, the posting of workers has not gone well, especially in the building industry. A number of cases have come to light of Portuguese workers being exploited in Spain, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. This has happened because there is a yawning chasm between the 1999 directive, which strikes a balance between the freedom to provide services and the guarantee of the labour rights of posted workers, and the implementation of that directive on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the fact that Member States have differed in their interpretations of the directive, there have also been differences in its practical implementation, and this has led to more barriers and more bureaucracy, and has slowed down the process. It is abundantly clear that there is no monitoring of the implementation of this directive. Subcontracting is a terrible example of situations that are very common but are not covered by the directive. This has led to an unacceptable watering down of responsibilities, which always – I repeat, always – works to the detriment of the posted workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I support Mrs Schroedter’s report because I believe it is up to the host Member State, in close cooperation with the authorities of the country of origin, to ensure that the employment conditions laid down in the directive are rigorously complied with, for the purposes of increasing the effectiveness of monitoring and of combating illegal practices.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed, therefore is greater transparency and more information on the rights and obligations to be complied with when businesses become involved in the posting of workers. I also endorse Mrs Schroedter’s report because it has become necessary to adopt corrections in order to ensure that this directive is supported, monitored and carried out better and more systematically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in favour of this, but not under just any circumstances and not at the risk of social dumping. Human labour is not a commodity and cannot be subjected to the rules of free competition. We voiced this concern during the debate on the ‘Services’ Directive, and – as you pointed out – Parliament rejected Articles 24 and 25 of this directive, which deal precisely with the easing of the conditions on the posting of workers. The fact is that it is unacceptable for the Commission to undermine this position and to ignore the criticisms voiced by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Directive on the posting of workers has been poorly applied in the Member States and is not meeting its objectives. That may be the case, but should the legislation be relaxed as a consequence or, on the contrary, should more be done to encourage the Member States to apply it? I do not believe that the obligations for declarations and effective controls and the retention of documents lead to pointless red tape when what is at stake is the protection of the social rights of posted or local workers. A lax attitude on the matter only benefits fraudsters. Furthermore, enhanced restrictions and the very threat of financial penalties should act as a deterrent.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I endorse this report and urgently call on the Commission and the Member States to overcome the difficulties in applying the directive, which we do not want to have amended at this stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I regret that we will not deal with both together in November, although that would have been logical and sensible.</p>
<p class="contents">As for our standpoint, there is an important philosophical difference between the approach expressed by socialist and Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fellow Members. We put the focus on strengthening and speeding up the economy, because without accelerating development we cannot create new jobs and we cannot secure long-term financing for the major social welfare systems or safeguard European social values. It will be impossible to make progress towards trying to balance work and family life or towards improving the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises. Consequently, we will not have adequate resources to deal on a European level with the massive downsizing caused by company relocations.</p>
<p class="contents">The question, then, is whether we want to hamper or strengthen the performance of the economy. In the course of the debate on the Posting of Workers Directive, it seemed to me that we want to hamper it, which is not a good sign for the future. To mention only the most striking problem, the requirement concerning company representatives runs completely counter to the free provision of services. In practice, this represents a serious competitive disadvantage. It would require setting up a local framework, which is an expensive, pointless and impractical exercise. This is why I would like to bring to your attention the fact that we consider Amendment 7 to be crucial. Should it not be accepted, we will not support adoption of the directive. Please, take that into consideration when voting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is clear is that the most important features of the Posting of Workers Directive function only to a limited extent – I am talking here not only about the imposition of administrative penalties across borders, but also about the cooperation between authorities. Moreover, the failure to take account of bonuses as an often essential component of wages leads to more wage dumping.</p>

<p class="contents">Very briefly, then. One key question, raised twice in this debate, is that in its communication the Commission tried to reintroduce Articles 24 and 25, which had been removed from the services directive. I wish to point out that this is a mistaken view, because Articles 24 and 25 are based on the country of origin principle, which is the principle that the country of origin is responsible for inspections. This is not in the communication because the communication is duly based on the current legal situation, according to which the responsibility for inspection lies with the countries to which workers are posted, that is to say, the countries hosting the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say that I have noticed in the debate that we agree on the idea that the directive is capable of working at any given time, but it is vital that we step up efforts to ensure its consistent application. The main problem at present is that it is being applied inconsistently, especially in cross-border cooperation between individual Member States. The Commission has taken steps in its communication to address this issue – and I feel that it is our duty to do this as thoroughly and as quickly as possible. I do not wish to issue an opinion on individual cases that have been cited by way of criticism of the directive or the Commission, not because this is impossible but rather because I respect the working time of the interpreters.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a final general remark. In its communication, the Commission firstly interpreted the court ruling in Luxembourg, and it did so correctly. Then on the basis of its obligations as Guardian of the Treaties it formulated a position on a series of issues. Thirdly it proposed, and continues to propose, steps that must be taken to improve the implementation of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to make one last remark. It is a basic principle of due process under the rule of law that any law – in this case the directive – can be used only for the purpose for which it was drawn up. The purpose of this directive is to protect posted workers, not to restrict the freedom to provide services. Consequently, in terms of this general structure and from the standpoint of proportionality, the communication does not restrict the Member States’ ability to carry out their own inspections; nor does it restrict their ability to perform their duties. The fundamental rule of proportionality naturally applies, whereby the obligations laid down must be appropriate to the objective, and cases must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, as in fact the communication indicates.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the attention given to this issue by Parliament. I am convinced that this is one of the most important directives concerning the EU labour market. It is our duty to interpret it correctly and accurately and to put it into practice as quickly and effectively as possible. I should like to thank Mrs Schroedter for her report, because it undoubtedly marks a step forward in the process I mentioned earlier, namely the full implementation of the directive in such a way that it can meet its objective. Honourable Members, thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The main problem of the directive is its enforcement. One of the main obstacles is the need to adjust the definition of ‘employees’ so that a clear distinction is made with the status of ‘self employed persons’ for the purpose of national employment law. Another difficulty is that this directive has not been transposed by all the Member States, nor is it enforced in practice in a number of Member States. Also it is apparent that such workers do not even know their rights and therefore the aim of the directive is not being achieved. I have come across numerous Maltese who were working in other Member States and who have no idea of their rights under this directive.
