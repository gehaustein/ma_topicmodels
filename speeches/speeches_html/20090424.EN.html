I believe that there are basically three problems, which I would like to mention, and which have been drawn to your attention and, above all, to the attention of the Commission in our report.</p>
<p class="contents">As compared with the outset, I can see a tendency on the Commission’s part to pay less attention to what Parliament does and asks, given that in contrast to previous practice we have received almost no reply to the questions that we have asked during the past two reports. I must say that this causes me a certain degree of frustration, since we had all agreed that the issue of the application of Community law was a priority in the ‘better regulation’ agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">We have encountered the following problems: the three fundamental issues that we discussed with the Commission were transparency, resources and the length of procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see that with regard to the new point that we developed together, in other words the issue of transparency, progress has been rather slow and in fact, with the new regulations on access to documents, the opportunity for those who carry out infringement proceedings, or who request that infringement proceedings be opened, to find out why they have been closed or why they have been opened, is decreasing by any standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to talk about the issue of defining priorities: the definition of priorities, respect for and conduct of infringement proceedings must naturally involve decisions which are not merely technical but are also political and here, unfortunately, after the three or four years that we have been working on this point, we still have a problem with monitoring and the transparency mechanism, not only internally in other words, with regard to the Commission but also externally.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to give you a couple of examples, particularly concerning Community law on the environment. We know that this is the main problem in the application of European law, and yet both from the point of view of resources and from the point of view of the priority given to this sector, we are still lagging significantly behind.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most interesting issues, and one which was discussed in the most positive terms with the Commission, was that of the reduction in the time taken by proceedings, through a set of mechanisms that had been put forward and in part agreed with the Commission. On this issue too, however, we have remained at a stalemate due to a certain inertia, which I hope in the future can be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, another issue that we had debated at length with the Commission was the ‘pilot project’: this is a project whereby, when a citizen complains to the Commission, the complaint is forwarded to the Member State so that it can give some sort of response. The assessment that some Member States have given, particularly our Commissioner, Mr Tajani, regarding the operation of this pilot project, is relatively unsatisfactory; the fact that the Commission no longer writes directly to those who have been accused of a possible infraction greatly reduces the capacity of an administration that is guilty, let us say, of this alleged breach, to be motivated to respond.</p>
<p class="contents">Things are always that way: if an Italian ministry department writes to a region, that will certainly be less effective than a letter arriving directly from the Commission. This is the kind of criticism that has been made of the pilot project, but unfortunately the Commission has not given much of a response. Madam President, I reserve the right to come back in the second part of the debate, to respond to the comments that I am sure Vice-President Tajani will make. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the support given by Parliament to the approach it adopted in its 2007 communication entitled ‘A Europe of results – applying Community law’.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barroso Commission attaches great importance to the correct application of Community law, making it a top priority. That is why the Commission has made a special effort to improve its working methods for the benefit of citizens and businesses, as explained in the 2007 communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Previous Parliament resolutions have inspired a significant number of the initiatives introduced in the communication. Firstly, last January we introduced more frequent decision-making in infringement proceedings with the aim of speeding up cases; secondly, we launched the ‘EU Pilot’ project in 15 Member States last April to test a new method aimed at improving problem solving and the availability of information; thirdly, the main purpose of this initiative, which is close to Parliament’s interests, is to better serve the interests of citizens and businesses with regard to questions and problems identified in the application of Community law, including infringements of this law; fourthly, the Commission will nonetheless continue to decide to prosecute infringements in the event of non-conformance within the framework of the ‘EU Pilot’ project, particularly through infringement proceedings; and fifthly, President Barroso has written to the chairman of Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Gargani, with details of the pilot project’s performance in December 2008. This letter also confirmed the Commission’s intention to send Parliament a detailed report on the project’s first year of operation, and preparatory work on this has begun.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from its communication, the Commission also adopted an annual report, which is more political; while it, too, points to the work done over the course of the last year, it also seeks to identify priorities for the application of Community law and a programme to put these priorities into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The report constitutes an important and strategic statement by the Commission on a key aspect of the ‘Better Lawmaking’ programme. One of the aims of this initiative is to provide Parliament with more useful information to form a better framework for the interinsitutional discussions that follow.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has welcomed the identification of the priorities listed in the 2008 annual report, especially those concerning fundamental rights and quality of life. For the first time, the Commission has used its annual report to set more precise priorities for the various sectors. Our goal remains to focus our work more on actions that will yield more effective results in the interests of all citizens and businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The action taken on the priorities identified last year and the progress made will be shown in this year’s annual report, as well as the new priorities for 2009-2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you. I am very interested to hear the contributions to this debate from the various Members, and I will give some answers to Mrs Frassoni at the end of the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think she and I now, over a period of two or three years, have enjoyed working together on this report on behalf of Parliament. That cooperation I have enjoyed; I do not enjoy the fact that we seem to end up every year repeating much the same things and having a certain sense that we are going round and round in circles.</p>
<p class="contents">It ought to be pretty simple, because this is about our citizens being able to see what European law is; when there is a problem, to be able to see what the enforcement process is; and, finally, to see the result of that enforcement. But, as it is, we seem to have to keep trying to invent new mechanisms all the time to actually deal with a process that is already there but is not obvious and is not transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made some progress in that the beginning of the process, in the sense of making EU law understandable, has now been taken on board by the Commission, and I am pleased that we now see, with some regularity, so-called citizens’ summaries prefacing pieces of legislation, so that we can all see – and those we represent can see – where we ought to be heading and what the law ought to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">But when it comes to the enforcement process, we still seem to be in a position where the decision to enforce or not is less than obvious – why that decision may or may not be taken – and citizens are often left wondering. We have recently received a letter from somebody who had tried to get a piece of legislation enforced and is now so disgusted with the whole European set-up, having been pro-European, that they now support an anti-European party.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the point: if we do not get this right, we bring the whole of European law and the whole of our institutions into disrepute. It is as serious as that. All of us as Members, in these last days of this mandate, are spending our time tearing around, going from trialogue to trialogue and first-reading agreement to first-reading agreement, arguing about sets of words, the contents of sentences in legislation. That is great. But if, at the end of the day, it is not enforced in the way that our citizens expect, we might ask ourselves: what is the point?</p>
<p class="contents">All of our institutions have a responsibility concerning the monitoring of EU law. You, the Commission, have the primary responsibility, and I wish in a way that we did not have to have this debate in this style every year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This principle is foundational to the process of integration. There is without doubt a need for continuous, active cooperation of the Commission and Member States in order to ensure rapid and effective answers to doubts raised by citizens and to criticise and rectify breaches in application of Community law. I welcome the declaration of the Commission on closer cooperation with the European Parliament in the area of reporting and application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">National courts play a fundamental role in applying Community law, and so I fully support the Commission’s efforts at specifying additional training for judges, the legal profession and civil servants in the Member States. However, the effective application of Community law is still associated with serious challenges, including widespread delays in the transposition of directives.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important mechanisms which allow us to ascertain how, in reality, European law is applied, is the system of references for a preliminary ruling, the objective of which is to give national courts the opportunity to ensure uniform interpretation and application of European law in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">A fundamental problem with the procedure for references for a preliminary ruling is the time needed to receive an answer from the Court of Justice, which unfortunately is still around 20 months. The reason for this is always the same – translation of the trial dossiers into all the languages of the EU. This takes around nine months. Of course, these translations are extremely important, because they ensure wide access to the latest and most important European rulings and they increase legal confidence in the European Union. However, success or failure in the effective introduction of EU law will ultimately be determined by whichever institutional model is considered appropriate. Having the knowledge and the means is not everything. The will to take action is also needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this respect there are three fundamental issues in which the lack of improvement remains a cause for concern: transparency, resources and the length of procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the new cases of infringement in 2007, 1 196 concerned a failure to notify national measures relating to the transposition of Community directives. It is unacceptable that the Commission should grant itself 12 months to deal with these simple cases, which, apart from the necessity of a quick reaction, do not require any analysis or assessment. The ‘EU Pilot’ project, which was launched a year ago in 15 Member States to test the new method for reaction to complaints, could be extended to the other Member States, but the lack of information on assessment of its operation does not, unfortunately, allow Parliament to comment on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that during this parliamentary term no significant progress has been made with regard to the role that Parliament should play in monitoring the application of Community law. In connection with this a call should be made for prompt implementation of the related reforms proposed by the Working Party on Reform, which enhance Parliament’s capacity to monitor the application of Community law in Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that as a former Member of this House you have experienced the frustration that we have as MEPs regarding the application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, in Parliament, we do have a tendency to take the Commission to task, but I think that we are setting the Commission an impossible brief, because all Community law and all application of Community law is based on indirect application.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the Commission has only a few officials in the central headquarters where it receives some complaints and has some options for action but, at the moment, the trend is to restrict budgetary powers, and so the Commission is not going to be able to act.</p>
<p class="contents">All Community law, and all application of Community law, is based on action by the national authorities: national parliaments, national courts and national civil servants.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, on this aspect, I do not believe that we can demand too much from the Commission. What we should do is to help the Commission, and I think that the report by Mrs Frassoni contains several points that may be useful in trying to make the application of Community law a reality. I am referring to the points on the correlation of national measures with directives, the cooperation of national parliaments and action by national courts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will just give one example. About 20 years ago we agreed to have the four freedoms throughout the European Union. In my constituency there are many people of Italian origin, one of whom is a teacher and, obviously, a fluent Italian speaker. He returned to his family home in Italy and was forbidden to teach in his family’s native country because his training was undertaken in England. That surely must be wrong, but there is nothing that we can do about it because the Italian authorities say – for whatever reason – that this is reserved for Italian nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">The British Government’s behaviour at airports seems to me to be in flagrant breach of most European agreements. Is there something the Commission can do – maybe by making a plea, at the next summit, to our national governments to show a bit of European solidarity? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can see how inadequate the Commission’s departments are; they have neither sufficient resources nor the political will to apply Community law in the most obvious of cases.

<p class="contents">Within the limitations of its obligations in terms of confidentiality, the Commission is working to be more transparent and to publish more information in its annual report on the Europa website and in its correspondence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in the process of developing a joint European Union portal that should help citizens. It is looking at the best way of presenting useful information to citizens and directing them towards the information that best matches their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in the process of finalising its work explaining the principle of State liability for breach of Community law, which could help citizens to obtain reparation in the national courts.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of complaints, the Commission confirms the importance that it attaches to the formalities, to efficient processing of complaints and to keeping complainants informed about the progress of their complaints. It also confirms its desire to find solutions as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to highlight, as has been rightly done by Mrs Wallis and Mr Medina Ortega, the importance of the national courts in the application of Community law. Work is being done by the Commission in several contexts, with national judges, as Mr Zwiefka said, to raise their awareness of the different aspects of Community law and ensure that they have all the tools they need to access the relevant information.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the new ‘European Union pilot’ method, it is not an additional stage in the procedure. This method enables us to quickly examine whether a solution can be found directly and quickly with the parties concerned in a Member State. It was constructed on the basis of the Commission’s practice over the years, adding better commitment from the Commission and the Member States taking part in terms of organising contacts and the results to target.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many specific points raised in the draft report under discussion today. The Commission will provide explanations on the aspects that I am not able to respond to today in its response to the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, with regard to infrastructures, which are also part of my portfolio, I can only welcome the European Parliament’s invitation to ensure that infringement proceedings are dealt with and, where appropriate, closed, as they prevent Member States from investing in infrastructures that could affect the implementation of the European Economic Recovery Plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the common interest shown by Parliament and the Commission in the appropriate and correct application of Community law, in the interests of citizens and enterprises.</p>

It is very interesting that the Commissioner has chosen, out of all the resolution, the point which I, as rapporteur, am least pleased with, but nonetheless I welcome all the things that he has said and the commitments he has made on behalf of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wanted to take this opportunity to point out a few problems which I hope can be tackled by the Commission. The first is a gradual reduction in the independence of the Directorates-General, subject to the combined effects of a legal service that is increasingly reluctant to go to Court and a General Secretariat that is increasingly reluctant to encourage the Member States; the examples that I could give are, alas, numerous.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a real problem of ineffective control of the application of Community law because of a lack of resources: Madam President, in relation to a directive that we have studied in depth, which is Directive 2004/38/EC, there have been 1500 complaints. This is the directive on the free movement of citizens, and there have been 1500 complaints by citizens but only 19 infringement cases have been opened.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, with regard to the pilot project issue, I have already spoken about the problem of a reduction in persuasive force and the fact that the deadlines cannot always be shortened. Clearly, when issues are handled in the pilot project such as pollution that has already been confirmed, rules on hunting that obviously and openly conflict with Community rules, it cannot be claimed that the Member States are taking action, because this only serves to delay proceedings further.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madam President, there is a problem which I consider to be worrying and which is relatively new, and that is the combined effect of the extreme formality, which is continuing to increase, of the replies given by the Commission, and the increasingly arbitrary nature of decisions. Recently, an infringement case was closed for reasons of political expediency – I am referring to the MoSE project. Clearly, when the concept of political expediency becomes involved in a monitoring process that ought to be, above all, a legal one, things can become complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, within our own institution, Parliament, we are faced with very serious problem because the reforms that we are about to debate and to vote on in May include proposals to significantly reduce the powers of the Committee on Petitions. This would be a very serious mistake, because a reduction in the power of petitions means a reduction in the power of citizens, of complaints and of the handling of infringements of Community law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margarita Starkevičiūtė, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold"><span class="italic">−</span></span><span class="italic"> (LT) </span>Today, as the European Union’s economy experiences a period of recession, it is very important to stimulate economic growth. One of the sources of the European Union’s economic growth is the expansion of the common market, which is still very fragmented, especially in the area of financial services. The proposal before us should help solve this problem and establish a common European payment area. In English this is called the Single Euro Payments Area.</p>
<p class="contents">This document already has some history. As soon as the euro was introduced and the currency exchange rates were abolished in euro zone countries, it became clear that prices for cross-border payments still differed from prices for local payments. For this reason Regulation (EC) No 2560 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in euro was adopted and entered into force at the end of 2001. It set equal charges for corresponding local, national payments and cross-border payments and strengthened this principle. The aim of this was to reduce prices for consumers and ensure greater competition in the payment services market.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementing this regulation reduced payment fees; for example, a cross-border transfer of EUR 100 used to cost an average of EUR 24 in the European Union, now it costs EUR 2.50. On the other hand, the document revealed certain deficiencies. For this reason it was decided that it should be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">The document before us is an improved version of Regulation No 2560. What is new in the document? Firstly, the principle of equality of charges for cross-border and corresponding domestic payments has been extended to include direct debit. This was not previously available. Once the SEPA had been created and the Payment Services Directive had been adopted, the payment environment in Europe changed; therefore, it is important that from November 2009 it will be possible to use the popular electronic payment method, direct debit, on a cross-border basis. In order to help create that common direct debit model, the regulation states that in the absence of a bilateral agreement between the payment service providers of the payer and the payee, the level of the default interim Multilateral Interchange Fee for a direct debit will be set at EUR 0.08 for a transitional period until 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">The document also outlines how to improve the defence of consumer rights and remove obstacles to business. It is proposed that Member States appoint competent authorities to supervise the implementation of this regulation, and those authorities should also actively cooperate across nations, so that there are fewer obstacles to business; they could also lay down guidelines on how to assess procedures for determining compliance with the principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Another novelty the revision of this document offers is the proposal to gradually abolish obligations imposed on banks in certain states to provide balance-of-payments statistics and the laying down of other procedures for providing balance-of-payments statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very sorry that an agreement with the Council could not be reached on this point and for the time being the balance-of-payments revision procedures and implementation procedures have still to be defined. Parliament and the Commission have declared that a strict deadline would be set. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">John Purvis, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Madam President, this directive responds to the growing importance of electronic commerce and of electronic money and the need for a clear legislative framework. Its aim is to facilitate the use of electronic money for on-line payments accounts, pre-paid mobile phone accounts, top-up travel cards and gift vouchers.</p>
<p class="contents">E-money is no different from other forms of money in that it stores monetary value and provides a convenient means of exchange. But, unlike account-based payment instruments, such as credit and debit cards, it works as a pre-paid bearer instrument. It is used to cover payments – usually of relatively small amounts – to undertakings other than the user, thus differentiating it from single purpose pre-paid cards like telephone cards. There is no need of a bank account in order to use e-money, so it is particularly relevant to those in society who do not, or cannot, have bank accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">It was all of eight years ago that a Benjamin Cohen, in his article, ‘Electronic Money: New Day or False Dawn?’, stated that the era of electronic money will soon be upon us. Sadly, this prediction was both over-optimistic and premature – for Europe, at least. Electronic money is still far from delivering, in Europe, the full benefits which were expected when the first e-money directive was adopted in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Probably this was because of the high initial capital requirement and other over-cautious restrictions. The number of e-money institutions differs remarkably from one Member State to another. For example, the Czech Republic has over 40 EMIs, or Electronic Money Institutes, while France and Germany between them have a grand total of 12. In fact, two German EMIs were even constrained to move to the UK jurisdiction because of major differences in regulation, even under this directive. In August 2007 – two years ago – outstanding electronic money was only EUR 1 billion, and that compares with EUR 600 billion of cash in circulation.</p>
<p class="contents">So, clearly, e-money has a long way to go to become a serious alternative to cash. However, it is growing significantly, despite the restrictions, and this new directive should enable new, innovative and secure electronic money services to operate, to provide market access possibilities for new players and to foster real and effective competition between market participants. New and smaller operators will have an opportunity to enter the market, as the amount of initial capital needed will be reduced from EUR 1 million to EUR 350 000. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would certainly have preferred less.</p>
<p class="contents">Providers can extend the outlets where e-payments can be made, for example the customer paying for his metro ticket with e-money could also purchase a coffee, a newspaper or a bunch of flowers at the station kiosk, as is already – and very successfully – the case in Hong Kong, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been rushed through the legislative process for a first-reading agreement in order to get this measure enacted before the European elections. I thank most warmly Ivo and Melanie from the Economic Committee staff, the Socialist and Liberal shadows, Mr Pittella and Mrs Raeva, the Commission services and the Czech Presidency, notably Tomáš Trnka and his team, for their very positive cooperation. None of us achieved all we would have wished, but I believe we will have made a significant step forward, and I would very much welcome Parliament’s support for this project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are now only a couple of months away from the final deadline for transposition by the Member States of the directive on payment services. These two measures, alongside the noteworthy efforts of the payments industry to develop SEPA products, constitute a crucial and timely step towards the completion of the single market for payments. These measures, together with the directive, will complete the legal basis which is indispensable in providing clarity, certainty and stability to the market. The negotiations that have been conducted in recent weeks have made it possible to obtain a very rapid agreement concerning these two issues.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the revised regulation on cross-border payments, I am pleased to announce that the Commission endorses the proposed amendment, which has come about as a result of a compromise. The Commission is particularly pleased by the inclusion in its original proposal of articles governing the matter of the multilateral interbank fee for direct debit transactions. The market was looking for these provisions and we consider them to be vital for a timely launch by European banks of the SEPA direct debit.</p>
<p class="contents">These rules will give the payments industry three years to put forward a long-term commercial model for automated debits that abides by competition rules. In a spirit of compromise, the Commission is willing to replace the unconditional removal of these obligations with a review clause, as proposed by Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the revised directive on electronic money, this is a particularly ambitious piece of legislation that will offer a well-received second chance for the establishment of a market in electronic money that will be genuinely useful. The directive aims to provide the market with a clear and balanced legal and prudential framework, removing unnecessary, disproportionate or excessive barriers to market entry and making the business of issuing electronic money more attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">The new directive should promote genuine and effective competition between all market participants, and at the same time ensure equal conditions for all payment services providers and a high level of consumer protection. The compromise reached establishes an excellent balance, fully protecting our initial objectives and at the same time providing an appropriate response to the legitimate concerns expressed during the adoption process. We therefore fully support this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The aims of the Commission initiative are as follows: firstly, to replace the existing regulation in order to adapt it to market developments; secondly, to advance the protection of consumer rights and to provide an adequate legal framework for the development of a modern and efficient payment system within the EU; and thirdly, to achieve an internal market for payment services in euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The Legal Affairs Committee was appointed to submit an opinion to the lead Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In the opinion it was proposed that Member States may appoint existing institutions to act as competent authorities and to utilise or extend existing procedures concerning cross-border payment services. It is important to apply and improve already existing measures and redress bodies to deal effectively with complaints and disputes regarding this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to point out that the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity and especially the extended principle of equality of charges for cross-border payments should comply with the EC Treaty, Article 95(1). Cross-border payments in euro require a Community-wide approach because the applicable rules and principles have to be the same in all Member States in order to achieve legal certainty and a level playing field for all European payments market stakeholders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The regulation, as she has explained very well, responds to the needs that have been perceived as a result of the introduction of the euro, and lays down a relatively clear principle: charges must be the same for domestic payments as for cross-border payments. This is a common-sense rule in an internal market, but one that was far from being adhered to prior to this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation has thus become a launch-pad for the Single Euro Payments Area, to which the rapporteur also referred, and I therefore have some additional observations.</p>
<p class="contents">With time, this regulation has become outdated and it has been necessary to revise it in order to adapt it to the changes on the financial markets and also to the directive on payment services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission set itself three goals in this revision: firstly, to include cross-border direct debits within the regulation’s scope; secondly, to establish procedures for the out-of-court handling of problems that might arise from the application of the regulation; and, thirdly, to ease the balance-of-payments statistical reporting obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has, on the whole, agreed with this approach, but it has made three significant changes: a clarification to the legal definitions laid down by the regulation, a warning or reminder to the Member States that they should comply with the regulation more effectively than they have done in the past and, thirdly, a call for significant cooperation between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern was the issue of balance-of-payments statistical obligations, which has been resolved by agreement between the separate institutions. I can therefore say that I am fully satisfied with the result achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I think that if we consider the reasons why electronic money is less developed here than in Hong Kong, it is undoubtedly because European citizens have become used to using their bank cards much more easily.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has had two concerns in drawing up this legislation: firstly, at a time when the issue of supervision is on everybody’s lips, we do not want to deregulate the supervision of electronic money institutions solely because of the latter’s lobbying. This is why the European Parliament has above all insisted that these institutions that issue electronic money and manage electronic money should be subject to genuine supervision, and I think that we have obtained a number of guarantees in this area. I welcome this.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, we were anxious to take into account the interests of citizens and those who use electronic money, particularly when they want to end their contracts, so that they did not have restrictions and fees imposed on them by the institutions managing electronic money that we would have seen as excessive.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the spirit in which we have supported this proposal, in the hope that it would make our fellow citizens’ lives easier through the use of electronic money, but that this would not result in excesses, particularly in terms of supervision mechanisms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for the EU to improve the internal market in this way by promoting its use. However, I would like to take the opportunity to recall what it is that we are actually talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">When we introduced the euro in a large number of European countries, it was based on the analyses carried out on the value of a monetary union. The value is that we reduce the costs involved in exchanging money as well as other transaction costs. We reduce information costs by having a common currency. The price that we pay for this is to have more unstable economies. It is more difficult for us to maintain even and high rates of employment and to maintain stable state finances. We are seeing this right now as everything is going pear-shaped in this regard in countries such as Ireland, Spain, Italy and Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Take note, then, that the victims should be counterbalanced by the benefits gained in lower transaction costs as a result of a common currency, but the benefits are continually diminishing precisely because progress with regard to the payment system is so rapid. Within a short time, we will be in a position where we find that we have such an effective payment system that the costs have become negligible. Then we will have a common currency that actually only guarantees us instability in our European economy. This is something I have said before and now you can see it happening. I urge you all to reflect on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, it is a positive result and I would like to thank the Council representative Mr Trinka and the Commission representatives for their cooperation, and would also like to thank staff of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who helped to prepare this document. It will answer those questions which were raised by Mr Lungren, that is, it will help to bolster the whole euro area, because the procedures for euro transactions will be strengthened. As a representative of a country, which is not in the euro zone, I am delighted that this regulation can also be applied, if non-euro zone Member States wish, to payments in national currency, which in Lithuania would be the litas.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, in our countries prices for cross-border payments and prices for domestic payments in the national currency still differ. This is partly determined by the fact that we are not euro zone Member States. I think that the first step and one of the steps towards the euro zone would be for us, non-euro zone Member States, to begin to apply this principle to national currencies. The other important thing is that the fostering of cross-border payments by this regulation opens the way to modernising the European banking sector, because banks have a transition period of three years to prepare a new business model, which would make payments more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">This is very important as we often talk about innovations, new initiatives and modernisation. This document creates exactly the right conditions for all this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have opened the door for e-money only a bit wider.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic capital requirement is reduced to EUR 350 000; the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would have preferred EUR 200 000. The own-funds requirement is to be 2% of outstanding e-money funds; we would have preferred 1.6%, but with the 20% flexibility up or down that is allowed, the more liberal Member States can go down to 1.6% and the conservative Member States can go up to 2.4%.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not ideal that we still have the prospect of such an uneven playing field in the European Union, especially when we have insisted that e-money users’ funds will be fully safeguarded and there are also other important user-friendly protections, for example in redemption, as Mrs Berès mentioned. Because of the level of capital required, the waiver level has also had to be set for purely national e-money operators at EUR 5 million instead of EUR 2 million.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, this is a very cautious step forward. It is not perfect. Compromises seldom are. Almost certainly it will have to be revisited in three or four years’ time and, by then, I hope more operators will have entered the business. Users and merchants will be clamouring for more choice. The more doubtful regulators, banks, Mrs Berès – and even the European Central Bank – will have become reconciled that this is a beneficial, user-friendly service which holds no risks to the European economy. We in Europe can at last take up all the opportunities which e-money offers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this, I owe my thanks to the French and Czech Presidencies, the Commission and the rapporteurs from the individual Groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The cooperation in drafting this report was characterised by a spirit of trust and we were able to finish the report quickly, although – and we must think of it like this – the report before us now has significantly changed the Commission’s proposal, less so in the way of content, but more in terms of structure. Many of the details have been reordered. The new proposal was necessary, because a few shortcomings emerged in the application of the 2002 regulation which led to problems in practice. Although the 2002 regulation controlled animal diseases such as BSE, dioxin contamination and the spread of other animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease or swine fever, in order to make further progress in this regard it was vital to lay down requirements with regard to the questions of responsibility, traceability and the end point for slaughter by-products.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also necessary to eliminate the legal uncertainty with regard to the scope of the regulation concerning by-products from wild game. In line with the previous regulations on hygiene issues, operators will in future also be responsible for their products. I have said this already in connection with the other regulations. However, this must not lead to a reduction in official control.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the new regulation we want to increase safety for citizens and not merely shift the responsibility. It is therefore important for operators handling by-products to be subject to approval. The particular operators that will require approval are clearly regulated. The fact that, in addition to a process of approval, there is also a process of registration is due to the desire to reduce bureaucracy. In future, we will certainly have to examine carefully whether the registration procedure will ensure a sufficient degree of safety. I also think that the uncertainty previously caused by the provisions on animal by-products from wild game has been eliminated. It is now clear that good hunting practice is crucial. Game gathered in the woods must not be used. I also think that we have complied with the wishes of many Members in allowing the appropriate feeding of necrophagous birds in certain regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The ability to establish the end point of the life-cycle of by-products is a significant step forward. This will eliminate legal uncertainty and resolve many shortcomings and difficulties. We will have to examine whether the setting of the end point by the European Commission complies with the aforementioned criterion, namely legal certainty. I realise, of course, that it can vary from product to product and for that reason flexibility is needed, but I will also say to the Commission now that transparency is also needed so that it is also clear to the user.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we come to the crucial point, which, for me, is always the issue of comitology. Too many rules in the new regulation are implemented using the comitology procedure. We must examine this carefully. We know, of course, that as MEPs we have the chance to play our part here, but we also know from practice that we are not at all in a position to monitor or examine all comitology procedures. For this reason, I welcome the fact that the Commission has said that it wishes to present its proposals to the Committee on the Environment prior to their adoption. That is a good approach, because there are very many forms of comitology. I believe that we are on the right path here.</p>
<p class="contents">I will make a couple of comments on other topics at the end of the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this time, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, which has made it possible to arrive at this common position, and for his knowledge of the rules in the veterinarian sector that has made it possible to achieve a positive and agreed outcome. My colleague, Mrs Vassiliou, apologises for not being present at this debate in person, but she has asked me to give her personal thanks to the rapporteur for all that he has done and the efforts he has made to achieve the goal.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Commission, we are, of course, also grateful to the shadow rapporteurs, who have seen this this work through in a constructive manner, as the rapporteur stressed in his speech, and through this collaboration it has thus also been possible to incorporate into the common position the chief concerns expressed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Like the rapporteur, I would also like to thank the French Presidency, which did a lot of work, although it was aware that it would not itself attain the final result, and the Czech Presidency, which invested great efforts to obtain a clear and consistent mandate for the negotiations with Parliament. The Commission therefore gives its definite support to the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">This text clarifies the relationship between health rules and environmental rules and thus contributes to the objectives of ‘better regulation’. The rules on which Parliament is about to vote will permit a wider use of by-products of animal origin, which currently cannot be put to any good use, but does so while ensuring appropriate safety conditions. There will also be a reduction in administrative costs, and this will enable operators to be more competitive. All this will be of vital importance in allowing them to respond dynamically to the challenges of the future, whether these derive from imports from non-EU countries or from new technological developments in the use of by-products.</p>
<p class="contents">The new rules will also be fully consistent with the goal of protecting biodiversity and – the most important aspect of all – will make it possible to maintain a high level of protection within the European Union against public health and animal health risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the numerous crises in recent years in connection with products of animal origin that pose a risk to human and animal health, a comprehensive statutory regulation is essential. A revision of the current regulation was necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as before, we need to ensure a high degree of safety. Although we essentially support the report, there are a few points which give me cause for concern. Many points in the regulation have been made less stringent and thus make trade in animal by-products somewhat easier. Let me give some examples of what I am talking about. It is permitted to use certain Category 1 material in pet food. Category 2 or 3 material may, irrespective of the risk associated with it, be disposed of more easily, under official supervision, if there are only small quantities of waste per week. The risk associated with animal by-products of any category is only partly determined by its quantity. It remains the case that it is the European Commission that will enact the implementing regulation and, like its predecessor, the draft contains a lot of authorisations for the Commission. This means that the Commission can lay down comprehensive and fundamental regulations for handling animal by-products in the comitology procedure, with the result that Parliament – as is unfortunately often the case – is excluded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal that we are to vote on now is both clearer and easier to use than the very complicated legislation that is currently in force in this area. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are particularly pleased to have succeeded in gaining a hearing for our amendment to also allow scavenging animals the opportunity to find the food they need to survive. We are also pleased that we have managed to place the focus both on health risks and on safety, while still having the necessary flexibility. Thank you for your work and we are pleased that we have a constructive proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is good that we have had a first-rate expert in the field as our rapporteur on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective of the regulation before us is the guarantee of hygiene and human health and safety. I would now, however, like to mention another detail, which is important for protecting biodiversity and small-scale entrepreneurship in nature tourism in my country. I am pleased that political consensus was found within Parliament and also with the Council of Ministers to resolve this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">This is about small-scale operations which take the carcasses of dead animals on farms with livestock, in pigsties for example, directly to feeding sites in the country for wild animals to feed on. This is important, for example, in Spain, to maintain the wild bird of prey population. In Finland such practices saved the white-tailed eagle from extinction back in the times when its natural food supply was too contaminated owing to chemical toxins, and when white-tailed eagles would not have been able to breed just by surviving on natural food sources.</p>
<p class="contents">In the northern, very sparsely populated parts of Finland, nature photographers use this method to attract wild animals to places where they can be photographed, and small travel companies also organise bear watching safaris, for example. I am very glad that this legislation would provide a solution which would safeguard human health and safety but also preserve small-scale tourism entrepreneurship and the use of the method to protect biodiversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank our rapporteur, Horst Schnellhardt, for his excellent work in accommodating all our concerns and also for the excellent outcome of his discussions with the European Council. Personally, I regret the removal of the reference to the Waste Incineration Directive, but I do not have time to expand on that here.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like confirmation, both from the Commissioner and Horst Schnellhardt again in his winding-up words, that my concerns in this area are taken care of and that this particular use of animal by-products will continue without any disruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission will prepare the implementing provisions for the new regulation in the light of your comments today, we will listen attentively to the experiences of operators, we will talk with our partners at international level and we will be fully transparent with Parliament during the whole of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">I can thus confirm to the rapporteur the commitment already made by the Commission in relation to comitology and the optional provisions. Regarding the question raised by Mrs Doyle, I wanted to say that the current regulation already recognises the particular food needs of certain wild species and allows the Member States to use by-products for feeding wild animals, provided that the health risks are appropriately controlled.</p>
<p class="contents">However, recently it has been stressed that the Commission should step up efforts to preserve biodiversity. For this reason, the Commission agrees with the decision by the legislator to extend the terms on the feeding of animal species protected in their natural habitats with by-products of animal origin; whereas the current rules refer to vultures and eagles, the new regulation will also make it possible to find appropriate solutions for wolves and bears.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of recent experience, we are also considering the advisability of laying down arrangements which would go beyond the current system of fixed points for the feeding of protected species with animal carcasses, particularly for extensive breeding systems, provided that specific health standards are abided by. On this point, the Commission is ready to enter into dialogue with all the parties involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that one would already need to act extremely illegally in order to be able to mix in this material. We will check whether a more stringent regulation is needed here. What we wanted to achieve with this new regulation was to enable the by-products of slaughter to be used in many ways and in that regard I can also say to Mrs Doyle that your concern is unfounded. Everything is the same as before. By establishing the end point for slaughter by-products, we have also very clearly stipulated that they will then become subject to totally different provisions, in other words we have clearly indicated the transfer to the Waste Framework Directive. I believe that we are on the right path here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention that we naturally also want to address the issue of the rotten meat scandals with this new regulation. We are not completely on the right path yet in this regard, but with the labelling and the guaranteed traceability, I believe that we are heading in the right direction. Of course, we now need to see what sort of labelling the Commission will propose. This will not be particularly easy, as we all know the problem of the blue Chappi dog food – no one wants that. In this respect, we definitely need our researchers to choose an approach.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of organic fertilisers, which was also up for debate and has not yet been properly discussed, the Commission actually intended to provide for more thorough mixing-in of the material so that the animals did not even notice it. However, that would result in a change to the quality of the fertiliser and I believe that we have formulated a good regulation in this regard and that our small-scale gardeners who like organic fertilisers so much can also be appropriately provided for.</p>
<p class="contents">By and large, then, this is a good regulation. I am very happy with it and with the cooperation, and I hope that we will not have to amend it again too soon. The cooperation with the Commission was very agreeable and for that I am very grateful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women’s human rights and dignity cannot fall victim to pre-electoral negotiations with Islamic fundamentalists. The international community present in Afghanistan must put much more pressure on President Karzai and the Afghan authorities to come up with proper laws which respect the human rights of women, and policies that are committed to enacting those rights and respect their dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Shia family law, the delaying of the Afghan media law, which was passed by the Afghan Parliament months ago by two thirds of the Parliament, is a tool by President Karzai to continue control of the state media, vital propaganda ahead of the presidential elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community cannot allow this to go on. This law is fundamental to ensure that there is freedom of expression and of the media in Afghanistan. Without that, anything that we are doing in Afghanistan is not worth it. It is crucial that action is taken on these two laws and that the international community makes sure that the authorities in Afghanistan abide by their commitments, by their words, in terms of human rights, and respect in particular the rights of women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is appalling to believe that, at the beginning of the 21st century, a country that wants to be a democracy and wants to abide by its international commitments can have a law that limits the rights of women.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I believe that in our debate, and in everything that we do with Afghanistan, we have to be very careful how we approach things, because Afghanistan is a country that has come through a violent, repressive religious dictatorship; it has endured years and decades of civil war; it is a society in which people, more than buildings, have been hurt and destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be very consistent in our messages, but we also have to be very careful in how we phrase those messages. We should call on the Afghan authorities to take a look at the law, to revise it and make sure that it is entirely in line with the international commitments of that country, as well as its constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not use this as an election opportunity here for us in Europe but as something that we can pass on to our colleagues and friends in Afghanistan to make sure that they can fulfil the obligations that they have voluntarily undertaken themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case we have to assist President Karzai and the Government of Afghanistan in revisiting this law and making sure that it is in line with international commitments and the constitution. It is part of our dialogue, and we have to be absolutely firm that no measures should be adopted that impede the rights of women.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree entirely with what Ana Maria Gomes has just said. But let us be very careful because, when we deal with a society that has been so traumatised, it is far more important how our messages are heard there than how our messages are understood here. Let us be very consistent in that and let us call on the Commission and the Council to pass on this message via all of our assistance programmes to the government and authorities in Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the same time, Afghanistan is promoting legislation that applies solely to the Shiite population and that clearly discriminates against women in the areas of marriage, divorce, child custody, inheritance and access to education.</p>
<p class="contents">This is completely schizophrenic. What Afghanistan signs up to in Geneva, it cannot reject in Kabul. By taking part in the Durban II conference, Afghanistan has made firm commitments to eradicating multiple discrimination. It is imperative, for its credibility, that it starts taking action now.</p>
<p class="contents">By refusing to pass this law, the minister of justice and the president would be showing their will to commit their country to complying with its human rights obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality between men and women is clearly enshrined in the Afghan constitution and in international conventions to which Afghanistan is a party. The authorities have a duty not to give in to extremism in any way and not to retreat. It is ultimately the future of a society that is being decided through this draft law, and Afghan society has already expressed its desire not to remain excluded from these debates.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are fighting and deserve all the support and all the protection of their country. It is up to the authorities to meet their obligations and demonstrate their ability to fulfil their commitments, and to the European civilian forces on the ground to support them in this ambitious reconstruction, and to set an example.</p>

<p class="contents">The first argument is self-protection for the world outside of Afghanistan. Since 2001, the United States has lived in fear of new disasters if al-Qaeda were to use the territory of Afghanistan to prepare attacks once more. This is, therefore, about the self-interest of other states. This objective has largely been met.</p>
<p class="contents">The second argument, however, pertains to the position of the people of Afghanistan. It was the intention to free them from coercion and backwardness. The argument touches on the freedom of the press, the rights of religious minorities, individuals’ freedoms and, in particular, the protection of equal rights for women. For years, international news about Afghanistan has been dominated by stories about how girls were going to school again, women were no longer required to wear a veil, how they were now able to live as equal citizens, independent of their husbands, and how more and more women were entering the world of politics. The invasion resembled a feminist project.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, we can see that the events in Afghanistan more or less mirror those in Chechnya. Both countries were run by fundamentalist Islamic groups, something which external forces wanted to put an end to in both cases. A monstrous alliance was formed in both cases, one by the Americans, the other by the Russians, which means that, in a bid to control a particular group of Islamic fundamentalists, agreements are concluded with other Islamic fundamentalists. The upshot is that the pursuit of freedom, which was an important justification for the invasion, has been sacrificed in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">In Afghanistan, women are more and more being pushed back into the position they were in under the Taliban regime. Girls no longer go to school and women are disappearing from the political scene. There is now even a law that protects the right of men to sexual gratification without any say from the women involved. This is tantamount to rape. Meanwhile, journalists are now also being threatened with the death penalty by the State. This is a dead end. Europe should refuse to lend any more support to this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite the divisions and differing views on armed intervention, and regardless of the positions that have been taken, we cannot allow the situation to deteriorate in this way with regard to women’s rights.</p>

It related to a warning of the impending Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which then actually occurred a few months later.</p>
<p class="contents">Since that time, this country has had a terrible history of suffering, and we ought to ask ourselves the question: what is Afghanistan? Firstly, it is in many respects a very ancient tribal society, which we cannot catapult into the 21st century in one fell swoop. Secondly, it is a country that attaches a great deal of importance to its independence, which it protected against British and Russian imperialism with a huge amount of effort. Thirdly, it is a country that suffered a lot during the 20th century and, as a result of a rather questionable intervention – this I say quite openly – by Western powers, is currently in a situation in which it has a president who many people there do not feel to be their own.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very difficult mixed situation. In order to ensure that there is no misunderstanding, Mr Cappato knows that I am not one of the so-called ‘realist politicians’, I am, as far as human rights are concerned, not open to compromise. We must uncompromisingly oppose this law and the oppression of women. However, we must proceed in such a way as to succeed and so as not to create the impression that this is a form of external control. We must therefore find partners in this multi-ethnic society in Afghanistan and gradually build a modern society there.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we must support a political concept for Afghanistan rather than a purely military solution, as has been the case thus far. Therefore, the law needs to be revised. On this, we are totally unwilling to compromise, as we are paying out a great deal for this country in which we have a military presence. However, we must do this in a way that involves the Afghans and that respects their dignity, and as a top priority this of course includes – whether some people like it or not – the dignity of women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In November 2002, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament sent a delegation under my leadership to Afghanistan in order to make sure that women were not being excluded in the reconstruction of the country. We held talks with President Karzai, numerous government representatives, women’s and human rights organisations, and we were very encouraged. An awakening to more in the way of safety, stability and prosperity for women, including without the burka, seemed to be within reach. The health system, education, training and the chance to earn a living were opened up to women after the Taliban rule. The highest child mortality rate in the world seemed to be improving. Through our intervention, a 25% quota for women was included in the new constitution for the first parliament that was to be elected and around four million refugees returned to their war-ravaged country.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, very little has happened in the last five years. Warnings from women’s rights organisations, such as <span class="italic">medica mondiale</span>, that violence must be stopped seemed to go totally unheeded, and at the beginning of April the radical Islamic Taliban in Kandahar murdered the German-Afghan women’s rights campaigner Sitara Achikzai. We were forced to discover that other women had been shot, such as the highest-ranking police officer. We must not sit back and watch this happen and do nothing about it. The civilian awakening is at serious risk. We must put a stop to this new Shia family law.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament resolution must state loud and clear that the law must be thrown out. If that does not succeed, international support for Afghanistan is also at risk if women’s rights are not respected. Either an awakening into the international community, which respects human rights, or regression into oppression by the Taliban is what is on the cards. This must be said loud and clear to Mr Karzai! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mothers do not pass on to young women the fact that camomile can be used when bathing a baby, because of its disinfectant properties. All too often the mothers have simply been murdered.

<p class="contents">The joint resolution is right to refer to the Afghan Constitution and the international agreements ratified by Kabul, which all claim equal rights for men and women and gender equality before the law. The real position of the women of Afghanistan tells a different story, however. In summary, the position of Afghan women can, roughly speaking, be outlined in 12 brief points, namely an average life expectancy of 44; a high death rate during childbirth (1 600 per 100 000 childbirths); only 14% of all women over the age of 15 can read; a low status, because women are owned by men; a frequent and increasing number of threats and intimidation of women in public roles, including murder; hardly any protection of Afghan women’s organisations from the local authorities or foreign troops against targeted attacks; it is the family that decides, in the main, whether girls can be educated; persistent attacks on girls’ schools – for example, in November 2008, eight schoolgirls and four women lecturers were mutilated in the town of Kandahar by the Taliban spraying acid in their faces; the continued threat of sexual violence in and outside of marriage; approximately 57% of all girls are married off before their 16th birthday; crimes committed against women are hardly reported for fear of retaliatory action by the family, tribe, perpetrators or even by the police; and self-mutilation, and even suicide, by Afghan women on account of their hopeless situations.</p>
<p class="contents">This depressing image of the position of Afghan women, which only scratches the surface, underlines the ultimate need to turn the paper reality of the legal status of Afghan women into a national, international, but also European political priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly this law makes it harder to distinguish, in terms of modernity and respect for women’s rights, between the elected Afghan Government and the Taliban terrorists against whom it is fighting.</p>
<p class="contents">The law also makes it hard to justify the international community’s massive military and financial assistance to Afghanistan. I feel very uneasy about soldiers from my country, the United Kingdom, dying to defend a government that panders too much to extremist and obscurantist sentiments.</p>
<p class="contents">To his credit, President Karzai has said this law will be repealed, but it has taken a great deal of international pressure, including this resolution from our Parliament, to get us to this stage. Also the repeal of this law should not obscure the fact that women in Afghanistan continue to suffer lack of schooling, injustice and discrimination on a daily basis. There is still a very long way to go to bring Afghanistan fully into the modern world and hold it to its binding international commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For many Afghan fundamentalists the place of women is in the home, and not at school or at work. An example of this is the law approved recently by both chambers of the Afghan Parliament and signed by the president, which states that only with the consent of their husband or father do women have the right to go out of their homes, study, apply for a job or receive medical care. In addition, the law gives legal custody of children exclusively to fathers and grandfathers. Fortunately, this law has not yet come into force. As a result of numerous protests, both in Afghanistan and from abroad, the draft law has been referred to the Afghan Ministry of Justice so that the conformity of the text with the constitution and international treaties can be verified.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should demand strongly that the Afghan authorities revoke this law, which without any doubt contravenes the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. In addition, we should make a clear call for the Afghan Ministry of Justice to abolish all other laws which discriminate against women. The European Union, as a community, must express support for all those who are fighting for women’s rights in Afghanistan, so that we do not allow the destruction of all that has up to now been achieved in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This act blatantly contravenes the agenda which we are promoting in Afghanistan, all the more so as the majority of NATO countries have announced that they are going to step up their involvement in the effort to bring stability to Afghanistan. The military aspect of the international presence in this country is certainly very important, perhaps even decisive, but this involvement is not only about guaranteeing peace and infrastructure investments, but also about a much more complex project: modernising Afghan society.</p>
<p class="contents">Who are we building schools for, when Afghan girls are discriminated against and not allowed access to education? No one is, of course, assuming that the new Afghan society should be a copy of Western societies, but we cannot let ourselves turn a blind eye to abuses and human rights violations in the name of respecting local cultural identities.

<p class="contents">We are closely monitoring the political developments on the ground, through our delegation and with the European Union special representative and the representatives of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We naturally respect the independence of the legislative process in Afghanistan, in particular with regard to the Constitution, which does indeed make provision, under Article 131, for the possibility of legislation devoted solely to the Shiite community. Nevertheless, along with our partners we have supported an approach targeting certain articles of that law that are scarcely compatible with the Afghan Constitution or the international law that the Afghan Government has signed up to.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union therefore made a representation to the Afghan Government on 12 April. In our representation, we specifically reminded the government of its obligations with regard to international conventions on civil and political rights, discrimination against women and children’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We pointed out that the proposed legislation would to a large extent prevent women from fully enjoying their rights and from participating fairly in the economic, social. cultural, civil and political life of Afghan society.</p>
<p class="contents">It is likely that the international reaction and the reaction of Afghan civil society contributed to the Afghan Government’s decision to refer the legislation back to the minister of justice for a general review, with the latter being focused in particular on Afghanistan’s obligations in terms of international law. It goes without saying that this review will be conducted entirely under the authority of the Afghan Government. In view of the political background of this country, it is essential that its government assume its responsibilities in full within the framework of the legislative and institutional process.</p>

In countries afflicted by the scourge of civil war, a permanent state of conflict or massacres, the consequences of this situation are catastrophic from a humanitarian and development perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, it is all the more important that legal judgments are enforced because this court is establishing a series of important precedents in international law. It is not only the first court of this kind set up in the same country as where the events being tried took place, but it is the first which has indicted and convicted, in the person of Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia, an African head of state still in office at the time when the trial started.</p>
<p class="contents">These aspects, combined with the recent conviction of three former rebel leaders from the civil war period, are strong indications of the determination of the international community and Sierra Leone Government to fight hard against the feeling of impunity displayed by those who have committed atrocities for an entire decade.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must fully complete the implementation of the project proposed for reinforcing the process of justice and law in Sierra Leone. The Court’s mandate comes to an end soon, in 2010, and the Sierra Leone Government has been totally frank about not being able to ensure that the sentences passed will be enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital therefore for the European Union and its international partners involved in the peace process to uphold and support the enforcement of the sentences passed by the Special Court. It is not only the progress towards peace and stability in the region which depends on this, but also the credibility of the Special Courts set up with the support of the international community in other countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia has paid an immensely important role in bringing justice to a region torn apart by a series of savage wars. Similarly, a tribunal in Tanzania has been prosecuting those responsible for the Rwandan genocide of 1994.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore know the potential of such courts to help war-torn regions by ending a climate of impunity and moving on. In many ways justice delivered in this way is as valuable as financial assistance from the European Union. That is why the international community should continue to support the Special Court for Sierra Leone by providing secure jail facilities in the Member States, if necessary and when required, for jailing convicted tyrants.</p>
<p class="contents">One of my proudest achievements in this Parliament was my role in this Parliament’s resolution calling for Nigeria to hand over Charles Taylor to the Court, which is what eventually happened through the mediation of the UN. But there are plenty of others who will escape unpunished without a robust and well-funded special court for Sierra Leone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Special Court for Sierra Leone has of course set a precedent, as has already been mentioned here. It has set a precedent in that, as the resolution states, it is the first international court to be funded by voluntary contributions, the first to be established in the country where the alleged crimes took place and it was also the first court – as has already been pointed out – to indict a former head of state.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, not only because it constitutes a precedent, but also because it is a benchmark for other courts that have been created and modelled along the same lines – such as the courts of Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, Cambodia or Lebanon – we consider it vital that this resolution, on which we have now been working together with the court for several months, be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years ago we adopted a resolution to support its funding, since at that time the Special Court was going through a difficult period, was without any funds and did not have the necessary support – and here we should thank the European Commission too, which gave the court its financial support.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are asking, above all, for two things: firstly, that those who have been convicted should serve their sentences – what is at stake here is not the operation of the Special Court, which will conclude its work next year, but the legacy that it is to leave us – and, secondly, obviously, that all this should be accompanied by more funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the Special Court for Sierra Leone is a fine example and a benchmark for all of us and for all courts that have dealt with war crimes. It is a fine example and a benchmark and it is a lesson being given to us by the second-poorest country on the planet: as we entered the court, we saw the slogan ‘no peace without justice’. That is exactly why we have a moral obligation, not only as Europeans, but as human beings, to ensure that the legacy of this Special Court leaves its mark on history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is very relevant to today’s debate, which, above all, is about financial support for the Special Court for Sierra Leone. It is true that we are in the middle of a crisis, and the Court, which is maintained from voluntary contributions made by various countries, absorbs large sums of money. We must not, however, allow this body, which is the only one of its kind, to end its work in international disgrace – and it would be a disgrace, if for financial reasons the Court ceased to function and the accused were released.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, and especially, in my opinion, the United Nations, are obliged to carry the work of the Court through to completion, to ensure financial support and to carry out the sentences handed down by the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the Court and its high costs are the subject of much controversy in Sierra Leone itself, because a great many people there are waiting for compensation, and Sierra Leone is one of the world’s poorest countries.

The Commission certainly supports the country’s commitment to the consolidation of peace, stability and, above all, democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the Commission recognises and welcomes the vital role that the Special Court for Sierra Leone has played and continues to play within the context of the reinstatement of peace and stability in Sierra Leone. We are convinced that the Special Court’s activities can transmit to all the message that no serious crime against humanity, no genocide and no war crime will remain unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">The Special Court for Sierra Leone has, in fact, played an essential part in the development of international law, by virtue of the case law that has been created on issues such as the recruitment of child soldiers and forced marriages, which were the subject of the Special Court’s first judgments. To this end, the Commission has been supporting the Special Court’s activities since 2003. We have given the Special Court EUR 2 700 000 through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. The aim of this funding is to support the activities of the Special Court on communicating its objectives of promoting the rule of law, international humanitarian law and human rights in Sierra Leone and the region of western Africa as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in 2008 the Commission adopted a project, funded by EUR 1 million, under the 10th European Development Fund, conceived together with the Special Court and the Sierra Leone Government. The project, which is to be carried out during 2009 and 2010, will integrate previous activities and sets out to ensure a lasting legacy on which to rely after the conclusion of the Special Court’s activities, in particular through the capacity-building of legal professionals and the strengthening of institutional capacity within the Sierra Leone legal system as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Having been informed of the Special Court’s budget problems, in 2008 the Commission provided it with emergency aid to the tune of EUR 2.5 million, funded from the Instrument for Stability and intended to cover the funding costs, and chiefly the salaries, of the Special Court’s employees. On this point, the Commission was pleased to learn that the Special Court has managed to cover the budget deficit for several months. We are confident that, despite the world financial crisis, the international community will manage to find the resources necessary for the Special Court to carry out its tasks successfully and in full, and to complete the trial of Charles Taylor, former president of Liberia.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I conclude, I would like to express my support for the request for further examination and investigation into the roles and functions of the various special courts, and on this point I am pleased to inform you, on behalf of the Commission, that two initiatives are to be funded in this sector under the human rights ‘conflicts and security’ heading within the Seventh Framework Programme on research. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are neither.</p>
<p class="contents">In my trips to Iraq, I have heard Kurdish, Sunni, Shia, Christian, Turkman leaders and others complain about the role of the People’s Mujahedin as a tool of Saddam Hussein in the 1988 Anfar campaign, which culminated in massacres such as Halabja. That is what the Iraqi delegation which was here this week also confirmed to us, while assuring us that the Iraqi constitution binds the Government of Iraq to fully respect the human rights of the residents of Camp Ashraf, who, with the help of UNHCR and ICRC, wish to leave for Iran or any other destination, or wish to stay as political refugees abiding by the laws of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">We must understand the reluctance of the Iraqi Government to let Camp Ashraf continue to be a nuisance to their good neighbourly relations with Iran. For Iraqis, Iran cannot be wished away. It is there. It is a powerful neighbour. It is true that the People’s Mujahedin are no longer on the terrorist list, but they are still an opaque cult which brutalises those of its members who wish to defect. Above all, the people in Camp Ashraf are human beings whose human rights have to be respected, irrespective of the fate of the organisation itself or of its past. They are to be treated under the 1951 Refugee Convention and no one – I repeat, no one – should be forced to return to Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us make one thing clear. This resolution is not about the Iranian regime, which has been repressing its people, mismanaging the country and destabilising the Middle East for decades. Anyone who presents a vote for the PSE and Green amendments, which aim to balance the tone of this resolution, as a vote for the Iranian regime, is either arguing in bad faith or has simply run out of arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of our amendments is quite simple. We want to present the whole picture of human rights violations and threats in and around Camp Ashraf. For example, we request that all Camp Ashraf residents be allowed to be interviewed by the ICRC and UNHCR at a neutral location and without People’s Mujahedin officials in attendance, in order to clarify their real wishes. Also we must call on the Mujahedin leadership to stop controlling the lives of the residents of Camp Ashraf, namely by not letting them leave the camp. Above all, we express our concern about the reported practices of mental and physical manipulation and severe human rights violations within the cult. In short, this is about the individual human rights of the people in Camp Ashraf. Let us have these people and their human rights in mind when we vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Three thousand five hundred Iranian men and women, members of the democratic opposition to the fundamentalist regime in Iran, live there completely defenceless. In the last few weeks they have been under pressure and harassment by the faction of the Iraqi Government under the influence of the Iranian regime, and there is a high probability that at any moment a tragedy could happen that would parallel the ones we witnessed in the Balkans not so long ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We all remember Srebrenica, and I have no doubt that no Member in this Chamber wants a second Srebrenica in Iraq. Our motion for a resolution is a call to alert public opinion all over the world before a disaster takes place. Unfortunately, some colleagues have tabled amendments that could increase the danger for the residents in Camp Ashraf and provide the Iranian regime and its proxies in Iraq with arguments to massacre them.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently visited the camp myself and I assure you that the allegations included in the amendments tabled are absolutely unfounded. People in Ashraf are there on a volunteer basis. They are free to leave whenever they want and they live in the best friendly relations with the Iraqi population of the region. The intention of our motion is to protect these people. Nobody would understand – but if these amendments are adopted the result of the motion would be exactly the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a political issue, colleagues: it is purely humanitarian and it is very urgent. I beg you to vote against all amendments tabled to this joint motion supported by these four groups and support the motion as it has been agreed by these four groups that are of very different political stances. The lives of many innocent and harmless people depend on your vote. Please do not let them down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It relates to the dispute over the Mujahedin or the MKO. This is not a democratic opposition. I would like to say a few things about it. The MKO is a degenerate organisation, which is tantamount to a religious sect and which severely oppresses its own members, including within the camp. Mental and physical pressure is used to force the members to stay in this camp. Those who refuse have their relationships destroyed, they are forced to divorce and their children are taken away – one of the most brutal means of oppression.</p>
<p class="contents">The MKO has totally isolated all MKO members living inside and outside the camp. All access to the international press or media is prohibited. All of the interviews conducted by the US took place in the presence of MKO cadres, which meant that the people could not talk about their real problems and concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, MKO members from northern Iraq were handed over to Saddam Hussein’s henchmen and were shamefully tortured and killed in camp Abu Greib. These are just a few examples and explanations for the joint amendments which I urge you to support. Anyone who rejects these – and I want to say this very clearly – and anyone who adopts the present resolution text unchanged, is voting in favour of allowing the MKO to carry on its policy of oppression in a camp that it controls. You will then also be partly responsible for what the MKO is currently threatening to do, namely that if the camp is broken up under international supervision, it will call on its members there to incinerate themselves. That is clearly the opposite of what we want to do here and therefore I urge you to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by the PSE and my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That dictatorship not only forces the inhabitants to live in conformity with its religious standards but also tries to kill everyone who does not conform to its system. The consequence is that many Iranians have to live in exile, not only in Europe but also in the neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">After the Anglo-American military invasion in Iraq, the Iranians who live there in exile got a guarantee of protection from Iran. Now the foreign troops are preparing to withdraw from Iraq. I support this withdrawal, but an unforeseen consequence could be that the theocratic regime in Iran would get an opportunity to attack the opposition outside its own borders. It strives for the deportation of those people to Iran in order to kill them. Inside Iraq there is much solidarity with the Iranians in exile. However, the power of Iran in Iraq has grown because the majority of the inhabitants in Iraq, too, is Shiite Muslim.</p>
<p class="contents">Through written questions to the Council I have drawn its attention to the position of the 3 400 people living in Camp Ashraf. The only answer was that the Council had not discussed this matter. Today, we are discussing a very important urgent resolution on Camp Ashraf. In two previous resolutions in 2007 and 2008, our Parliament confirmed the legal status of the Ashraf inhabitants under the Fourth Geneva Convention. Today, our Parliament is paying special attention to the current situation by adopting a resolution only on Ashraf. This text is a joint text, adopted by most political groups, and it is balanced. It wants to send a strong message to the Iraqi Government that the rights of these 3 400 people in Ashraf, including 1 000 women, cannot be violated because of the pressures of the mullahs in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">So we must send a united message, without amendments that would undermine and weaken this resolution, which only covers the humanitarian issues of Ashraf residents. We have to avoid any changes to the final text of the resolution that would complicate the situation or endanger the lives of these defenceless people.</p>
<p class="contents">The inhabitants of Ashraf were bombed by US forces at the beginning of the invasion in 2003. Later on, they were screened by the USA. The Iraqi Government has also screened every one of the people in Ashraf – this took place during April this year. Every one of them was interviewed, outside Ashraf. They were encouraged and urged to leave the camp or go to Iran. Only six of them agreed to leave – six out of 3 400 people! So we have to respect their decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Together with a delegation of four Members of this House, I visited Camp Ashraf in October last year and met with American, Iraqi and UN officials there. They all reinforced our concern for the legal status of Ashraf’s residents, because its security was transferred from American troops to Iraqi forces at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation has got much worse since then. The Iranian supreme leader, in an official announcement at the end of February, asked the visiting Iraqi President to implement the mutual agreement to close down Camp Ashraf and expel all its residents from Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then Iraqi forces have started a siege around the camp. Iraqi troops have been preventing entry of families of Ashraf residents, parliamentary delegations, human rights organisations, lawyers, journalists and even doctors to the camp, and do not allow many logistical materials to get into Ashraf.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament therefore found it absolutely necessary to address this as an urgency issue at this stage. We have now worked together with all groups and produced a common text, which is well balanced and addresses all our concerns on this matter, and calls on international bodies to find a long-term legal status for Ashraf residents.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately there are some amendments tabled by some of the spokesmen for Tehran, those who believe the lies told by Tehran. I think we should understand clearly that these are contrary to the security of the residents of Ashraf and we should vote against them. We urge all colleagues to stick to the joint text and reject any amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was therefore questionable if they should have remained on the EU banned terrorist list.

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> I am now going to speak in French. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission regularly monitors the development of the situation in Iraq, particularly in relation to Camp Ashraf.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, in January 2009 the Iraqi Government took back control of that area. With regard to the humanitarian situation in the camp, the Commission has been informed by the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organisations that have been monitoring the development of the situation that no significant deterioration in living conditions or any breaches of international conventions have been reported.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission entirely agrees with the view that the closure of the camp should be within a legal framework, and that the lives and physical or moral well-being of its residents should not be threatened. International humanitarian standards should be applied, not least the principle of non-return.</p>
<p class="contents">On several occasions the Iraqi Government has said that it is prepared to treat the residents of the camp decently and that it did not have any intention of illegally deporting the members of this organisation or forcing them to leave Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the Commission nevertheless stresses the need, as always, to respect the rule of law, and is counting on the Iraqi Government to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">When they met with the Commission in March 2009, the Iraqi authorities reiterated their commitment to respecting international humanitarian standards and not using force, and in particular to not conducting forced returns to Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iraqi Human Rights Minister is currently holding individual meetings with the residents in order to establish their rights and determine whether they wish to return to Iraq or leave for a third country.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent weeks, some members have chosen to leave the camp and have been able to do so without encountering any difficulties. The Commission supports these efforts. If the residents of the camp wish to leave, the Iraqi Government must authorise them to settle in another country and facilitate the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, in cooperation with the representatives of the Member States on the ground, will continue to monitor the progress of the situation.</p>

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to two very important facts regarding the report. These reports have been compiled for years, but the Council has not even once yet included these reports on its agenda. I think that it would be very important for the Council to make Member States aware of the content of this report. This would help, to a large extent, to also make the Council’s and other institutions’ discharge procedure work successfully. This is why I am suggesting that the postponement of the Council’s autumn discharge procedure should only be accepted, provided that the Council also puts this report on its agenda. This would be extremely important to ensure that the Council also accepts those regulations which are pending and would guarantee transparency in the spending of European funds. I would like to express my sincere thanks to those who helped draft this report, including the shadow rapporteur and those who submitted the proposed amendments. We adopted this report by consensus in the Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title18"></a><a name="creitem18"></a>

But once again I have to draw attention to the fact that we should be leading by example in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about energy efficiency, we should make sure that we put our own House in order.

But we also have to understand the unintended consequences of our actions sometimes, and if we seek to crack down too much on lower-tax regimes and lower-tax areas, rather than just driving money from one country to another, we will drive much-needed capital, much-needed innovation and much-needed entrepreneurship out of Europe altogether. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with the comments that have been made about tax competition being a good thing. I think it is a good thing. I think anybody who looked at this independently would say it is a good thing. People often say, well, isn’t it easy for you – you have 12.5% corporation tax in Ireland, and I say, well why don’t you have a 12.5% corporation tax in your country, if that is the problem? But there is an issue here, and we need to put down the marker about tax evasion. That is a criminal offence, and we really have to ensure that we do not become too close to those who practise these types of evasions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen in the past where bad regulation and bad practice have brought the financial world.

The PPE-DE did not support Amendments 17 and 54 which were passed in committee, because it agreed with the Commission proposal – we are opposed to the introduction of intra-state markings, because they represent a barrier to the internal market and we agree that Member States should eliminate all national references demonstrating conformity other than the CE mark.</p>

Like everybody – and you all know this – as a Member of the European Parliament they immediately think a number of things. Firstly, that you are on the gravy train and you do not really care about ordinary people, and secondly that Europe is not working: there are too many regulations. Maybe in some cases they are right – there should be a cost-benefit analysis of what the regulations are – and they are badly implemented, in fact not uniformly implemented across the continent.</p>

I think we all agree, at the moment, that we are all members of the European Union and we should abide by Community law, because we have been through the due process, the debates and legal processes.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we need better monitoring – I think we all agree – of the application of Community law. So when I have constituents in London and cheesemongers complaining to me about the fact that they have had to invest lots of money to make sure, for example, that the facilities they use to sell cheese meet EU standards that have been gold plated by British civil servants, and then they travel across to other Member States and see cheese being sold openly in street markets and melting and they wonder about the application of Community laws in other countries, it is time for us to show that we are strict about application of Community law right across the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He knows perfectly well that, unfortunately, it is the governments of the Member States who decide on the seats of the institutions and, unfortunately, under the chairmanship of the former leader of his party, John Major, at the Edinburgh Summit in 1992, they imposed a legal obligation on the European Parliament to have 12 part-sessions a year in Strasbourg.</p>

<p class="contents">The link that people have repeatedly attempted to make between members of the Iranian resistance and terrorism is unjustified, as newspapers, politicians and courts have been able to prove. On the contrary, the situation in Camp Ashraf is in the public domain and numerous people, including members of parliament and journalists, have visited the camp and drawn their own conclusions. The residents of Camp Ashraf are protected persons under the Geneva Convention. For these reasons, the signal sent by the European Parliament is vitally important: the Camp Ashraf residents have a right to be protected and not to be handed over, under any circumstances, to the Iranian regime. This is a question of the most basic respect for human rights. We therefore hope that this resolution will bear fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have one point to make about the Iranian regime. It is vital that the errors made at the start of and during the intervention by the United States’ allies in Iraq are not now compounded by errors made on their exit. If, at the end of this process, the Iranian fundamentalist regime has reinforced its influence in the region, in particular by controlling the internal affairs of Iraq, then that region will be further away from peace and the world will be facing a greater threat. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I constantly emphasise that people with disabilities must be treated just as people without disabilities are treated.

Of course, this method is not new. The repressive mechanisms of the bourgeoisie have a rich history of criminal activity against communists and social fighters for whom this classification was used in order to label them as being dangerous to ‘public order and security’. Today, on the pretext of ‘terrorism’, they are hauled in again from the darkest ages in the history of the bourgeoisie in Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">The objective is to reduce the negative effects of plant protection products as much as possible by reducing the risks. In order to measure this we need indicators and in order to develop these indicators we need reliable data, determined by statistics, which ensure comparability between Member States. That is why I voted in favour of the report. However, we must not forget that only those who market the products in accordance with the regulations will provide data. Up-to-date reports on the Europe-wide illegal trade in pesticides indicate that this needs to be brought more firmly into our sights. The same applies to the importing of products from third countries. We need to step up our controls in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Our stringent European approval procedure guarantees the comprehensive protection of people and the environment. Anyone who sells or uses plant protection products without approval and anyone who does not adequately check residue limits not only creates avoidable risks, but also brings the manufacturer of the product and the agricultural industry into disrepute. Existing law provides a sufficient level of protection in this regard. However, it must be complied with and monitored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The shadow rapporteur Zita Pleštinská deserves our applause. It is thanks to her professional experience and diligence in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection that the current version is of a professional standard. Through harmonisation and the CE mark for batch production there will be simplification and reduced costs particularly for small firms. The disparate requirements of the 27 Member States will no longer apply. The CE mark of conformity for batch production provides a sufficient guarantee that products conform to European standards. Harmonisation is not necessary for prototypes and one-off products. Only if construction products are imported into countries where there is an earthquake risk, for example, will they have to fulfil the requirements for those specific conditions as well. I appreciate the Czech Presidency’s support for this version. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The core subject-matter of Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 is cross-border transfers and cross-border electronic payment operations. The regulation was adopted on 19 December 2001 and its aim is to ensure that the cost of a cross-border payment is the same as a payment made within a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Up until 1 January 2006, it applied only to transfers, withdrawals from automatic teller machines and to payments made with a debit or credit card up to EUR 12 500 in EU countries, whereas, from that date, the amount has been increased to EUR 50 000. This change has led to a fall in prices and greater competition on the payment services markets. Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 also has drawbacks, however, such as the failure to define ‘corresponding payments’ and the failure to include a review clause, and it is necessary to take action on these points immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by saying that we are in favour of the proposals to update and amend Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001, since it is our duty to make cross-border payment transactions easier and more economical. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The merits of this text are that it proposes a method that is based more on risks and controls, and makes the regulations on animal by-products and the legislation on hygiene more consistent, while also introducing additional rules on the traceability of animal by-products.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also tell you that Mr Schnellhardt’s previous report on the hygiene of foodstuffs (2002) had a very positive impact by making the European game sector aware of its responsibilities.

Such crises can also have a wider adverse impact on the socio-economic situation of farmers and the industrial sectors affected, including a decline in consumer confidence in the safety of animal products. Disease outbreaks can also have adverse consequences for the environment: disposal of the bodies and biodiversity. We needed to review the regulation on animal by-products (ABP) not intended for human consumption from a legislative perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">This will therefore resolve problems linked to differences in interpretation of the scope of the regulation and the problems caused by this, such as: distortion of competition and the different levels of protection against the risks to public and animal health; ABP classification based to a larger extent on risks; clarification of derogations (e.g. impact of ABPs on research, disease outbreaks, natural disasters); reduction in the administrative burden by eliminating the duplication of permits for certain types of economic units.</p>

No longer are there solitary powers, independent economies or dispensable globalised countries. On the contrary, those countries experiencing much worse conditions than these ‘victims’ of the crisis, but which have not been involved in globalisation, as is the case with most of the African countries, still have their problems and remain outside the solution. That is the problem to which no solution is being given.</p>
<p class="contents">The other lesson of these times is that the only alternative to the market economy is a market economy that functions better. That is the road to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must underline that the capacity to respond to the crisis very much depends on whether or not there is the capacity to reform national economies and create conditions of flexibility. At the same time as responding to the financial crisis, we need to respond to the paradigm shift in the world economy.

<p class="contents">On the fiscal measures currently being envisaged by Member States, it is important to continue with sensible, balanced approaches which also do not add up to protectionism.</p>

It is clear that the biggest threats come from two directions: nuclear weapons that are in the hands of undemocratic regimes which are answerable to no one and the irresponsible use of civilian nuclear resources. The Non-Proliferation Treaty is the right framework where we have addressed these concerns and which we can continue to build on.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted in favour of Mrs Beer’s report and I would like to stress that the importance of this document is due precisely to the obvious need to increase the use of nuclear energy for civilian purposes. We are well aware of the problems that arise from a lack of energy independence. We are also just as aware of the contribution of nuclear energy as a clean form of energy to the battle against global warming. Nowadays, the only way to generate clean energy on a large scale is to use nuclear.

However, we reject the implication that the EU should replace Member States as the major actor in the process. Only two EU members are nuclear-weapon states (NWS), with an additional four participating in NATO nuclear weapons sharing. We do not support the proposal that the UK should dismantle fissile material production facilities. The report also pays insufficient attention to the danger of proliferation by terrorists and rogue states, as opposed to retention or replacement of weapons by the existing five NWS. Several amendments would have considerably worsened the report, including the proposal that the EU should become a ‘nuclear-weapons-free zone’.

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 11 and 12 December 2008, the European Council approved the European Economic Recovery Plan submitted by the Commission in November. The Plan includes immediate budgetary measures amounting to EUR 200 billion, which comprise on the one hand measures at Community level amounting to EUR 30 billion and on the other hand national measures worth EUR 170 billion. Besides these measures there are also a number of priority actions which the EU should undertake within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, the aim of which is to adapt the EU economy to long-term challenges, to boost potential growth and to carry out structural reforms.</p>
<p>The ECOFIN Council has always put a strong emphasis on close coordination of the steps taken by Member States in response to the current economic situation, including steps in support of the financial sector, where it has been necessary to take account of possible cross-border effects of such measures (see the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of 7 November 2008), or in the case of fiscal stimulus measures (see for example the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of 2 December 2008), the coordination of which is essential for ensuring a greater impact on the EU economy and a greater boost to confidence on the markets.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 19 and 20 March 2009, the European Council evaluated the method for implementing the Recovery Plan: the overall level of budget support, including the discretionary measures of governments and the effects of the automatic economic stabilisers, amounted to 3.3% of EU GDP (more than EUR 400 billion), which will help to boost investments, support demand, create new jobs and steer the EU towards a low-carbon economy. However, there will be a certain delay before the actual effects of these measures on the economy become apparent.</p>
<p>As far as measures at Community level are concerned, the December meeting of the European Council supported the idea of rapid measures by the European Social Fund for supporting employment, directed especially towards the groups of citizens most under threat. These measures should include more advance payments and the simplification of procedures. The European Council also called for the simplification of procedures and faster implementation of programmes financed from the structural funds, with the aim of boosting infrastructure investments in the energy sector.</p>
<p>In accordance with this, several amendments to existing legislation have been drafted. Firstly, there is draft Council Regulation (EC) No 284/2009 of 7 April 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund concerning certain provisions relating to financial management. This draft should speed up access to financial resources.</p>
<p>Secondly, the draft regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund, concerning the eligibility of investments in energy projects and renewable energy in the housing sector, should enable all Member States to boost investment in this sector. Finally, there is the draft Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1081/2006 on the European Social Fund, which aims to extend the types of expenditure eligible for contributions from the ESF. The objective is to simplify administrative procedures and expand the range of funded projects.</p>
<p>At their informal meeting on 1 March 2009, the Heads of State or Government also emphasised the importance of measures based on the use of existing instruments such as the ESF in respect of mitigating the negative impact of the financial crisis on employment.</p>
<p>At its meeting of 19 and 20 March 2009, the European Council expressed confidence in the ability of the EU to solve the financial and economic crisis. It reviewed the important fiscal stimulus measures currently being implemented in the EU economy (in excess of EUR 400 billion), and emphasised that joint action and coordination was a fundamental component of the European strategy for economic recovery and that Europe was doing everything necessary to restore growth.</p>
<p>The Council also emphasised its role in the efforts to shorten and mitigate the recession in the European single market. It emphasised the need to restore credit flows to companies and households and agreed on accelerated agreements concerning legislative proposals negotiated to date in relation to the financial sector. In June the Council will adopt the first decision on strengthening regulation and supervision of the EU financial sector. The decision will be based on the Commission proposals together with a detailed discussion of the report from the group headed by Jacques de Larosière in the Council.</p>
<p>Based on the EU’s own experiences and its wish to make a significant contribution to the creation of future international regulation of the financial sector, the European Council has set out the position of the Union in relation to the G20 summit which took place in London on 2 April.</p>
<p>The Council has also welcomed progress achieved particularly over the question of advance payments from the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund, the agreement over a voluntary application of reduced VAT rates and the European Investment Bank measures aimed at stimulating funding options for small and medium-sized enterprises. It has called for agreement to be reached more quickly on changes to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
<p>The Presidency agrees that it is essential to maintain general confidence in EU measures for combating the economic crisis and it will continue to monitor the situation. The institutions of the EU are determined to solve the current problems, particularly concerning the provision of sufficient volumes of credit to companies and households and restoring general confidence on the markets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0151"></a>

<p>In order to improve energy efficiency it is necessary to introduce specific instruments providing the necessary incentives, for example VAT concessions on specific services and products, an increase in the percentage of ERDF appropriations earmarked for investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy in the home and the creation of a European energy efficiency and renewable energy fund.

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council shares the honourable Member’s opinion that the energy performance of buildings is important for the achievement of Community objectives on increased energy efficiency and for other areas such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the security of supplies, since buildings account for about 40% of energy consumption in the Community. In its conclusions of 2 March this year the Council particularly mentioned measures aimed at increasing the energy performance of buildings, such as support for green technologies, the development of energy efficient production systems and materials, market instruments for energy efficiency, changes to the operating programmes of structural funds and innovative models of financing.</p>
<p>The measures currently implemented for boosting the energy performance of buildings were established on the basis of existing Community laws, particularly Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. On 17 November 2008 the Commission submitted to the Council the draft of a reworked version of this Directive; the honourable Member is the rapporteur of this draft. The Council is devoting considerable attention to the draft, which forms part of the package on energy efficiency. A progress report on the four legislative proposals in the area of energy efficiency will be submitted to the Council in June.</p>
<p>As far as the details set out in the second part of the question are concerned, the Council’s conclusions of 19 February 2009 mentioned and reaffirmed commitments in the area of greenhouse gas emission cuts and energy efficiency set out at the meeting of the European Council in March 2007, and also mentioned and confirmed the agreement reached in December 2008 concerning the package of measures on climate change and energy. The Council stressed the need for short-term and long-term priority measures. In this context it stated that the development of low-carbon energy­efficient systems should be an important element of the energy policy action plan for Europe after 2010.</p>
<p>The Council has therefore invited the Commission to identify essential legislative and non-legislative measures and the appropriate financial resources and to draw up an initiative for financially sustainable energy; the aim of this initiative, which will be a joint project of the Commission and the European Investment Bank, will be to mobilise extensive financial investment resources from capital markets, in relation to which it will be necessary to take into account expert assessments from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other international financial institutions.</p>
<p>As concerns the question of increasing the proportion of the EFRD targeted at investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in residential buildings from 3% to 15%, it is important to note that the total volume of potential investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in residential buildings was increased from 3% to 4% of total allocations from the EFRD as a result of an agreement in the Council<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Following difficult negotiations, this limit was approved by all of the Member States at the level of COREPER (in December 2008) as a compromise and subsequently approved by the European Parliament at first reading (in April 2009). According to the statements of the experts from the area of structural measures, this ceiling represents a sufficient level of funding for effectively boosting energy efficiency across part of the existing housing stock with the objective of supporting social cohesion. It should be added that Member States which acceded to the EU on or after 1 May 2004 are able to use the EFRD for other options amounting to up to 2% of total allocations from this fund, which include improving the environment in areas where the physical decay of buildings and social exclusion are taking place or may take place. The recognised costs also include energy saving investments in existing housing stock in these localities.</p>
<p>As far as the limits are concerned the new measures enabling EU support for housing are entirely relevant, sufficient and welcome. We would like to say in conclusion that this part of the recovery plan will probably be adopted in the coming weeks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council would like to point out to the honourable Member that under Article 211(1) of the EC Treaty the Commission has a duty to ensure the application of Community law in all of the Member States. The honourable Member may therefore consult the latest annual report on monitoring the application of Community law (2007), which the Commission submitted to Parliament on 18 November 2008<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Council would also like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to Articles 220, 226, 227 and 234 of the EC Treaty relating to the powers of the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>It is not therefore a direct task of the Council to deal with the enforcement and application of existing laws.</p>
<p>With regard to the foregoing, the Commission informs the Council regularly about the current situation regarding the application of internal market directives in national law and about ongoing proceedings over non-fulfilment of this obligation. The Council received this information (known as the Internal Market Scoreboard) on 25 February and 25 September 2008 and also recently on 5 March 2009<a href="#defann_3_2" name="refann_3_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As far as the specific topic of the common fisheries policy is concerned, I can also inform the honourable Member that the topic was discussed by the relevant ministers on 18 February 2008, within the context of an informal meeting on the issue of monitoring and enforcing rules in this area in connection with Special Report No 7 of the Court of Auditors on the control, inspection and sanction systems relating to the rules on conservation of Community fisheries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 10 March 2009 it will be 50 years since the Dalai Lama was forced to flee his country.</p>
<p>Under international public law a state may continue to exist for decades in spite of being annexed by an occupying power. Non-recognition of this illegal situation by third countries is very important in this connection. For example, most Western countries never formally recognised the illegal annexation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union. In 1991 these republics stated that they were the same states as the ones which had existed in the inter-war period (principle of legal continuity) and that they were therefore not new states. This was recognised by the EC (as then constituted) in its declaration of 27 August 1991.</p>
<p>Does the Council consider that the occupation and annexation of Tibet is in conflict with international law?

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The question of recognising third countries is a matter for each Member State. Therefore the Council does not take any position over this question.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the Council addresses the question of Tibet mainly within the framework of human rights policies. The EU is pursuing a human rights dialogue (the aims of which were set out in the conclusions of the Council on China in 2001 and 2004) within the framework of the comprehensive partnership with China, where the question of human rights in connection with Tibet is tabled regularly. The issue of human rights also arises at meetings within the framework of political dialogue and at other high-level meetings, and this will continue to be the case.</p>
<p>On 19 March 2008 the Presidency published on behalf of the EU a public declaration in which the EU called for restraint and appealed to the Chinese Government to solve the problems of Tibetans in relation to human rights issues and called on the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama and his representatives to begin a businesslike and constructive dialogue aimed at achieving a sustainable solution which would be acceptable to all parties while fully respecting Tibetan culture, religion and identity. At the meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on 17 March 2009, the Presidency made a declaration on behalf of the EU in which it again emphasised that in China, including Tibet, it should be possible for everyone who so desires to express their views peacefully without fear of reprisal. Within the framework of a general regular review several EU Member States formulated recommendations on Tibet which were handed over to representatives of the Chinese Government.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0162"></a>

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The global recession is having a particularly severe impact in the countries of South-East Europe. All of these countries are having to cope with higher costs of refinancing, lower fiscal revenues, weaker flows of direct foreign investment and reduced remittances from abroad. However, some countries are more affected than others. One of the important factors in this context is the extent to which households and enterprises have taken on loans in currencies other than the national currency where such loans must however be serviced in the national currency. As a number of currencies of South-East European countries have weakened it is increasingly difficult for borrowers to keep up with their obligations and in some cases they have even had to stop paying back their loans.</p>
<p>The Presidency is well aware of this problem and within the framework of the last meeting of foreign ministers (Gymnich) held on 27 and 28 March 2009 in Hluboka nad Vltavou, a working breakfast of the Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Alexandr Vondra and the foreign ministers of the West Balkan states was devoted to the economic situation in the region.</p>
<p>The EU has adopted a series of measures for supporting economic and social consolidation in South-East Europe and for mitigating the negative impacts of the global economic and financial crisis. Specific measures include a major increase in levels of lending to all sectors, continuing efforts to boost liquidity in the banking sector, increased support through the ‘crisis response’ package within the framework of the instrument for pre-accession assistance and increased efforts on coordination between the European Commission and international financial institutions in connection with the investment framework for the Western Balkans.</p>
<p>The Commission has created a ‘crisis response’ package worth EUR 120 million enabling the mobilisation of EUR 500 million in loans from international financial institutions. The measures are aimed at energy efficiency and support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Implementation should start in September this year.</p>
<p>Besides this the European Investment Bank has supported the efforts of the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in connection with the refinancing of the banking sector in Central and Eastern Europe, including facilitating coordination between the host and the domestic bodies for supervision and regulation.</p>
<p>During 2009 international financial institutions will make available to the Western Balkan countries and Turkey credit facilities of EUR 5.5 billion for the purposes of refinancing the banking sector. The European Investment Bank will provide EUR 2 billion of this total amount and the rest will come from international financial institutions.</p>
<p>Increased loans to banks in the EU within the framework of the European economic recovery plan should also contribute to greater volumes of loans to subsidiary companies in South-East Europe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at its March sitting the European Council welcomed the intention of the Commission to propose doubling the limit of the EU’s support system for assisting in balance of payment problems to EUR 50 billion.</p>
<p>The Council repeatedly expressed its full support for a European perspective in respect of the Western Balkan states, the final aim of which would be EU membership, provided these countries fulfil the essential conditions and requirements. The current global economic and financial crisis must not be allowed to affect this perspective.</p>
<p>The Council is of the opinion that the existing instruments, systems and procedures are adequate, but it will continue to monitor the situation constantly and to ensure that all countries that experience a temporary economic imbalance receive the appropriate assistance. In the interests of achieving maximum levels of complementarity and the mutual cohesion of the measures it is of absolutely fundamental importance for all of the available instruments and resources to be properly coordinated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0166"></a>

<p>.</p>
<p>The Council shares the honourable Member’s concern over the need to develop coordinated response policies capable of addressing the direct social impact of the crisis, especially on the most threatened groups of citizens.</p>
<p>These priorities were set out in the joint report on social protection and social inclusion and in the document on key questions which the Council adopted on 9 March 2009 and submitted to the spring part-session of the European Council. As we approach the Lisbon strategy target year approved in 2000, and bearing in mind the current economic crisis, it is all the more necessary to adopt a strong political commitment aimed at achieving the common goals of social protection and social inclusion while at the same time respecting the powers of Member States.</p>
<p>The joint report emphasised the need to encourage Member States in their efforts to implement comprehensive strategies in the fight against poverty and the social exclusion of children, including accessible and affordable high quality child care. We must continue to strive for a solution to homelessness and very serious forms of exclusion and to support the social inclusion of migrants. We must give special attention in particular to the fact that new risk groups may appear, e.g. young workers and persons entering the labour market, and also new risks.</p>
<p>All of these considerations will be reaffirmed in the declaration of 2010 as European Year of the Fight against Poverty and Social Exclusion.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0170"></a>

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 9 December 2008, after initial operational capability was successfully achieved throughout the territory of Kosovo in numbers corresponding to those of the UNMIK mission, the deployment of EULEX mission personnel continued and on 6 April 2009 full operational capability was declared.</p>
<p>The mission currently numbers around 1 700 deployed international staff, while the full complement should be almost 2 500 personnel. There are 25 Member States represented and the mission also includes contributions from six other countries (the US, Norway, Turkey, Croatia, Switzerland and Canada).</p>
<p>In accordance with the planning documents, members of the mission are deployed with all of their local opposite numbers in the relevant ministries, police stations, courts, government offices, penal institutions and other selected administrative bodies, for example the finance and customs authorities.</p>
<p>The deployment of the mission will enable effective fulfilment of its mandate from December, not only through the implementation of tasks in the area of monitoring and providing expert guidance and consultancy, but also through fulfilment of the mission’s executive mandate. Within the framework of the mandate the mission is successfully fulfilling tasks relating to security, for example through the deployment of the formed police units and integrated police units (FPU/IPU) as the second element in the security response, all of it on time and in numbers corresponding to the immediate threat which was present in the period around New Year.</p>
<p>From day one the mission has also ensured an effective presence at police stations in the northern section, at gates 1 and 31 and at the court in Mitrovica. It has taken over from UNMIK supervision of all operational activities carried out in the northern section relating to the legal state. There are 120 EULEX personnel deployed in the north every day, including:</p>
<p>–	a permanent presence of customs advisers at gates 1 and 31 (collecting commercial data which is forwarded to the authorities in Belgrade and Pristina);</p>
<p>–	in addition to the presence of customs advisers at these gates there is also a permanent presence of advisers from the border units monitoring the situation and also members of the special police units (IPU);</p>
<p>–	around 15 police advisers in four police stations in the northern section;</p>
<p>–	visible police presence is achieved through the special police guards (IPU) in Mitrovica and in the court there; these guards have the role of escorting and protecting the seven judges and state representatives belonging to the EULEX mission who are active in the court in Mitrovica, together with a number of lawyers. These judges and state representatives belonging to the EULEX mission have begun to mount criminal proceedings and to make rulings in the court, particularly in connection with recent events.</p>
<p>There have been no reports of significant security events directly targeted against the mission and a consolidation and stabilisation of the mission’s presence is under way, in connection with the full implementation of its mandate.</p>
<p>As far as the legal framework is concerned, the details are currently being worked out, particularly in respect of the northern section, so that the mission can function on the basis of a single legal and customs framework founded on the consolidation and development of valid laws applied by the local bodies.</p>
<p>The mission has some important tasks ahead of it, especially concerning the reintegration of local staff at the court in Mitrovica, and the reintegration of around 300 Kosovo Serb police officers south of the River Ibar, who have not been on duty since 17 February, but based on the current situation concerning the mission it can be assumed that a successful implementation of its mandate within the territory of Kosovo will be possible.</p>
<p>The preparations for the EULEX mission would not have succeeded without the establishment of an EU planning team with its own budget, through which it was possible to finance the deployment of a significant number of the personnel required for the planning phase as well as the initial deployment of the mission itself. In view of the delayed deployment it will not be necessary in the first year of the mission to spend all of the financial resources of EUR 205 million which were allocated to the joint operation from February 2008; the current EULEX budget of EUR 120 million will suffice to cover the costs of the mission up to the summer of 2009.</p>
<p>As far as the administrative side is concerned, the development of the EULEX mission has faced significant problems over uncertainties relating to the takeover of equipment and buildings of the UNMIK mission, as well as delays with the supply of armoured vehicles on the part of the framework contractor. Fulfilment of the logistical needs of the mission has also been made more difficult by the fact that EULEX is the first civilian mission within the ESDP framework to be given an executive mandate, as well as the sensitive political situation in Northern Kosovo. However, we have now managed to overcome most of these problems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0182"></a>

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council agrees that the issues raised by the honourable Member are significant, and it emphasises once again that it is important for the European Community and the Member States to achieve greater coordination of their activities in the area of research and technological development and to ensure that Member States’ policies and Community policies are interlinked.</p>
<p>In this context the Council, in the conclusions from its sittings on 1 and 2 December 2008 on joint research planning in Europe, emphasised in response to significant social changes the important role of the Community’s framework programme for research and technological development and related instruments, such as ERA-NET, ERA-NET+ and relevant initiatives pursuant to Article 169 of the EC Treaty, in the mobilisation of scientific and financial resources of the Member States in order to implement initiatives of common interest in the area of research and development. Apart from this the Council acknowledges the importance of existing activities aimed at coordinating programmes implemented by national agencies and research organisations in more Member States and at regional level, through international organisations and also through cross-border and inter-governmental initiatives in this area (EUREKA, COST). The Council also calls on Member States to consider making their internal programmes more open, where appropriate.</p>
<p>The sitting on 1 and 2 December 2008 adopted conclusions on joint planning in which it called on Member States to establish a high level joint planning group, the aim of which would be to identify topics which should be the subject of joint planning in response to major social challenges.</p>
<p>In the document on key issues in the area of competitiveness and innovation, which the Council adopted on 5 March and submitted to the spring session of the European Council, Member States were invited to cooperate with this high level group in order to make it possible to identify the main social challenges and solve them within the framework of joint planning. Topics should be developed actively in consultation with all of the relevant interested parties so that the Council will be able to adopt the initiatives by 2010 at the latest.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0185"></a>

<p>European companies are exploiting uranium in Northern Niger. Niger is one of the least developed countries. However, its people derive no benefit from these activities.

Moreover, groundwater has been drained for exploitation of the deposits. The EU must ensure that European companies established in Africa assume their responsibilities.</p>
<p>What is the Council’s approach for ensuring that European uranium mining companies in Niger respect the health of the local people and the need to preserve groundwater?

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU and Niger are conducting a general political dialogue through a forum, on the basis of Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement. The first session of the dialogue took place on 17 March 2009 at the Niger Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. The key points of the dialogue on which both parties agreed included the economy and the social situation (including the process of poverty reduction and social development, economic growth, food and the fight against corruption), the proper administration of public affairs and fundamental rights, democratisation, and regional and sub-regional integration (including economic development and infrastructure).</p>
<p>The dialogue continues and other sessions are planned before the end of the Czech Presidency, particularly in relation to preparations for the forthcoming elections. However, the dialogue under Article 8 is also a suitable forum for solving questions raised by MEPs, including the application of the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in the mining industry, which Niger signed up to in 2005.</p>
<p>In the strategic document for Niger (the 10th EDF) it is stated that before the end of 2006 the Niger government had confirmed its intention to establish – through a revision of the mining law – that 10% of mining royalties would be allocated to local development in the regions affected by mining.</p>
<p>Through its Sysmin programme, the EU is providing within the framework of the 9th EDF a contribution of EUR 35 million which is targeted, among other things, at improving work conditions and safety at work in the mining sector.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU is at present negotiating a general plan with special emphasis on security and development aspects, the aim of which is to solve - together with Niger and other countries of the region - the serious problems facing these countries. In this context the socio-economic conditions of the inhabitants of the north of the country will be studied in greater detail.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0187"></a>

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council shares the honourable Member’s concerns relating to the difficult situation on the milk market. After an unprecedented period of record prices for milk and dairy products in 2007 and early 2008, European producers now face weak and uncertain markets characterised by a sharp drop in global dairy product prices.</p>
<p>At the Council sitting of 23 March, there was an extensive exchange of views on the difficult situation facing the milk market and account was taken of a memorandum that was supported by a number of delegates.</p>
<p>In this context it can be said that the legal framework regulating the market in milk and dairy products has changed considerably over the past two years after the Council adopted the ‘mini-milk package’ in September 2007. From 1 April 2008 the national quotas for milk have increased by 2% and in January 2009 a package was adopted under the title of ‘Health Check’.</p>
<p>The new legal framework was established with a view to the long-term competitiveness of European producers. The effects of market competition must be counterbalanced by existing instruments within the framework of market support measures.</p>
<p>In this regard the honourable Member is surely aware of the fact that the Commission has already adopted market support measures, including the introduction of support for private storage facilities for butter and interventions for butter and skimmed milk powder as well as the reintroduction of export subsidies for all dairy products. The Commission informs the Council regularly about the situation on the milk market.</p>
<p>The Commission must submit further proposals on this matter to the Council. In this regard the Commission has expressed its readiness to assess the possibility of expanding the range of dairy products for which it is possible to provide support within the framework of the regime for distributing milk to schools. However, it stated that it is not ready to restart discussions on the ‘Health Check’ package.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0195"></a>

<p>The position of the Council has not yet been approved as regards conclusion of the optional protocol and the list of Community powers set out in the Commission proposal.</p>
<p>In the spirit of its motto of ‘Europe without barriers’, the Presidency has invited all representatives of persons with disabilities to its events.

These events included a meeting of the European Disability Forum, which took place in Prague on 28 February to 1 March 2009.</p>
<p>A forthcoming international conference called ‘Europe without Barriers’, which has been organised at the end of April by the Czech National Council of Persons with Disabilities, will take place under the sponsorship of Czech Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Petr Nečas. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is sure to be on the conference agenda.</p>
<p>Close cooperation with representatives of European organisations of persons with disabilities has already started with the preparation of a draft of the said treaty and it will definitely receive a fresh impulse once the treaty has been ratified and implementation has begun.</p>
<p>The second report of the high level working group for the area of disabilities, which deals with the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, will be presented to the Council meeting on employment, social policy, health and consumer protection in June 2009.

<p>(EN) The Commission adopted an Evaluation Report on the motor vehicle block exemption Regulation<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> in May 2008. In this report, the Commission underlined that access to technical information and alternative sources of spare parts are essential for independent repairers to compete with authorised dealer networks. We believe competition in the automotive aftermarket is essential for ensuring consumer choice and reliable repair services at affordable prices.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently reviewing several options, and is taking into account views expressed in a public consultation we have conducted, and we are ready to ensure an appropriate regime for motor vehicle distribution and servicing remains in place once the current Block Exemption expires in May 2010.</p>
<p>No decision about the Commission's preferred policy has been taken yet. However, any future framework should safeguard repairers' access to technical information and to alternative sources of spare parts.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that notwithstanding the future policy in the competition framework, detailed provisions on access to information for independent operators are introduced by Regulations 715/2007 and 692/2008 on the type-approval of Euro 5 and Euro 6 light-duty vehicles. Euro VI legislation on the type-approval of heavy-duty vehicles, currently in the final stage of adoption by the Council, imposes similar requirements, for which the Commission is preparing implementing legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Adult stem cell research is an active field, which is advancing in a dynamic way as new knowledge becomes available, and where Europe has a strong presence. Adult stem cells form the basis for some treatments already in the clinic, such as bone marrow transplantation for leukaemia and repair treatments for bone injury; and recently, European scientists implanted the first tissue engineered trachea, which had been made with the use of the patient's own stem cells.</p>
<p>The EU has funded adult stem cell research in successive Research Framework Programmes, including in the current Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013) (FP7). Following the first two calls for proposals under the Health priority of FP7, the EU is funding 8 projects involving therapeutic use of adult stem cells (table attached). Together, these projects represent an EU contribution of around €41 million; further projects cannot be excluded in the future.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that the scientific community indicates human embryonic stem cells as a potential source for regenerative medicine and tissue replacement after injury or disease, particularly when adult cells are unsuitable or unavailable. Human embryonic stem cells are a reference standard for judging quality and usefulness of other types of cells. Research on human embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells needs to continue in parallel and many EU projects compare cells from different sources. All sources of stem cells are part of a research effort to expand our knowledge of how cells function, what fails in disease, and how the first stages of human development occur. It is this combined knowledge that will ultimately generate safe and effective therapies.</p>
<p>Following its institutional remit, the Commission manages FP7 as adopted in co-decision by the Parliament and the Council, where research involving the use of human embryonic stem cells is eligible for EU funding under strict ethics conditions.</p>
<p>All EU research proposals involving human embryonic stem cells are subject to double ethical review, at national (or local) level as well as at European level, and are submitted to a Member State Regulatory Committee, guaranteeing that projects that come through the system are sound ethically and scientifically. The European Group on Ethics of science and new technologies has issued an Opinion on the ethics review of FP7 human embryonic stem cell projects following President Barroso's request<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Currently, 85% of European public research funding is spent nationally without any transnational collaboration between programmes or competition between researchers from different Member States.

<p>(EN) The EU is facing challenges today that no single state or region can address alone. Think about the need to tackle food shortages, and climate and energy crises. No Member State can address these challenges efficiently alone - we need joint and coordinated action at European, if not global, level.</p>
<p>Yet today barely 15 % of European publicly financed civil R&amp;D is financed in partnership and coordinated between Member States, either in the Community Framework Programme or in inter-governmental partnerships such as ESA, CERN or EUREKA - the remaining 85% of the European public research funding is defined and spent at national level. The share of research activities which is jointly defined or implemented remains insufficient lacks strategic focus as well as the scale and scope to address effectively the common challenges of our time.</p>
<p>That is why there is a need to work more closely together and why the Commission presented the Communication on Joint Programming in research<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Joint Programming is about making research in Europe more strategic, more focused and more effective.</p>
<p>Joint Programming is not about the Commission taking control of national research programmes and budgets. It is about setting up partnerships between Member States and about making the best use of resources - money and brains. It is based on Member States getting together to develop common visions how to address major societal challenges and to define and implement Strategic Research Agendas.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question on avoiding duplication of research efforts, it needs to be said that some duplication of efforts can be good, if different research teams compete for the same objective. However, in certain areas, hundreds of similar projects are funded and reviewed independently by several countries. The aim of Joint Programming is about creating a process which brings more strategy and coordination in the panoply of available instruments. It is about more efficient and more effective use of national money. Member States have nominated representatives to a high level group on Joint Programming, to jointly identify priority topics for future Joint Programming activities. The Commission expects this process to be finalised before the end of 2009.</p>
<p>Joint Programming is a Member-States-led process, but of course, the Commission is there to support and identify possible value-added vis-à-vis its own instruments, notably 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme, to maximise the effects of any joint investment of national resources.</p>
<p>On the relation between Joint Programming and Article 169 initiatives it has to be understood that Joint Programming is a process which lies upstream of any decision with regard to the choice and combination of appropriate instruments and resources (either national or at Community level) that are necessary for implementation. The shared vision, the common research agenda and the proportionate commitment of competent authorities are the heart of this process, which may lead to Joint Programming Initiatives that are very different in nature. While Joint Programming builds on the experience of ERA-NETs (cooperation between similar R&amp;D programmes of Member States) and on Article 169 initiatives (a common programme on specific topic), it goes beyond these by adding an element of foresight, of strategic programme planning and of aligning various national and regional resources to achieve common objectives. Of course an Article 169 initiative or a European Research Infrastructure or any other instrument of FP7 could be part of implementation of a Joint Programming, but it is mainly about aligning and putting together national resources.</p>
<p>Joint Programming has an enormous potential in the European research landscape and can change the way in which research is thought about and carried out. In that sense, it is a test case for the ERA 2020 vision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the Eurobarometer of autumn 2008, only 16% of the electorate knows that there will be European Parliament elections in June 2009.

<p>(EN) The Commission supports and complements the communication efforts of the Parliament and national authorities by carrying out thematic, awareness-raising activities of various kinds at both European and local levels. Significant communication work is being organised jointly, but there is also scope for each party's own actions.</p>
<p>Messages by the Commission focus on the EU as a whole and demonstrate what exactly the EU has achieved in policy areas of direct relevance to the life of citizens. They highlight the real added value of collective action at the European level, and demonstrate that there are issues that cannot be tackled by a Member State alone (climate change and environment, consumer safety and health, immigration policy, terrorism threats, safe supply of energy etc).</p>
<p>The awareness-raising activities address all Member States and all voting age citizens. Whilst respecting the overall uniformity of the activities, the identification of the themes and the messages has been tailored to the specific situation of each Member State. Nevertheless, most people would like to see the focus on economic issues affecting everyday life (unemployment, growth, purchasing power). There is also considerable interest in security and climate change related issues.</p>
<p>However, according to the latest Eurobarometer (carried out in October/November 2008) 26% of the electorate was aware of the timing of the European Parliament (EP) elections, and only 30% indicated an intention to vote. Therefore, targeted action is needed to reach social groups with low level of interest and willingness to participate. These groups vary somewhat from country to country but generally include young people, women, and people with lower level of education.</p>
<p>The Commission deploys communication tools favoured by citizens, including the AV media (radio and TV), and the internet. TV and radio clips will illustrate the priority topics of the EP elections. A multimedia action targeting young people will aim at getting young people to cast their vote. In addition, the Commission (in cooperation with the European Centre for Journalism) supports a blogging project involving 81 young journalists from EU-27 on EP elections issues<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>

<p>(EN) Eurobarometer polls have shown that, compared to other EU Member States, the level of knowledge in Ireland of the EU is below the EU-27 average (for example, behind that of France, Denmark and the Netherlands that have also held a referendum on EU issues). Therefore, the Commission is continuing working to contribute to improve communication and information on European issues in Ireland.</p>
<p>The Commission communication activities in Ireland are a response to the conclusions of the Oireachtas sub-committee's report of November 2008, which identified serious lacunae in communication on Europe in Ireland, as well as to requests from the Irish authorities also responding to the Oireachtas report. These activities are planned for a period of several years and aim to tackle the long-term problem of lack of knowledge about the EU in Ireland.</p>
<p>It is worth underlining once more that responsibility for the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and therefore for the referendum campaign lies with the Irish government.</p>
<p>A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Communicating Europe in Partnership was signed on 29 January 2009 between the Irish Government, the Parliament and the Commission. It formalizes into a partnership Ireland's existing cooperation with the Parliament and the Commission to promote better public understanding of the EU. The MoU is similar to arrangements in other Member States.</p>
<p>The main aim of this partnership is to build understanding of the European Union in Ireland. The three parties will seek to do this through dissemination of information to boost public awareness of the European Union's objectives. The main target audiences, apart from the general population, will be women, young people and those socio-economic groups that have a weaker association with the EU. These groups have been singled out in several surveys as being particularly poorly informed of EU matters.</p>
<p>The partnership will not prevent the partners from carrying out their own independent information activities. The participants will maximize mutual support for communication activities and actions, also working together with all relevant institutions and bodies (European Direct Relays, other networks of the European Union, regional and local governance structures and groups, Non-Governmental Organisations, etc.).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0128"></a>

<p>(EN) 1.	In order to restore stable and reliable financial markets for the future, the Commission Communication for the Spring European Council published on 4 March 2009<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> has presented an ambitious agenda for change, starting from providing the EU with a supervisory framework that detects potential risks early, deals with them effectively before they have an impact, and meets the challenge of complex international markets. Other elements of the programme included:</p>
<p>filling the gaps of incomplete or insufficient national or European regulation with a "safety first" approach,</p>
<p>reinforcing the protection of consumers and small companies;</p>
<p>sorting out pay and incentives;</p>
<p>making sanctions more deterrent.</p>
<p>On supervision, building on the conclusions of the de Larosière report<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission will present a Communication on a strengthened European financial supervision framework before the end of May, for discussion at the June European Council. Legislative proposals will follow in the autumn. This framework will include:</p>
<p>on the macro-prudential side, measures to establish a European Systemic Risk Council (ESRC), and</p>
<p>on the micro-prudential side, proposals to establish a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS).</p>
<p>The ESRC could be, in particular, responsible for:</p>
<p>pooling and analysing all information relevant for financial stability;</p>
<p>identifying and prioritising risks;</p>
<p>issuing risk warnings and advice on the appropriate measures to be taken in reaction to the risks identified (for which there would need to be some kind of mechanism to ensure effective follow-up).</p>
<p>2.	On micro-prudential supervision, the Commission has recently adopted measures with the aim of strengthening the functioning of the existing European Committees for banking, securities and insurance/occupational pensions: i) by setting up a clearer framework for the activities of the Committees and reinforcing financial stability arrangements. ii) by proposing the establishment of a Community programme, providing direct funding from the Community budget to the Committees. In order to improve the decision-making process of the Committees, the Decisions introduce Qualified Majority Voting when consensus cannot be reached.</p>
<p>Despite these improvements, the Commission is of the view that the limits of what can be done with the present status of the current committees have been reached. Indeed, the Commission thinks EU financial markets need much more effective mechanisms to ensure that supervisors cooperate in a way which is consistent with the reality of an integrated market.</p>
<p>The Commission is obviously interested to have a debate as wide and comprehensive as possible on the composition and powers of the ESFS and the ESRC, and to this end it launched on 10 March 2009 a consultation on the suggested improvements to supervision, with a deadline set for 10 April 2009<a href="#defann_24_3" name="refann_24_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. It will also organise a High Level Conference on the follow-up to the de Larosiere report in Brussels on the 7 May 2009.</p>
<p>In the last European Council conclusions of 19 and 20 March 2009, EU Heads of States and Governments have stressed the need to improve regulation and supervision, and that the de Larosière report is the basis for action.</p>
<p>3.	Concerning the G20, the results achieved by the G20 process are really unprecedented. For the first time, leaders have been able to agree on comprehensive, detailed coordination of international financial policies and regulations. The Commission has made a real and substantive first step toward the global regulatory convergence it has been calling for long. The EU has been in the lead in this process, and the Commission closely coordinated its position inside the EU.</p>
<p>Concerning the content, the Commission is satisfied that it has managed to secure a comprehensive and ambitious agenda for reform:</p>
<p>a commitment to improve requirements concerning bank capital and liquidity buffers, as well as measures to limit the build-up of leverage;</p>
<p>the establishment of colleges of supervisors for large cross border banks;</p>
<p>a more ambitious stance to regulate credit rating agencies, including compliance with the substance of the IOSCO code of conduct;</p>
<p>an agreement to endorse tough common principles on pay and compensation in financial institutions;</p>
<p>an agreement about improving accounting standards, in particular on valuation and provisioning – two key issues in order to mitigate procyclicality;</p>
<p>an agreement to enhance the resilience of credit derivative markets by promoting standardisation and multilateral clearing arrangements, subject to effective regulation and supervision;</p>
<p>regulation of hedge funds.</p>
<p>On non cooperative jurisdictions, important results were achieved by widening the scope of the review to anti-money laundering, terrorist financing and prudential issues. The Commission also stands ready to deploy sanctions, if needed. It is a good first step to get rid of free riders in the global financial system.</p>
<p>Finally, the work is not over, it is only beginning. The Commission is now entering a new crucial phase where the regulatory commitments must be translated into concrete action. The Commission will continue to play an active role, as it has done until now, to attain this objective.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Today, the EU's aid extends to a broader field, including human rights, economic cooperation, demobilisation and integration of ex-combatants and rural development.

<p>(EN) The current cooperation with El Salvador is based on the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2007-2011 with two focal sectors: 1. Fostering social cohesion and human security, 2. Economic growth, regional integration and trade. These sectors are covering well the challenges El Salvador is facing currently.</p>
<p>Fighting violence and investment in human capital especially are important focuses of these two priority sectors and have been targeted by several actions of our cooperation.</p>
<p>Job generation has been already a priority of the focal sector „support for equitable and balanced growth of the economy and employment” in the CSP 2002-2006. The project FOMYPE, with a budget of 24 million euros, focused on strengthening small and medium size enterprises. The current CSP in the framework of the Priority sector „Economic growth, regional integration and trade” foresees an action aiming at strengthening the quality system so that especially small and medium size enterprises can better use the benefits of the current GSP+ system and the opportunities offered by regional integration and the currently negotiated association agreement. It is widely recognised that SMSs play an important role in generating employment and they can contribute to lessen the negative affects of the present crisis.</p>
<p>There is a large programme of over € 20m (“Projovenes"), targeting particularly the Youth and focusing on the security problems affecting the country. It works at the same time on crime prevention, social integration of young people and support the institutions in the implementation of new educational and social work. This project is complemented by the project PROEDUCA that strengthen the creation work opportunities of young people, and thus crime prevention through reinforcing technical education.</p>
<p>The priorities of the current CSP are likely to remain valid, although, the current Mid-Term Review of the 2007-2013 El Salvador Country Strategy might modify them to reflect better the necessities of the country. The findings of this review will be available early 2010 and the Parliament will be consulted in this process.</p>
<p>Also, the Commission has launched a independent Country level evaluation of the EC's cooperation with El Salvador 1998-2008. This exercise, which is ongoing, will identify key lessons in order to improve the current and future strategies and programmes of the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0133"></a>

<p>The long-standing preference of the Commission is to reach an agreement that would cover all pending issues: compliance with this WTO dispute settlement report; consequences of the EU enlargement to 27 Member States; and tariff negotiations resulting from a new round of WTO negotiations.

<p>(EN) It is unfortunately true that around 60,000 people commit suicide in the EU each year. And it is also true that most of those people, who commit suicide, experienced a history of mental health problems. These people did not find the help which they needed.</p>
<p>In the EU, more people die as a result of suicide than because of road accidents. While the number of road accidents decreased by more than 15% since 2000, the number of suicides remained relatively stable. With the current economic crisis, there is even a risk that the number of short and long-term mental health problems will increase, with a clear impact on suicide rate.</p>
<p>As a European Union committed to improving health and the well-being of its citizens, we should not tolerate this high suicide toll. However, it is important to stress that prevention of suicide is primarily a Member State responsibility.</p>
<p>At EU level, we can nevertheless support exchanges of information and good practices. This is why we made "Prevention of Depression and Suicide" the first priority theme of the European Pact for Mental Health and Well-being launched in June 2008.</p>
<p>In the context of the implementation of the Pact, the Commission and the Ministry of Health of Hungary will organise, on 10/11 December 2009, a thematic conference on "Prevention of Depression and Suicide". This conference will involve policy makers from Member States, practitioners and research experts. It will highlight the most successful approaches in preventing suicide. It will encourage Member States to take the action which best suits their needs.</p>
<p>The conference can build on many European-level project activities during the past 10 years, such as the successful European Alliance Against Depression.</p>
<p>The present economic situation really increases the need to redouble our efforts to protect our citizens’ health, in particular in areas like depression and suicide. The Commission expects that the conference will be a useful step for Member States to contribute to that aim.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0139"></a>

<p>(EN) The current financial and economic crisis has resulted in higher spreads for long-term government bonds within the euro area, which can make it more costly for some Member States to service their debt.</p>
<p>However, it needs to be pointed out that if these spreads (measured against the yield on German bonds) usually have risen, the overall level of long-term interest rates in the euro area is not particularly high by historical standards. This is because the backdrop of the main refinancing operations rate relevant for monetary policy has fallen to an unprecedented low.</p>
<p>The most effective way to counter the "perception of default risk" remains a credible commitment to restoring sound fiscal positions in the medium term: the euro area and EU Member States with large budgetary imbalances including Ireland have put forward plans to ensure sound public finances in the medium term.

<p>(EN) The Commission fully agrees with the Honourable Member that discards are a problem in European fisheries that needs to be tackled vigorously. This problem is very complex, since discards take place for a variety of reasons. Therefore, the solution is to take individual specificities into account therefore requiring several initiatives being taken instead of only one.</p>
<p>Already in 2007, the Commission indicated in its Communication "A policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards in European Fisheries"<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> its intention to address the problem of discards. Some first but significant steps were taken in 2008 by further limiting fishing effort in various fisheries and by putting in place a high-grading ban in the North Sea and the Skagerrak.</p>
<p>These measures entered into effect in 2009 although a lot still needs to be done and a new impetus is needed in order to eradicate discards. The Commission does not therefore want to wait until the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and it envisages to tackle this issue by means of a gradual approach, as from now. This stepwise approach will focus in the short term on regulated and other major commercial species. It will include measures such as incentivising pilot studies to test discard reductions in practise, new control and technical measures, promoting more selective gears and improved mesh sizes and the provision of incentives to favour initiatives from the fishing industry itself which are geared to less by-catch and discards. The Commission is also envisaging to propose a ban on high grading in all Community waters with effect from the beginning of 2010. Member States must do their part as well and should manage fishing permits at national level in a way that ensures that only vessels having appropriate quotas have the opportunity to fish for regulated species.</p>
<p>Beyond these immediate measures, the Commission will also use the upcoming debate on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to help bring about the necessary change. The current system of Total Allowable Catches and quotas is a contributor to discarding because it is based on national quotas for individual species. Solving the discards problem may require significant changes in this system. While it is premature to establish clear positions on such changes at this early stage, it is essential that in the context of the discussions on the Green Paper and further negotiations leading to the reform of the CFP in 2012, solving the issue of discards should occur centre stage and has to be tackled forcefully. The final objective should be to eradicate this practice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Commission has since been working with the Council towards building a consensus among Member States on the main features of a Community patent and a unified litigation system which would cover both current European patents and the future Community patent. Substantial progress has been made which enabled these discussions for the Commission to adopt on 20 March 2009 a Recommendation to the Council to authorise the Commission to open negotiations for the adoption of an Agreement creating a Unified Patent Litigation System<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.

<p>(FR) The Code of Conduct for Commissioners recognises that Commissioners are politicians who may be active members of political parties provided that this does not compromise their availability for service in the Commission. In this context, they may express personal opinions but they must take responsibility for them and must respect their obligations to the principle of collective responsibility, to confidentiality and to discretion that arise from the Treaty.</p>
<p>The participation of a Commissioner in an election campaign, as a candidate or endorsing an electoral list, is governed by the obligation to be independent and to defend the common interest as laid down in Article 213 of the Treaty and again in the Code of Conduct for Commissioners.</p>
<p>The Commission attaches great importance to the forthcoming European elections, which mark an important moment for the European Union. It encourages its Members to participate in activities such as giving information and creating awareness of common European values that aim to encourage European citizens to vote. In this context, Commissioners must ensure that they remain impartial with regard to the political groups’ programmes, although they may challenge them when they call into question the work of the Commission or of the other institutions.</p>
<p>With regard to a Commissioner’s participation in the forthcoming European election campaign and endorsement of a particular electoral list, it is the Commissioner’s responsibility to inform the President of the intended level of participation.</p>
<p>Commissioners who intend to play an active role in the electoral campaign will have to take special unpaid leave.</p>
<p>On the other hand, slight participation does not entail having to take leave of absence during the election, provided that the major part of their time is still devoted to their role as Commissioners and that they avoid stating views that could be perceived as compromising a policy or decision adopted by the Commission or as being in conflict with the pursuit of the general interest of the Community. Furthermore, if Commissioners do speak publicly in the context of the European election campaign, they must make it absolutely clear whether they are speaking as Members of the Commission, providing information in their official capacity, or personally.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0150"></a>

<p>(EN) Aquaculture is of high economic and social significance for several coastal and inland regions of the European Union. It has also a tangible environmental dimension.</p>
<p>On 8 April 2009, the Commission adopted a Communication on building a sustainable future for aquaculture (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2009&amp;nu_doc=0162">COM (2009) 162</a>). This initiative gives a new impetus to the sustainable development of EU aquaculture. This strategy identifies a number of measures that are aimed at addressing the challenges faced by the EU aquaculture industry, in particular with the objective of promoting its competitiveness.</p>
<p>As regards traceability, the provisions for aquaculture products are already quite well developed. Under Commission Regulation 2065/2001 provisions are laid down so that consumers have information on the Member State or Third Country of production at each stage of marketing of the species. Provision has been made for organic aquaculture production in the revision of the organic production rules completed in 2007 through Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. While the control and labelling provisions already apply, detailed production rules are currently under development and the draft Commission Regulation is expected to be adopted in the course of 2009. In the meantime, national rules or private standards recognised by Member States continue to apply.</p>
<p>The Commission also intends to develop a market observatory in order to improve the knowledge of the EU fishery and aquaculture sector on market trends and price formation. A survey will be carried out on volumes and value for fisheries and aquaculture products at different levels of the supply chain from first sale to retail. This project should help the aquaculture industry to adapt its marketing to the evolution of demand and to get better value for their products. Furthermore, the review of the market policy for fisheries and aquaculture products foreseen in 2009 will allow to assess and to address particular needs of the aquaculture sector, such as those regarding producer organisations, inter-professions or consumer information.</p>
<p>The Commission is also fully aware that the economic crisis has compounded the difficulties that some enterprises, notably in the sea bream farming industry, were already facing. The Commission adopted a number of measures at horizontal level, which are meant to benefit operators across all the sectors. Among others, measures on finance and credit have been adopted. Furthermore, the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) provides tools and measures that can help the aquaculture industry address today's difficulties.</p>
<p>Finally, most measures identified in the Communication for a renewed impetus for the sustainable development of European aquaculture, are of a non-legislative nature and should be delivered over a few years. The future of EU aquaculture and the role that the Community should adopt in the longer term in this regard will have to be assessed and further discussed in the process that begins now on the preparation of the future reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and the review of EU financing instruments after 2013.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0160"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has constantly reiterated the need for a common vision on the role and place of agencies in EU governance. The ad hoc establishment of agencies over the years has not been accompanied by an overall vision of their position in the Union, which has made it more difficult for them to work effectively and has nourished a range of critics as the ones quoted by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>This is why in March 2008 the Commission addressed a Communication to the Council and the Parliament, "European Agencies-the way forward"<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, inviting the two institutions to an inter-institutional debate with the objective of arriving at a common approach vis-à-vis the role of agencies. To this end an Inter-institutional Working Group was created, composed of members coming from the Commission, Parliament and Council with the mandate to debate on several key issues concerning the agency system – funding, budget, supervision and management. The first meeting of this Working Group, at political level, took place on 10 March 2009 on the margins of the Parliament's plenary session in Strasbourg. The Commission believes that the group offers the opportunity to examine whether the criticisms levelled at agencies are, indeed, justified and, if so, what should be the appropriate responses. Conclusions can be drawn only against the background of the results of this inter-institutional dialogue.</p>
<p>With regard to the alleged overlapping of competences of existing agencies with other actors acting in the same area, the Commission points out that this matter will be addressed within the ongoing evaluation of the system of the EU decentralised agencies. This evaluation was announced in the above mentioned Communication and was commissioned to an external contractor. Its findings will be available in November 2009 and they will feed into the inter-institutional debate. Once the evaluation is completed the Commission will report to the Parliament as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the Parliament, as well as the Council, is closely associated to the evaluation process via their participation in the so called Reference Group, which comments on relevant deliverables, including the draft final report.</p>
<p>Concerning the creation of new agencies, the Commission recalls existing proposals in the fields of energy and telecoms, as well as planned agencies in the field of justice and home affairs which are already in inter-institutional discussions.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to shape together with the Parliament and the Council a new overall approach to agencies with a view to making them a more effective tool by improving their coherence, effectiveness, accountability and transparency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is deeply concerned about the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children in its different forms. This includes child prostitution, child sex tourism and child pornography. They are particularly serious forms of crime directed against children, who have the right to special protection and care. These crimes produce long-term physical, psychological and social harm to victims. When the abuse is committed abroad, as in the case of child sex tourism, it is particularly worrying that the application of certain national rules on criminal jurisdiction often results in child sex offenders enjoying impunity in practice.</p>
<p>On 25 March 2009, the Commission put forward a proposal for a new Council Framework Decision on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography repealing the Framework decision 2004/68/JHA. It includes an extensive set of vigorous measures on the three fronts of prosecuting the offenders, protecting the victims and preventing the phenomenon.</p>
<p>More specifically to combat child sex tourism, the proposal provides for amending rules on jurisdiction to ensure that child sexual abusers or exploiters from the EU face prosecution even if they commit their crimes in a third country. For that, the existing rules on criminal jurisdiction must be amended to cover extraterritorial cases and to eliminate requirements of intervention by authorities in the third country, which may not be able or willing to take a firm stand against child sexual exploitation. In this way, offenders abusing children abroad will face penalties when they come back. In addition, the proposal envisages criminalising the dissemination of materials advertising the opportunity to commit any sexual abuse, and also the organisation of travel arrangements with that purpose.</p>
<p>In the context of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation a Task force for the protection of children in tourism has been set up. The Task Force is a global action platform of tourism-related key-players from the government and the tourism industry sectors, international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and media associations. It operates as an open-ended network. Its mission consists of supporting efforts to protect children from all forms of exploitation in tourism, under the guiding principles of the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism. Although its main focus is the protection against sexual exploitation of minors, it also includes child labour and the trafficking in children and young people.</p>
<p>The Task Force's on-line service, the Child Protection in Tourism Watch, was launched by WTO to support the international community and tourism industry organizations in their fight against the commercial sexual exploitation of children in tourism networks. The Child Prostitution and Tourism Watch is a constantly up-dated public information server on past and present activities, partners’ tourism policy documents, related facts &amp; figures and other measures.</p>
<p>Under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), more specifically the Investing in People thematic programme, the Commission addresses sexual violence, exploitation and abuse by supporting actions and dissemination of good practices aimed at fighting child trafficking and rehabilitating victims. The programme focuses on civil society's capacity building to promote policy dialogue and effective programming on child trafficking and related issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0164"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission can only make again the point that it has received no complaint on State aid to ferry companies in Greece nor on the violation of the transparency obligation to be respected on the occasion of the conclusion of public service contracts under Regulation 3577/92 on maritime cabotage<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>An infringement procedure on Greece for the incorrect implementation of the mentioned regulation is still open, but with respect to matters which are irrelevant for the purpose of the questions raised by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the reply given by the Commission to Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2008-5029_EN.html">E-5029/08</a>, Member States are not under an obligation to notify the Commission public service contracts for maritime cabotage and the relevant compensation. The Commission is therefore not aware of the amounts paid by the Member States for the provision of public service.</p>
<p>Should the Honourable Member consider that the Regulation on maritime cabotage has been infringed or that illegal State aid has been given to shipping companies, he can lodge, as any citizen, a formal complaint and provide the details and circumstances of the alleged infringement which will allow the Commission's Services to start an assessment of his complaint.</p>
<p>The Commission has no specific information as to the existence today of any dominant position held by one ferry company in the Cyclades. It should be noted in any event that Article 82 of the EC Treaty only prohibits the abuse of a dominant position, not the existence of the dominant position as such. Any abuse of a dominant position which has an effect on trade between Member States could be investigated by the national competition authority or by the Commission. In addition, subject to the relevant conditions being met, the national authorities can take the appropriate measures according to Regulation (CEE) No. 3577/92 of the Council of 7 December 1992 on maritime cabotage<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the Regulation on roaming of June 2007 concerning roaming costs for mobile telephony, the cost of outgoing roaming calls per minute may not exceed 0.49 euro (and should have fallen to 0.43 euro by 2009). Incoming roaming calls may cost a maximum of 0.24 euro per minute (0.19 euro by 2009). Currently, there are various contracts which levy a connection charge, which means that the price ceiling is exceeded. The connection charge is part of a voluntary agreement which results in lower costs per minute but, in the case of short calls, the cost exceeds the price ceiling.</p>
<p>Is this situation consistent with the Regulation on roaming? If not, what does the Commission intend to do to ensure compliance with the price ceiling rules?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Under Article 4 of the current Roaming Regulation<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> mobile operators are required to offer a Eurotariff to all their roaming customers. The Eurotariff cannot entail any associated subscription or other fixed or recurring charges and may be combined with any other retail tariff. Operators may also offer other roaming tariffs apart from the Eurotariff which may be structured differently to a Eurotariff and could therefore contain a connection charge. However, for the Eurotariff, the per minute charge cannot exceed the ceilings imposed in the Regulation.</p>
<p>On a related point, the Honourable Member may be aware that the Commission's review of the Roaming Regulation revealed that per minute billing for roaming calls is the most common practice in the majority of Member States. This means that operators charge on a minimum per minute basis even where calls are less than one minute duration. The European Regulators Group estimated that consumers pay around 19% and 24% more for calls received and calls made, respectively, as a result of this practice and stated that urgent action was needed to address this 'hidden charge'.</p>
<p>Per minute billing practices represent a dilution of the intended effects of the Regulation. The Eurotariff is a maximum cap and is intended to provide consumers with assurance as to what they will pay. Divergent billing practices for the Eurotariff by mobile operators undermine the original aim of the Regulation which is to provide a common price ceiling across the Community.</p>
<p>In its proposals for extension of the Roaming Regulation<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission proposed a move to per second billing for retail and wholesale roaming calls. The Commission believes that this is an essential step to address the dilution and lack of effective harmonisation of the Eurotariff price ceiling. In relation to making a roaming call, the Commission considers that it is reasonable to allow a minimum initial charging period of up to 30 seconds at retail level so that operators are able to recover minimum fixed retail costs involved in setting up a call.</p>
<p>The Commission is hopeful that its proposals to extend the Roaming Regulation, including the new measures for billing unitisation, will be adopted by the Parliament and Council in time for customers to benefit this summer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission does not have quantitative data on the percentage of EU citizens using weight loss products since such products can be either centrally or nationally authorised medicinal products, with or without prescription or food suplements or even medical devices.</p>
<p>If weight loss products are medicinal products, they need according to EU legislation (Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) 726/2004), like any medicinal product, a marketing authorisation before being placed on the market in the EU. It may be authorised at the Community level by the Commission following an evaluation by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) or nationally by the Member State.</p>
<p>Assessments conducted before the marketing authorisation is granted, are based on scientific criteria to determine whether or not the products concerned meet the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements set out in the EU legislation. The Commission considers that the requirements in the EU legislation are adequate to assure a positive risk-benefit balance in favour of patients of these products once they reach the marketplace.</p>
<p>The testing of these medicinal products is defined in the scientific “Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products used in weight control” adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in 2006. This Guideline is intended to provide guidance for the clinical evaluation of medicinal products used to promote weight loss in obese adult patients. The efficacy testing of these medicinal products is clearly provided for and defined in this Guideline. Therefore, there are no plans to review the scope and tighten up the EU legislative framework regarding medicinal products against obesity.</p>
<p>Weight loss medicinal products are marketed as prescription as well as non- prescription medicinal products. Rules on the advertising of medicinal products for human use are harmonised under the Articles 86 to 100 of Directive 2001/83/EC. EU legislation forbids direct advertising to consumer of prescription medicines. It allows for advertising only of non-prescription medicines. This situation has not been changed by the current proposal (COM/2008/663).</p>
<p>As regards medical devices, in some rare cases, weight-loss products may fall under the medical devices legislation. The medical devices legislation sets requirements to ensure that devices do not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patients, of users or, where applicable, of other persons. As part of these requirements, the medical device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer. Moreover, it is required that conformity with the legal requirements must be demonstrated by means of clinical evaluation in accordance with Annex X of Directive 93/42/EEC.</p>
<p>Foods intended for use in energy restricted diets for weight-reduction are specially formulated foods which, when used as instructed by the manufacturer, may replace the whole or part of the total daily diet. They are part of the group of foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses (dietetic foods) for which specific provisions regarding the composition and labelling have been laid down by a specific Directive (Directive 96/8/EC on foods intended for use in energy restricted diets for weight-reduction<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>); specifications as regards the amount of energy provided by these foods as well as their content in protein, fat, fibre, vitamins, minerals and amino acids have been established after consultation of the Scientific Committee for Food. As regards the labelling, advertising and presentation of these products no reference in particular shall be made to the rate or amount of weight loss which may result from their use.</p>
<p>Without prejudice to Directive 96/8/EC, health claims referring to 'slimming or weight-control or a reduction in the sense of hunger or an increase in the sense of satiety or to the reduction of the available energy from the diet' are subject to the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) N°1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods<a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and are to be based on and substantiated by generally accepted scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Commission considers that the prevailing legal framework as such should ensure the safe placing on the market and use of weight loss products. The Commission therefore does not intend to take further action concerning these products. It should be stressed however, that it is of paramount importance that there is correct implementation in the Member States and subsequent follow-up by the competent authorities of the relevant EU legislation. If the Honourable Member is aware of any relevant information regarding lack of proper implementation, the Commission will analyse it and, if appropriate, take the necessary action.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>European companies are exploiting uranium in Northern Niger. Niger is one of the least developed countries. However, its people derive no benefit from these activities. On the contrary, exploitation of uranium is leading to an environmental and health disaster: the mines have high levels of radioactivity and the mining waste presents a health risk to the people who live alongside the mines. Moreover, groundwater has been drained for exploitation of the deposits. The EU must ensure that European companies established in Africa assume their responsibilities.</p>
<p>What is the Commission’s approach for ensuring that European uranium mining companies in Niger respect the local people’s right to good health and the need to preserve groundwater? Can the Commission make sure that the local people share the economic benefits of the mining, particularly by means of the trade agreements between the EU and Niger?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission is following closely the situation in Niger, where the exploitation of uranium affects several aspects of life in that country. First of all we must remember that this resource is essential for the budget of a state that is one of the least developed countries. Like the other mineral resources in the country, its contribution to the budget is significant on account of the activities of a number of European, Asian and American international companies.</p>
<p>The environmental impact of this exploitation is considerable and takes place in a context where the challenges to be tackled are multiple and often significant. One has only to mention desertification, deforestation and the problem of water. Environmental legislation in Niger to deal with these issues is considered completely acceptable. Implementing regulations, however, are all too often lacking and the civil service staff, both centrally and in the interior of the country, is often very inadequate, with the result that strategies and regulations can very rarely be implemented. That is why it is important to have adequate budgetary resources available. The Commission helps Niger to respond to these challenges through cooperation. Considerable resources from the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) for rural development and budgetary support are contributing to this effort, as well as specific projects from the 8th EDF that are still in progress, such as support for the Ministry of Mines, or sanitation and waste-water treatment at Arlit.</p>
<p>The exploitation of mineral resources, especially uranium, is also a source of internal conflict, particularly in the north of the country. The Commission has begun discussions with the Council about the problems linked with the issues of development and security in the region and it sees the participation of local people in resource management as essential for peacemaking, particularly through decentralisation, which it strongly supports and which is beginning to be translated into action. Major improvements in the management of local natural resources are anticipated on these bases, although local skills are still very weak.</p>
<p>With regard to transparency in the management of public funds and mineral resources, the Commission supports establishing commitments from Niger in connection with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), of which Niger is a signatory country. Under the Cotonou Agreement these issues will, on the one hand, be followed up in the context of implementation of the EDF, given the importance attached to issues of governance in the 10th EDF, and, on the other hand, these issues may be raised within the framework of political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p>With regard to any possible action against European companies or in the context of trade agreements between these companies and the authorities in Niger, the Commission has no actual competence in this area nor any right of sanction, but it supports adherence to codes of conduct such as the EITI, as mentioned above.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0188"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council's Directives for the negotiation by the Commission of a plurilateral anti-counterfeiting trade agreement (ACTA) do not provide for the creation of an "intellectual property group" to follow the ACTA negotitions (nor for any other expert or consultative groups of a non-governmental nature attached to the negotiations). However, in line with the negotiating mandate, the Commission will conduct the negotiations in consultation with relevant regular committees of the Council of Ministers of the EU, in particular the Article 133 Committee, but also the Council's Working Party on Intellectual Property. The latter is a regular body within the Council, consisting of representatives of the governments of the 27 EU Member States, which meets regularly to discuss intellectual property rights (IPR) related issues.</p>
<p>In order to involve civil society in the process of negotiation of ACTA, the Commission is also organising Stake-holders' Consultation meetings. A first one was held in June 2008, and a second one has taken place on 21 April 2009. These meetings were open to the public (individuals, companies, associations, press, NGOs, etc.) and are widely advertised. Additionally, the Commission has invited interested parties which were unable to attend the meetings to provide written submissions.</p>
<p>A different question is the possibility of providing ACTA with some kind of mechanism to involve stakeholders after the Agreement has been signed and entered into force. Since IPR are, by nature, private rights, the Commission considers that it could be valuable to foresee the possibility for interested parties to be associated to the functioning of ACTA. But this question, as well as any other aspects about the future institutional structure of ACTA, are still being negotiated and no final decisions have been taken.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0189"></a>

<p>(EN) Article 7.3 of the Code of Conduct for computerized reservation systems (CRS) is very clear on the protection of business data. It provides that any marketing, booking and sales data resulting from the use of the distribution facilities of a CRS by a travel agent established in the Community shall include no identification either directly or indirectly of that travel agent. This applies unless the travel agent and the CRS agree on the conditions for the use of such data. This applies equally to the supply of such data by the CRS to any other party for use by this party other than for billing settlement.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission can confirm to the Honourable Member that airlines are covered by Article 7.3 of the above legislation relating to the disclosure of travel agent identity in all marketing, booking and sales data products.</p>

<p>The Commission confirms that only agreements respecting the rights of anonymity protected by Article 7.3 and in force after March 29th 2009 will be valid under the Code of Conduct.

<p>(EN) The current Community rules on individual identification and traceability of sheep and goats were prompted by the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001 in the United Kingdom (UK), and the subsequent reports of the Parliament, the Court of Auditors and the so-called "Anderson report" to the UK House of Commons that indicated that the existing "batch" traceability system was unreliable.</p>
<p>Electronic identification is the most cost-effective way to achieve individual traceability in particular when animals are frequently moved through markets and fattening farms. It is now ready to be used under practical farming conditions, even the most difficult ones.</p>
<p>In December 2007 the Council, supported by an opinion of the Parliament, established that electronic identification will be compulsory for animals born after 31 December 2009, with limited exceptions.</p>
<p>The Commission is taking all reasonable measures to facilitate the smooth introduction of these rules and with this aim it has recently published an economic study to assist Member States and sheep farmers to minimize implementation costs.</p>
<p>Financial support may also be granted to sheep farmers within the framework of the rural development policy or by means of state aids.</p>

<p>(FR) In general, the Youth in Action Programme is implemented with the intention of reaching the greatest possible number of organisations, whatever their size, even small, informal groups of young people in some cases. It does not therefore particularly target larger organisations.</p>
<p>With regard to Action 4.1 in particular (2% of the programme’s budget), it should be noted that it aims to support organisations likely to have a major impact on young people. It is true that the criteria for awarding these operating grants include the number of activities planned by the grant applicant. The number of activities, however, is not the only criterion taken into account in making an award. In accordance with the decision whereby the programme was established, only organisations whose structure covers at least eight countries that participate in the programme are considered eligible for grants. That means we can be sure of their impact, despite a relatively small budget.</p>
<p>Since 2007 Action 4.1 has made it possible to support medium-sized or even small organisations. The grants paid out in 2009 to certain organisations do not exceed EUR 45 000, but may nonetheless represent up to 80% of their annual budgets.</p>
<p>The Commission considers it right to continue with this approach, so as to provide a certain structure in this section of the programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0194"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware that mobile road transport activities imply special constraints and risks. Specific measures have been taken at Community level to improve road safety, prevent the distortion of competition and guarantee the safety and health of mobile workers. In this context, the Commission draws the Honourable Member's attention to Directive 2002/15/EC<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities, which is a Lex specialis in relation to the general Working Time Directive<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and seeks to provide solutions to problems specific to the road transport sector.</p>
<p>As from March 2009, self-employed drivers are to be covered by Directive 2002/15/EC, without prejudice to a review exercise, to be conducted by the Commission, which could result in their inclusion or exclusion from that Directive's scope.</p>
<p>In this connection, with a view to complying with Directive 2002/15/EC, the Commission has reported on the consequences of excluding self-employed drivers from the scope of the Directive and now proposes to amend its scope to include 'bogus' self-employed workers but to exclude genuine self-employed drivers.</p>

The recent scientific draft produced by the US Department of Health and Human Services (Agency for Toxic and Disease Registry) entitled ‘Toxicological Profile for Chromium’ of September 2008 (Chapter 3.2.2. ‘Oral Exposure’) indicates that the systematic ingestion of substances containing hexavalent chromium produced serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, haematological, hepatic and renal disorders, together with cancer, in human subjects and in animals used as guinea pigs.

<p>(EN) The Commission is currently assessing the toxicological profile for chromium presented by the US Department of Health and Human Services (ATSDR<a href="#defann_48_6" name="refann_48_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>). This draft report develops the toxicological differences between trivalent (III) and hexavalent chromium (VI).</p>
<p>In its reply to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0775_EN.html">H-0775/07</a> the Commission already stated that hexavalent chromium was recognised as the most toxic of the three valences in which chromium occurs, which is confirmed and substantiated by the draft report in the case of inhalatory exposure. However, for oral and chronic exposure (which applies to drinking water), there is no solid evidence in the report for quantitative comparison of risks related to exposure to hexa- and trivalent chromium.</p>
<p>The Commission acknowledges the findings published in the draft report, which indicate that oral intake of hexavalent chromium can be carcinogenic for rats<a href="#defann_48_7" name="refann_48_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>, and that for accidentally very high intake by humans (higher than 100mg/person/day), cardiovascular and renal effects have been reported. The Commission takes also into account that the EU risk assessment on chromium (VI) substances<a href="#defann_48_8" name="refann_48_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> concluded that for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity no threshold below which there would be no risk to human health can be identified.</p>
<p>The Commission is very concerned about the risks caused by the intake of chromium and will remain focussed on the evolution of health standards as published by inter alia the World Health Organisation both for chromium (III) and for chromium (VI). It will take toxicological and scientific evolution into account for the revision of the Drinking Water Directive<a href="#defann_48_9" name="refann_48_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, it must be repeated that the Drinking Water Directive's limit values apply to drinking water as it is delivered and not to river- and ground water in the Voiotia and Evvia area</p>
<p>Referring to the Commission's reply to question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2008-5250_EN.html">E-5250/08</a>, the Commission confirms that the Greek authorities have forwarded updated information to the Commission on the authorisation regime of the industrial units of the wider region (Voiotia and Eastern Attiki) and carried out continued inspections of the industrial units.</p>
<p>The results of the controls carried out by the national authorities demonstrate the lack of adequate planning and management of hazardous waste. The Commission has already brought a horizontal infringement case on the latter issue against Greece before the Court (C-286/08). The example of Asopos has been used in the framework of this infringement procedure, which is currently pending before the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>In addition, it appears that the Greek authorities have taken adequate measures to comply with the requirements of the Directive on Drinking Water (i.e. no further exceedances of the limit values for chromium were observed).</p>
<p>As regards the obligations resulting from Directive 2006/11/EC<a href="#defann_48_10" name="refann_48_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a> on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community and Directive 80/68/EEC<a href="#defann_48_11" name="refann_48_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a> on the protection of groundwater against pollution caused by certain dangerous substances, the information available has not allowed the Commission to identify and adequately substantiate any possible breaches. The Commission will continue the assessment of the information available and will take all necessary measures, including, if required, the initiation of an infringement procedure, to ensure that EC environmental legislation is complied with.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The dairy industries in Greece are ruthlessly eliminating small dairy farmers - who are responding with demonstrations - by constantly lowering producer prices for cow's milk in order to increase their profits. One of the major companies has announced that, as of 1 May 2009, the milk cartel is to stop buying milk from 120 small producers and will limit the distribution of fresh milk in favour of long-life milk, increasing imports. Another dairy industry has announced a reduction in milk prices and an extension of the payment period by one month. The number of milk producers in Greece has fallen by 80% over the last 15 years and production, which is no more than 800 000 tonnes, covers less than one half of consumption.</p>
<p>What is the Commission's position on the disappearance of small and medium-sized dairy farmers in a country with a milk production deficit, the reduction in producer prices with a simultaneous increase in consumer prices, the abrupt change in consumer habits and the reduction in nutritious substances in milk through limiting the consumption of fresh milk caused by the CAP and the relentless pursuit of profit?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Subsequent reforms have changed the Common Agricultural Policy into a policy with lower guaranteed prices coupled with direct income support to allow farmers to better react to market signals.</p>
<p>The more targeted rural development measures give the Member State the possibility to address specific problems or priorities in the respective Member States, for example support for small farms. Small farmers, receiving less than € 5000 direct income support are not subject to reductions under modulation.</p>
<p>In the Health Check it was decided to allow the redistribution of funds via the so called Article 68 and modulation.</p>
<p>Article 68 provides for the possibility to use funds to address specific disadvantages affecting, amongst others, dairy farmers.</p>
<p>Modulation provides additional funds for the so called new challenges, including restructuring of the dairy sector.</p>
<p>This clearly shows the importance the Commission gives to milk farmers.</p>
<p>While Greek raw milk prices are among the highest in the EU-27, the Commission does agree that it is unusual that farm gate milk prices are decreasing while retail prices are increasing, especially if a large share of Greek milk is sold via the Greek retail channel.</p>
<p>The Commission will implement in 2009 the roadmap proposed in its Communication "Food Prices in Europe" through a joint Task Force involving relevant Directorates General (including DG AGRI). This work will feed into a wider analysis of the retail sector in Europe, currently conducted by the Commission. The final reports for both undertakings are expected at the end of 2009.</p>
<p>As regards the roadmap mentioned above, the Commission therefore intends to conduct a review of the main potential anti-competitive practices in the food supply chain, including an analysis of the distribution of bargaining power within the chain. It also plans to review regulations impacting the food supply chain in order to identify potential simplification of regulations at Community, national and local levels. Another objective of the Commission's roadmap will be to design and set-up a permanent tool to monitor the functioning of the whole food supply chain and to provide increased transparency on consumer prices and pass-through mechanisms.</p>
<p>Therefore you can be assured that competitiveness in the food supply chain remains high on the Commission's agenda.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0198"></a>

<p>Currently, the International Maritime Organisation is preparing a tool for enhancing the environmental performance of new ships.

<p>(FR) Short sea shipping often offers advantages in terms of economics, energy, security and infrastructure costs compared with overland transport operating between the same geographical areas. That is why the European Commission supports short sea shipping through its programmes and legislation and in international negotiations.</p>
<p>The trend towards an increase in congestion, the desire to reduce pressure on the environment, and economic constraints will further enhance the advantages of this mode of transport in the medium term. For short sea shipping to play its full part, however, its intrinsic qualities must also be improved and in particular there must be a further reduction in conventional and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to propose, in the appropriate international forums as well as at European level, proactive but balanced legislative and support measures for short sea shipping. To this end it will continue to prepare intiatives applying the rules of good governance and, in particular, analysing as thoroughly as possible the advantages and disadvantages that they bring for operators in general.</p>
<p>With regard to the specific question of the development by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) of a CO2 index for the design of new ships (Energy Efficiency Design Index, EEDI), the Commission supports the work of the IMO in aiming to develop an index appropriate for most ships. Nonetheless, it has to be said that there is much still to be done and issues regarding the application of this index have yet to be addressed in the IMO. The Commission will pay particular attention to the arrangements for any potential application of the index to ships operating on short sea shipping lines. Furthermore, the index is one of several instruments that would apply to new ships. There are measures being prepared for existing ships, in particular the development of a CO2 index for the operation of ships, voluntary measures in relation to the ship’s operation and the development of a financial instrument such as a mechanism for trading emission rights or a fund fed by a tax on marine fuels.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0200"></a>

It also considers that the public pension insurance system does not constitute a social security scheme but a professional insurance system, which means that there are no guarantees in respect of age limits, the level of pensions and benefits in general. The judgment paves the way for the privatisation of social security in the public and private sectors, while making employment relations more flexible, reducing the social security rights of men and women and exacerbating in the extreme the problems faced by working-class families.</p>

<p>(FR) In its judgment in the case of the Commission v. Greece made on 26 March 2009, the European Court of Justice condemned Greece for having failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 141 of the EC Treaty, which lays down the principle of equal pay for men and women.</p>
<p>According to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, retirement pensions constitute pay for the purposes of Article 141 of the EC Treaty when they are paid to workers because of the working relationship linking them to their former employers. In the matter in question, the Court held that pensions paid under Greek law met the criteria laid down by the Court’s case law and could therefore be treated as pay for the purposes of the Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission emphasises that the Court considered that the disputed provisions of the pension scheme in question in this matter did not remedy the problems that female workers might encounter during their professional careers but that, on the contrary, by being limited to granting female workers more favourable conditions than those applicable to male workers with respect to retirement age and minimum service required at the point of retirement, these provisions were discriminatory.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be pointed out that the Court’s judgment concerns solely the problem of the age difference on retirement for men and women. It does not in any way affect the organisation of the system, whether it be public or private, the number of years of contribution necessary before taking retirement or the amount of benefits.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0204"></a>
