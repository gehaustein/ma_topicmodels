This is a cyclical crisis, caused by the difficult economic situation, which has led to a decline in milk consumption and created stagnant markets, with the prices paid to producers in free fall.</p>
<p class="contents">The prices paid to milk producers have plummeted everywhere, averaging 24 cents per litre within the European Union. Many economic operators are in an even more serious situation, as they get prices of less than 20-21 cents, when their production costs come to at least 40 cents per litre.</p>
<p class="contents">Other markets, such as the cereal, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets, are showing some alarming signs too. On this front, first of all, we should continue to make use of all the measures at our disposal so as to stabilise the market and to stimulate an upturn in consumption, but at the same time we need to be able to look to the future with medium- and long-term policies and to do everything possible to identify acceptable and lasting solutions aimed at minimising the risk of price fluctuations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the Commission proposals extending the intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder have been welcomed and accepted within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the unanimous vote of 2 September demonstrates. We believe, however, that these proposals are not enough to mitigate the serious consequences of the crisis in the sector. That is why, still in relation to the adoption of the European Commission’s proposal, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted an amendment to my proposal that also reintroduces aid for private storage of cheese, which was abolished under the health check on the common agricultural policy in November 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a unanimous decision, Madam President, Commissioner, representing what are, in essence, identical views shared by the members of the Committee on Agriculture, which I have the honour of chairing, and expressing our desire to send out a strong signal to the Council and the Commission at a sensitive time for an extremely important sector for European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as being a first important demonstration of the positive leadership that we as the European Parliament want to provide when looking ahead to codecision in agricultural matters too, this is a measure that can also offer immediate help to dairy farmers, who are grappling with an increasingly difficult market and with an obvious and dramatic fall in sales.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these initial measures, on which we will vote today, are not enough to support the producers in crisis, and that is why the Committee on Agriculture, through an oral question and a resolution on which we are preparing to vote, is calling on the European Commission to introduce new and effective measures to combat the crisis and to support the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to encourage and at the same time support the European Commission in the process of deciding what must be done to end the crisis in the European dairy farming sector once and for all. In this sense we hope that the Commission will provide an exhaustive answer to our questions and will take our proposals seriously, so that interinstitutional cooperation produces the results that European agriculture deserves and shows its solidarity by offering practical support to European farmers in crisis, who need our help today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to say that I am very happy with the questions put by the Committee on Agriculture, because this gives me an excellent opportunity to clarify the actions that have already been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also thank Parliament for its ongoing work in this area. We are all committed to finding solutions. You are, and so am I.</p>
<p class="contents">Not everyone agrees with my preferred solutions, but I strongly believe that these solutions are working, that they will work, and they are also solutions that we can defend politically.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Paolo De Castro asked on behalf of the Committee that we say what we are actually doing. The top line is good news: prices are improving. For example, in the course of one month butter prices went up by 4% in France, 8% in Germany and even more in the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">Skimmed milk powder also went up by 4% in France and Germany, and 2-3% if we look at the average all over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Average milk prices have been going up, and Albert Deß just told me this morning that the spot market prices are now at 30 cents in certain areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see that intervention buying on cheese has almost stopped because the market price is higher than the intervention price, which is another positive signal.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not yet where we want to be, but we are heading in the right direction. This makes me more confident than ever before that the policy approach that we have been taking from the very beginning is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">You know the key elements of what we have been doing. We have been using all the market measures available and here we expect to spend approximately EUR 600 million over a 12-month period.</p>
<p class="contents">We have indicated the possibility for Member States to start the direct payment of the single farm payment to farmers from 16 October instead of 1 December, and we decided under the 2003 reform to decouple the dairy premium – EUR 5 billion every year – and transport it directly into the single payment scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the recovery package and the decisions taken in the health check that provide another EUR 4.2 billion to face the new challenges, including restructuring in the dairy sector. All this of course is on top of what we can do under the rural development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Just for clarification to Paolo De Castro, intervention for cheese was actually abolished in 1994. I think there must be some confusion between intervention and private storage because private storage was abolished by the decisions in the health check.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, our current approach seems to be working. I am therefore more determined than ever before not to go back to the future in ways which would hurt our dairy sector in the long term and leave our farmers without any kind of predictability.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, making a U-turn on the health check decision is not an option and something that the European Council, the heads of state, explicitly asked me not to do.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the idea of keeping the quota system after 2013 is not on the table. Freezing quotas is not on the table, and neither is any return to the use of certain expensive but inefficient market instruments of the past. They are not on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">This certainly does not mean that we have now done the job in terms of policy. I think it is time for further action. We need to follow up on the dairy report from this July, use the measures in there and then decide on other actions for the longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">If I could start with the report, I will look first at state aid. The report floated the idea that Member States could temporarily offer aid of up to EUR 15 000 for farmers under this temporary crisis framework. The Commission has actually already launched the boat and expects to change the rules in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is streamlining the procedures for responding to prices in the dairy sector. At this moment, milk is not actually included in Article 186 of the single Common Market Organisation which allows the Commission to take temporary actions quickly under its own power during times of market disturbances. I am therefore proposing that we include the dairy sector in Article 186, and this will enable us to spring into action in the future if we hit serious problems in the dairy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, our recent extension of intervention had to be approved by the Council, and Parliament voted on this as well, but, if the dairy sector had been included in this Article 186, we could have acted immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally speaking, we could with almost immediate effect mobilise measures stimulating demand and/or we could limit the marketing of milk, and all this would only be put in place on a temporary basis and under the condition that we had the necessary financing available.</p>
<p class="contents">The third follow-up point from the report concerns the buying-up schemes by Member States. One way to restructure is that Member States can actually buy quotas from farmers and put these quotas into the national reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the national reserve counts in a sense as part of the Member States’ total quota, so if individual producers go over their quota, but Member States as a whole do not exceed their quota, with the national reserve included, then no super levy is actually paid.</p>
<p class="contents">What I intend to propose is that bought-up quota kept within the national reserve will not count as part of the national quota when it comes to deciding whether we have to add or to ask the farmers to pay the super levy or not.</p>
<p class="contents">If the super levy should then be collected anyway, then the part corresponding to the bought-up quota could then be used for restructuring. It might sound a bit complicated, but it is actually a very efficient tool.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these steps are actions that we are taking now with an almost immediate impact on the markets, but we also need to do something about steps for the medium and longer term. I would like to thank France and Germany here for their ideas and their input on these different possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The first longer-term issue is about using contractual relations between milk farmers and the dairy industry to better balance supply and demand in the dairy market.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a much, much better approach than the quota system, and it already works in parts of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Milk producers and dairies have clear agreements which remove a lot of the uncertainty. On the other hand, some Member States simply do not use this possibility, but this can be changed by looking for a legal framework for these contractual relations, whilst clearly safeguarding fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The second long-term issue is about the balance of power, and you know that we have had this discussion a lot of times. We need to be able to see within the whole chain from primary producer to supermarket chains where the added value is disappearing.</p>
<p class="contents">We will look into future markets as well and, finally, I think a lot can be done on production costs and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to deal properly with all these ideas for the medium and long term, I want to establish a working group with experts from the Member States and the Commission so they can go to the heart of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the problem in the dairy market is not only an issue between the Commission and Member States. Parliament actually plays an important role as well, and I am looking forward to the discussion here today on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for being so patient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The dairy sector is in trouble. Many dairy farmers are seeing their very existence under threat. The main reason for this is a huge drop in milk product sales. The Commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also have preferred to see stronger sales promotion measures instead of a greater amount of intervention, such as butter fat being used once again in the ice cream industry. Last year, when the price of butter reached more than EUR 4 for a short time, a large proportion of the ice cream industry stopped processing butter fat. I know the figures for Germany, which show that around 100 000 tonnes is no longer being processed by the food industry, which corresponds to a million tonnes of milk. We must try to stimulate sales once again, in order to clear these quantities from the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the groups that have helped in drawing up our joint motion for a resolution. Unfortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not participate in this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as a short-term measure we are calling for an increase in the de minimis subsidies in an additional motion which is being tabled with 40 signatures, because this would be an opportunity to help the smaller dairy farmers in particular. It would also make sense to introduce an early retirement regulation. I know a lot of farmers who are 58 years old and who would like to stop working soon. An appropriate regulation would be needed for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to thank you sincerely for your work. I would ask you to put in place appropriate regulations to improve the situation of our dairy farmers. Perhaps you will still have the chance to remedy this situation in the near future.</p>

There is no doubt that we must take action to alleviate their pain, but let me make it very clear that this is a short-term crisis which requires short-term market measures by the Commission, as outlined in the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also be clear that, for too long, European consumers have paid for a dysfunctional agricultural policy which has failed both farmers and consumers.

Tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed in rural areas. The European Union had counted on growth in world demand. Its experts got it very wrong. The financial and economic crisis that we are experiencing has direct effects on agriculture and consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision by Mrs Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture, to maintain the increase in quotas and the Council’s wish to dismantle them by 2015 are a provocation to milk producers. Times have changed. European policy must be adjusted to suit a new global environment. The milk prices imposed on producers do not cover production costs. On each litre of milk, some small farmers are losing up to 30 cents. At the end of the year, many of them will not have made a single euro, or will even have lost money. Some of them, too, as we are told by regional officials, are today going so far as to take their own lives.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of this unprecedented crisis, the European Union must take significant steps, quickly. We call upon the Heads of State or Government who are meeting this evening to prepare for the G20 to place the issue of the dairy crisis on the agenda for their meeting, so that appropriate steps can be taken to respond to livestock farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must boost the negotiation capacities of dairy farms, so that they are no longer subject to the dictates of the agri-food industry. It should also put in place a safety net to guarantee a remunerative price so that the price never falls below the production costs. The European Union must put a stop to its export refunds programme. It has just committed the enormous sum of EUR 480 million, adopted with the backing of various parliamentary groups from both the right and the left, in order to sell its surpluses cheaply on the world markets. It is destroying hundreds of thousands of farming jobs in the south and is cynically pushing farmers to move off the land or to immigrate.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, the European Union must immediately make drastic reductions, of 5%, in European milk quotas, in a way that is inversely proportional to the volume delivered by small producers, in order to swiftly re-establish a balance between supply and demand. A laisser-faire policy is unacceptable. It has terrible consequences in terms of employment and land use patterns.</p>
<p class="contents">Without the small farmers, there will be no Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They sat on their hands for too long, and many farmers have suffered grievously for that. We can either decide to help the industry, or we can decide that we will ultimately let our farmers go out of business: then we can import from abroad with all the problems that brings us.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome your remarks for the future, Commissioner, but I am not happy about your remarks for the short term. I think we need to do more in the short term to help the industry through this present crisis. Those short-term measures require immediate action.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I remember the time of the milk lakes and the butter mountains, and I do not want to go back to that. I do not think anybody in the industry wants to go back to that situation: neither the farmer, nor the processors, nor the Commission nor we in this Parliament. We do not want to return to that, but one of the main problems I see at this moment in time is that, while the farmers have taken a drastic reduction in what they are receiving for their milk, consumers are paying almost the same as they paid before.</p>
<p class="contents">Until we tackle the power of the supermarkets in this area we will not have the answer. They have to be controlled. We need an ombudsman, someone who can tell the supermarkets that they are acting beyond their remit, that they are ripping the people off, ripping the farmers off and putting them out of business in the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We therefore insist on supporting the need to maintain the quota system, albeit with readjustments to adapt them to the needs of each individual country, including the scrapping of the annual 1% increase until 2015. Does she not believe that, at a time of such serious crisis in the dairy sector, what is more important than deregulation of the sector and liberalisation of international trade is support for agriculture and the dairy sector in the Member States, so as to promote rural areas and employment with rights? Does she not consider it essential to create an extraordinary support fund for the dairy sector at Community level, benefiting the most affected producers and countries, and to define new forms of aid for milk and meat production? I consider it necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my country, in Northern Ireland, the dairy sector is of vital importance. When the dairy sector struggles, the rest of the rural economy struggles. Currently dairy farmers receive just over 20 cents per litre for milk amid escalating costs. In Northern Ireland not only have they had to contend with poor milk prices and high costs, but we have suffered a third consecutive wet summer and this has had a devastating effect on the dairy industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">It was distressing last night to see farmers in Belgium so angry and feeling so helpless that they are spraying milk onto their fields in protest at the poor price of milk and the difficulties that they too are encountering. The Commission has taken welcome steps to put a base on the market but we cannot sustain prices at an uneconomically low level.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to take short-term measures to help: measures that will increase demand for milk; measures that will cut the cost of production; measures that will address the supply chain with its decreasing farm-gate prices and high supermarket prices; and measures that in the long term will create a sustainable industry and a future for young farmers who are experiencing severe difficulties with low prices and high bank charges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the weekend I met a group of Irishwomen called ‘Farm Women for a Fair Price’ and I think we should note the words ‘fair price’ because producers are not getting a decent or fair price – and that is what this debate is about.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be churlish not to welcome the comments from the Commissioner about a stability coming into the market place, although at a very low level, and I acknowledge that the Commission has taken steps and spent money to bring stability to the market place. It is just that it is not enough and it did not happen quickly enough and we have a severe crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say that, in relation to the future, your comments are particularly welcome. I am worried that this House is divided on the issue of milk quotas because when we have codecision, if the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, we are going to have to think more coherently as a group and give clear signals to farmers rather than divided messages, so let me repeat that your comments about making links between producers and processors, about production levels, are something we need to explore, something we have to have a further debate on.</p>
<p class="contents">But we need to ask you, Commissioner, what type of market support measures do you think will exist in the absence of quotas that can ensure a fair and decent price to our producers? And, also, please tackle the marketplace: it is not working. Everybody says they are making no money from milk, including the supermarkets –which I doubt profusely – but we need more clarity, and we need fairness for farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that there are two parts to this debate. There is the immediate question of how we can extricate ourselves from this crisis. All measures, ranging from assistance for farmers to intervention measures, are necessary – in fact, absolutely necessary. We must endorse them and even call for them to be enlarged in scope. That is what we, together with several fellow Members, are proposing here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the structural question regarding the management of the dairy market, and this is where our views diverge from yours, Commissioner. You propose that we move in the direction of using contractual relations. I can tell you in advance that introducing contractual relations between industrial firms and farmers will, in the long term, result in those industries competing with each other, on a Europe-wide scale.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to regulate a market, we need public regulation. There is no other solution. After this crisis, that is what the debate must be about. I think that, in this debate, we must respect all opinions and all options; I fear that we acted too quickly at the time of the health check to settle an issue such as quotas, which up until now, as I would like to point out to all those who have spoken, have made it possible to maintain dairy production in Europe, to ensure that the dairy industry is highly developed and, at the same time, to keep prices at a level that was easily affordable for customers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The livelihoods of dairy farmers are under serious threat.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission’s decision to extend the intervention period for butter and skimmed-milk powder until 2010 is very much welcome, short-term measures would not alleviate the pressure on dairy farmers in the long term. Actions must be taken now that will manage, not just the current difficulties, but are long-term and will ensure a sustainable and successful industry into the future. Financial assistance is required by dairy farmers immediately. The creation of an EU dairy fund of EUR 600 million, as called for by Parliament in the 2009 budget procedure, is urgently needed. Dairy farmers are entitled to fair prices, and an appropriate system of price supports is required to guarantee milk producers a reasonable minimum price per litre and a reasonable income for them to survive. Irish and European dairy farmers must not be forced out of business and I urge the Commission and the Council to take immediate and effective action.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, may I say to you that you have been a very successful Commissioner, and I pay tribute to the immense work you have done.

The current situation is unsustainable and requires a political solution. Clearly, the measures adopted to date by the Commission have been unable to alleviate the crisis or provide a viable alternative to the quota replacement scheme planned for 2015. As a result, in Spain for example – Galicia to be precise – 14 000 milk producers have had to cope with root-and-branch restructuring in order to continue living and working on the land, but today they are still on the verge of imminent disappearance.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, in the same way that the Commission has intervened in other sectors, it must also intervene in the milk sector, by regulating production, redistributing quotas, offering temporary compensation, encouraging product traceability and helping to bring producers and consumers closer together by correcting the dysfunctions caused by the distribution oligopoly.</p>
<p class="contents">Why has the Commission not positively intervened to prevent the negative consequences of this oligopoly established by the major distributors?</p>

I feel that the biggest problem lies with the retail industry, which is making huge profits off the backs of our dairy farmers. When we see what the supermarkets are charging consumers for milk, and then look at what the dairy farmer actually receives, the difference is just incredible.</p>
<p class="contents">The work and the major cost in producing milk are borne by the farmer, but at the same time the supermarkets are reaping huge profits. The margin that the farmer receives is so unfair. We need to put pressure on the supermarkets to pay a fair price to the industry, and it is my view that the price of milk in the supermarkets will not have to change. The consumer will not have to pay any more for their milk. The supermarkets need to reduce their profit margins. It is quite scandalous when we see the massive profits that these supermarkets are enjoying every year and at the same time our dairy industry is struggling. If action is not taken on the issue in the very near future then I really do believe that many of our dairy farmers in Wales, and the rest of the UK, will go out of business.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one quick point on what the Commissioner said this morning about the super levy. I am concerned by those comments. I think it will hit our most efficient producers – those who have risen to the challenge, responded to the market and invested heavily in their farms, following a lead from the Commission that quotas will be abolished. Imposing a super levy goes against the structural changes which both the EU and the UK Government claim to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This type of measure would not only not provide a solution, but would be a mistake, at least from the following points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is no basic economic link between the increase in milk quotas and the fall in market prices. Quotas have increased, while production has fallen. I cannot see where the link is. The market itself offers the explanation for falling prices. I believe that setting fixed quotas would lead to a rise in prices over time. However, the beneficiaries will be, once again, not the producers, but the processors and retailers. If we want to limit production we should perhaps encourage producers to stop livestock rearing voluntarily, by providing incentives rather than measures which could distort the market. Assuming quotas are frozen, what is going to happen when, for instance, demand on the global market picks up again? What could European producers do? Because dairy production does not have a tap that we can just turn off and on…</p>

<p class="contents">As I was saying, what could European producers do, assuming demand on the global market picks up again? Because dairy production does not have a tap that we can just turn off and on willy-nilly. If we were to cut production now, farmers would obviously give up cow rearing, but it would be very difficult to replenish the livestock when we realise that what some people now imagine would be a good measure is, in reality, a big mistake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, intervention is perfectly acceptable for a short period if the price of milk has reached rock bottom, and additional subsidies, loans and funds to combat the crisis are justified. However, what is totally unacceptable is, firstly, to start up discussions about milk quotas again and, secondly, to reintroduce tax-funded export refunds for products supplied to developing countries.

<p class="contents">There are, however, two points that I want to make. Firstly, in my view, the implementation of the super levy at this time would be inappropriate.

<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to recognise that there is little or no direct relationship between the price in the retail sector and the raw material price received at the farm gate. That is what I term a dysfunctional price-chain mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">The major influence will always be the global marketplace, and we have to recognise that the global marketplace will always be volatile.

<p class="contents">You should know that it takes a wise woman to recognise that she was wrong. That is a saying in Spain, which could very well be applied to this situation. For months the milk sector has been suffering one of the worst crises in its history. Despite that, because the European Commission and certain governments – seemingly including my own, the Spanish Government – do not want to allow their arms to be twisted, they are refusing to go back on the decisions relating to the health check of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Those decisions were taken without any thought for the fragility of this sector, and in a market context very different from the one that has developed since that compromise was agreed. It makes you think that the Member States did not want to see, or could not see, at that time, the storm that was approaching. The reform has very quickly become irrelevant, due to the major turnaround in the market, which demonstrates that the sector is totally at the mercy of price volatility.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that major producers such as France and Germany – countries which, in absolute terms, obtained the biggest increase in their national production quotas in this agreement – are now the ones asking for a review of the health check decisions raises a lot of issues.</p>

They receive only 19 cents per litre. The crisis is caused by an over-abundant supply of milk, which is making prices drop sharply. Deregulation is encouraging volatility, and market conditions now are totally the opposite of what they were a short time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, please stop stubbornly hiding behind choices made last year and take into account what is really happening on the ground now!</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is also to blame, firstly for not being here to listen to the debate, but also for not taking decisions, because it is swayed more by purely national interests than by a European vision of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The market is not working. There is over-production. It would be very simple to freeze the 1% increase in quotas, or to reduce the quotas immediately by 3 to 5%, because we urgently need to come up with some short-term solutions. Adopting this measure would kill two birds with one stone: we would give the producers a decent price once again and, by reducing production, we would reduce the European bill of hundreds of millions of euros spent on various interventions, including export refunds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They still receive very little money for their products, below the viability threshold. This also applies to those farmers who have invested a great deal of money, including EU funding and loans. This situation is plunging them into further difficulties, and they are unable to meet their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these problems, I would like to talk about the future. Today, we have to react to what is happening right now, but we also have to think about what lies ahead and plan our common policy to take farmers into account as well. At this juncture, I would like to repeat the following: the common policy in respect of dairy farmers needs to involve plans for sensible investments in this sector, so that we can avoid spending money which, as a result of increased production, will land us in the kind of trouble we find ourselves facing today.

<p class="contents">The new Member States are still at a particular disadvantage because of phasing-in, as we are receiving just 60% of the subsidies from the envelope in Brussels this year. As a counterbalance to this, the Hungarian government proposed increasing the quota-based subsidies, but the Commission did not respond positively to this suggestion or to the one from France, specifically from the French ministry, either. I finally call on my fellow Members to support the amendments from Mr Le Foll and his colleagues.

I recognise that Europe’s dairy farmers are facing a crisis on a major scale, but I simply do not understand how my fellow Members can think that you, in the Commission, have not done enough. I would definitely like to call on you, Mrs Fischer Boel, to reiterate what you have done. It seems to me that the list of initiatives coming from the Commission is a long one, in fact it is almost too long. It is almost as if we are destroying the progress that we made in connection with the health check. I would also like to point out that the efforts that have been made thus far on behalf of the dairy farmers have clearly not been mirrored in relation to those workers in the car industry who have lost their jobs or those workers in the shipbuilding industry who have lost their jobs as a result of the current economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">So I can only ask that we take a little care about how we handle this crisis and that we also make sure that we do not destroy the sound progress that was made, despite everything, as a result of the health check. The idea of freezing the milk quotas is, I think, completely hopeless! Nor can we go back to the old models by granting export refunds – that simply ruins the market for someone elsewhere in the world. We have to be careful. Commissioner, I would nonetheless like to ask you to reiterate the long list of activities that you have already undertaken so that my fellow Members can see that there is certainly no need for us to go crazy and start enacting numerous additional measures with the result that we destroy the sound progress that has been made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What that means is that our producers are in the process of decapitalising.</p>
<p class="contents">Just now, you listed the measures you have taken in the past nine months. Those measures do exist, we will grant you that. They have not, however, produced the anticipated effects because, in our view, they are not extensive enough, and there is definitely too much uncertainty about how effective their target is.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning you mentioned a recovery in the market, but the producers will certainly only see the effects of this in the payments made at the beginning of next year. The agricultural products market is not the same as the market in metals or the energy market. It calls for regulatory tools, because the cycles of the seasons and nature also have an effect on market conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Your interpretation of the health check, carried out under the French Presidency, surprises us, since the interim assessments that it produced in relation to the dairy sector leave all avenues open, including the possibility of new decisions on tools for regulating the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The French delegation, to which I belong, is convinced that a renewed quotas system will be necessary after 2013. The tension that existed on the food products market prior to the current economic crisis has demonstrated the fragility of the balance across the world between production and consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">After having partially dismantled the intervention tools, we have neither the right nor the legitimacy to dismantle today the production tools that we will need in the short term.</p>

The fact is we need a restrictive system for the dairy industry.

In my view, this is an insult to our farmers. The main problem is the price at which milk is purchased from farmers. In the Czech Republic, for example, the purchase price is up to 25% lower than the production cost, but the price of the finished product which is then sold in the shops would easily cover all the farmers’ costs. The main problem, therefore, is that there is a large hole somewhere. This problem has to be resolved. In the Czech Republic we now have fewer cattle than we had after the Napoleonic wars.

Surely there is a problem with a model or system where a huge quantity of soya is imported from Latin America, for instance, thereby increasing the oversupply in Europe while destroying the environment in Latin America. In the ensuing crisis, we then rack our brains about whether we should export agricultural produce to the developing world at dumped prices, therefore ruining the market over there, along with the situation of smallholders and producers.

I have actually listened very carefully. But of course I have also noted the different views that I have heard among the different Members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the quota system; it seems to be the scapegoat of this whole situation in which we find ourselves. I do not underestimate – and I have been very precise on this since the very beginning of the discussion – that the dairy sector, not only in Europe but globally, finds itself in an unprecedented crisis. That must be very clear. So I certainly do understand the frustration that I see among farmers in different parts of Europe, not all over, but in different parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The abolition of the quota system was decided back in 2003 so it is not a decision that was taken overnight while nobody knew what was happening. Then, in the health check, we had the discussion on increasing the quotas to try to find a soft landing for the dairy farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">But I think that those who want to point their finger at the quota system for being the reason for all the problems in which dairy farmers find themselves are wrong. Because we see that even with a quota system in place, we have not been able to maintain high prices and the structural changes in the dairy sector have taken place anyway. If you look at 1984, when the quota system was introduced, we had 1.6 million dairy farmers in the old EU-10. Today in EU-10 we have 300 000 dairy farmers: less than one fifth of the number of dairy farmers today compared to 1984 with a quota system in place. So these structural changes are taking place anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that going back or rolling back the decision in the health check is the right policy, and here I am supported by all heads of state saying clearly in their decisions from the meeting in June that I have to stick to the decisions from the health check. I have never, ever, during the health check discussions, signalled any openness to roll back these decisions because that would certainly jeopardise predictability for farmers within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But, José Bové, I think you said I had not been acting with preciseness; that is, the laissez-faire attitude. I do not think it is fair to say that we have been doing nothing. I am not going to repeat all the different measures that we have been taking. I think that, if Member States want to pay specific attention to the dairy sector, they now have the possibility with the health check to reallocate the direct payments so they give a special preference to the grassland areas. That is a possibility and I know that at least one big Member State has taken the opportunity to use this possibility, and for the mountainous areas there are lots of different possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have production in Europe today that is 45% below quota, so what would happen if we actually wanted to cut quota by 5%? We would actually damage the situation for the young farmers that have invested in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would recommend to those countries, those Member States, who really want to help their dairy sector that they use this buy-up of quotas from those who want to leave the dairy sector. That is a much better way of securing the maintenance of those who have invested while giving a helping hand to those that want to leave the sector. That is I think the right policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I then just correct the misunderstanding on the super levy? We are not introducing a new super levy system. We are just giving the possibility that, if Member States are buying up quotas from farmers, they can reduce the number of kilos or tonnes from their ceiling, but it is not a new super levy that will punish any of the farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Just on some of the promotion. We have already reserved EUR 14 million for promotion for the rest of this year. We have agreed on extending the school milk scheme; yogurt that is low in sugar – that is, containing no more than 7% sugar – will now be introduced into the school milk scheme. Labelling – I hear from different Members of Parliament that there is interest in a labelling system. Let us discuss that in the context of the quality paper that is actually on the table at the moment. So I think there are lots of possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, finally, on the food chain, I completely agree with you that that there is no transparency in this chain and we cannot see where the added value is disappearing. Therefore, I am looking forward to the presenting of this report before the end of the year so we can see what the situation actually looks like.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that, if you look at the supermarket situation all over Europe, there are huge differences. Germany has a tradition or number of discount supermarkets. These supermarkets are using dairy or milk products, drinking milk as a <span class="italic">produit d'appel</span> to get the consumers in, and they are offering a very low price but they are just handing over the bill to the farmers, paying them the low price. So, I think it would be very interesting and necessary to see what is actually happening in this chain, so let us get this transparency on the table and let us, internally in the Commission, but also in Member States’ competition authorities, look into the market.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a very interesting discussion here today. I hope that you have noticed the short-term measures and the long-term measures that have been worked out together with France and Germany. I am sure that we will have some very interesting discussions on the future of the dairy sector in Europe because we all want our dairy sector to have a future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission and Member States’ governments are also responsible for the current grave situation affecting the dairy sector, as in 2008 they supported raising the quotas, resulting in the creation of milk surpluses and the collapse of prices.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision was based on the European Commission’s erroneous market forecasts. However, the European Commission did not abandon its intention even when it became obvious that the production increase was contrary to market trends.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the European Union must immediately drop its measures leading to an increase in dairy production. Furthermore, we also oppose the permanent removal of quotas after 2015. The important lesson to be learned from the current crisis is that the dairy market needs to be regulated. Without this, prices will become unpredictable. European dairy producers cannot endure the losses caused by large-scale price volatility.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that, with a view to easing the crisis, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted in favour of my initiative, which would raise the export subsidies amount from EUR 450 million to EUR 600 million.

While the Commission is correct to adopt a long-term view, it cannot detach itself from reality - and the stark reality is that the agriculture industry, in particular the dairy sector, is in real danger. The lowest milk prices since 1983, together with high costs, poor weather and lack of credit, have created an unprecedented cash flow and income crisis for dairy farm families in 2009. While the indications are that markets have bottomed out, badly needed price increases still appear some way off, and EU action is needed.

The producer price for milk fell, and at present many milk producers are having to sell dairy products at a price that does not reflect production costs. The survival of milk producers is now seriously under threat. Up until now it has not been possible to resolve the crisis in the dairy sector with the measures the Commission has implemented. Now it is time to roll up our sleeves and come up with new solutions. The Commission must stabilise the dairy market in Europe quickly. At the same time it should also undertake a thorough evaluation of the future of the dairy industry together with actors in the sector and the Member States.

In common with the majority of the Member States, I believe that the solutions put forward by the Commission are unsatisfactory. Of course, I welcome the flexibility that it is permitting, which will enable the national aid ceiling to be increased from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 for producers who are struggling. It is nonetheless vital for us to adopt more effective intervention tools. In order to deal with the growing volatility of prices, our markets must be regulated to a greater extent. The joint statement made by 16 Member States on the state of the European dairy market offers the Commission some valuable suggestions on improving the regulation of dairy markets. I also believe that it is necessary, as seven Member States are requesting, to look at temporarily suspending the increase in quotas. I would also like to reiterate my support for the introduction of a ‘Dairy Fund’ to help producers’ organisations and cooperatives, and also to support agricultural investment, modernisation, diversification of dairy farming, measures linked to geographical location and marketing measures for dairy products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fall in the prices of milk and dairy products primarily affects farms with low incomes. For this reason, I do not think that the quota system ought to be frozen in all Member States, but each state ought to decide how to set their own quotas. The problem is that, compared to 1983-84, only one-fifth of producers have remained in the market, and we are now at risk of more farms closing down. We therefore need to adopt urgent measures to prevent this from happening. We ought to take the following measures to end the crisis in this sector: extend the measures envisaged for storing butter, milk powder and cheeses, speed up the creation of a dairy product fund to meet the needs of small producers and young farmers, and reach an understanding with the supermarkets in terms of setting a fair price for both agricultural producers and retailers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

At the same time, we have made good progress over the last five years in establishing a robust European energy policy with three goals: security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">In achieving all these goals, the external dimension is extremely important for two reasons. Firstly, EU import dependency – currently, 50% of energy resources come from outside the European Union, and the trend is upwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, issues related to sustainability. The climate change goals cannot be achieved anywhere in the world unless energy is produced more cleanly and used more efficiently. For this reason, dialogue with the producer, transit and consumer countries is crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">The two projects mentioned in today’s plenary are, in a way, complementary and at the same time fit well into the overall strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, Nabucco. I came from Baku yesterday, and we are definitely still on course to fulfil this project. We made a major breakthrough this July. An intergovernmental agreement was signed between four European countries and Turkey, which means that we could already take a final investment decision next year with a view to having gas supplies by 2014.</p>
<p class="contents">We have identified three sources that are ready to commit gas volumes. Firstly, there is Azerbaijan, where the final investment decision about Shah Deniz 2 should be made in the very near future, and then there are other fields, in Turkmenistan and Iraq, which at this stage are the biggest sources of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Where are the difficulties? There are always difficulties related to the particular way we operate in the energy field and how a lot of producer countries are organised. In the European Union, projects are industry-driven, which means that there is always a very clear calculation of all the commercial risks. The countries that have the resources would expect more forward-moving decisions. That means, for example, the EU decides to build a pipeline, it builds a pipeline, and then we commit the gas. The philosophies are different. At the same time there is a clear understanding that EU companies are ready to buy the gas, and we are moving forward towards it.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the transit issue is more or less solved. We are still awaiting the ratification of the intergovernmental agreement, but I would not expect too many difficulties. Also, to facilitate buying gas from regions that have particular ways of selling gas, we are developing the concept of a ‘Caspian development corporation’ that would allow for reduced risks for companies buying gas, for example at the Turkmen border, or investing in areas where the political and economic risks are quite substantial.</p>
<p class="contents">We are well on track, and I believe this is a good example of cooperation between industry-driven projects with political support from the EU institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also committed some funds for the southern corridor and particularly for the Nabucco project. We have launched a call for proposals. At this stage I cannot say whether this was successful or good enough but at least the invitation was made.</p>
<p class="contents">Desertec is also an industry-driven initiative that is currently at an initial stage. It sounds very interesting that we use the solar energy potential of Africa and transport it to the European Union, but we need some flanking measures for this project to materialise.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is the technological development that we have supported for many years. A large concentrated solar power plant will be inaugurated this month in Seville. This is one technology that could be used for this Desertec project, and I believe that we would not have advanced so far in this technology without EU support.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to work with partners because it is very clear that we cannot just say we will take your territory, we will put solar panels in and transport electricity to the European Union. There should be common ownership of these projects, if they are to happen at all. For this reason we will have a conference in October on using renewable sources together with countries from the Mediterranean and the Gulf. It is clear that for Desertec to be successful we need common ownership of these projects, otherwise there will be no successful outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, there is definitely the issue of interconnection. There are two types of interconnection that we need to separate. One relates to the philosophy and markets. We have supported the integration of markets in North Africa for some time. Progress has been made, but we need to strengthen these measures. The second type is physical interconnection with the European Union, using cables.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Desertec will come step by step. It will not be one big project but I believe there will be elements that could ultimately fit our objectives: clean energy for the countries involved and additional exports to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also provided for commercial incentives. With the Renewable Energy Directive we have established the possibility for EU countries to invest in third countries and transport electricity to the European Union, and then the goal will also be fulfilled with energy produced in the third country.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, it is definitely difficult at this stage to give any timetable for Desertec. It is a new initiative, which is still in its infancy, and we cannot say Desertec is part of our security of supply strategy. It is a promising move towards a climate change strategy that we need to promote, but Nabucco is there for security of supply, and it is too early at this stage to rely on Desertec.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude that the best security of supply measures we can take are inside the European Union. This House has been a very strong supporter of energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is not only to do with climate change. It really is a very important element in the security of supply. I would say it is more important than Desertec and Nabucco, plus even South Stream and Nord Stream, combined. It really is the biggest element. Three legal instruments are being discussed with the Council, and I would emphasise that we need to be ambitious and successful with these.</p>
<p class="contents">On renewable energy, I am very grateful for the support of this House for the recovery plan, and I am quite positive regarding what I have heard about the applications for offshore wind energy. It seems that all the funds that were committed to support offshore wind energy will be committed. This is not only EU money because the overall envelope was roughly EUR 600 million, but the overall size of this project is EUR 4 billion, so industry is investing most of it. I believe this is a very good combination, as renewable energy also gives security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I know that sometimes there is an issue about carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS is usually needed for two reasons. One is as a global response to climate change but, from another point of view, we will also use coal and lignite for our security of supply. There has also been very good progress on applications for the financing provided with the recovery plan, so the recovery plan was successful, in my opinion. After announcing the results, we – the Commission, the Council and Parliament – definitely need to review how to channel EU funds to strengthen the European Union's security of supply. Many other steps will also definitely need to be taken to strengthen the security of supply of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is acknowledged that the energy mix and energy supply differs among Member States according to geography and other distinct factors. So, diversification also covers supply.</p>
<p class="contents">A diversified and interconnected network can, if appropriately redirected, one day become the security of supply for all. We support the need for a southern corridor, and Nabucco is a common European project.</p>
<p class="contents">However, questions need to be answered on the recent agreement between Mr Putin and Turkey, on the quantity of gas from Azerbaijan vis-à-vis the investment, on Gazprom’s offer to buy all Azerbaijan’s exports, on the stability of Iraqi supply, and on the Russian promise to pump double the amount through South Stream.</p>
<p class="contents">The energy dialogue with Russia is a necessity based on the pragmatic and equitable principle of security of supply and security of demand. All other geopolitical considerations must be set aside.</p>
<p class="contents">On solidarity, we need tangible plans for emergencies, such as storage and new LNG technology. Cyprus, for example, invests half a billion euro on LNG, and I regret that the Union assists with only EUR 10 million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question of security of supply for our citizens is becoming ever more important. In this context in particular, your portfolio will play an even greater role in future – and it will be important for the European identity, too.</p>
<p class="contents">As you quite rightly said, diversification is also necessary. I absolutely agree with Mr Kasoulides that cooperation with Russia will always be important, as it is an important partner with regard to gas supply. However, we should not be too dependent on any one country, whichever country that may be, but we should diversify, and Nabucco is a good way of going about this.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the solidarity that is needed in the EU. You have presented a number of proposals as to how we should increase our solidarity and also how the role of the EU as a mediator in conflicts that affect us, in particular between Russia and Ukraine, can be strengthened. You also talked about Desertec. I believe both projects are important, as they differ in terms of their timescales.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to consider – and that would be a task for your successor, whether that is you or someone else – how we in Europe, on the one hand, can be in favour of a number of large projects, such as Nabucco and Desertec, while at the same time advocating the decentralisation of some of our electricity and energy production.</p>
<p class="contents">There are currently a number of industrial projects under development – which are also industry-driven – which enable consumers and even households to become more involved with a type of energy production that brings energy security. This ranges from smart meters on the one hand to actual production by individual households. In this regard, Europe’s approach could be to say ‘yes, of course we need an external supply, we need security of supply and large, innovative projects like Desertec, but we must also ensure that the people, the companies and enterprises as well as individual households can have greater control over their energy budgets and energy consumption in terms of price, the economy and the environment’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do so also as a former member of the Lower House of the Dutch parliament and Deputy President of Liberal International, as I aim to see European politics, national politics and international politics as one. In the field of energy, in particular, there is, of course, a direct connection between these forms of politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, when it comes to our position, Europe’s position, in the world, we are currently open to blackmail. We are dependent on unstable regions and countries with undemocratic regimes. This has to stop. That is why my group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, supports Nabucco and Desertec, and I would like to draw attention to the major role that the former parliamentary leader of my national party, Mr Van Aartsen, has played in this project.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there are two points that I want to make. I am pleased that the Commission accepts that business has an important role to play. It cannot be just the authorities – national government, Europe or international bodies – that are involved in energy. Business emphatically does have a role to play. Secondly, Mr President, we in this House should not accept taboos such as those on looking into nuclear power again, as part of our energy mix. This also applies to Europe in international relations. Nuclear power, nuclear fusion and nuclear fission are of vital importance. There are major problems in relation to waste, but we must ensure that we allow research and development and knowledge exchange to play their part in this regard. Nuclear power has a major role to play because it will help combat the greenhouse effect. Once again, my group, too, does not have a definitive view here. We, too, need to open up this discussion again, but we must not declare nuclear power a taboo in this House. I would therefore like to hear the Commission’s opinion on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To put it more precisely, if we could introduce low energy standards or zero energy standards for our buildings then we would save more natural gas than Nabucco, South Stream and Nord Stream combined could import. It is important that our resolution states that the cost-effective options of renewable energy, the energy efficiency strategy and energy saving in particular must be a central part of this policy. If that is the case, then no additional nuclear power will be needed at all, in our opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, an important message in this resolution is that we need a common external energy security policy for the EU, which is something that we do not have at the moment. This policy should include the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy within the framework of a neighbourhood policy and a common position to be taken by the EU in negotiations with the transit countries. The Commission should make sure that it has sufficient capacity for this, as called for by Parliament two years ago in its resolution on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, Nabucco is a high priority project, because it would strengthen our independence in terms of energy, particularly with regard to Russia, although I agree with Mr Kasoulides when he said that there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered in this regard. However, it is a pity that some Member States, through their promotion of the South Stream project, which is openly competing with Nabucco, have been undermining the policy of energy independence.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to energy policy, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also believe it is important not to forget human rights and to neglect the human rights dialogue when we discuss energy. When we broaden our perspective to include Desertec or even the Arctic – as we do in our resolution – it is also important that we do this in a spirit of partnership rather than neo-colonialism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, complacency over energy policy is putting us increasingly in the dangerous position of dependency on Russia. Where possible it clearly makes sense to coordinate our response, but any unified EU policy would inevitably be skewed by those countries that are already in bed with Gazprom and related interests. And we should not be handing yet another area of vital national interest to the European Commission, which sees every possible crisis as an opportunity to extend its competence. Needless to say, many of us will vote against any endorsement of the Lisbon Treaty or further efforts to take forward political integration on the back of the various energy concerns of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, diversification of sources of supply requires greater commitment to Nabucco. For the success of this pipeline, Turkish cooperation is essential, yet the opening of the energy chapter in EU negotiations with Turkey is being blocked. What are the Council and Commission doing to resolve this unhelpful situation?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I notice the word ‘nuclear’ does not appear in the resolution. Clearly, sustainable, diverse sources of energy supply require a greater commitment to nuclear energy and in that respect I agree with our colleague Mr van Baalen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, instead of securing power and influence and the last reserves of fossil fuels, instead of insisting on giving priority to dependency, we are, in my opinion, facing completely different challenges when it comes to establishing a sustainable energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there needs to be a global switch to more renewable sources of energy, more energy efficiency and energy saving. In other words, we do not need disputes about external energy policy – and certainly not if that is all we are going to do – but rather we need intelligently-provided, affordable energy for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, energy security must be part of a responsible peace and development policy for the EU. Access to energy is vital for every individual, for economic development and for the fight against poverty. A project like Desertec must not therefore be a way of using energy policy as a means to continue colonialism. What will the people of the African countries, where the population is growing and energy requirements are rising, get from this? Why have they not up to now been involved on an equal footing in the planning and decision-making processes?</p>
<p class="contents">The global energy supply is also part of crisis prevention and peace policies. This approach is also lacking in the European Union’s relations with the South Caucasus and Central Asia. As energy suppliers – for example Nabucco – these countries are becoming of more and more interest to the EU, but I see no conflict prevention and sustainable development concept at a local level in these countries. It is time that the EU put an end to an external energy policy that merely increases competition for oil and gas reserves or extends nuclear technology. Genuine partnerships for renewable energy and for decentralised supply are what is needed now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On that basis, no competition exists between the various projects under way, such as, for example, Nabucco and South Stream.

However, Nabucco is ‘cementing’ relations between the people involved in this venture, establishing a strategic link between the European Union and Turkey. Prime Minister Putin said that anyone can lay as many rusty iron pipes in the ground as they want, but they will need something to fill them up with. It is precisely the uncertainty about sources that is the biggest concern with this project. The only thing for sure is that the EUR 8 billion investment will be a good deal for those involved in it.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, just like the concerns caused by Ukraine, the transit country for the Russian delivery, Turkey may similarly cause problems. There are also many of us who do not agree with establishing a concrete link between Turkey and the European Union. What is Desertec all about? North Africa, revolving mirrors, solar cells, continuous-current transmission and meeting 15% of energy requirements. At the moment, this is much more of a mirage than a realistic plan. Desertec will not be the main course on the European Union consumers’ menu. It is much more likely to be just a very expensive dessert. This is why I am suggesting that we get involved in research into increasing the safety of nuclear energy, because this type of energy is clean and cheap as well. This is a serious consideration because energy security stops with the consumer, or rather the bill and whether he can pay it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore important for us in Europe to find common solutions, although it is certainly right for the energy mix to remain a national responsibility. This means that during our joint deliberations we do not need to fight over nuclear energy, low-carbon energy and other types of energy, where my opinions differ from those of Mr Bütikofer, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must try to reach a common position where the external aspects of energy security are concerned. As regards internal policy, I fully agree with the Commissioner that the issues of renewable energy and energy saving, for example, are more important, as is research into new possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in order to reduce our dependence on external suppliers, we need to diversify. Desertec and Nabucco are important instruments in this regard. We also need to negotiate with Russia in connection with issues relating to the partnership and cooperation agreements and energy security now that Russia – wrongly, not rightly – has withdrawn from the energy charter. This is also an important task for us. However, we must recognise that we are dealing with countries that are not necessarily reliable and that, unfortunately, we cannot make a distinction between reliable and unreliable countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore counter supplier power with the consumer power of the European Union. Interconnectivity, the issue of common gas stores – these things are important to ensure that the supply to any individual country cannot be shut off. If we all help each other, we will be so strong that no one will be able to disconnect us. That is the crucial point that we need to get across here.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we must also make it clear that private investments are necessary, because the situation will be impossible without them. Much has already been done, but our overarching common security interest must be brought into line with economic interests in order to achieve the best possible solution. That should not be seen as a contradiction. I believe that we will then indeed find an appropriate solution. It means that matters relating to competition law also need to be considered here, and by that I mean that it should not be the power of large suppliers, for example Gazprom or even other companies ...</p>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, in order to prevent the reoccurrence of the situation of helplessness suffered by many of our citizens when Russia decided to cut off the gas supply through Ukraine, it is clearly vitally important to maximise the diversification of energy sources and gas transport. In this respect, we urgently need to build new gas pipelines, which, like Nabucco and other projects, will help to improve security of supply in Central Europe. However, to ensure a supply in all European Union countries, these efforts must be supplemented by supplies from the south of the continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I want to underline, as the Commissioner has already done, another dimension to this problem. The recent crisis showed us that the EU did not lack gas stocks, but rather transmission capacity. That is why it is important to focus our efforts on improving interconnections within the EU. Ladies and gentlemen, you should believe me when I say that there is a great deal of room for improvement in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you the example of my country. As you know, Spain could become an important transit axis for Europe, thanks to its connection with Algeria via the Medgaz pipeline, which is already in an advanced stage of construction, and its six liquefied natural gas plants, whose capacity could be doubled if another emergency situation were to occur. However, Spain cannot help without improving its interconnection capacity through the Pyrenees.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we should be aware that the construction of major infrastructures is only one part, albeit an important part, of the EU’s security of supply policy. This security also particularly depends on energy saving and the use of renewable energies. It is in this context that we regard as vital our cooperation with the North African countries in the development of renewable energies. This is linked to my call to reinforce the supply from southern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, Commissioner, the Mediterranean Solar Plan, led by the Union for the Mediterranean, is an attractive idea that we in this Parliament want to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Desertec and Nabucco are central to meeting these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">If we succeed in developing high-voltage solar thermal power in North Africa, we can give a sense of purpose to the Union for the Mediterranean, we can assist in water provisioning in the countries on the southern Mediterranean rim and we can develop electricity generation technology, for which there is a massive world market. If we can convince Member States of the political need for greater energy independence, and stop Berlin and Paris from undercutting it at every turn, Nabucco can help us diversify our supply of oil and gas.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution before us today says little about what we need to do here in the European Union. We need to develop renewable energy production – solar thermal and other. We need to build high-voltage DC electricity distribution capacity through a smart grid – some EUR 50 billion of investment, but creating many jobs – and we need oil and gas storage facilities and, even more, a storage policy to reduce our dangerous dependence on Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Our energy provision will continue to rely on oil and nuclear power but, as we prepare for the World Climate Change conference in Copenhagen, the only big idea is the switch to renewables. Wind could meet all the new electricity demand in China in the next 20 years and replace 23% of their coal generation. Deserts get more energy from the sun in six hours than humankind uses in a year. Commissioner, you said this is not part of our strategy for security of energy supply. Well, it should be, and it must be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I am surprised at the European Commission’s policy towards Russia with regard to this matter.</p>

In harmony with the new Italian-Russian remix, South Stream, the energy project of that name is, however, in danger of being scrapped.

<p class="contents">Over the next few years, electricity produced from solar energy will become significantly cheaper. The entire investment could be used to generate a total of 8 000 megawatts of wind energy.

<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that the Sun is an extraordinary source of energy. Converting this energy into energy that can be used by people is an area which has seen major developments in the last 20 years. However, there is also no doubt that we still have a way to go before the full potential and viability of this source can be technologically assured, particularly in projects such as the Desertec project which we are now discussing. This project is very welcome and we must therefore support it and keep moving forward in order to solve the technological problems.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must really draw your attention to the fact that, when talking about energy efficiency, and particularly about security of supply and therefore diversification of energy sources, one particular energy source is ignored to a certain extent. I am of course talking about nuclear energy. This energy source is systematically being discriminated against, because it does not fit with what is happening in many EU countries or with global trends or with mankind’s current energy needs.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation must be turned on its head. We must adopt an attitude of considering all possible energy sources in terms of the role that they can play. Here in this Parliament we cannot so obviously turn our backs on this reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was probably the breaking point in relations between the European Commission and the Member States as a whole regarding this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are now discussing is not so much the technical questions and details of developing energy policy within the European Union as the external aspects of energy security and the European Union’s development in this sphere, because at the end of the day there are two sides to this issue. It is, after all, an important question, as it ultimately affects every single citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be clearly aware of this when discussing Nabucco, which is undoubtedly one of the highest-priority projects in this sphere, along with Desertec. We must also be clearly aware that there are countries in the European Union which rely not only on a single supplier, but also on a single supply route.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore cannot accept that Nabucco will pose a challenge to projects such as South Stream and, to some extent, Nord Stream, whose aim is to supply gas directly from Russia to a European Union Member State, thereby ensuring that the European Union is not dependent on transit supplies through countries which are both politically and economically unstable.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the European Commission is right to declare that there is no challenge posed, and that we have to try to integrate all these separate projects into a common strategy where, I stress, Nabucco is obviously a major priority.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect the Commission to come up with its own proposal for increasing gas reserves within the European Union, which is very important, and for developing an interconnection system between Member States with a higher capacity, which is also a very important element in guaranteeing security both for citizens and for business in the European Union.</p>

As both the Nabucco Agreement and the Desertec initiative show, Turkey is an essential gateway, and in this regard I echo Mr Van Orden’s point. It is critical at this time to be building greater trust and deeper ties with countries who will be our energy partners, including Middle Eastern and North African states. In relation to many of these there is a connected development issue. With Desertec the mass generation of electricity from solar power is a unique opportunity for revenue generation, which must be used for the benefit of their people also. This opportunity must not be squandered.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, some Member States – including my own – have not used the recent past to prepare a coherent energy strategy. My own constituency, the North West of England, has been identified as a prime area for wind power generation, and yet the UK’s planning laws are an obstruction. Whilst we must look outward for future energy supplies, Member States must also make the best use of the resources and potential they already have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is: what are we actually talking about when we talk about energy security and energy? Are we talking about people – people for whom we must guarantee equal access to energy and guarantee security so they are not left without energy during the winter; are we in the end talking about the power relations between great powers; or, worse still, are we using energy security and these projects, like Nabucco or Desertec, as excuses to send out messages to other regions of the world or other countries? If it is to send out messages, with what moral authority are we doing so?</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to make is that, whenever we speak out against non-transparent transactions by foreign entities within the European market, we ask the Commission to take immediate action. I would like to know how this request of ours stands in relation to non-transparent transactions on the European market by Europeans themselves. To finish, Mr President, I would like to make a third point. I just feel we have all missed a great opportunity to have a medium- and long-term policy. We chose the short term and, once again, we have been left with a strengthening of the interests of the internal market and of the big industrial companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, it is not as simple as it is sometimes made to appear in political debates. We are talking today about two projects: Nabucco, a very tangible project that we can work on, and Desertec, an interesting project or an interesting idea or a vision and no one can yet judge precisely whether, where and how it can be put into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to concern ourselves with concrete matters and work on those. We must also promote visionary projects, but we must guard against believing that there is only one solution to any particular problem or only one strategy for solving the problems. Thus, the point made by many fellow Members here is absolutely right: there is not just one answer, there are many solutions to these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">These include, for example, the fact that we must not allow a very intensive debate on the CO<span class="sub">2</span> problem to make us increasingly dependent on gas, which then brings us problems once again because we need new pipelines. We must say ‘yes’ to the coal policy, and that is why we need new power station technology. We must say ‘yes’ to CCS, ‘yes’ to nuclear power and to renewable energy and ‘yes’ to energy saving. It is not a question of one thing or the other, but of doing all of these things together. Anything else would, in my opinion, be immoral and irresponsible and I believe we would not be doing ourselves any favours.</p>
<p class="contents">This also relates to the question of the source of supply and transport routes. Here, too, there is not just one answer. Anyone who believes that they can simply rely on a debate about pipelines is mistaken, of course, for if we want fewer dependencies we must keep a variety of options open, including LNG, and set about dealing with these. The question then remains – and it is a very important question – as to how we ensure that the necessary capital is made available to implement the required projects. What is the use of wonderful plans if there is no one willing to invest in them?</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the way in which we pursue our energy policy and how we deal with those who we expect to invest in the projects is important. Companies must be encouraged. We must guard against believing that we can force everything to happen and predetermine every last detail. Last winter many solutions worked without any political decisions being taken because clever people cooperated wisely in different places and because the Commission provided helpful mediation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore extremely important for us to take wise decisions in order to safeguard energy supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the requirements made of the large infrastructure projects that are needed must be clear with regard to both environmental impact and the countries’ independence. Member States must not be placed in a situation where they are at risk of being at the mercy of another state. The environmental impact analyses must be carried out by reliable and independent bodies before large projects are allowed to get underway.</p>
<p class="contents">This of course applies to all of the large projects identified, but I would like to mention the Baltic Sea in particular, which is a large and sensitive inland sea. We need analyses and decisions that guarantee that the Baltic Sea will not be turned into a dead sea because we in the European Parliament did not have a sufficiently long term view and were not demanding enough when we took our decisions.

Maybe it is because there are 27 interpretations of what energy security means.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I interpret it as meaning, among other things, diversifying the sources and moving away from our gas dependency on Russia. We do not have to look too far for evidence of this, just at some of our Member States which, being too far from Russia to have a pipeline, do not have all the problems attendant on dependency.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we should focus on LNG, developing technologies, building LNG terminals and bringing gas from all over the world. We should also contribute to establishing a global market for LNG such as there is for oil and commodities.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the Nabucco pipeline, I think the project should be quickly redesigned to take into consideration gas from various sources, and reconsider a shorter route which might lead from Georgia, Ukraine, under the Black Sea to Romania. We just have to look at the map.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that Member States have different interpretations of, or interests in, energy security is also proven by the fact that some countries involved in Nabucco have also signed up for South Stream, thereby lowering Nabucco’s credibility and the chances for a common European energy policy. South Stream definitely means increasing dependency on Russian gas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is something we could have tested in January of this year, during the energy crisis. After all, we are adopting resolutions as we all feel that the Union is not coping with the issue of energy security. We also note, Commissioner, that there is less interest in Nabucco among the EU Member States, although this is not the case for all energy projects. In the north, we have the Nord Stream project, which is a very serious move against the common foreign policy. In the south, there is the South Stream project. Here, too, the EU Member States are keen to get involved. However, when it comes to Nabucco, all we hear are promises, but there is neither sufficient money nor political support.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are discussing the subject in Strasbourg, the cement mixers have arrived on the shores of the Baltic to work on the Nord Stream project. I would like to know whether I can hold supporters of the Treaty of Lisbon to their word, namely that when the Treaty is ratified, they will cease to support the Nord Stream and South Stream projects. Nabucco may prove to be an excellent step towards ensuring energy security. If we continue to merely issue statements then, during future energy crises, when we send EU citizens pamphlets containing our resolutions, they will burn them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At zero growth, future demand for gas is estimated at an additional 100 to 150 billion m<span class="sup">3 </span>by 2020. Based on these assumptions the development of different options is imperative, and South Stream is not an alternative to Nabucco, but in fact complements it. The Commission regards the southern corridor as a series of projects including Nabucco, South Stream and the Turkey-Greece-Italy interconnection (ITG). The anti-Russia debate is therefore in conflict with what we will see happening over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must call for pragmatism and above all consistency in the decisions that the European Union has essentially already taken: with the European economic recovery plan, with Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks, and with the second energy security strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The diversification of sources, routes and supply countries is the real pillar of Europe’s energy security policy and, leaving aside the political and economic interests of the various countries most directly involved, the South Stream-Nabucco challenge must be analysed with realism, not through the distorting prism of ideology but rather with a clear vision of what needs to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We know the figures: in the countries of the Caucasus, there are two centuries of reserves; in Russia, one century; in North Africa, half a century; in the Baltic, half a century; and in Europe, about 20 years. We must therefore prepare to import gas.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Commissioner, Nabucco is a sound project, and we must support it, but we must give financial and political support to all the diverse sources of energy supply, both Nord Stream and South Stream, from the North and from the South.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also rely upon our industrial companies, which are competent and fair, and which have an ethical code, but let us not be naive. Commissioner, I urge you to study, straight away, the proposals by certain Member States that would like us to have an operational European instrument for taking action on the gas market, that is, to create a European central buying office for gas, something which you are, moreover, doing for the Caucasus with the Caspian Development Corporation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Desertec, I would like to offer my congratulations. We know the figures: 1 km<span class="sup">2</span> of desert receives the equivalent of 1.5 million barrels of oil. This is an excellent project for the Euro-Mediterranean area. We know that 0.3% of the planet’s deserts could supply the entire world with energy.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that we will solve our energy problems through human ingenuity and science, but in an ethical and moral way.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you are doing a very good job, because we have here a Europe that produces results, a Europe that protects, and a Europe that acts. Well done, and please continue – you will have the support of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Desertec project is especially significant in that it points to the future. When discussing energy security, too little attention is paid to renewable energy sources and, in particular, energy efficiency. I am pleased that this is exactly what the Commissioner underlined today. Financial and economic mechanisms should be established at EU level, which would encourage EU Member States and individual companies to save energy and switch to the newest and cleanest technologies and this would be a serious contribution to energy security and to combating climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although Latvia generates about one-third of its energy needs from its own renewable resources, the remaining two-thirds of our energy balance-sheet comes predominantly from one supplier state – Russia. As a small country heavily dependent on energy supplies, we understand very well how expensive this dependence can be both for the end-consumer in terms of price and for the country as a whole in terms of potential political vulnerability. The energy balance-sheet of every European Union Member State is different, but we are all concerned by one and the same question – the security of energy supply. Security of supply can be achieved by diversifying sources of supply, for the more suppliers we have the less dependent are we on each individual supplier. Russia is an important partner for the European Union in terms of gas supplies. In Europe, we import in total about one-quarter of all gas consumption from Russia. Some countries, such as Latvia, are even wholly dependent on supplies of gas from Russia, and with every year Europe’s overall dependence on supplies from that country is tending to increase. One of the alternative sources of supply is the projected Nabucco pipeline, which would deliver gas from Central Asian countries to Europe, via Turkey. I consider it very important for Parliament to give special support for this project, for it will directly strengthen our common gas supply security. The Nabucco pipeline, however, is only the start of the solution for our common gas supply security. We have to achieve a united European energy policy that would coordinate our activity across all energy issues. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to begin by saying that, if we look back at the last five years, Commissioner Piebalgs has probably become one of the most successful commissioners for the balanced, forward-looking policies which we have jointly accepted with Parliament up until now.</p>
<p class="contents">In January, at the Nabucco conference held in Budapest in Hungary, Commissioner Pielbags stated for the first time that the European Union wants to offer political and financial support to the Nabucco project. We will have to raise an estimated figure of some EUR 8 billion for the 3 300-kilometre pipeline. The two most important tasks we have ahead of us then are to find some EUR 2 billion from the European Union budget and, secondly, to draw up those conditions which will make it easier and simpler for the project to access credit, and on better terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The original promise was for some EUR 30 million. We need to realise that we have to go further. I am confident that in the few months that lie ahead, the Commissioner will make every effort or leave it to the next commissioner to ensure the project’s success. We are all very aware that in the event of an economic crisis, it is not households which bear the main brunt of current and power failures, but companies. We are talking, fellow Members, about those companies where our voters and our citizens work, and we are jeopardising their income by jeopardising energy security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now, the March European Council declared that, in order to achieve its energy security objectives, the European Union collectively, but also each of the Member States, must be prepared to combine solidarity with responsibility. This, in my view, is the crucial point: European energy policy must be inseparably linked to the Union’s foreign policy, because, while we keep on saying that our foreign policy action will be truly effective when we speak with one voice, that is just as true for energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet that is precisely the point; until that time – that is, until we are able to speak with one voice – the efforts of many governments that are involved in complex operations such as Nord Stream and South Stream must be viewed not as in conflict with support for Nabucco but as part of the same strategy, in which we combine pragmatism with realism in order to put our citizens’ interests first.</p>

However, what is even more important about this is the political aspect: it will eliminate our dependence on a single source. The recurring crises have highlighted that the current situation, with Russia as a single source and Ukraine as the only transit country, does not provide any security for Europe’s economy and citizens. The development of new energy supply routes must be just as important as developing relations with Russia. The delay in launching the Nabucco project has been due, unfortunately, to the individual interests of certain Member States. Member States must realise that it is not only the countries which the pipeline passes through or the commercial companies involved which will enjoy the benefits of this project, but all Europe’s citizens whose national governments must guarantee their well-being and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The mistakes which have led to this project being delayed must not be repeated in relation to securing sources of gas. There are countries in the region, such as Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Iraq and Iran, which want to supply the gas pipeline with their reserves. The Commission must repeat what it has done for the intergovernmental agreement, which is take part in the subsequent negotiations and reach a positive outcome as quickly as possible.

In addition, all predictions agree that energy demand in the world will increase significantly over the next 25 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Europe, we have to reduce our high dependence on Russian gas, particularly following the crises in recent years. There is also a clear strategy in Russia to secure its dominance in Europe over the gas sector. That is why we have projects such as Nord Stream, Blue Stream II and also South Stream.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to diversify in terms of suppliers and routes. That is the reason for the interest in Nabucco, which will give access to Azerbaijani and Iraqi gas, and also to gas from Turkmenistan, thus reinforcing our energy relations with Central Asia, which is an increasingly important region.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore delighted about the agreement reached last July, as reported by the Commissioner, and also the explicit support given to Nabucco by President Barroso in the political guidelines that he recently presented.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that there are doubts about the viability of Nabucco, but I also had doubts about the Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, which is now a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that the countries around the southern rim of the Mediterranean also have an important role to play in the supply of gas to Europe. The main country in this respect is Algeria, which is an important supplier of gas to my country and to Italy. We must ensure that the work on the Medgaz pipeline is quickly completed. I also want to highlight countries such as Egypt and Libya in terms of gas supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, energy issues must be a priority in the Euro-Mediterranean relationship, to the benefit of both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon includes energy as a shared responsibility and lays down that one of the EU’s energy policy objectives will be to guarantee the security of energy supplies. This really encourages us to move forward with developing an increasingly essential common foreign policy on energy, as stressed by the motion for a resolution to be adopted today.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that this is a difficult objective, as proven by our failure in Europe, in the European Union, to achieve a true internal market in energy, because we do not even have the necessary interconnections. That is why I am delighted about the commitments made in this respect in the document mentioned by President Barroso. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A lot has already been said today regarding Nabucco and Desertec. As regards diversification of the sources of supply, I would like to draw your attention to a neighbouring region which up to now has been characterised by stability and reliability in supplying Europe and which also has a huge exploitation potential and will become more accessible as a result of climate change. I am talking about the Arctic region. Here there is, on the one hand, an existing tradition of pragmatic cooperation, including with Russia, for example, and, on the other hand, the EU as such does not currently have a presence there, unlike Russia, the US, Canada and even China.</p>

The question now is what price Europe is prepared to pay Turkey. In the meantime, Turkey is playing two hands and is seeking to benefit both from the Nabucco project and from South Stream. It is not in Europe’s interests. I call on the Council and the Commission to make an unambiguous choice for the Nabucco project. This project would directly reduce our dependence on Russia and, given the slow decline in the demand for gas in Europe, it is in any case totally unnecessary to realise two southern supply routes. Turkey must nail its colours to the mast and put its weight fully behind the Nabucco project. The negotiations with Turkey on this topic should, however, be kept strictly separate from the country’s accession negotiations. It should not be the case that Turkey receives an entry ticket for the Union in exchange for being cooperative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the policies we follow in the energy sector seek to promote the wellbeing of our citizens and our industry. What we are looking for is a secure supply of well-priced and clean energy. This is our overarching goal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we never make any side deals when we are discussing energy agreements. There are no compromises either on enlargement or on human rights. We work from the point of view that interdependence in energy supply is the most important thing and is beneficial for all – for suppliers, transit countries and consumers. It takes time to convince our partners, but that is the only way to achieve stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, even if it sometimes seems that we are slow, I think that basing ourselves on the industry proposals, and on support for industry, is crucial because that makes us strong. Perhaps it does not make us a speedboat in the energy ocean, but it makes for stability. When we make a change, we have a much broader basis for it, so we are much safer. All the projects have been well checked for cost efficiency and future viability. So I believe that is the right support to give.</p>
<p class="contents">The next area where we have a weakness, and which we are continuing to discuss, is external energy policy and coherence. It is true that there is a lot of controversy – or at least perceived controversy – and, as a Commissioner, I would definitely be happy to see a more coherent external energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution addresses exactly this issue because, although there is no in-built conflict between Member States, there is perceived conflict. All the activities pursued by the Member States also benefit the European Union. So we should follow this up and really try to build a system where we speak with one voice, not only verbally but also in terms of the points of view that we want to emphasise. For this reason the second strategic energy review is still very important. All the points that we put forward in the second energy review are still there.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, from the Commission’s point of view, we clearly see that we cannot afford to move from interdependence to dependence. That is why we particularly support diversification projects like Nabucco and LNG – not that they completely change our relationship of interdependence with other countries, but they give us additional safety margins. So that is what we are doing, but at the same time we definitely take note of what happens in the energy world.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the point on nuclear energy, we have moved away from this option. We have adopted a Nuclear Safety Directive but it is very much a national and very sensitive point. I really believe that, from the Union point of view, we should build upon the cooperation of nuclear safety regulators and try to establish a safer and more coherent system. But I doubt that we could go further than that.</p>

The Nabucco project must be made a priority as it provides a solution to the gas supply problem, which has intensified in recent years. I know that, although Nabucco is a project which is just as important from a geopolitical perspective, the project’s partners must also have, at the same time, strong commercial motives so that it becomes a reality as quickly as possible. The economic crisis, which has reduced the money that the participating companies have available for investment, along with a number of uncertainties linked to the sources supplying the pipeline are obstacles which must be overcome. The EUR 200 million we are offering the project are welcome, but we also need to step up political and diplomatic measures with Turkey and the countries in the region supplying the gas. I would therefore like to call for a show of solidarity by Member States in order to be able to avert gas crises similar to those that we have had in recent years. We cannot wait for the Treaty of Lisbon to come into force and the Nabucco project to be completed while Europeans are running the risk of remaining without gas in the middle of winter as a result of disputes between Russia and Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are Members who urge the Commission and Member States to take concrete coordinated measures in the spirit of solidarity and who propose to act like the EU already had such a policy. Their efforts have not only political and moral but also practical value because as representatives of the citizens they can speed up the creation of the common energy policy. There are others who use the absence of such a policy as an excuse to justify their bilateral deals with suppliers which often ignore the requirements of transparency and fair competition, not to mention European solidarity. This is a short-sighted and risky approach which plays into the hands of those undemocratic suppliers whose political strategy is to split and weaken the EU. The Commission should provide not only political and legal but also financial assistance to companies which are engaged in efforts to diversify our energy supplies. To really advance towards genuine energy solidarity, the Member States should start to inform each other and the Commission on their agreements with third partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This situation puts Moscow in a special position of influence, based on having control of these resources. However, energy is a commodity which must be subject to the principles of the market economy. It must not be possible for energy to be used as an instrument of political pressure. The energy crises which Europe has faced have highlighted the importance of diversification of energy supply sources. They have also demonstrated the added value Nabucco offers in this respect for the entire European Union. Romania has been and remains a strong supporter of the Nabucco project. In fact, Romania signed the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Nabucco project in July, along with Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria. We regard the conclusion of this agreement as a success and an important step forward. A gas pipeline of the size and ambition of Nabucco will need to face many challenges before it becomes a reality.

And before that we had the Austrian gas terminal in Baumgarten being taken over by the mysterious Centrex company. We need a clear, European energy policy, and we need it now.

The Lithuanian President has created a special group to review this legislation, which is only supposed to come into force in 2010. Moreover, I think that the resolution would constitute an excessive amount of interference in the affairs of a sovereign nation such as Lithuania. Furthermore, this resolution contains a statement to the effect that the legal opinion of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights should be requested. It does not fall within the remit of the Agency for Fundamental Rights to evaluate individual countries and draw up an opinion on such cases. It would set far too dangerous a precedent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After liberating themselves from the yoke of the Soviet Union, they wanted to be members, as quickly as possible, of that other union, which likes to put itself forward as a unique association of free nations. Now, though, it seems to be once again the case that one form of guardianship has simply been replaced by another, albeit a more subtle one. Today, too, Lithuania is no longer free: when the Lithuanian Parliament adopts a law aimed at protecting minors, it is castigated for its trouble and shunned. There is not a single area that is still free of European meddling and this is something that is definitely not going to improve over the coming years. On the contrary, in fact, the new European Commissioner for Human Rights – what’s in a name? – will reinforce this European guardianship still further.

It is a sad fact that the situation in the dairy sector is extremely critical. Despite the fact that consumer prices have risen by 14% over recent years, the purchase price of milk has fallen by almost 40%. Many European dairy producers are therefore now facing ruin. In the Czech Republic, for example, 15 Czech dairies are clinically dead in financial terms, according to the managing director of Madeta, Mr Teplý. The situation must be resolved on a systematic basis, however, through long-term management of the sector, not just through short-term support measures such as subsidies, intervention purchases and support for private storage. This only distorts the market while not preventing price instability. At the same time, we must establish a level playing field for farmers from all Member States, and not just in the diary sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union is dependent on energy imports. Energy consumption is continuing to grow, but the natural resources are limited. Energy security assumes at the same time diversification of sources and transport routes, as well as highly efficient interconnection between Member States, which is currently being worked on through various projects, with European financing for the gas pipelines between Romania and its neighbours, Hungary and Bulgaria. This is where we are at the moment, I told myself, but what do we still have to do?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw a perhaps bold, but simple comparison with electrical energy. At the moment, our houses are supplied with electrical current without us knowing where it comes from. A diversified network supplying natural gas and numerous transport networks must enable us to achieve the exact same aim: guaranteeing a gas supply in any situation, regardless of the situation. This is why I supported and still do support the Nabucco project, but also the move towards diversification of renewable energy sources, at the same time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the dire situation which Europe’s dairy producers find themselves in, we must continue the period of public intervention (i.e. for buying and storing skimmed milk powder and butter) at least until February next year or until 2011, if it is considered necessary. I do not think that we can allow ourselves to stand by and watch farms in Europe being closed down because in a year’s time we would need to import milk and dairy products from outside the Community. If we also consider that the health standards will not be anywhere near those we are looking for, we have far too much to lose. This report is welcome in this context. However, to be able to really solve the problem of the dairy sector, we must adopt related measures because this stock of products involves allocating considerable resources and it could happen at any given moment that this stock will be of no use. We must invest now in a sustainable agricultural system, capable of meeting our food requirements, even if we are in the midst of a financial crisis, in order to prevent a food crisis occurring later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that we are tempted to focus our attention on certain issues which we consider to be extremely important and ignore others. On this point, I would like to emphasise that we can give up many things, but we cannot give up eating. This is why agriculture must remain a priority area for the EU. In my view, we must increase the minimum amount of aid granted to farmers above the limit of EUR 15 000 set by the Commission, as well as allocate an increased budget to promote the dairy and dairy product sector. I strongly recommend support for farmers producing milk and meat, with a view to stabilising markets, by including them in the Temporary Crisis Framework for state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the direct aid systems need to also take into account the particular features of the new Member States where agriculture plays an important role in the national economy and ensure that support is maintained for agriculture to enable them to overcome the structural problems and achieve the objective of convergence through boosting the development level in the agricultural sector and eliminating the differences in terms of efficiency and competitiveness in relation to the old Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The finger is being pointed at a country because its democratically elected parliament is in the process of examining a law that – in common with the laws that exist in the majority of the Member States – is designed to protect minors, and that is aimed specifically at protecting them from any propaganda promoting homosexuality, bisexuality or polygamy. What could be more natural, where children are concerned? Well, no, it seems that this is ‘discrimination’, and the entire EU is mobilising against poor Lithuania, which is ‘guilty’ of banning proselytising and of encouraging family values.</p>
<p class="contents">What is even more astonishing is the fact that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), which theoretically claims to be Christian democrat and to have certain moral values, has also put its signature to this absurdity, which the left initiated. As usual, children’s rights count for nothing in the face of pressure from certain lobby groups. It should be said that, in their time, some Members of this Parliament were advocates of paedophilia in the name of universal freedom and of the right of all, no matter how young, to sexuality.

We must offer young people a vision of society that is open to diversity and founded on the principle of respect for others, however different they may be.

The economies of many Member States are heavily dependent on agriculture and farming. Unfortunately, there is now a big difference between the prices paid by consumers for agricultural products in the supermarkets and the money received by producers. Many EU dairy farmers are now at serious risk and are forced to sell dairy products below their production costs. The Commission must take adequate measures in both the short and long term to overcome this crisis and to save the EU dairy market. In this regard, I very much support the request to create an EU Diary Fund to aid producers and to support farm investments. If we want to have a well-functioning diary market we must support farm investments in modernisations, small producers and young farmers. And most importantly, to ensure that farmers receive a fair and adequate price for their production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Market transparency is essential, and in that respect I suggest setting up a European observatory to help monitor and regulate the market from production to distribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The battle that milk producers have been fighting, which goes beyond their immediate aims – to sell their produce at prices that ensure their survival – also has a broader meaning and importance that have to do with the kind of agriculture that we want in the future. The neoliberal model of agriculture, which promotes flooding the market with products from countries with greater productive capacity and promotes intensive production in some countries and the abandonment of farming and food dependency in others, must be replaced with a model based on the concept of food sovereignty and food security – the right of each country to produce in a sustainable way. In this model, public mechanisms for controlling production – quotas, adapted to each country’s needs – are essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Foodstuffs are not products on which one can speculate on markets disconnected from any form of reality.

Currently, the instability in producers’ incomes does not allow the best allocation to be made of resources that are vital for future investments in the sector. Therefore, the European Commission has a duty to facilitate contractual relations within the agri-food chain, so as to balance the relations between the various operators in the sector, stabilise the markets and prevent market risks. It must also encourage better organisation within the sectors. In addition, consideration should be given to whether an increase in milk quotas might have a positive impact on producer prices.

That is what led me, in paragraphs 17 and 18, of which I am the author, to ask the Commission for an enquiry to determine whether there are any cartels operating. The credibility of the Commission is at stake.

It is true that in order to reduce these constraints, we need to diversify the forms of our dependence, from the viewpoint both of energy sources and of supplier countries. To be honest, however, I do not see the point in placing ourselves in the clutches of Turkey, in a move motivated more, it seems, by hostility to Russia than by energy concerns. Turkey is the necessary point of transit for this famous Nabucco gas pipeline of yours, which has systematically received priority over other projects. This would give the country a significant means of applying pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Desertec, here too I fail to see the point in becoming dependent upon what is, for the moment, a project which is part of a private initiative. In fact, I believe that it is contradictory to want to conduct a centralised energy policy, in the hands of the Commission, and at the same time to hand the European energy sector over to private operators, entailing a rise in prices and a reduction in services, and adversely affecting energy choices. Above all, I believe that energy is too crucial an issue to be left to Commission officials to deal with, or to be abandoned to the profit motive of a few companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Community Mechanism for Civil Protection made a contribution to the overall relief effort and showed Europe’s solidarity with the population of Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">On 7 August 2009 Taiwan was hit by Typhoon Morakot, causing major flooding and mudslides. Over 150 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced. Transport infrastructure, including roads and bridges, was damaged and communication networks were interrupted. Around 700 000 homes were left without drinking water. Taiwan requested international assistance on 12 August 2009. In response the European Commission activated the Community Civil Protection Mechanism. The mechanism facilitates and coordinates Member States’ in-kind assistance during major emergencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission deployed a coordination and assessment team to Taiwan to assess the needs and to assist the Government in its relief efforts. The team undertook several assessment missions to the affected regions, sharing its findings and recommendations with the local authorities and international partners. The mechanism team also facilitated the delivery of in-kind assistance such as water purification equipment donated by Sweden and Poland, which was delivered to the most affected areas in Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapid delivery of this assistance ensured a tangible expression of European solidarity. The presence of the European team on the ground was also received positively. The Community Civil Protection Mechanism is a very visible sign of European solidarity with countries worldwide, and I am convinced that it will continue to grow in strength and effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Natural disasters can affect any country in the world. They often carry a heavy human, economic and environmental cost. In the future, climate change makes it likely that we will face more disasters. In this regard, solidarity with other countries hit by disaster remains one of the pillars of the European disaster-management policy. I look forward to continuing to work with the European Parliament to make sure our European emergency-management tools are fit for purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Typhoon Morakot swept across the island with unbridled force, leaving more than 750 people dead. Thousands lost their belongings and large areas of land were laid waste. The damage amounts to more than EUR 2.5 billion. The reconstruction of an infrastructure that has been widely damaged will take months. As a token of our solidarity, we Europeans wished to support the Taiwanese people by providing disaster relief.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kuneva, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) supports the initiatives that the European Commission has instigated. It is all the more surprising that the Taiwanese embassies were instructed to refuse all foreign aid. That led to strong criticism and on 13 August to much needed adjustments to a completely abortive crisis management programme. Shortly after that, Prime Minister Liu Chao-shiuan resigned.</p>
<p class="contents">Another cause of irritation was the visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama over several days in September. He merely wanted to pray for the victims with the survivors. Sympathy has long been the message of the much-acclaimed speeches and books of the Dalai Lama. Once again the Chinese government made loud protests and brought a huge amount of pressure to bear. It is outrageous that Peking has once again made a political issue out of a purely humanitarian act by the Dalai Lama. Taiwan must ask itself whose side it is actually on. President Ma Ying-jeou only allowed the Nobel Peace Prize winner to enter the country after strong protests from his own people.</p>

<p class="contents">Morakot was the deadliest typhoon to hit Taiwan in nearly 50 years, ravaging the island in early August and leaving about 700 people dead or missing, forcing the evacuation of thousands and burying hundreds of village homes in mudslides.</p>
<p class="contents">On this occasion China showed great sensitivity by sending immediate aid to help Taiwanese victims. Not only was the Chinese Government ready to assist the island, but also private companies and organisations of different kinds including the Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits and the mainland Red Cross Society.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the Chinese population afforded help with fundraising events organised to relieve the island from the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the last figures, the Chinese mainland has so far donated to the typhoon victims about a CNY 1 billion, which is the equivalent of nearly USD 150 million. An important role in this situation was played by the several hundreds of prefabricated houses that were sent from China to Taiwan in order to put a roof over those who had lost their dwellings.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline the fact that the European Union, attached to the One China policy, welcomes the help that China offered Taiwan on this tragic occasion because this shows an improvement in the relations between the two territories, and it is clear that an improvement in such relations can lead to greater stability in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think, and with this I conclude, that, given the dimension of the disaster, the European Union should make use of one of its core values – solidarity – and offer Taiwan additional material and financial assistance in order to help with the massive task of reconstruction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over 700 people lost their lives and thousands of others have faced major disruption.</p>
<p class="contents">The Taiwanese Government under President Ma responded promptly by deploying soldiers to the worst-affected communities and areas, and requesting assistance from the international community. The Swedish EU Presidency and the Commission should be congratulated on their work in activating the Community Civil Protection Mechanism. I do hope now that the Commission will commit to longer-term assistance to Taiwan to enable full recovery of its people and economy and the rebuilding of the infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no doubt of the gratitude of the people and Government of Taiwan for the solidarity and support shown by the EU. Furthermore, as chairman of the EP Taiwan Friendship Group, I look forward to finding out the latest situation when I lead a delegation of MEPs to Taiwan next month.</p>
<p class="contents">The calamity that has affected Taiwan may well become more commonplace, both in Taiwan and around the world, as a result of climate change. It is therefore essential that Taiwan, as an island vulnerable to such meteorological phenomena and as a major global industrial power, is enabled to participate meaningfully and with dignity in appropriate international organisations, not least those related to weather and climate change. In particular, Taiwan should be allowed to participate in the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Council and the Commission support Taiwan’s meaningful participation in United Nations bodies now, and I hope they will use the opportunity, arising from this disaster, that has now been presented to Taiwan to promote Taiwan’s involvement in these structures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Taiwan’s admission as an observer has already yielded some good results in other international sectoral organisations such as the WTO, and, in this case, too, Taiwan’s admission could be a practical form of prevention and could in future limit the risks for the 23 million inhabitants of the island and for the region as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is our duty not only to express our solidarity but also to play an active part in the reconstruction of the parts of the island that have been devastated.</p>
<p class="contents">Happily, after typhoon Morakot hit, the Commission and the Council indicated their willingness to help. I urge them now to provide the concrete aid that the government and the people of that country need, because there is an enormous amount to be done. Appropriate instruments exist at European Union level. They should be put to full use.</p>
<p class="contents">This disaster once again poses the issue, as already mentioned by some of my fellow Members, of Taiwan’s participation in the various agencies of the United Nations. In principle, the EU institutions encourage this, but it is high time for action to be taken to change things. The Taiwanese authorities did not have access to meteorological information indicating how serious the typhoon was. This is unacceptable. It is absolutely vital that Taiwan accedes to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and is thus in a position to avoid the worst, since there is no doubt at all that there will be further climatic depressions in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am the chairman of the Taiwan-Luxembourg association, and I really must say that we should no longer be pressurised by the blackmailing of Communist China, with regard to our relations with Taiwan.

<p class="contents">We now know that 640 people were killed by Typhoon Morakot and over 192 people are missing. One mudslide wiped an entire village off the map and killed hundreds. However, none of this happened by accident. It was preceded by a prolonged drought, which reduced the capacity of the soil to absorb the rain.</p>
<p class="contents">Droughts, floods and a rapid increase in extreme weather are gradually increasing due to climate change. A typhoon is caused in sea areas with a surface temperature of 27 <span class="sup">ο</span>C. The increase in temperature will considerably increase both the number of typhoons and their intensity. To date, 120 million people are living in areas affected by typhoons. Between 1980 and 2000, there were 250 000 typhoon victims.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, our heart must be in Copenhagen, where we shall decide in December if each of our countries will separately defend its own temporary, short-term interests or if we shall all fight for the planet, our home, in a fight to reverse climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">So will the developed and developing world stop contributing to disasters such as the disaster in Taiwan? If so, action is needed. We need to pledge to making the necessary commitments for the necessary reduction, in order to prevent the temperature rising above 2 <span class="sup">ο</span>C. We also need to put our hand in our pocket to provide financial assistance to the developing world, so that it becomes part of the solution and helps to combat climate change.</p>

There is great tragedy in the mountains. Whole villages have disappeared and there are a thousand people thought dead or missing. Thousands of survivors, if not more, are being put up in military camps for the time being. This is how Menno Goedhart, the highest representative in Taiwan from my home country, the Netherlands, depicts the devastating effects of typhoon Morakot. First and foremost, I would like to express my sympathies, from this Parliament, to the government and citizens of Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the practical assistance that Menno Goedhart is currently offering his Taiwanese friends, and also whilst appreciating what has already been done from the European side, I would nonetheless like to ask a couple of questions of the Commission in relation to the strengthening of European-Taiwanese relations. First of all, the Commission will be putting forward a proposal next month to relax the visa regime for Taiwanese citizens. The United Kingdom and Ireland have already set a good example in this regard. Secondly, a recent European report demonstrated very clearly that there would be enormous benefits for both Taiwan and the European Union in agreeing trade enhancing measures (TEM). Does the Commission agree with this urgent conclusion?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to lend my full support to those of my fellow Members who have already argued for the ending of Taiwan’s incredible international isolation.

The Commission must continue in this vein. The big problem, however, alongside this human catastrophe, is, of course, Taiwan’s isolation. It is quite possible to maintain a one-China policy whilst at the same time establishing good working relations with Taiwan. Taiwan could easily play its part in the World Health Organization as an observer. The same applies to the World Meteorological Organization and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

<p class="contents">As many observers have noted, the number of victims could have been lower if the Government had reacted in a more coordinated manner to the typhoon.

At the same time, we know that Taiwan has a highly developed high-tech sector and is one of the largest manufacturers of GPS systems in the world.</p>

Taiwan could have been better pre-warned if the WMO provided it with timely information. I am therefore convinced that the time is right again to raise the issue of Taiwan’s membership in the WMO, not only for political reasons but also for humanitarian ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The humanitarian aid provided by the European Union must be unconditional. The aim is to help victims as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is an active donor, working with non-governmental organisations and the United Nations’ specialist agencies to provide funds for medical treatment, logistical support and the reconstruction of devastated areas. The Copenhagen Conference will have a great deal to discuss, and we are preparing to take some measures aimed at a future post-Kyoto agreement on reducing polluting emissions. Therefore, we are mostly discussing measures for reducing the causes that lead to climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the Copenhagen Conference, I would like to call for particular attention to be focused as well on adaptation measures, as we will continually have to deal with powerful storms, flooding, prolonged drought or forest fires. I also urge the European Union to provide humanitarian support to Taiwan, along with support for reconstruction and, in particular, for the population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, on the assistance which the Commission is providing to Taiwan to meet the ongoing needs of its people, which was the main point of the question by Mr Mann: Taiwan has been informed of the Commission’s post-disaster needs-assessment mechanism, but we have not received any requests so far. If such a request comes, we will take it into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, on the Commission position regarding the current state of cross-Strait relations, which was the question from Mr Boştinaru, the Commission welcomes the rapprochement between Taiwan and China during the last year. This has made it possible to improve cross-Strait relations, reducing tensions between the two, and to promote bilateral issues such as direct air and sea links.</p>
<p class="contents">We strongly support the bilateral discussions between the two parties that may allow further progress. We also welcome the Chinese assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question concerning the participation of Taiwan in the World Meteorological Organisation from Mrs Lulling and Mrs Andrikienė, and also from Mr van Baalen and Mr Tannock: in line with the position expressed by the European Union in a statement issued in September 2008 and the EU’s One China policy, the European Commission supports, where appropriate, the meaningful participation of Taiwan in international organisations. We will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">On the questions from Mrs Lulling and Mr Mann, as to the assistance provided, the Community’s Civil Protection Mechanism provided assistance from Sweden and Poland. This help was received with gratitude which was acknowledged by President Ma to Commission President Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question concerning the visit by the Dalai Lama to Taiwan in the aftermath of the typhoon, the visit by the Dalai Lama was a decision taken by the Taiwanese authorities, and the European Commission has no comment on it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question raised by Mr Belder, about the Commission position on granting visa-free access to Taiwanese visiting the EU: the Commission is considering, within the framework of the revision of the appropriate legislation, the possibility of updating the list of countries and entities which may not be subject to visa requirements in respect of visits to the European Union, especially the Schengen Area, and in this context it will also consider the case of Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to the question by Mr Zemke on the issue of standard procedures in the event of disasters and how we will proceed in future in such cases, the Commission focuses on two priorities: the first is continuing work on preparedness and response, and the second is the prevention of disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we deem it important to ensure the availability of EU assistance at all times. With Parliament’s support, in 2008 we launched a pilot project and a preparatory action on the EU rapid-response capability. From this initial experience, if appropriate, the Commission will present further proposals for the development of the EU rapid-response capability, funded from national resources earmarked for EU operations.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, we aim to have a comprehensive approach to disaster prevention at EU level. In February 2009 the Commission published a communication on a Community approach to the prevention of natural and man-made disasters. We would welcome Parliament’s feedback on this communication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have to remember that Natalia Estemirova, Zarema Sadulayeva, Alik Dzhabrailov and many others who have suffered and lost their lives in their defence of human rights deserve the support of all of us. Unfortunately, we were not able to support them enough while they were alive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is alarming that Russia has not been able to conduct criminal investigations rigorous enough to solve these murders and bring the guilty to justice. I have noted that the European Union has communicated with Russia officially on the subject. Quite obviously, however, our efforts are insufficient, and we will have to consider seriously how we can make the rule of law work in Russia and how we can raise this issue’s profile a lot higher when we negotiate the new partnership and cooperation agreement with that country .</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to think about how we might support human rights defenders in Russia better than we do now. We should discuss whether we could offer protection to those in danger and whether the EU institutions can arrange visas for them promptly, so that they can escape from Russia, where they and their lives are at risk. In the opinion of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, it is important that the European Parliament should have a centre which disseminates information on the situation of human rights activists whose lives are in danger and which endeavours to help them in collaboration with the other institutions. There is much we can do. Anna Politkovskaya once said that the West can do so much, but the West does so little.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to tell you, firstly, that we are fully in agreement with the joint resolution with regard to Natalia Estemirova, Zarema Sadulayeva and Alik Dzhabrailov.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been shocked by these new assassinations which, in fact, are just a sample of the assassinations of human rights activists in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">In our resolution, we have called for exactly the same thing as the joint resolution calls for: we condemn the attack, we call for an enquiry, and we express our concern over the deterioration of human rights for militants in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Where our position diverges is with regard to the additional reference in the joint resolution to all human rights defenders and to the situation in the North Caucasus region in general. We think that there may be other places in which to make these points – and I undertake to do so – particularly in the resolution that will precede the summit between the European Union and Russia. We would like this agenda on human rights activists and the protection of these activists to form part of that resolution, but also of all the negotiations that we have in the future with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the problem here, I would add, is simply one of time and of place. This is a political issue that should be dealt with politically and not just here, when we are dealing with urgent cases.

Only this year in January, Stanislav Markelov, the human rights lawyer who represented the assassinated journalist Anna Politkovskaya, was gunned down in the middle of the afternoon in downtown Moscow. On the same occasion, Anastasia Baburova, a journalist who tried to protect him, was also shot and died.</p>
<p class="contents">In July, Natalia Estemirova, a well-known Russian human rights activist and journalist, was found dead in Ingushetia after being abducted by armed men in neighbouring Chechnya. Less than a month later, another non-governmental activist, Zarema Sadulayeva, and her husband were abducted and killed.</p>
<p class="contents">In August, journalist Malik Akhmedilov was shot dead shortly after leaving his home in Dagestan. Six outstanding journalists and human rights activists dead in less than eight months.</p>
<p class="contents">These abductions and murders are only the peak of what results from the deterioration of the human rights situation in Russia, where independent voices, including lawyers, journalists and other activists, face increasing violence, threats and unjustified prosecution.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights violations in Russia, and especially in North Caucasus, can no longer be ignored. We cannot be so naive as to believe that super-powerful Russia, with one of the strongest intelligence services in the world, is not capable of finding the perpetrators and bringing them to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We all, regardless of our political colour, have to understand that impunity for attacks against human rights defenders will contribute to more violence and a growing culture of lawlessness. The Russian authorities must ensure the physical safety and freedom of movement and expression of human rights defenders, in accordance with the United Nations Declaration on human rights defenders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not the case – and I would like to thank Mrs Weber for giving such a clear speech – that these incidents and murders in the Caucasus are in any way random or the work of some dark force, but rather, since Mr Putin came to power, which is linked to the matter of Chechnya and the mysterious explosion of houses in Moscow, there has been a trail of blood there for years that always leads back to Chechnya and affects innocent people: civilians and, in particular, human rights activists who, like those mentioned – and many of these people were known to us personally – not only work for the human rights of Chechens but also for a democratic Russia, for an understanding between the peoples of Chechnya and Russia and for peace in the Caucasus. These people are being murdered one after the other.</p>

We will make ourselves a laughing stock if a woman who received praise in this House and who visited us in Strasbourg on account of her commitment to human rights is murdered in front of our eyes and we then postpone the debate on the subject to some later date.</p>

That has nothing to do with interfering in national affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I have for years been genuinely concerned and outraged by the fact that, time and again, human rights activists involved with the situation in Chechnya are being murdered. Natalia Estemirova, Stanislav Markelov, Zarema Sadulayeva, these are examples of murders that are truly shocking. It is therefore important that we in this House concern ourselves with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned that cases like the murder of Anna Politkovskaya are not investigated. If this process is now re-opened, I most sincerely hope that the perpetrators are found and arrested, because otherwise there is a risk of more bloodshed and it will be seen as a licence to commit acts of this kind. What we expect is simply for an immediate and full investigation to be carried out into these murders and for this matter to be dealt with ruthlessly, for Russia not to wait any longer but to take up the fight to protect human rights itself. It must not be the case that protecting human rights somehow condemns people to death. I also believe that the forthcoming EU-Russia summit needs to tackle these issues as a matter of urgency, and not merely as side issues, but with the prominence that they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I also expect human rights issues to be discussed honestly in this House. I would have preferred not to debate issues such as these on Thursday afternoon and I believe this topic should also concern us even if it was about enterprise and trade. Such issues are often given secondary priority. That is what we want to change and that is also something I wanted to say here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are coincidental because, generally speaking, many people fall victim to crime in these countries. Today, on 17 September, I have to remind you all of a sad anniversary, namely the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland. Following this invasion, Soviet troops shot at least 21 768 Polish citizens. Why have I mentioned this fact? It is because the Russians now claim that this was an ordinary crime, in the same way that the murders of human rights activists are ‘ordinary crimes’.</p>
<p class="contents">The scale on which human rights activists are being murdered in Russia is such that to interpret this phenomenon as the result of ‘ordinary crime’ is utterly reckless. The theory that these murders are ‘coincidental’ is not a viable one. The systematic nature of these killings means that there has to be something in the political and social climate in Russia that has caused such frequent killings. The moral crisis in that country, a tendency to trivialise death, dehumanisation, relativism and vanishing values are to blame for the fact that this problem is not taken seriously. I think that our resolution is well-balanced and will help the Russians resolve this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We condemn utterly the perpetrators of these barbarous actions and the fact that sadly in some regions of Russia there is an atmosphere of impunity and political murders are not investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has promised that the perpetrators of the murders will be found and punished. His reaction was stronger than the previous president’s, but so far these are only words. Time will tell if the Russian authorities are able to carry through the commitments made, so important to the country’s citizens and the international community. In our opinion, evaluation in the proposed resolution of Russian actions in the Northern Caucasus has exceeded the resolution’s area of application, therefore the social democrats have decided to adopt their own separate document. The social democrats are convinced that the human rights situation in Russia would really improve if EU-Russia human rights consultations were stepped up. The European Parliament, the State Duma, civil, social and human rights organisations in the EU and Russia should make an active contribution to these consultations. We stress that the protection of human rights must be discussed at length at the next meeting of the leaders of the EU and Russia. This matter is becoming an inherent part of the new agreement between the EU and Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union cannot remain indifferent to the brutal killing of human rights activists. In our relations with Russia we must underline and we do underline that investigations into these murders take too long and as a rule end without establishing who was guilty. Such an unacceptable practice is becoming the norm in Russia, especially in the case of crimes in Chechnya, where impunity is thriving. One of our fundamental values is respect for human rights, human dignity and human life, and no pragmatic interests can be above these values.

We now call on the Russian authorities to do everything in their power to ensure the protection of human rights defenders. We know that the crucial thing that is lacking is a will to do that ‘everything’. It can be done, as the Kremlin exercises a decisive influence on Russia’s power structures and judiciary. Because of this, the failure of the Russian judiciary to protect human rights defenders makes one assume the complicity of the regime in these crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Our message today should be addressed to the EU governments and the Commission.

Exactly 70 years ago, on 17 September 1939, the Red Army – in collusion with Hitler – occupied one third of Poland, which was then fighting against the German invasion. Stalin’s forces murdered thousands of Poles, and hundreds of thousands were taken away to Soviet labour camps. In Katyń, thousands of Polish officers were murdered on Stalin’s orders. To us, 17 September will forever remain a day of shame for Stalin’s Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s Russia is not brave enough to face this horrific truth. Its current government is providing unconvincing justifications for their former alliance with Hitler. To this day, Moscow is refusing to grant access to the archives on the Katyń massacre.</p>
<p class="contents">The histories of many countries contain horrific events. It is a measure of the maturity of a nation when it is able to confront its past and denounce that which needs to be denounced in its history. Today’s Germany is an example of such an attitude. It is only then that the past will cease to be a burden for today’s Russia and will allow it to enter the community of free and democratic nations with its head held high. Only then will Russia be able, once and for all, to drop the millstone of its Stalinist past from around its neck, and to stop fighting against its own citizens, who are currently risking their lives to defend fundamental freedoms and human rights.</p>

The murder of Natalia Estemirova prompted great sadness in all of us in this House, since we learnt of her abduction on the very day when we gathered here for the first time, and heard of her murder just a few hours later. That is something that cannot fail to move anyone, wherever in the world they may be. As my colleague Mrs Ernst has already said, I firmly believe that the left must defend human rights and the defenders of human rights everywhere, regardless of the country they are in.</p>
<p class="contents">These attacks, this onslaught against human rights activists in Russia, have had very worrying effects. They work as intimidation and will certainly be extremely traumatic for all those who want to defend human rights in Russia. They are therefore the first layer in an offensive that will later result in the deterioration of the whole human rights situation, not to mention the human rights of the activists themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The effects of these murders are therefore unpredictable and worrying. Without a swift and effective judicial investigation and with no guarantee that the safety of human rights activists will be respected, the situation may in fact become extremely worrying. That is why I shall take great pleasure in voting in favour of this resolution and in following up its appeals to the Russian authorities to protect human rights activists.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from Portugal, from the other end of Europe, and next week I shall be going to Russia. In fact, I am going to the Russian embassy tomorrow to get my visa. I believe that the relations between Europe and Russia are of the greatest importance and that Europe owes much to Russia. The first thing that Europe owes Russia is sincerity and clarity in the protection of the human rights and freedoms of our Russian fellow citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will not under any circumstances allow, and do not believe it is right for us to question the commitment of the S&amp;D Group to the protection of human rights, because we also did this when your group, Mr Posselt, was attempting to trivialise the crimes at Guantanamo and the treatment of prisoners in Iraq by US troops.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of human rights in Russia, there is indeed a serious problem, which we acknowledge, and the resolution which we are submitting is sufficiently tough and incisive. However, we do think this Parliament needs to focus on the issues, and not simply to come up every time with a long list of problems in our relations with Russia, when these have no effect over there.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are doing in this respect is continuing to send a delegation from the S&amp;D Group to talks in Moscow next week, where this particular issue will be raised. Do not use human rights emergencies like this one to produce a long list of issues. This is not the purpose of today’s debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because such demands are only made of states outside the European Union. However, things are different when it comes to human rights being grossly violated in a European Union Member State, as happened in my country, Hungary, where people were shot in the eye at a mass gathering of several thousand people staged by the party of the man currently presiding this session, Vice-President Pál Schmitt, to commemorate the anniversary of the 1956 revolution and fight for freedom. This Parliament has not had any investigation conducted into this case and the crisis situation which has continued since then.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that as long as this does not happen and as long as someone who was a member of the government which sanctioned shooting at people can be Vice-Chairwoman of Parliament’s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, , we cannot have any real confidence and the moral authority in another country, to ask for this kind of investigation to be carried out in a country outside the European Union.

The recent wave of violence against human rights defenders has put the spotlight on the grave dangers they run in the course of their work. Many have paid the ultimate price for bringing to light violations of human rights. We pay tribute to all those who have lost their lives and to those who continue their work in such an environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the violence against human rights defenders has taken place in the North Caucasus, against the background of growing instability. The Commission knows many of them. They are highly respected partners in the implementation of human rights projects. Innocent civilians, law enforcement personnel and government officials have lost their lives in the ongoing struggle in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence against human rights defenders is not restricted to the North Caucasus. There are reports of activists, lawyers and independent journalists across the Russian Federation facing violence, harassment and intimidation. The EU must continue to speak out against this violence and insist that Russia uphold the commitments it has entered into as a member of the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that the attacks and violent deaths of civil society activists are properly investigated and that the perpetrators are promptly identified and punished. It is only through the effective and lawful prosecution of these killings that the climate of fear and impunity can be dissipated.</p>
<p class="contents">President Medvedev has spoken out against what he has termed the ‘legal nihilism’ prevailing in Russia. The EU stands ready to support Russia in its continuing reform of the judicial system. The EU highly values the opportunity it has to discuss its concerns on human rights with the Russian authorities. We welcome the more open attitude President Medvedev has taken to discussions with the EU on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The next EU-Russia summit is another opportunity to continue these discussions. This must be complemented by exchanges among experts. The regular EU-Russia human rights consultations offer an opportunity to broaden the scope of these discussions and the range of interlocutors with whom we discuss human rights issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The safety of human rights defenders must be the first concern. We urge the Russian authorities to make every possible effort to ensure that those who work on shedding light on violations of human rights are able to do so without fear of violence or intimidation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that my fellow Members in the various groups will discuss this matter with their groups’ chairmen, as Parliament’s authority is continually being gnawed away at because there are so few of us here at any one time.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let us turn to the Zhovtis case. Kazakhstan is an important Central Asian country, and it will assume the Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe next year. It is therefore not a matter of indifference how crimes are judged in a country that will be at the head of the democratic aspirations of all countries over a vast area of Europe. Accordingly, we should focus attention on the case of human rights defender Yevgeny Zhovtis. He was found guilty of manslaughter in very suspicious circumstances and sentenced to four years in an open prison for running over a pedestrian in July this year.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to take into account the fact that the OSCE has been wondering whether the procedure to which Zhovtis was subjected was possibly in violation of the principle of a fair trial, which is guaranteed in Kazakhstan’s constitution. The European Parliament also needs to keep this debate going with the Council and the Commission, so that they might raise the issue of this case and demand a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the European Parliament can have a powerful influence on the extent to which the countries of Central Asia endorse the principle of the rule of law by keeping a record of these individual cases, and the case of Yevgeny Zhovtis is without a doubt one of these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unjustifiably underlining its unique and special nature, the country shows no regard for the OSCE’s recommendations on electoral laws and freedom of the press. Repeated violations of human rights and the direct persecution of human rights defenders increasingly raise doubts as to whether this state is suitable to head an organisation which fights for the implementation of democratic principles. We urge Astana to make concrete progress in the areas of democratisation, the protection of human rights, the rule of law and freedom of the press. Kazakh laws which are based on international law must be applied appropriately and transparently in legal proceedings against the human rights activists Yevgeny Zhovtis, Yesingepov and Dubanov. We must hope and demand that judgments are impartial and that the prisoners’ involvement in the human rights movement does not influence the verdict.

A human tragedy which unfortunately occurred where a man lost his life. At the same time, please allow me to express my concern in relation to the current situation of Mr Yevgeny Zhovtis.</p>
<p class="contents">Indisputably every person who commits a criminal offence must accept that legal sanctions will be applied undiscriminatingly and Mr Zhovtis, as an outstanding human rights lawyer, knows this better than anybody. But at the same time we want to make sure that the Kazakh authorities do not use this unfortunate situation to punish Mr Zhovtis for anything else other than the car accident in which he was involved. Mr Zhovtis must not be punished for his human rights activity and for being a very critical voice of the Kazakh Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I think it is of the utmost importance that the Kazakh judicial authorities carry out immediately, and with full respect for transparency and the rule of law, a second full and fair investigation into the circumstances related to the incident and to a review of Mr Zhovtis’ conviction and sentence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) it is therefore important to establish that we do not in principle wish to question the judgments made by an independent court, unless we are talking about an obvious show trial that does not comply with any principles of law. We have already seen this in Iran. There must be a clear line drawn here. As far as we are concerned, an independent judicial system is the key element of any democratic order. That being the case, we must first take account of the judgment handed down.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also acknowledge the fact that a person has been killed in a car accident – and we should be saddened by that, indeed we are saddened by that – but also that a judicial review has been carried out. The fact that Yevgeny Zhovtis, a well-known civil rights activist, is involved in this case has brought it to the attention of the world and has prompted the response, as a result of which we are discussing this here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE Group acknowledges Kazakhstan’s efforts and progress towards democracy and the rule of law. We would like to assure Kazakhstan of our explicit support and encourage this country to continue resolutely along this path. With regard to this particular case, we urge the Kazakh authorities, in their own interests, to provide the public with as much information as possible and to present their view on these events, and to enable a fair appeal or review procedure to be carried out for Mr Zhovtis under the rule of law.</p>

I am utterly astonished that, in front of the whole Parliament here in Strasbourg, we are having an urgent debate on a traffic accident in Kazakhstan, albeit an accident where somebody was tragically killed and where the driver of the car happens to a human rights activist who has been duly sentenced in a court of law to four years in prison – but even in a low-security prison, which has suddenly become, in the terms of the resolution, 'a labour camp'. I am afraid that bringing this kind of matter before this House really brings the reputation of this House into disrepute and it means that the good work that we try to do in human rights is devalued, when we start talking about traffic accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we seriously suggesting the Kazakh Government threw a civilian under the car wheels of a human rights activist? Are we seriously suggesting that the sentence is too harsh for somebody who was convicted of manslaughter? We cannot go on traducing a country like Kazakhstan, simply because of political motivation, to try and bring down their reputation before they chair the OSCE next year. This is politically motivated, and it is a disgrace that it is on the agenda. I hope the House will throw out these resolutions and support the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Kazakhstan is an important country. It is making a lot of effort in terms of its progress towards democracy. Of course, at the moment, it is not a model of democratic freedoms, but the civil rights situation in that country – and I know Kazakhstan a little, as I have visited it on a number of occasions – is considerably better than in most of the neighbouring countries in the region, and it fortunately does not have the sort of problems that exist in Russia, for example, and which we have just been discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">I share Mr Stevenson’s view that the European Parliament should not use all its authority to state its position on a single, dramatic court case. It may be the case that some clarification is needed in this instance, but certainly not a European Parliament resolution. This would undermine the value of the resolution, and people will stop listening to the voice of the European Parliament if it becomes distracted by issues that do not deserve a general debate or a parliamentary resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was pleasing to hear Kazakhstan’s Foreign Minister Marat Tashin promise last year in anticipation of the Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and again in May this year, improvements to the country’s human rights situation. Despite the international attention, however, there has been tighter control of the media and there are poor standards of freedom of religion.

<p class="contents">The sentence handed down to the human rights activist Yevgeny Zhovtis also makes one wonder, and it is in the Government of Kazakhstan’s own interests to lay these doubts to rest in every respect, and that is unquestionably the case in view of its forthcoming term of office chairing the OSCE.

<p class="contents">I am confused because, undoubtedly, in terms of international relations, Syria has made great progress over the past two years. It has joined the Union for the Mediterranean. It has, on various occasions, acted as a mediator in difficult international situations, including very recently when a young French woman was arrested in Iran. I would say that the fact that the association agreement – which is not yet signed, Mrs Brantner, but which could be fairly soon – the fact that this association agreement has been relaunched is, at the same time, a very positive sign.</p>
<p class="contents">On the domestic front, it is true that there are also some very positive developments in Syria. Syrians have taken in 1.5 million Iraqi refugees, and they are looking after them, they have a high level of education, and they have freedom of religion, which is important. However, in terms of political freedom and political plurality, there has been absolutely no progress. To my enormous regret, we continue to see instances of repression and imprisonment of human rights activists and defenders, and we have intervened on several occasions over the last few years to request the release of political prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">On two occasions, we have succeeded in obtaining a release. Syrian prisons still contain, however, people such as Dr Al Labwani, Dr Al Bunni and, now, Mr Al Hassani. I would therefore like to address a message to Syria: we are here and we would like to help Syria to escape the isolation in which it has been placed at some point.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that it is an important figure on the international stage, and particularly for peace in the Middle East. Please, though, for your own image – and I think that you are strong enough to allow political plurality and human rights defenders in your country – please, release the political prisoners, and, as we have said, please abide by the convention against torture and degrading treatment!</p>
<p class="contents">This is in Syria’s own interests and in the interests of peace throughout the world, and particularly of peace in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The finishing touches are being put to an EU-Syria association agreement within the framework of Mediterranean cooperation, and because one of the fundamental pillars of cooperation consists specifically of the promotion of human rights and democracy, I think that the EU should call more loudly for improvements in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough just to focus cooperation on improving the economic situation. As we have heard, the leading Syrian human rights lawyer, Muhannad Al Hassani, was imprisoned at the end of July without any proper trial. He was charged with weakening national sentiments and spreading false news. The case is not the first of its kind. We in Parliament last intervened in a similar one in 2007. Kamal Abwani, whose cause we were pleading then, is still in jail, although in March the UN investigation team reached the conclusion that it had been an arbitrary arrest.</p>
<p class="contents">Syria has a very long way to go when it comes to freedom of speech and of association. The work of NGOs in the country is problematic and thus virtually nonexistent. It will be highly regrettable if we in the EU do not have the courage to set clear criteria for a basis for cooperation with Syria. In my opinion, the onus is very much on us to demand the release of political prisoners and compliance with international human rights agreements before we can move on with the EU -Syria association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights in the world are not just a lot of solitary islands: they are a fabric, in which everything has an impact on everything else, and if we tolerate neglect and turn a blind eye, that will eat away at our own rights here before very long. It is our important duty to nurture them and ensure that they are implemented always and everywhere. Only in that way can we make human life worthwhile. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During a trial held behind closed doors, to which lawyers were not granted access, he was accused of weakening national sentiments and disseminating false information. He had previously already been interrogated on a number of occasions in connection with his activities in the field of human rights and efforts to defend people arrested for political reasons. He was also denied the right to leave the country. Mr Muhannad Al Hassani took part in monitoring the Supreme Court’s proceedings as, in the view of Human Rights Watch, the conditions under which these proceedings take place do not meet international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned that human rights activists are being repressed in Syria, especially in view of the lack of progress the Syrian authorities are making in the field of human rights.

<p class="contents">In view of existing political, economic and cultural ties between Syria and the European Union, and the significant role that this country has in terms of fostering stability in the Middle East, I am sure that Syria can make progress in this field, thereby also contributing to the democratisation of the whole region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our assessment is that the situation has deteriorated over recent months, with more arbitrary detentions, harassment of human rights defenders and travel bans.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrest on 28 August of Mr Muhannad Al Hassani – a well known lawyer, President of the National Organisation for Human Rights in Syria and a member of the Damascus Bar Association for 15 years – is the most recent example. Mr Al Hassani is a human rights defender and one might suspect that his arrest is politically motivated.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has already expressed its concerns to the Syrian authorities. Syria must observe its international commitments, in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Syria is a state party. The Commission, through its delegation in Damascus, together with Member States’ embassies, are discussing how to more effectively and efficiently act in defence of human rights’ defenders. Clearly, we have to continue calling for actions to protect human rights defenders and to ensure the observation of trials at the Supreme State Security Court. We must continue to support the civil society through our instruments, such as the non-state actors and the European instrument for democracy and human rights budget lines, and give moral support to the families.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite being important, these actions are, nevertheless, insufficient. We believe the EU would have a stronger leverage on Syria if the association agreement was signed. I am glad that the Presidency is contemplating its signature in the coming weeks. With this agreement we will establish a regular dialogue to advise on these issues and achieve better results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the September 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As stated in the Presidency conclusions of the June 2009 European Council meeting, the Middle East Peace Process remains a top priority for the European Union in 2009. The same meeting also endorsed the conclusions adopted by the External Relations Council at its meeting on 15 June 2009.</p>
<p>The Council remains committed to a two-state solution with an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable Palestinian state, comprising the West Bank and Gaza, living side by side in peace and security with the State of Israel. this is an indispensable step towards a more stable and peaceful Middle East.</p>
<p>We very much welcome to US Administrator's commitment to vigorously pursue a two-state solution and we are ready to work actively with the United States and other Quartet members to achieve this goal</p>
<p>The EU is also ready to continue substantially to post-conflict arrangements aimed at ensuring the sustainability of peace agreements, including through regional arrangements such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Union for the Mediterranean. We stand ready in particular to further develop our relations with the Palestinian Authority within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy. We will help promote Palestinian state-building and will cooperate further towards additional improvements in restoring law and order. Our focus will continue to be on support in the areas of civil police and justice.</p>
<p>A comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict requires a regional approach, covering the political, security and economic dimensions. Through its numerous agreements with partners in the region, the EU is uniquely placed to work on key issues of regional development . In the light of developments on the ground, we will carefully assess how our policies and programmes can promote concrete and early results on the path of a comprehensive settlement of the conflict.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0284"></a>

<p>Israel's recent barbaric war against the Palestinian people, the expansion of settlements, the dividing 'Wall of Shame' in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and the continued murderous blockade of the Gaza Strip are worsening the already unbearable situation of the Palestinian people even further.

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the September 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In response to the question of the Honourable member of the European Parliament the Council would like to recall its formal statements that while recognising Israel’s right to protect its citizens, the construction of the barrier in the occupied Palestinian territory is contrary to international law.</p>
<p>The Council has also urged the government of Israel to immediately end settlement activities, including in East Jerusalem and including natural growth, and to dismantle all outposts erected since March 2001. It reiterates that settlements are illegal under international law and constitute an obstacle to peace. Also according to the Road Map, Israel has an obligation to freeze all settlement activity, including the natural growth of existing settlements, and dismantle all outposts erected since March 2001.</p>
<p>The Council has also expressed its concern for the situation in Gaza and has repeatedly called for the immediate and unconditional access for humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and from Gaza without which the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, reconstruction and economic recovery will not be possible.</p>
<p>The Council would also like to assure the Honourable member of the European Parliament of its unflinching commitment to the two-state solution with an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable Palestinian state, living side by side in peace and security with the State of Israel. The EU will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders other than those agreed by both parties. Indeed a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a comprehensive peace in the Middle East is one of the central objectives of the European Union's common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p>The listing of terrorist organisations is one of a number of measures adopted by the European Union in order to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1373 of 2001 as part of a wide-ranging international strategy to combat terrorism and in particular the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is based on objective criteria. As within all persons, groups, and entities on the list, the PFLP is made aware of the reasons for its inclusion.</p>
<p>The Council reviews the list regularly and at least every six months. At the last review the Council considered that the grounds for listing the PFLP remained valid and therefore decided to maintain the group on the list which was adopted on 15 June.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0286"></a>

<p>As regards the piece of legislation mentioned by the Honourable Member, the Council has not taken a position. Neither does any legal instrument adopted by the Council address the issue raised, as it falls within the domestic jurisdiction of Member States.</p>
<p>In this context, however, I would like to mention the first the first Remembrance Day for victims of totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, which I had the honour to attend on 23 August this year.

In this context, I should also like to mention the impressive work carried out by the European Parliament in supporting democracy movements and human rights defenders in totalitarian countries worldwide.</p>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the September 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the Honourable Member for his question about the Egyptian satellite provider Nilesat, whose broadcasts of the Lebanese "Al-Manar TV" can reach the territory of the European Union. The Council understands the concern of the honourable Member that some of the material broadcast by the station could amount to incitement to hatred.</p>
<p>In order to achieve a lasting improvement in matters of xenophobia, intolerance, and sectarian hatred there is no better method than dialogue. It is encouraging to see, therefore, that more than 80 countries, among them Egypt, Lebanon, Gulf states and most EU member states, have joined the UN Alliance of Civilizations, whose main mission is to prevent conflicts due to prejudice and cultural or religious misconceptions. Several UN AoC programmes focus on media literacy and ethics.</p>
<p>Thus, the Council, considers that dialogue with Egypt is the most effective way to encourage the Egyptian government to progress in the area of human rights. This dialogue takes place through the institutional structure of sub-committees and political dialogue, and provides an opportunity for exchanges of views on a variety of issues.</p>
<p>The Council had already addressed the specific concerns raised by the Honourable Member in its statement related to the 5th EU-Egypt association Council, which stated that "The EU encourages Egypt to continue to pursue efforts aimed at fighting discrimination on all grounds and at promoting tolerance in matters related to culture, religion and beliefs and minorities. In this context, the EU is concerned about the discriminatory content in some of the broadcasts of the Al-Manar television channel distributed by the Egyptian satellite Nilesat. The EU condemns any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence".</p>
<p>At the sub-committee on political matters with Egypt, whose second meeting took place in Cairo on 7 and 8 July 2009, the issue of the broadcasting of "Al-Manar TV" was raised for the EU side within the framework of issues related to the fight against racism, xenophobia and intolerance, including the undertaking in the joint EU-Egypt Action Plan to “strengthen the role of media in combating xenophobia and discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or culture” and encouraging the media “to assume its responsibilities in this regard.</p>
<p>Egypt refrained from providing a reply, on the grounds that Al-Manar was an individual case. Egypt also failed to offer a commitment to address the case. The reaction of Egypt should however not prevent us from continuing the dialogue. The Honourable Member can be assured that the Council will continue to pay close attention to this issue and is ready to raise it on another occasion within the EU’s regular political dialogue with Egypt.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0292"></a>

<p>The general elections in February 2008 brought democracy back to Pakistan. The Council recognises this as a major progress for Pakistan. Strengthening democracy and stability remains the EU’s main objective in its cooperation with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it is a prerequisite for a functioning democracy in Pakistan that the civilian government has control of the armed forces. Elected governments should always exercise full transparency and control over the military establishment. This is a fundament of EU policy.</p>
<p>The process of democratization in Pakistan is still at an early stage. The EU, together with the rest of the international community, must continue to support the government in its efforts to strengthen democratic institutions and structures. The first EU-Pakistan Summit, held on 17 June 2009, was an important step in building a stronger partnership between the EU and Pakistan in supporting democratic, civilian rule in Pakistan.

<p>The Council Decision of 15 September 2006 adopting the Council's Rules of Procedure (OJ L285 of 16 October 2006, p. 47) cited the European Council's call for citizens to be enabled 'to acquire first-hand insight' into the European Union's activities, 'notably through further increasing openness and transparency' and 'particularly when the Council deliberates on legislative acts under the codecision procedure'.</p>
<p>Yet it appears from the agendas of Council meetings that the number of agenda items discussed in public actually declined, between 2007 and 2008, in all Council of Ministers meetings (except in the case of the Education, Youth and Culture Council and the Agriculture and Fisheries Council). In 2008, for example, the Environment Council discussed only 4 out of 33 agenda items in public, significantly fewer than in 2007. The all-important General Affairs and External Relations Council, meanwhile, discussed only one of the 130 items on its agendas in public.</p>
<p>In what areas does the Swedish Presidency intend to take tangible measures to finally comply with the Council Decision of 15 September and maintain the celebrated Swedish tradition of transparency?</p>
<p>Is the Swedish Presidency also in favour of at last publishing the proceedings of meetings of the European Council, including the Council's customary 'working lunches'?</p>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the September 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Presidency would like to recall that the modification of Article 8 of the Council's Rules of Procedure, to which reference is made in the Honourable Member's question, has brought about a significant increase in the number of public deliberations and public debates during the last three years as compared to the previous four years period where the access to the decision-making process of the Council was governed by the principles established by the Seville European Council (the so-called "Seville regime").</p>
<p>Thus, a total of 788 topics have been dealt with at ministerial level during open Council sessions since 1 July 2006. The increase has been particularly significant as regards the number of legislative "B" items: Altogether the number of the legislative "B" items examined by the Council since 1 July 2006 in public doubled in comparison with the period July 2002 - June 2006. Moreover, a total of 128 public debates, including 118 debates on important issues affecting the interests of the European Union and its citizens, were held during the period July 2006 - June 2009, whereas only 33 such debates took place during the preceding period.</p>
<p>That being said, the Presidency would like to recall that the number of items listed on the Council's agenda for a public deliberation or a public debate may vary from one year to another, notably depending on the number of co-decision items to be examined and/or adopted by the Council during a given year.</p>
<p>Thus a total of 153 co-decision items were listed on the Council's agenda for a public deliberation in 2007, whereas the corresponding figure for 2008 was 229 co-decision. In 2009, the Council has so far dealt with 148 co-decision items in public.</p>
<p>The number of public debates held pursuant to Article 8 (3) of the Council's Rules of Procedure may also vary, depending on how many issues which have been identified by each Presidency as suited for a public debate.</p>
<p>With regard to the proceedings of the European Council, it should be recalled that the transparency rules are not applicable to the European Council.</p>
<p>The Swedish Presidency shares the Honourable Member’s view on the importance of increased transparency in the work of the Union. This is a very important part of the work to increase citizens’ confidence in the EU and our common institutions.</p>
<p>For its part, the Presidency intends to give full effect to the relevant transparency provisions, set out in Article 8 paragraphs 1 - 4, of the Council's Rules of Procedure. In principle, all deliberations on</p>
<p>legislative acts to be adopted in accordance with the codecision procedure will be open to the public, as provided in the Council's Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p>Parallel to this, the Council will continue the efforts undertaken since July 2006 with a view to further improve the quality of the web casting of the public Council sessions. This service, which is regularly updated and enhanced, offers live and on-demand access to public debates and deliberations, as well as other public events.</p>
<p>In qualitative terms, the Council's video streaming aims to ensure that users have easy and meaningful access to the debates they are interested in.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the creation of the EBS (Europe by Satellite) Plus by the end of 2008, more space is now available for re-transmission of the public deliberations and debates of the Council.</p>
<p>The Lisbon Treaty places increased focus on openness and transparency, which hopefully will contribute to both Council and other institutions taking steps forward in their work for more transparency. Moreover, if and when the Lisbon Treaty enters into force, the Council will systematically meet in public when considering a draft legislative act and when voting on such a draft, irrespective of the legislative procedure applicable.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0298"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the September 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency was already identified as a priority for European energy policy in the Energy Policy Action Plan which the European Council adopted in March 2007 and where the objective of 20% energy savings by 2020 was set.</p>
<p>The 18-month Programme of the Council adopted in June 2008 underlines that the Presidencies will, respecting the Member States' choice of energy mix, strive for a low-carbon economy that is consistent with both sustainability and cost efficiency and that positively contributes to broader growth objectives consistent with the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. Indeed, energy efficiency does not only have a positive impact on the use of energy resources and on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but stimulates at the same time, as the honourable MEP states, innovative technological developments and can thus boost the competitiveness of European industry and job creation. Energy efficiency is therefore the corner stone of not only an energy-efficient but also of an eco-efficient economy. It will help us address simultaneously the challenges of climate change, resource degradation, the global economic crisis and security of supply.</p>
<p>Three co-decision legislative proposals linked to energy efficiency are currently tabled before the Council and the European Parliament:</p>
<p>the proposed Directive concerning the energy efficiency of buildings;</p>
<p>the proposed Directive concerning the labelling of energy consumption, and</p>
<p>the proposed Regulation on the fuel efficiency of tyres</p>
<p>and are indeed the main priorities for the Council in this semester.</p>
<p>Once adopted - what we hope will happen, with your help, still during this semester -, Member States will be able to introduce on their basis, also in the longer term, concrete energy efficiency measures in the buildings and construction sector as well as in the wide field of energy related products, both in the public and the private sector. In this sense, such measures will boost investments in innovative technologies which Member States can support with various types of incentives, both national and European.</p>
<p>Implementation of energy efficiency instruments already adopted at Community level will also trigger the creation of new jobs. This is the case for the Eco-design and the energy labelling framework Directives, where important implementing measures (related to lighting, electric motors, etc.) are in the pipeline.</p>
<p>This is also the case for renewable energies, where Council and Parliament adopted the</p>
<p>Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources on 4 May 2009.</p>
<p>As for incentives, Community instruments are available for financing energy efficiency projects, such as the European Parliament and Council Regulation 1080/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund, which was revised in order to allocate € 8 bn to energy-efficiency and renewable energy investments in housing. Within the context of the European Economic Recovery Plan, where emphasis is on "smart investments" through detailed proposals for partnerships between the public and private sectors, Community, EIB and national funding will be used. In this perspective, the European Council gave its support to an increased intervention by the EIB, notably for small and medium-sized enterprises, for renewable energy and for clean transport, as well as the simplification of procedures and a faster implementation of programmes financed by the Cohesion Fund, the Structural Funds and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development with a view to strengthening in particular investment in energy efficiency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0302"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the September 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member rightly asserts, free movement of persons is a basic component of the internal market and of the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice. It constitutes a right of all EU citizens, enshrined by Article 18 (1) of the EC Treaty, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in this Treaty and by measures adopted to give it effect.</p>
<p>It follows from the EC Treaty and Article 27 of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> that any limitations to this right can only be justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The application of any such limitation is subject to the control of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p>With regard to the specific point raised by the Honourable Member regarding the movement of Heads of State, the travel arrangements for such individuals, in view of the specific security and safety measures required, would be a matter exclusively for the Member States concerned. It is consequently not for the Council to take a view. This issue has never been discussed by the Council.</p>
<p>However, the Presidency welcomes the bilateral meeting between the Prime Ministers of Hungary and Slovakia held on 10 September, and considers the common statement that was published in connection to the meeting, as a positive sign. This statement seems to provide a good basis for a solution that will subvert the bilateral tensions between the two countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) A number of policy initiatives are promoting the development and wider use of cleaner technologies. They include:</p>
<p>the Environmental Technologies Action Plan (ETAP) has been implemented since 2004, with actions ranging from focussing Research and Development (R&amp;D) programmes, establishing Technology Platforms, mobilising financial instruments and public procurement, up to revising State Aid guidelines. A Green Paper on the future of ETAP will be proposed before the end of 2009;</p>
<p>the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan), adopted in 2007 as part of the EU Climate Change and Energy package, is targeted at accelerating the development and market take-up of low-carbon technologies. The tools are European Industrial Initiatives in technologies such as renewables and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), the European Energy Research Alliance and enhanced international cooperation;</p>
<p>the Lead Market Initiative, also adopted in 2007, aims at enlarging the market for innovative products and services in six priority areas including sustainable construction, renewable energy and recycling, with demand-side actions related to regulations, public procurement and standardisation;</p>
<p>the Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy Action Plan (SCP-SIP), adopted in 2008, intends also to promote eco-innovation to develop greener products and leaner production processes. The voluntary targets on Green Public Procurement (50% by 2010) will contribute to an increased uptake of environmental technologies and expansion of eco-industries.</p>
<p>These policy initiatives are also supported by Community funding instruments, such as the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework-Programme for R&amp;D, the new Competitiveness and Innovation Programme and the Cohesion Policy Funds.</p>
<p>It is estimated that about one third of the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme's budget supports research projects on clean or environmental technologies in all sectors. Those investments are also promoting the engagement of the private sector, through dedicated Joint Technology Initiatives or other forms of Public-Private Partnerships.</p>
<p>The revised Community framework on State Aids makes it easier for Member States to support financially the development and market uptake of cleaner technologies, using related provisions in the Community Guidelines on Research, Development and Innovation, the Guidelines on Environmental Protection and the General Block Exemption.</p>
<p>In addition, the revised Emissions Trading Directive<a href="#defann_11_1" name="refann_11_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> reserves 300 million allowances for support of CCS and innovative renewables.

<p>(EN) The development of wind energy forms part of the European Community's commitment to achieve a 20% share of renewable energies in overall EU energy consumption by 2020. This is a key element of the strategy to tackle CO2 emissions in the context of climate change. It supports other EU energy and environmental policy objectives - for example in terms of reduced air pollution, reduced water consumption from conventional power generation, reduced energy import dependency and increased job creation.</p>
<p>However, the Commission is aware that there are environmental risks from the inappropriate location of wind farms. Wind energy developments should be carried out in a sustainable and balanced way that does not lead to significant damage to sensitive areas of conservation importance: Special Protection Areas (SPAs) designated under the Birds Directive<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, and Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) established under the Habitats Directive<a href="#defann_12_2" name="refann_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, which form the Natura 2000 network.</p>
<p>Wind farms are also included in Annex II of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive<a href="#defann_12_3" name="refann_12_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. For projects listed in Annex II, Member States are required to determine whether an environmental impact assessment is required. Criteria such as the characteristics of the project, its location and the characteristics of the potential impact are to be taken into account.</p>
<p>This means that an EIA is required if these projects are likely to have significant effects on the environment. The EIA must take into account different factors, such as fauna and flora, but also human beings, soil, landscape or cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Any developments likely to have a significant adverse effect on Natura 2000 sites must be subject to an appropriate environmental assessment under Article 6 of the Habitats Directive. The Commission has provided general interpretative and methodological guidance on the application of this provision.</p>
<p>For public wind energy plans the provisions of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive<a href="#defann_12_4" name="refann_12_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> are also applicable.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that this environmental legislation is sufficient to properly assess the possible impacts of wind farm projects on the natural and cultural environment.</p>
<p>The rigour and quality of these environmental impact assessments is a responsibility firstly of the developers and finally of the Member States' competent environmental authorities.</p>
<p>To help them and to improve implementation, the Commission is working on specific guidelines on wind energy and nature conservation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Firstly, the Commission would point out that the issue of regularisations is not regulated by Community law and falls under the jurisdiction of the Member States. Consequently, residence permits may be granted to illegal persons at the Member States’ discretion within the scope of national legislation. A residence permit issued by a Schengen State is the equivalent of a visa and allows the holder to travel within the Schengen area. This also applies to residence permits issued in the case of regularisation.</p>
<p>However, the Pact on Immigration and Asylum contains the political undertaking by all Member States to ‘use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons’. According to the available information, it would seem that the Belgian regularisation procedure is in line with this approach.</p>
<p>Taking account of the fact that migration-related measures adopted at national level may have an impact beyond national borders, in 2006 the Council created the mutual information mechanism (MIM). This mechanism enables the sharing of information on national measures (such as regularisations) that are liable to have a significant impact on several Member States. It should be noted that the application in practice of the MIM remains disappointing, since the Member States make only very limited use of it. Thus, in future, the Commission will integrate the MIM into the annual process for monitoring implementation of the Pact on Immigration and Asylum.</p>
<p>The Commission monitors the issue of regularisations closely. In early 2009 it published an external study on regularisation practices within the Member States. This study will be useful for its future deliberations. The communication on the Stockholm Programme mentions, with reference to regularisations, the need to improve information sharing and the possibility of developing guidelines.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0268"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission does not consider that the measures adopted by the EU and Member State governments in response to the financial and economic crisis can, in any way, be described as a ‘harsh attack on workers with the aim of safeguarding the profits made by monopolies’. The overriding aim of those measures is to stem rising unemployment and to underpin eventual recovery, so that people throughout the EU can benefit from growth as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The EU Employment Summit held in Prague on 7 May took no decisions. The ten recommendations published should be considered a well-balanced set of policy priorities to create new jobs, maintain people in employment and promote active social inclusion. Furthermore, the social partners, and thus the trade unions, attended and participated actively in the Employment Summit.</p>
<p>The Commission has advocated more flexible labour markets, but has always stressed that these should be accompanied by more security for employment. The Commission has also advocated an increase in the retirement age to reflect the greater longevity of Europeans and the need to ensure that pension systems are socially sustainable. In order to ensure the long-term adequacy and sustainability of their pension systems, all Member States, including Greece, are faced with the challenge of raising the effective age at which people stop working and of securing employment for more people to work longer. In Greece’s case, this could involve increasing the pension eligibility age in public schemes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0291"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to thank the Honourable Member for his question regarding the recent EU-Egypt subcommittee on political matters and the Egyptian satellite provider NileSat, which broadcasts the TV station Al-Manar.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member that material broadcast by Al-Manar may amount to incitement to hatred.</p>
<p>Both Egypt and the EU are committed, as set down in our joint Action Plan established in 2007 in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, to “co-operate to combat all forms of discrimination, intolerance, racism and xenophobia, and in particular hate or defamatory discourse based on religion, beliefs, race, or origin….” The Commission is also committed to strengthening the role of media in combating these phenomena.</p>

<p>During the meeting, the Commission did indeed raise the issue of Al-Manar TV transmission via NileSat. The Commission expressed concern over the channel's content, which contravenes EU legislation against hate speech and undermines the EU’s and Egypt’s efforts to promote peace and security in the region.</p>
<p>Egypt did not offer comments on this occasion or make any commitment to stop the broadcasting of Al-Manar TV via NileSat.</p>

Similarly, the Belgian authorities of Club Brugge refused to allow Polish officials from the European Commission and the European Parliament to buy tickets for the match between Club Brugge and Lech Poznań last week (27 August 2009). This is yet another example of clear discrimination on the basis of country of origin.

<p>(EN) As regards the alleged entry ban imposed by the Danish authorities on Polish and Dutch nationals in possession of valid tickets for the Champions' League match between Brondby Copenhagen and Legia Warsawa, the Commission would welcome clarification as to whether the ban concerned the entry into the country or into the stadium as well as to if it was indeed imposed by the state authorities or the match organisers themselves. It would also be very useful to know the reasons invoked by the authorities or the match organisers when not allowing the persons concerned to attend the match.</p>
<p>In this context, it should be noted that it follows from the settled European Court of Justice case law<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> that Article 49 of the EC Treaty, guaranteeing the free provision of services throughout the EU, includes also the freedom for the recipients of services to go to another Member State in order to receive a service there, without being obstructed by restrictions unless these restrictions can be justified by overriding reasons of general interest such as security or public order and they are proportionate. This principle is also enshrined in Article 20 of the Services Directive 2006/123/EC<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (to be transposed by Member States by 28 December 2009) according to which Member States shall ensure</p>
<p>i) that the services recipient is not made subject to discriminatory requirements based on his nationality or place of residence</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>ii) that the general conditions of access to a service, which are made available to the public at large by the provider, do not contain discriminatory provisions relating to the nationality or place of residence of the recipient, but without precluding the possibility of providing for differences in the conditions of access where those differences are directly justified by objective criteria.</p>
<p>With regard to the right of EU citizens to move and reside freely, Directive 2004/38/EC<a href="#defann_22_3" name="refann_22_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> entitles Member States to deny EU citizens entry to the territory only on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. The restrictive measures must comply with the principle of proportionality and must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the EU citizen concerned which must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.</p>
<p>From the above, therefore, it does not follow that an entry ban would necessarily constitute unlawful discrimination or an unjustified restriction under Community law. It is worth mentioning that according to the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Regulations of the Champions' League, it is the home club who is responsible for order and security before, during and after the game.</p>
<p>As a result, to judge whether the alleged behaviour of the Danish authorities or the match organiser was in breach with Community law would require a more precise knowledge of the circumstances of the specific case.</p>
<p>As for the alleged denial by the Club Brugge to sell tickets to Polish nationals, officials of the EU Institutions, for the match between Club Brugge and Lech Poznan, the above reasoning with regard to non-discrimination and to unlawful restriction on free provision of services applies in a similar way. Again, more details would be needed to assess the compliance of the alleged behaviour with EC law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the Gojra incidents, and the violence against Christians there can only be described as appalling. It should like to mention at the outset, though, that it is not only Christians, but also other minorities, including Shias and Ahmadis, who are suffering from extremist violence in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Commission has raised the issue of religious minorities repeatedly during Joint Commissions and as part of the Troika dialogue. It will continue to raise this matter with Pakistan at every opportunity as part of the human rights dialogue.</p>
<p>Pakistani officials are fully aware that atrocities as the ones seen in Gojra not only cause immense personal suffering but tarnish Pakistan’s image. The Commission understands that the government has taken action in response to the incidents, including compensation for any loss of property and the establishment of a commission of enquiry. It will follow the situation closely, in particular progress in bringing the culprits to justice.</p>
<p>The Commission has also repeatedly brought up the blasphemy laws with the Government of Pakistan as part of the human rights dialogue. The Commission understands that, in absolute terms, the majority of those accused under the laws belong to the Muslim faith. But it is conscious of the fact that the blasphemy laws have often been applied against religious minorities, and have been given to understand that false accusations have been used as a tool to settle private disputes or for personal gain.</p>
<p>The Gojra incidents have given rise to renewed calls in Pakistan’s civil society to reform or repeal the blasphemy laws. The Commission would welcome such initiatives and will pass this message to the Pakistan government.</p>
<p>Article 1 of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on Partnership and Development refers to respect for human rights and democratic principles as an essential element of the Agreement. On the occasion of the 17 June 2009 Summit, both the EU and Pakistan stressed the importance of having an open and constructive dialogue in human rights forums.
