I would urge the President and the Conference of Presidents to look into this – to take their time and do it properly, but this, surely, is an instance where the imposition of penalties as foreseen under Rule 147 should be, at least, considered.</p>
<p class="contents">We revised this rule last year to distinguish very clearly between protests that are measured, that are visual but do not disrupt the sitting, and those sorts of behaviour which actually disrupt the parliamentary sitting. Yesterday, speakers – including our guest, the Prime Minister of Portugal – were shouted down so that they could not be heard. That is no way to behave in a pluralist, democratic parliament where we thrive on proper debate, not shouting people down.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the President to look into this and, perhaps at the January sitting, announce what penalties he intends to impose: at the very least a reprimand, as foreseen, but perhaps some of the more vigorous penalties that are provided for in our Rules of Procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I just wanted to agree wholeheartedly with both Mr Corbett and my group chairman, Mr Daul. What happened yesterday was utterly inexcusable. However, I would caution, perhaps, that the Conference of Presidents remembers the – perhaps wise – advice of Mr Cohn-Bendit not to give these people the prominence they seek through their quite unacceptable behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">I was wondering whether, perhaps, the services of Parliament might investigate whether additional facilities for Parliament’s crèche might be found, so that those suffering from what apparently is described as ‘offensive Faragia’ syndrome – the symptoms of which are feeling far out and outrageous; it can, in its extreme form, become contagious – but for those who feel obliged to go to this crèche, and I propose Mr Farage as its custodian, the only known therapy is for them to march up and down with a placard with single words on it and shout at each other at the top of their voice. When the fever subsides, they may rest and rejoin the grown-ups. So, I wish those who held up those absurd posters yesterday and those who behaved appallingly a merry Christmas; if they have time over the yuletide to reflect on their behaviour, they might even think what they would like to do when they grow up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again, Parliament wants to tackle the complex situation of the textile industry, asking the Commission for more decisive and appropriate intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">The sector employs millions of workers in Europe, and accounts for significant turnover in many countries, making Europe the second largest exporter in the world and therefore making a very important contribution to European exports. In my opinion, it is wrong to consider it a mature sector, because in many cases there is scope for modernisation through technological innovation and research into new materials, and it has strong links with fashion, styling and other specialities in which many European countries have genuine expertise recognised the world over.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, this requires substantial support for the sector through industrial policies that put it in the position of being truly capable of facing global competition. These are also suggestions made by the High Level Group that was set up, and consequently we are asking the Commission just what follow-up and implementation action it has taken. In the immediate future, the urgent problems concern the measures to be taken for the fateful date of 1 January 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention just three problems: the need for very careful checks: how does the Commission intend to implement the surveillance system to ensure there are effective safeguards; how it will cope with the risk of indirect movements and therefore the problem of twin checking of licences? Basically, for all instruments that look good on paper, the problem is how to put them into practice. There is the matter of how to guarantee the authenticity of products and thus the need to keep fighting counterfeiting, piracy and unfair commercial practices, and we hope that the Council – which is not here today – will adopt the ‘made in’ regulation, which is truly necessary and would be a genuine safeguard measure.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the problem of consumer protection, including from the point of view of health and safety. We should apply the same health and safety standards to imported products that we use for the manufacture of products within the European market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and we are directing this to the Commission – there is the problem of willingness to act. If at the beginning of 2008 there should again be a boom in imports, if there should be peaks again, as happened in the past, we are asking for a genuine willingness to use new instruments and possibly new measures and safeguard clauses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To try to cope with the crisis, Commissioner, you were recommending temporary palliative measures with the aim of controlling and restricting imports of some Chinese textiles. In a few days time, these safeguards will no longer exist and trade in textiles will be subject to joint European Union/Chinese surveillance, which I hope will be attentive and vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, our concern is about the way this system of joint surveillance will be set up. What guarantees do we have that this twin checking system will be both adequate and effective? The textiles sector is one that has always been globalist, both in terms of production and consumption, but it is one that has paid the price for globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, globalisation can be anticipated and regulated. For this to happen there needs to be the political will to set up a competitive framework for our European textile industries. We need to work towards fair and reciprocal conditions of market access. We need to continue to be fearless in using the instruments at the EU’s disposal to defend our trade; being protective is not the same thing as being protectionist. We need to prioritise the fight against counterfeiting. The Europe of tomorrow will no longer have any industry if we do not stand up for its intellectual copyrights and expertise. Having the same rules applied by everyone for everyone is the only way of offering all of the parties concerned a win-win scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish for 2008, Mr Mandelson, that together we can consider the textile sector’s bright future in a more peaceful climate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The joint resolution we are proposing today asks for a clear commitment from the European Commission and the Member States on several points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, for companies and workers in the sector who face major restructuring risks to be fully supported by adequate social measures and by the granting of European funds to support the modernisation of their production facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, we need to commit ourselves to improving the competitiveness of the European textiles sector within the more general framework of a strong and ambitious European industrial policy. This objective cannot be achieved until words turn into actions and until we invest heavily in research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in view of unfair competition from some of our competitors, who base their competitive advantages on social and environmental dumping, or both, Europe needs effective tools to defend itself. Greater efficiency will not be achieved by means of hurried reform, which will weaken the EU’s means of protection, but by the more transparent and predictable use of existing instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Europe needs to use the Euro-Mediterranean partnership as the foundation for an integrated manufacturing area that makes the most of the proximity of the Mediterranean countries to increase competitiveness in the international textiles market. The development of the Mediterranean countries with which we want to create a partnership depends on our ability to offer them firm commitments on policies and sectors of common interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">China joined the World Trade Organisation some time ago, and has enjoyed many benefits as a result of this, starting with the ban on reintroducing quotas on its textile exports. Having accepted these advantages, it should have reciprocated by meeting requirements defined and ratified by the World Trade Organisation. It does not seem to us that this has happened, and this is bad for international competition, which is still far from fair, and still far from having the same rules for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not talking about the comparative social and environmental advantages that unfortunately still remain outside any legal framework in multilateral trade negotiations and that one day, very soon I hope, must be brought into the framework of trade that can truly be described as fair. Today, I am talking about the rules that govern the strenuous fight against counterfeits, the safety standards of many products from toys to medicines, and access by our companies to markets like China, which is not the only one where, not just for textiles but also for other sectors, there are still tariff barriers and especially non-tariff barriers that make it very difficult for European industry and small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector to break into the Chinese market.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of situations like this in international trade, we should not be afraid, provided that the legal and economic requirements are met, to use the legitimate instruments available, which have been put in place by multilateral international agreements to protect and safeguard the textile industry, specifically to counterbalance the potential negative effects of the ending of quotas. I am talking about the function and effectiveness of the High Level Group for surveillance of the textile market, which will have the task of monitoring the operation of the market in Europe through the import and export licence twin checking system. This is one method that should identify indirect trade movements and provide information about flows of imports.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to have the courage and strength to implement the safeguard clause on the basis of the WTO rules and to reintroduce the quotas, at least temporarily, if there is serious damage to our industry from abnormal import levels. I am thinking about the constant use of trade protection instruments, such as anti-dumping and anti-subsidy rules and, more generally, about keeping a channel of comparison open between China and the European Union at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">Our textile industry is not afraid of competition, but it must be put in a position to be able to cope with it. Consequently, we need to act on two different fronts. On the one hand it is important to encourage the modernisation and restructuring process that will make the sector more competitive, with social shock absorbers to cope with a possible backlash, and on the other we need to ensure the sector is fighting on a level playing field, with the same rules for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, this is also why we are inviting the Commission and the Council to get the identification of product origins off to a stronger and more incisive start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Caroline Lucas  (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span><span class="bold">. –</span> Mr President, I should like to emphasise that the Greens are very aware that the consequences of a totally liberalised textile and apparel market for EU-based producers is still a very pressing issue, particularly for certain production zones within the EU in which the industry is highly concentrated. Several hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost since the beginning of 2005, albeit fewer than some of the worst predictions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens have from the start flagged our concern about the impact of competition on European producers. I think we need to monitor the situation carefully and be ready to apply import restrictions if import surges in the next year overwhelm the capacity of EU-based apparel industries to adapt, as well, of course, as channelling research and development resources to that sector.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we need to be aware that the problem is very much harder for certain poor countries in the South, like Bangladesh and the Philippines, which have been induced by the World Bank and other donors to invest heavily in exporting clothing and apparel products and now find themselves with shrinking export opportunities, a continuous debt burden, no financial means for adjustment of the sector, and misery – especially for millions of women who work for almost nothing in nightshifts in order to undercut the cheapest offer on the market with an even cheaper one.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in fact, that latter perspective that emphasises that in certain sectors, where too many producers produce too many products, some kind of management tools to control supply are necessary and in the interests of the majority. That is why I urge colleagues to support the amendment that the Greens and Socialists have filed together, which reads: ‘Calls on the Commission to evaluate the usefulness of supply-side management tools for the clothing sector, in order to level off global competition and prevent a lowest-common-denominator approach to social and environmental standards.’</p>
<p class="contents">A completely liberalised market in sectors characterised by overproduction capacities brings misery to all but a few. In that respect I think we should use the example of the apparel industry to press for new thinking about the way in which policy ought to regulate markets for the benefit of all. The reintroduction of some kind of quotas should be considered in this evaluation of supply-side management tools.</p>
<p class="contents">Another option mentioned in the joint resolution which deserves a more comprehensive evaluation is the creation of a Euromed production zone of the clothing and apparel industry. Indeed, that option not only points towards the improvement of opportunities for development in the southern Mediterranean rim states, but also gives opportunities to the southern European textile and apparel producers who would profit from shorter transportation times to EU markets. It is one of the good examples of how a Euromed economic zone could be sensitively managed without dragging the whole of the Mediterranean region in all-out liberalisation through a free trade agreement. From my Group’s perspective, we regard this proposal as an option in its own right that should be fostered independently of the contested 2010 Euromed free-trade-agreement project, which, according to the sustainability impact assessments done by DG Trade in the Commission, would involve a significant number of quite negative social and environmental consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope that the debate will help to protect jobs and the activity of the textile and clothing sector, a strategic sector for the European Union, which has been so little protected and so undervalued.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the questions to the Commission, we have nothing to add; they have been tabled. As regards the joint motion for a resolution, due to be adopted by the European Parliament today, we should like to point out that, although it contains certain points that might in practice protect and promote the textile and clothing sector in the European Union, we have reservations about some other points.</p>
<p class="contents">To give just three examples: the ‘Globalisation Adjustment Fund’ should not be used as a temporary cushion against the unacceptable social and economic costs of closure and relocation of undertakings, with the consequent destruction of jobs. That is, we should intervene on the causes, not the effects. The current liberalisation policies need to be reversed and financial means made available that effectively help to protect jobs, to modernise the sector and also to promote the introduction of other industries, including those linked to textiles and clothing, thus making for industrial diversification in regions where that activity is currently concentrated.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not make much sense to urge the European Union to encourage others to review their monetary policies if the EU does not first critically reappraise the strong euro policy and its impact on some EU countries’ exports. Nor would it make sense to call for trade defence instruments in relation to China, whilst simultaneously supporting the setting up of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not have time in this speech to summarise all our proposals on the European Union’s clothing and textile industry. They are set out in our motion for a resolution. However, we should like to mention some of the amendments tabled to the joint resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">They aim at making up for the lack of any mention of the serious consequences of the liberalisation of the textile and clothing industry at global level, with the closure and relocation of numerous undertakings, in particular to North Africa and Asia, leaving a trail of unemployment and serious socio-economic crises; stressing also that the double-checking ‘surveillance system’ will serve no purpose unless it prevents any repetition of the situation that occurred in 2005, underscoring the need for new safeguard measures so as to enable employment in, and the business of, the textiles and clothing sector to be safeguarded and promoted in the EU. The proposals highlight that some countries have adopted safeguard measures applying until the end of 2008 and it is therefore difficult to understand why the EU has not followed suit.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals also express disquiet at the Commission’s intentions to review trade defence instruments according to the interests of firms which are relocating their production to countries where, because of the low wages and social and environmental standards, production costs are lower. They propose that a Community programme should be drawn up for the textiles and clothing sector, and especially for the more disadvantaged regions that depend on it and aid for SMEs. They are proposals which maintain that a regulatory framework needs to be laid down to penalise company relocations, making public aid to businesses subject to long-term commitments regarding regional development and employment, including the requirement to pay back aid if such conditions are not met. Finally, they are proposals which call for a stronger role for workers’ representatives in company boards and in fundamental organisational decision-making. They are proposals that we hope will have the support of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peter Mandelson, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Mr President, as Members of this House know, back in 2005 the EU and China agreed a memorandum of understanding that included a two-and-a-half-year transition arrangement designed to give some extra breathing space to EU textile producers following the liberalisation of global trade in textiles and clothing.</p>
<p class="contents">The arrangement capped growth each year for 10 particularly sensitive textile and clothing products. These caps expire on 31 December 2007, although the memorandum itself remains valid until the end of 2008, and it commits industry and government on both sides to work for a stable transition to free trade in textiles.</p>
<p class="contents">It was always my intention to hold China to that responsibility. The Commission negotiated with China a double-checking surveillance system for 2008 that will cover eight textile-product categories with particular sensitivities.</p>
<p class="contents">What this means is that China will issue an export licence for all exports and, in parallel, the EU licensing offices in the Member States will issue an import licence. It is a familiar system, and manufacturers, importers and retailers have all welcomed it. Its value lies in allowing us to monitor textile import patterns and, because imports have to be licensed before they leave the dock in China, it allows us to see likely developments in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">I am the first to acknowledge the fact that the textile and clothing industry is going through a long period of structural change. This started long before the dismantling of quotas. Successful European companies are not taking the mass producers head on but are investing in technology and in quality. We remain – it is always worth saying it – the second biggest textile exporter in the world. We have more fashion and quality brands than the rest of the world put together. It is a sign of the European textile producers’ confidence and resilience that they have not called for quotas to be further extended. They have argued that their competitiveness depends more now on effective action on counterfeiting and market access in China.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that I intend to throw the entire weight of our trade policy behind these two problems. On market access, we will be seeking new access for textile goods in the Doha Round and in all our new FTAs. We have also set up a specific working group for textiles as part of the renewed market access strategy. Europe is well poised to exploit huge new markets for consumer goods in the emerging economies and we will not simply be sitting back and hoping that these trends go our way.</p>
<p class="contents">Counterfeiting is, if anything, an even greater problem. Protecting trademarks and design rights is absolutely central to the textile industry and I raise these issues with the Chinese in every single meeting I have with them.</p>
<p class="contents">We have done some useful collaborative work with the Chinese customs service and trade fair organisers, and the Chinese patent office. But, on balance, China remains a huge problem for intellectual property rights holders. The counterfeit markets are cleared out one day and the traders creep back in the next. As I have said in the past, we have not ruled out the prospect of using the WTO if the situation does not improve. Ms Toia mentioned the ‘Made in’ proposal to assist textiles: I made this proposal, I presented it to the Commission, it was agreed by the Commission but it has not been agreed, I am afraid, by the majority of Member States. In view of this, I cannot press the proposal further or do more than I have done.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, at the EU-China summit in Beijing, I was very careful to pass on some frank messages, and they apply in the textile sector as much as anywhere. The EU-China trade relationship has been transformed in the last two decades. Both sides have benefited from it immensely but it has become badly imbalanced. While China dominates our import markets, our businesses are losing out in China because of counterfeiting and market-access barriers amounting to EUR 55 million a day in lost business opportunities. Our spiralling trade deficit reflects both these things.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not because of a lack of competitiveness by European producers. We have a surplus in goods trade with the rest of the world and, where we are allowed to compete freely, we are a match for anyone. This is not the case in China. Instead of a level playing field, it is seriously tilted against us. We face trade and investment restrictions, rampant counterfeiting and regulatory barriers in virtually every sector. China’s WTO obligations six years after it became a member are still too often unmet.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the textiles problems as emblematic of the broader problems we face in China. We are China’s largest client for clothing and textiles. We have respected China’s comparative advantage in labour and production costs. We are focusing on our own comparative advantages. We are moving up the value chain in what we produce. We expect the same sort of equal opportunity and fair treatment in China’s market that Chinese producers receive in ours.</p>
<p class="contents">At the recent summit, the Premier of China, Wen Jiabao, appeared to hear and understand our strong concern and offered to create a high-level strategic mechanism with the EU to focus on rebalancing our trade deficit with China.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this, with one obvious caveat: it is not one more dialogue or one more roadmap we need, it is action – on the ground, in the markets, in the courts, where it matters to European exporters. And action not just by the Ministry of Commerce but across the board by the regulating agencies and ministries which restrict market access and law enforcement in all parts of China’s economy. The openness of Europe’s own markets to China will not be politically sustainable if this action does not occur.</p>
<p class="contents">I talk of textiles and clothing products, but also all sectors where Europe has export interests. The practical delivery of real change by the new high-level trade deficit mechanism, which I and my trade counterpart are charged with designing and launching, will be the definitive test of China’s sincerity. I hope their sincerity matches our own in wishing to resolve the issues before us without resorting to avoidable confrontation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Congratulations! I think it is exactly what this House wanted to hear and I certainly hope he continues with the points that he has raised today in his negotiations with China. It is encouraging, and it looks to me as though he has a total and utter grasp of the situation. He would not expect me to say that, but I am saying it because I think he has done exactly what is wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just say one thing, or two or three things, very briefly. Yesterday, I heard in this House one of the best speeches that I have ever heard any head of state give, and that was by the King of Jordan. One of the things that he mentioned was the situation with Euromed, which has a specific relevance to textiles and, of course, is very important for the stability of the whole European/Mediterranean region. Perhaps the Commissioner could just add his comments on that, because it is coming up for negotiations. I think it is particularly important, particularly as we have Turkey on one side and Morocco on the other; all would be particularly affected by our relationships with China.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as one who does not believe in trade defence instruments and believes more in a free market, but in a free and fair market where competition is equal, I am pleased to hear that he is following those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what exactly will happen after the Commission’s double checking finishes – I believe the Commissioner said at the end of 2008 – bearing in mind the United States has just put in place very strict import conditions? Will this mean more products coming on to the European market than we already have?</p>

Certainly nothing good. China has developed into the most aggressive textile power in the world and in 2006 alone, 50 to 60% of high technology in textiles was bought for China in the ring-spinning, weaving and texturing machine sector. Capacities are now waiting in the wings.</p>
<p class="contents">European retailers and manufacturers are no longer ordering, but are waiting for better offers from China. Further bankruptcies are imminent. The European focus on trade will create even bigger problems for us in other sectors, not just in textiles.</p>
<p class="contents">The volume of products we are offered will, of course, increase. The variety of textiles, however, will fall. If the issue is still to have any meaning, then further restructuring of the industry in the European Union must be flanked and more effectively cushioned in social terms. Only a very few niche producers will survive.</p>
<p class="contents">This development also has an extra dimension, however. In China, working and pay conditions for textile, garment and leather workers are still abysmal. European retailers and investors are in addition beating down prices in China. Alongside all the competitive advantages in China, survival is made more difficult because of the strong European support given to the remaining European textile industry. A fast buck is always at the expense of the smallest players.</p>
<p class="contents">As a trade unionist, I would expect the sports economy staging the Olympics in China to reveal what it is like for the female workforce there. Today 350 to 400 people already die on a daily basis in China’s textile factories. Up to 100 sustain mutilations to their hands every day. Nine out of ten Chinese manufacturers violate international labour standards and even labour standards laid down in Chinese legislation!</p>
<p class="contents">However, business is going well for us in the retail trade. As a trade unionist and as Vice-President of the International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers’ Federation, I would say to you that it is too late, but not too late for us to take social measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been very few debates recently in which we have heard people from different sides of the House representing different political sensibilities all talking the same language, with exactly the same objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We support free trade, without a doubt, and we support it as a very clear principle. It is therefore not about creating barriers: it is about ensuring that the rules of the game are the same for everyone and accepting that the unfair competition by China, through imposing restrictions on access to the market and through extremely serious, permanent and systematic infringements of intellectual and industrial property rights, or the lack of controls on imports, or the question of exchange rate differences, which obviously not only affect textiles but also many other spheres of our commercial relationship, and other measures on the part of China are placing the industry in an extremely serious and very delicate situation. The industry is continuing to exist and defend itself in order to survive and is not asking for protection, as Commissioner Mandelson rightly said in his speech, on which I certainly congratulate him. It is not asking for barriers, it is asking for the rules of the game to be equal for everyone, and it is asking to be able to play on equal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact the situation is changing entirely from the end of the year, and the Commission cannot just note this, observing it as if it was a meteorological phenomenon It has a large number of weapons and tools at its disposal, such as import controls, with which to ensure that the rules of the game are indeed the same, and it can use the defence mechanisms that it has at its disposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had already read about them in detail in the European press.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my contribution. The future of the European textile sector in the light of China’s economic rise is at the forefront of this debate. Time after time, the Union reveals itself as unable to anticipate China’s development adequately. The reason for this is the Union’s inability to develop an unambiguous trade policy. The European Union is divided into a northern and a southern camp, be it on the subject of quotas for textile products or of the reform of trade defence measures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time, therefore, that the Member States learned to see beyond their own interests alone. An initial step in this regard is the recognition by the northern camp that the protection of its own industry against piracy and illegal State aid is not protectionism, and that an effective set of instruments is required for that protection. The southern camp must realise that China’s rise has consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must no longer let itself be caught off guard, as happened in 2005 when the Multifiber Agreement expired. Europe’s industries must seek niche markets in good time. After all, the options for reintroducing quotas are limited until the end of 2008. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On several occasions I have highlighted the fact – and I have not been the only one to do so – that genuine competition and competitiveness for our products in the internal market, more so than in the external market, is assured not only or not so much by a system of quotas, but chiefly by defending the sector from unfair competition. Such competition is unfair because it is based on vastly lower cost and production conditions. The added value of Chinese production at that cost is disproportionate, because of well-known production factors that are inconsistent with those on our much more civilised continent.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we imagine we can compete with manufacturing where the costs are infinitely lower but where, even in terms of comparative quality, the products are now almost equal to many European products? I believe there is really only one option open to us, the only thing that can re-establish a bit of what I might call fair trade and sustainable competition: a surveillance system over Chinese imports should be based, in my opinion, on checking that manufacturing conditions are not very different from those our industry has to provide. We may not be able to demand that labour costs are the same but we can demand that products are definitely made without the use of child labour or in conditions that are shameful or akin to slavery, and that they are made without causing massive damage to the environment, beyond the insufficiently verified environmental safety, consumer safety and certified quality.</p>
<p class="contents">A different policy should also be applied to European industries that relocate outside the EU and engage in unfair competition with respect to industries that continue to manufacture within the EU, perhaps through tax measures that counteract the advantage over companies that do not relocate, to achieve a new balance.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, distribution conditions in Europe should also be monitored more closely, in view of what is certainly going on in Italy at least, where what is actually wholesale marketing masquerades as retail distribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The outlines of an overall European strategy could be drawn as follows: firstly, ensuring improved access for European products to foreign markets, through the greatest possible worldwide convergence of customs duties at low levels; and eliminating customs barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, achieving effective application of the rules of origin to imports.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, giving substantial support, through the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, to small and medium-sized enterprises affected by liberalisation.

<p class="contents">Fourthly, ensuring that there is an effective way of combating piracy and counterfeiting, given that the textile and clothing sector accounts for more than 50% of the recorded cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, maintaining and strengthening the trade defence instruments, which are absolutely essential for combating illicit practices which harm competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, guaranteeing that products imported into the European Union are subject to equivalent safety and consumer protection rules.</p>

<p class="contents">In view of the removal of the quota system, which is concluding this year, the agreement will help, or should help, at least, to guarantee that the transition to a free market throughout 2008 is done correctly. This is essential for European manufacturing companies, which have already had to deal with huge challenges, as other speakers have said. The industry and the authorities will have to work together in order to closely monitor the development of trade patterns with China and prevent a repeat of the situation that occurred in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">We do, however, regret the fact that the categories covered by the June 2005 agreement only included eight of the 10 products that were subject to limits until 31 December of this year, and on this point I would like you to clarify what the Commission’s strategy is going to be for monitoring the two categories of products that have been excluded from the agreed double control system, which are cotton fabrics and table and kitchen linen.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, no doubt that in addition to this agreement we will need to continue to act in other areas in order to guarantee that European industry can compete under fair and reciprocal conditions, for example by making progress on the indication of origin marking – although there are the difficulties that you pointed out – or by promoting working, social and environmental conditions in the negotiation of trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">All the institutions and businesses must focus on R&amp;D, using the wide range of possibilities offered by the Seventh Framework Programme, and we need to anticipate the changes and, at the same time, take into account the effects of restructuring by adopting the social measures needed to support workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to welcome the agreement reached on the occasion of the Tenth Europe-China Summit that you mentioned, through which a high-level working group will be created to tackle key issues such as the trade deficit, difficulties accessing the Chinese market and intellectual property rights.</p>

The answer lies to a great extent with the European Commission. Last month in Beijing, Commissioner Mandelson denounced the poor safety of Chinese products, the enormous influx of counterfeit goods and the dumping of Chinese export goods. Quite rightly, he threatened to lodge a complaint with the WTO. Europe’s daily imports from China amount to half a billion euro, and eight out of ten of the counterfeit goods intercepted originate from that country.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as from counterfeits, however, the European textile sector is currently suffering from the weakness of the US dollar. The weak dollar not only mortgages our exports, but also gives an artificial advantage to countries continuing to use the dollar as a currency. Coincidentally, those countries are situated mainly in Asia, and, not so coincidentally, China is holding on to the dollar. This is intolerable for the textile sector, which works with large volumes and low profit margins.</p>
<p class="contents">Our industry cannot and must not fall victim to a strong European currency. Hence the need to use the euro more and more in our trade relations. After all, that was, I thought, one of the reasons for the introduction of our single currency five years ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is all very clearly reflected in internal cohesion. In the case of the textile industry, the fact that the sector is mainly made up of small and medium-sized enterprises is a disadvantage on the market that represents 6% of total world trade and an estimated turnover of EUR 566 billion. In addition, many producer regions are suffering the consequences of economic restructuring, so that it is difficult to achieve sustainability in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">European production is forced to compete with that of countries that artificially devalue their currency, do not respect environmental protection rules or bear the costs of environmental protection, that frequently infringe intellectual property rights or, even more seriously, on the social and employment front, apart from having much lower wage costs, do not apply such stringent worker protection measures as Europe does. It is therefore all the more pressing to make sure that WTO rules are respected and that the Commission is able to monitor imports, not allowing a veil to be artificially drawn over the excesses noted in practice with China as regards textile imports, as has happened in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must adopt all the measures needed to safeguard the interests of the European Union, including if necessary the imposition of quotas on China, possibly up to the end of 2008, within the WTO legal framework and must also insist upon total respect for the rules of fair play. European producers lack incentives for research and development and for improving the skills of the labour force, they do not have appropriate access to external markets or an effective means of preventing counterfeiting. Intellectual property is basic to the added value of the sector and must be defended at all costs in order to encourage production with a high added value. Finally, Mr President, Commissioner, consumer safety must not be forgotten. It falls to the Commission to prevent any product that might be harmful to our families from coming into the homes of Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we have made some progress, but not very much. Here we are, still demanding more research and development and asking the Commission to make sure that intellectual copyrights are respected. These are decisive factors but they are not enough. It makes me think that, instead of being a factor of the growth of trade and economic development, the WTO and its rules act as a brake. Trade is obviously a source of growth, but in order to be so, it needs to work in both directions. The textiles issue in fact throws up two fundamental problems: the absence of an EU industrial policy and the question of the European interest.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the European interest, I welcome with some satisfaction the Commission communication entitled ‘The European Interest: Succeeding in the age of globalisation’, published in early October, which says that we need: ‘to have ground rules which do not impinge on our capacity to protect our interests and to safeguard our high product standards relating to health, safety, the environment and consumer protection’.

I should like to address two remarks to him, however. The textile industry is not only important to southern Europe, as Belgium, too, for example, still has a very flourishing textile industry, which provides 25 000 jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the disappearance of quotas for the 10 finished products on 1 January threatens to have serious repercussions again not only for the sectors concerned, but also for upstream businesses. Taking the example of the jeans sector, if this is swamped with Chinese products, whether or not at dumping prices, the producers of the denim material and of the thread are also directly affected. Thus, of course, the ramifications are much broader than they seem at first glance.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark, Commissioner, is that the ‘monitoring system’ currently only monitors the volume of the imported goods. It would be much more efficient if monitoring were also carried out on the basis of prices – and this a priori, or at the time licences are issued. Only in this way is a genuinely proactive, preventive approach possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Mandelson, we should also like you to tell us when the Commission is planning to take action, as this is rather confusing and vague. In other words, how big do imports from China have to grow and how much do the prices of these imports have to decrease before you actually start to take action? It strikes us as no more than logical that we obtain some clarity on this, too, in advance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would at the outset reject Mr Belder’s view that we do not have a common trade policy in the EU, and that the Member States are so divided that we cannot pursue a policy on, for example, textiles.</p>
<p class="contents">Our experience in textiles demonstrates only too clearly that we do, in fact, have a common trade policy, through which we have been able to bring together Member States with different emphases and different orientations, to weld together their views and to produce a common trade policy in textiles that has been consistently pursued. There may be differences on the use of trade defence instruments, but through the review and anticipated reform I want to build fresh consensus and solidarity amongst Member States on the use of those trade defence instruments, and notably on their greater use by SMEs, for which I want to bring forward proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Some specific points have been made, for example about the double-checking surveillance which will be in operation in 2008. The Commission will monitor textile imports from China in as close to real time as possible. This includes double-checking surveillance and any other monitoring means at the Commission’s disposal, such as the TAXUD surveillance, which provides trade data on the basis of actual trade. In the face of a sudden surge of Chinese textiles, the Commission stands ready to use all the instruments at its disposal, should the situation so require.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would stress that the 2005 deal was a once-and-for-all deal, and the Commission does not intend to make proposals for the extension of the levels agreed. As such, it is not opposed to more trade, and an increase could be expected. Should the upsurge, however, take such dimensions that action is justified, this will be based on existing requirements and criteria. We do rely on the co-responsibility of China for this smooth transition. China is well aware that it is not in its interests to repeat what happened in 2005. We also rely on the economic operators’ self-interest to avoid a recurrence of 2005. Textiles are now moving into the same category as any other product, so the usual instruments – including trade defence instruments – apply, with the usual standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of EU assistance for the textiles industry has been raised. Let me make two last points on this. At the EU level, the Commission has committed over EUR 70 million, for research and development under the sixth framework programme, to textile and clothing projects, while two innovation project proposals have acquired funding within the Europe Innova framework.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Globalisation Fund is concerned, it is as open to the textile sector as to other sectors. There have, so far, been eight formal applications for a contribution from the European Globalisation Fund, of which four concern textiles. None of these textile cases have yet been approved by the budgetary authority. They are all still being assessed by the Commission services.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I turn to the issue of the Euro-Mediterranean, raised by Mr Sturdy. The Commission has set up a formal Euro-Mediterranean dialogue on the future of the textile and clothing industry, in order to define common strategies towards achieving better competitiveness of the industry in the Euro-Mediterranean zone. The objective of the dialogue is to bring Euro-Mediterranean countries and candidate countries together, in order to find common solutions for improving their competitiveness. I look forward to receiving proposals emerging from that dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">David Martin  (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Mr President, this report had to be put together rather quickly, because we anticipated – we even hoped – that the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Korea might be concluded by the end of this year. That is clearly not going to be the case but, nevertheless, we are pleased that Parliament is able to report today and we hope, through our report today, that we will be able to influence the Commission’s position.</p>
<p class="contents">To get to where we are today, some of my colleagues had to work extremely hard, and I would like to thank Christopher Ford from the Trade Committee and Emmanuelle Le Texier from the PSE Group, who worked above and beyond the normal call of duty to get this report prepared in time. I would also like to thank Commissioner Mandelson and his services for the good cooperation I have had from the Commission in producing this report, and also the Korean Ambassador, whose assistance enabled me to get an insight into the Korean position on these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Historically, free trade agreements between the European Union and Asian countries have been trade-light, despite their name. I think this could be the exception to the rule. Korea has shown a willingness and an ability to negotiate a far-reaching and comprehensive bilateral trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Korea is a significant player in the region in Asia. It is now a wealthy country, the 11th largest economy in the world. Its per capita income is comparable to Spain. It is an economy that is growing quickly, and trade between our two regions – between Korea and the European Union – reached EUR 60 billion last year. So it is a deal worth doing, and, if we can get it right, I think it is a win-win situation. The Korean manufacturing industry, for example, can win through access to European services, enabling Korean manufacturing to expand and to compete more favourably. We can win, through access to the Korean market for some of our key goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">The timetable, as I mentioned, was originally set for conclusion by the end of this year. It now realistically looks like May next year will be the earliest negotiations can be concluded, but I am encouraged that, after five rounds of negotiations, talks seem to be getting down to the nitty gritty and seem to be getting serious. There are clearly still significant gaps between the European Union position on issues like country-of-origin labelling, technical standards for the automobile industry and on tariff concessions for goods. But the key point is that negotiations are now being conducted at a serious and detailed level.</p>
<p class="contents">My main concerns come in the field of, firstly, social and environmental standards. Even with this delay, the Korean agreement looks like being the first of the new generation of FTAs that we agree. As such, it can be a template for further FTAs, and I would like to see our ambitions in relation to environmental and social standards raised. I would like to ensure that there is a dispute settlement mechanism in the Agreement. I do not believe that we should settle for anything less than the United States have settled for, and they have got a dispute settlement mechanism in their report. I believe issues like ratification of key ILO conventions and the post-2012 application of any new climate change agreement cannot be left to mere gentlemen’s agreements or simply encouraging people to do things. We have to actually have some mechanism for settling disputes. I hope the Commission will look at this again.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to argue that the Kaesong Industrial Complex should be looked at sympathetically in relation to such an agreement. I accept the Commission’s approach that, firstly, we have to get the Free Trade Agreement; but if we can get the FTA, before signature we should look at how we can assist South Korea in terms of encouraging North Korea to come into the real world. The Kaesong Industrial Complex, based in North Korea but run by South Korean companies, is a way of engaging North Korea with the rest of the world, and it is a process that we should be encouraging. I believe that, through our trade agreement, we can do much to assist South Korea in this process. It is not just a matter of interest for South Korea but it is a matter of interest for the world. It makes the world a safer place if North and South Korea can cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is an important free trade agreement. I believe it is one that both the EU and Korea can win if we get the right deal. I support the Commission’s view that we should not rush to a settlement, and that a good settlement is better late than a bad settlement that we get early. I hope, when Korea changes president at the beginning of next year, that the new president will instruct his administration to work tirelessly to reach this agreement before the summer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Together they have produced a comprehensive and balanced report, which I commend.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s endorsement of this motion for a resolution will send a clear signal of support for the Commission’s policy of seeking an ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) with South Korea, as part of the strategy laid out in the Global Europe Communication of October 2006. The choice of South Korea as partner for this generation of free trade agreements reflects the important economic and political potential of the country, but it is also an acknowledgement of the reality that important barriers exist and persist to stronger economic and trade ties between us.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion is timely: free trade negotiations with South Korea were launched in May 2007, and have progressed rapidly so far. We are ready to work for an early conclusion so long as the substance and quality of the outcome are right. That is our bottom line and it will remain so.</p>
<p class="contents">Our FTA with South Korea should be fully WTO-compatible. That goes without saying. We seek far-reaching liberalisation in trade in goods and services, as well as in investment. We are paying special attention to non-tariff barriers and to rules and regulations in key areas, such as intellectual property rights, competition and government procurement. I fully agree with the importance the report attaches to non-tariff barriers and to effective dispute settlement machinery in this and other aspects of the prospective agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Studies have suggested that, in some sectors in Korea, non-tariff barriers are now more important than the tariffs themselves. Substantial improvements on these behind-the-border barriers to trade, creating real market access for EU exports to South Korea, will be absolutely key to conclusion of the FTA.</p>
<p class="contents">On a few of the specific concerns that have been raised, the question of Kaesong raises complex technical and political questions. We welcome the amendments proposed in this regard, because they highlight the complexity of the question, which will require careful consideration. The recognition and promotion of the social and environmental aspects of trade – sustainable development – will be an integral part of the free trade agreement with South Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that effective enforcement of standards is key to securing an ambitious and effective result on sustainable development in this agreement. However, a cooperative tone can achieve much more in this area than the appearance of coercion. We expect to cover a greater number of multilateral environmental agreements, and to include issues such as decent work and a stronger commitment to ILO core conventions, and expect to go beyond other recent agreements, such as those covered by the Korea-US FTA. We will also aim to involve the social partners and civil society in this cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The sustainability impact assessment has been launched. The main findings of draft reports in the different phases will be discussed with civil society. We have set up the SIA to ensure that there will be continuous and rapid feedback into the negotiation process. This builds on the initial contacts we had with civil society at the start of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also worked closely with Parliament. The cooperation with the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade has been excellent. I myself, as well as the Director-General, have regularly updated that Committee. As far as the ratification procedure is concerned, this will depend on the content of the agreement itself, but the Commission is in favour of involving Parliament as much as is possible under the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a possible future FTA covering the bilateral trade relations with South Korea will be part of an overall and coherent framework of EU relations with South Korea. The existing bilateral framework agreement will continue to govern bilateral cooperation and political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the goal of this FTA is to complement an ambitious Doha outcome by going deeper and further bilaterally with South Korea. Past experience shows that such agreements can road test liberalisation solutions and become stepping-stones for the future evolution of the WTO. An ambitious and comprehensive FTA with South Korea is not just commercially significant, but will also mean an important upgrading of the bilateral EU-Korea relationship. It is also a recognition of the engagement of the EU on the Korean Peninsula and in the region. In a wider sense, it is part of our broader commitment to ensuring that EU trade policy in Asia is keeping up with the dramatic development of that region, and securing the benefits in terms of jobs, growth and growing trade for both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We think an agreement is reasonable, but would nevertheless point out that there have been considerable sectoral problems with Korea in the past. I am thinking here of the discussion on dumping prices in the shipbuilding industry in recent years, for instance, where we also had lawsuits. We wish to ascertain whether these sectoral problems are being resolved in order to ensure that both sides really are opening up and Korea is not the unilateral beneficiary, and that – even when we think of our pharmaceutical industry, the car industry, of the many industrial sectors – reciprocity is guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">One particular subject was Kaesong. The Commissioner has just addressed the issue of how to involve these North Korean special zones. According to what I am hearing, eight other special zones are planned. In the opinion of the Committee on Industry, international standards must apply here. We cannot undermine our own free trade agreements in this way. We therefore ask that this aspect in particular be thoroughly checked. Otherwise, many thanks – to the Commission, too – for these negotiations! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our negotiators should take note of it. We should also learn from the recently completed USA-Korea FTA, which shows that speed of conclusion is important, but should not be the top priority. The main goal should clearly be to accomplish high quality and an even playing field in flows of trade. Today, those flows are still seriously impeded by non-trade barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">Korea does not apply international norms or labelling requirements regarding automotive products or other important products such as pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and electronics. There is also a need for clarification in the area of intellectual property rights and counterfeiting. These issues need to be resolved before we sign this FTA, in order to ensure free and fair trade. Unless all these issues are resolved to our complete satisfaction, I would advise the Commission not to sign this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I admire the economic miracle of South Korea, which is reflected in the fact that it is the European Union’s fourth largest trading partner. Having a strong democracy has obviously benefited them greatly, and one has to feel sorry for their brothers and sisters in North Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be prepared to do all we can to bring about an emotional reunion similar to the one we saw in the late 1980s between East and West Germany. This should, of course, be based on the principle of democracy, which has brought so much success to South Korea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Martin, on behalf of my group. The report has been written with great care and it actually alludes to all the points that are important and have to be debated. It also advises on the appropriate caution to be exercised on certain subjects, e.g. in the automotive sector. In this respect I believe it is an excellent report, which is a good prerequisite and should accordingly be considered by the Commission and the Council. I am pleased to hear that the Commissioner has responded so meticulously to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to ask the Commissioner: how will negotiations with Korea generally proceed, in your view? Negotiations are indeed underway and are at a very difficult stage. It seemed very much better at the beginning, I believe, than we have thought in the meantime. Parallel negotiations with all the ASEAN nations are also being added, of course. These negotiations are also – as far as I have gathered from the Minutes – at a very difficult stage. What is the Commission’s assessment of this? What influence will our ongoing negotiations with ASEAN have on negotiations with Korea?</p>
<p class="contents">My last question to the Commissioner relates to the fact that the Heads of State or Government are just about to sign the Reform Treaty today, 13 December. Under this Reform Treaty, Parliament will in future have a great deal more influence in the retail sector, for which we in this Parliament have been fighting for a very long time. I should like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Mandelson in particular for always having backed this.</p>
<p class="contents">My question, however, is this: can you imagine that the Commission will support us when we ask the Council for the right that has already been brought forward under the upcoming free trade agreement and that Parliament will therefore keep the relevant endorsement obligation? Can we assume that we have you on our side in this, Commissioner? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In reality, not all reports are equal. It is important that, although here we vote on all sorts of documents, we point out when some of them have a content and a solidity that enable them to be examined in detail, and cover all the subjects that are up for discussion. I therefore congratulate the rapporteur and the team that supported him in making this happen.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we do not talk about Korea very much here; we do not talk about it enough, although it is undoubtedly one of our major commercial allies, and indeed the fourth largest outside of Europe, as the report states. The European Union is the leading investor in Korea, which is also, undoubtedly, one of the strongest democracies in the whole of that region.</p>
<p class="contents">If we consider what I have just said, on the one hand, therefore, and on the other hand the difficulties in the multilateral context and the reality that there are obstacles to accessing the market for European products and services, which are major non-tariff obstacles, it is obvious that this makes it a very clear candidate for a bilateral agreement that has the full support of Parliament. This agreement, however, needs to be well put together, well negotiated and ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">There are difficulties in very specific areas. I would highlight the subject of services, which has already been mentioned, and the subject of intellectual piracy, in one of the countries with the greatest Internet penetration in the world, and where, therefore, there are very specific problems resulting from the fact that copyright and rights protecting the audiovisual sphere are not taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of Kaesong: my group is going to support the text as it is in the report; in other words, we recognise and understand the political content of this area between South Korea and North Korea, but we understand that, if free trade with the European Union were simply introduced into this context, it could cause serious problems, and therefore we would not support the simple inclusion of the Kaesong area in a possible agreement with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a situation where Korea has signed a Free Trade Agreement with EFTA and ASEAN and also with the United States, but will not sign such an agreement with the European Union, the competitiveness of European companies taking advantage of duty-free access to the Korean market will decline. This will have a negative impact on the level of economic growth and the level of employment in EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, according to analyses carried out by independent research centres, as a result of the conclusion of a free trade agreement, two thirds of the benefits accruing from such an agreement would go to Korea, and only one third to the European Union. It is therefore necessary for Korea, in addition to this agreement, to make a commitment to the EU in which Korea undertakes to observe European social standards, and in particular the basic elements linked to decent work, as well as environmental and consumer protection standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this approach gives an opportunity to lead on to honest competition between Korean and European companies. It is only then that Korean companies will include in their manufacturing costs the overall costs of labour, environmental protection and consumer protection, and thus the price of their products will reflect the full manufacturing cost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU-Korea Treaty will be the first application of the new EU trade doctrine Global Europe, a doctrine that is highly controversial, not least because it seeks such deep market access conditions through the removal of all kinds of barriers to all-out import penetration, precisely at a time when more and more people are becoming aware that there are very many losers as well as some winners in a completely liberalised global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the positive side, the report sets out some very good standards for trade and social and environmental fields, which Greens absolutely support, and in that respect I think the report sets a very important precedent for further upcoming parliamentary responses to other free trade agreements, with India and ASEAN, for example. So we welcome the fact that the report insists that there must be no exceptions to the rule that access to the European market is conditional on compliance with environmental protection standards.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that it demands that the trade agreement with Korea incorporates binding social and environmental clauses and, to our mind, this by itself makes it difficult to contemplate that the North Korean Kaesong industrial complex would be included within the FTA rules. Most importantly, it intends to give teeth to those binding clauses by demanding that they are subject to the standard dispute settlement mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">But we do have some serious misgivings about this report as well. First, there is the demand to scrap all non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade without any attempt at differentiating what really constitutes a legitimate NTB and what does not. We should not assume that everything that prevents unfettered free trade is an illegitimate obstacle. There are some very good reasons to qualify trade, especially when public policy wants to put in place controls for social, health or environmental reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also opposed to the full introduction of the so-called ‘Singapore issues’ into the free trade agreement. Again there are good reasons why total investment freedom or public procurement should remain outside the scope of a trade agreement. Korea had a devastating experience with the free flow of capital in the late 1990s and they have used sheltered public procurement policies to get back on their feet since then. Now, it is not up to us to judge whether they should offer those items on their side, but we are allowed to judge for our side, and my Group does not support giving unlimited freedom to foreign investors in Europe or destroying the possibility of engaging in public spending for social goals through specific domestic procurement policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Precisely for this reason it is important that we conclude a free trade agreement. The aim of this agreement must be to achieve fair and equitable trading conditions to our mutual advantage and our mutual benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also say that I am pleased that the negotiations have been running substantially better in the fifth round than they did in the fourth round. I should like to encourage Korea to support EU proposals for the faster and reciprocal abolition of import duties. The EU’s target for this would be 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the motor vehicle sector is and remains a challenge in the negotiations. What we as the European Union expect is that our safety standards are accepted by Korea just as we, too, accept Korea’s standards in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I am optimistic that the barriers in the pharmaceutical products and services sectors, and particularly in the banking and legal advice sectors, can be removed. With regard to Kaesong, I should like to say that it would be significant for the negotiating partners to find a way of supporting the Kaesong project and other projects, on economic and political grounds, particularly for introducing North Korea to the international community of states.</p>

When negotiating this future trade agreement with Korea, we would do well to remember that our priority should remain multilateralism, because we know that the excessive proliferation of bilateral agreements is damaging to the regulated multilateral structure that we belong to. That is why, if we enter a new era of bilateral trade agreements, these should include guarantees and principles, some of which are mentioned in Mr Martin’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">The future free trade agreement with Korea should be up-to-date and include restrictive environmental and social requirements such as those in the fundamental ILO conventions, which aim to promote proper working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, following Parliament’s commitment to enable better access to generic medicines, I am delighted that the provisions on public health have been included and that our wish has been respected that any demands that would limit our partners’ ability to make use of the flexibilities provided for in the atypical Doha declaration agreement should not be included.</p>

<p class="contents">The main problem in our bilateral trade relations is difficulty of access to the market across non-tariff barriers, including a lack of accepted norms and international standards.

<p class="contents">I want to deal briefly with two issues. Firstly, the opposition of trade union and farmers’ groups to the free trade agreement with Korea and, secondly, the case of the industrial zone. In the first case, we need to place the opposition in perspective. Thousands demonstrated against the US agreement with Korea and a number of people burnt themselves to death. Rather than thousands, we have only dozens protesting, possibly because we are attempting to include in our free trade agreement an associated political cooperation agreement – social, political and labour clauses that will help protect labour standards in the south and may well enhance them. At the same time, we will not have the discussion over rice which Korea had with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to Kaesong, we are not arguing that this should be included. We are arguing that we should not automatically exclude it. That is a rather different position, and I hope that on that basis the Liberals will be able to change the way they vote. As the former Prime Minister of Jamaica once said, the only thing worse than being exploited is not being exploited. Some of us had the opportunity to visit Kaesong last month, as part of an EU workshop on economic reform held in North Korea. I saw thousands of happy North Koreans flooding from the zone, smartly dressed, because they have standards of living six times higher than in the North. This is an opportunity, politically and economically, to actually change that regime and move things in the right direction. Kaesong can transform the North and, allowing for the difficulties, should be encouraged and not killed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, on the issue of Kaesong, I think that Mr Ford’s formulation – that we should not automatically exclude Kaesong – is the right approach to take. We in the Commission will be very prudent on this subject, but I think, on that basis, the amendment is probably a worthwhile one.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I was asked about the overall prospects for the negotiation. Well, in this job I have not discovered a trade negotiation that is not in some difficulty. However, I would say that this negotiation is in less difficulty than some other trade negotiations I could identify.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Ms Mann asks whether the European Parliament can obtain rights earlier than the Treaty ratification in respect of this agreement. When asked about this in a different context, I overstepped my collective Commission responsibility in my enthusiasm, so today I shall be a little bit more careful and simply stress that we will seek to involve Parliament as much as possible.</p>

<p class="contents">I should like to deal with the general reason first, however. Mr President, would you please issue a statement about yesterday’s events on behalf of my group, particularly about the very specific case, the case concerning our ushers here in this House. I wish to say: it is every man and every woman’s absolute right to be able to express their opinion in this House. We are also accustomed to seeing posters and T-shirts and to everyone being free to express their opinion here. Anyone who is in favour of a referendum is entitled to express this in this House. What we experienced yesterday, however, is not acceptable in the context of this freedom of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We can argue here about what individual fellow Members are doing here, how they conduct themselves, whether or not they shout. One thing is not acceptable, however, and that is that the ushers in this House, for whom – and I speak on behalf of all my fellow Members, of almost all Members, I believe, in this House – I have the greatest personal and professional respect…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What is not right – and I also speak specifically on behalf of my fellow Member Mr Daul and, I think, also, on behalf of Mr Watson, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Wurtz – is that ushers in this House are physically and verbally assaulted in a heated debate: ushers, who have been discharging the duties of their office, and were described yesterday as the Gestapo and SS. This is a disgrace, Mr President! I think the House should express its total solidarity with the ushers.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Sustained applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the ushers in this House are not private individuals; they are officials of this Parliament. They are the long arm of the President in this House. When an usher is physically assaulted here, when an usher is punched here, only one thing is possible: the Member who has done this must be identified! The offence must be reported to the police and his or her immunity must be removed immediately!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, on behalf of my Group I should like to address the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, particularly Mr Crowley, although I do not know whether he is here, with regard to the votes – that is, the votes on the resolutions on extremism, the EU/China human rights dialogue, Montenegro and the ban on land mines. The UEN Group is a co-signatory to these resolutions. As long as no official apology is forthcoming from the UEN Group for yesterday’s incidents in this House, I see myself, as representative of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, being unable to continue to cooperate with the UEN Group.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I refer to the resolution on combating the rise of extremism in Europe. It was pointed out in the third recital on behalf of the UEN Group, among others, that we condemn racism in Europe and we do so with reference to the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Parliament achieved a budget for results on its major objectives: financing for Galileo (EUR 2.4 billion) via a revision of the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the use of the flexibility instrument (EUR 200 million); significant further use of the flexibility instrument (EUR 70 million) to finance an increase in the spending on common foreign and security policy (CFSP).</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets voted its second reading amendments, further to the conciliation outcome, on 29 November 2007. After the technical check of the figures, a small number of technical adjustments were necessary to ensure full respect of the conciliation outcome of 23 November as regards revised financial framework ceilings and the overall level of payments.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreed modifications are the following:</p>
<p class="contents">First, in heading 1a, commitment appropriations are adjusted as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 335:</p>
<p class="contents">06 02 09 01 (Galileo Supervisory Authority) to EUR 7 460 000</p>
<p class="contents">06 02 09 02 (Galileo Supervisory Authority) to EUR 3 100 000</p>
<p class="contents">08 07 01 (Research Cooperation – Transport) to EUR 348 922 000</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 331:</p>
<p class="contents">02 02 01 (Competitiveness and Innovation) to EUR 126 300 000</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 69:</p>
<p class="contents">06 03 03 (TENs – T) to EUR 955 852 600</p>
<p class="contents">Second, in heading 1b, in order to meet the overall level of payments agreed at the conciliation, payment appropriations are modified on lines:</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 27:</p>
<p class="contents">04 02 17 (ESF) to EUR 3 823 198 181</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 140:</p>
<p class="contents">13 03 16 (ERDF convergence) to EUR 10 606 637 496</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 141:</p>
<p class="contents">13 03 18 (ERDF competitiveness) to EUR 2 540 832 078</p>
<p class="contents">All these technical adjustments were unanimously approved by the Committee on Budgets on Monday 10 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, a number of technical/nomenclature changes will be made, mainly as regards pilot projects and preparatory actions.

I am of course referring to that historic event – the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon – due to take place in just over an hour in my country’s capital. Following the enlargement of the European Union to 27 Member States, it is another decisive step in European integration, that will make Europe more democratic, more representative, more flexible and effective in the way it works than it was before.</p>
<p class="contents">If I might make a brief and early summing up of the achievements of the Portuguese Presidency, I would point to three important areas of success for the future of the European Union. They are the agreement making it possible for the EU Reform Treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, to be signed today, the holding of the EU-Africa Summit and of the EU-Brazil Summit. To that we might now also add the important agreement we were able to reach on the financing of the strategic Galileo Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, today we have the second reading of the 2008 budget, the final stage of a long process of negotiation which finally ended very successfully. I am pleased to report the agreement reached between our two institutions in the concertation meeting on 23 November, that dealt in full with all the budget proposals for 2008 on which we had agreed by that date.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the procedures, I must point out that the Council will be able to accept the maximum rate of increase resulting from your second reading. I note, however, that some small adjustments are still needed as regards the classification of expenditure on which the Council reserves its rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to express once more my gratitude to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Böge and to the two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, to my colleagues in the Council, to Commissioner Grybauskaité and to all those who have helped to bring this very demanding budgetary procedure to a successful conclusion, culminating in Parliament’s approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it appears that as a whole it is unilaterally oriented towards a problem that is described as European citizens with fascist and racist attitudes, and it makes the resolution meaningless. Repeated opinion polls in Denmark have indicated that immigrants from non-Western nations do not feel that they are being subjected to any form of racism or hostile treatment. However, some immigrants from non-European nations have perpetrated very widespread violence towards both Danish citizens and other immigrants. In the official crime statistics, immigrants from non-Western nations are disproportionately over-represented.</p>
<p class="contents">Week after week in recent months there have been many shooting incidents on the open streets involving immigrant gangs, as well as individual attacks. Immigrant officials, who are themselves of non-Danish ethnic origin, have had their lives threatened and been told to leave their job, not by Danes, but by people from foreign cultures, who they are trying to help integrate into Danish society. We have a prominent immigrant politician of Syrian origin. He must be protected 24 hours a day, not against Danes but against fundamentalists of an Islamic background. Our intelligence service is constantly involved in preventing violent attacks against Danes and Danish social institutions, not from Danes but from foreigners. Therefore, from a Danish perspective this resolution is absurd. In Denmark, violent racism is directed towards democracy and human rights. On this basis I have been unable to vote in favour of this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Twelve vessels sank or ran aground here during a severe storm. These events had serious consequences, affected people’s lives and caused large-scale ecological disasters.</p>

However, I do not agree that woollens should not be subject to monitoring. Our resolution is a political appeal to the Commission, an expression of our wish that greater emphasis be placed on demanding that international obligations are met, and it is a protest against Chinese barriers to imports of European products. I welcome the fact that China will have to issue import licences, which will make it possible to carry out control procedures in Chinese ports and so better protect Europe from counterfeit goods. At the same time it is the Commission’s duty to protect European consumers against toxic substances, for example azo dyes that are sometimes present in Chinese goods. Therefore, I call on the Commission to push for the confiscation of textiles presenting health risks at the borders of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the meantime, maintenance creditors, the large majority of them children, live in very poor circumstances and often do not even have money to survive.</p>

It should ensure that such decisions are recognised and enforced throughout the European Union in the quickest and most effective way at the lowest possible cost.</p>
<p class="contents">It will simplify citizens’ lives and should at the same time have positive social effects in that it will make it easier for maintenance creditors living in another Member State to take a claim to a competent court and, once the court decision has been given, it will be recognised in all the Member States without further formalities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 2006, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, the electorate of Montenegro, the last state to remain united with Serbia, decided democratically to end this union. This made Montenegro the 49th independent state in Europe. Now it is important that Montenegro become a normal state, rather than a larger version of Monaco: a paradise for rich foreigners wishing to pay low taxes, launder money and build palaces. Montenegro must do more to combat environmental pollution and cigarette smuggling.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has accepted my amendments concerning housing and jobs for Serbian and Kosovar refugees. Stateless persons cannot remain stateless for ever, and Montenegro must respect the agreements of the Council of Europe in this regard. Even my proposal regarding the restoration of the north-south railway connections to Nikšić on the Bosnian border and Shkoder in Albania has been accepted. Increasing road transport is not a valid solution. Fortunately, the rapporteur, Mr Vernola – unlike in his previous annual report – is not calling for swift accession to NATO, nor an economic policy that is even more neoliberal than is usual in the rest of Europe. Accession to NATO cannot be a prerequisite for admission to the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to draw particular attention to the role of the EUFOR TCHAD/RCA operation. The main aim of the European initiative, which is also supported by the UN, is to ensure security in the humanitarian zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the ongoing Darfur crisis and the way in which it is destabilising the situation in the region, it is worth remembering here that the conflict has already crossed the borders of Chad and the Central African Republic.

There is absolutely no doubt that intervention is required in Chad. There is no doubt that the teeming human misery of refugees in that part of our world is unbearable to see, but I want to state very clearly that there are a number of core difficulties with this proposed mission.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is the lack of clarity in terms of the operation’s mandate. We are saying that this is a peace-keeping and humanitarian effort. If that is indeed so, then this must be made doubly clear in the terms of reference for the troops we send. I believe that clarity is lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe – and I have to disagree with my colleague – that an intervention shaped in this way will actually increase security. We have recently witnessed a growing intensity and barbarity of the conflict. We have also heard from leaders of many of the rebel groups that any intervention, and this intervention in particular, will be considered hostile. That poses a huge difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say – and, again, I disagree with my colleague – that the troops as currently configured will not act as the neutral force that is required. I have to say, with the greatest of respect for France and her people, that to load the mission so much towards France verges on the provocative, and I think it deeply unwise.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that it is possible for us to formulate a common European defence or security policy. The difficulties that have arisen – in this instance in relation to Chad – reflect very clearly why. I think it is undoable, because we have very different traditions and histories and very different foreign policy goals and outlooks. For this reason in particular it is a great shame – if I may say so, coming from a country that is still at least nominally militarily neutral – that the obligations, responsibilities and capacities of militarily neutral states are not recognised sufficiently in the European Union, and particularly not in the Lisbon Treaty. I believe that countries with that tradition could make the kind of valued intervention based on neutrality that my colleague has mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, intervention in Chad is necessary. However, the essential thing is how we go about this. Any operation has to be focused. It certainly has to be neutral and, above all, it must have prospects of success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent unrest in eastern Chad, including heavy clashes between rebel fighters and the Chadian army, underscores the urgent need for our presence in this region to protect innocent refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) from getting caught in the crossfire. These military offences are exacerbating criminality and leading to increased insecurity around the IDP camps. Not only is access to the camps being impeded for humanitarian personnel, but they are wrestling with the problem of banditry, restricting their ability to provide much needed humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the EU and its Member States to honour the political decision made and to provide this mission with more troops and appropriate financial, logistic and air support, including the necessary number of helicopters, as soon as possible. The EU’s credibility in its foreign policy on the world stage is at stake if it cannot mobilise sufficient troops and equipment to make this mission operational. This is an EU peacekeeping mission and therefore concerns all EU Member States, whether they are participant countries or not.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like here and now to dispel the myth that this mission will be French dominated. This mission has troops coming from Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Austria and Ireland. Furthermore, it will not be French led but Irish led. Irish Lieutenant General Pat Nash has been appointed to front this mission, and he will therefore be calling the shots – excuse the pun – concerning troop activities on the ground. This operation is going to go ahead, and such remarks are simply not helpful when it comes to aiding this mission’s perception and eventual reception among the local population in Chad and among the rebel groups.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been some hopeful signs of movement this week from other EU Member States, following Ireland’s appeal for this mission to be adequately resourced. It appears that one country has offered medical supplies, while other Member States are discussing providing funding to assist other countries to supply necessary logistical support, including aircraft. Another fourth-generation conference must be called immediately to come up with the necessities to protect our troops in the field so that they can go about their important job of protecting refugees. The time to act is now. Our inaction will cost lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This situation has, de facto, restricted access to refugee camps for thousands of people and made the task of humanitarian aid workers considerably more complicated.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also remind you that at present in this region of the world, women and children are still the victims of particularly odious violence and that there are already more than 450 000 displaced people living in terrible conditions precisely where the conflict has restarted.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, we can obviously demand that the warring factions cease all combat, particularly where civilian populations are affected. We also demand that they respect the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law, which means respecting humanitarian areas and allowing the transportation of aid, as well as not attacking humanitarian personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, we are also particularly concerned about the fact that humanitarian law is more and more often flouted, if not totally ignored, by the parties involved in the conflicts. The European Union needs to act specifically against this worrying development. We also urge the authorities in Chad to systematically do all they can to prosecute those responsible for rape, war crimes and all forms of serious human rights violation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would say that our message is mostly aimed at the European Union, particularly the Council of Ministers, by which we undoubtedly have more chance of being heard and which we ask to assume its responsibilities. On 15 October, the Council adopted a joint action on the EUFOR Chad/RCA operation to provide protection for civilians, humanitarian aid, and security for local and expatriate humanitarian personnel. Just two months later, the deployment of EUFOR troops has still not materialised, due to a lack of resources and sufficient equipment. This is unacceptable and the Council and Commission therefore urgently need to speed up the decision-making process to enable this operation to be conducted as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that no peacekeeping mission in eastern Chad or the northern part of the Central African Republic will be effective without a general reconciliation process involving the whole region. We already know that EUFOR’s presence on Sudan’s doorstep will make it more difficult for the rebels to circulate freely across borders and will therefore cause the displacement of some attacks. The urgent and essential support that the European Union is committed to providing could therefore very quickly prove inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now also essential for the EU to do everything it can to encourage the resumption of peace talks at regional level, in partnership with all those involved in the conflict and the various representatives of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that we believe that the European force’s neutrality is particularly important and very strategic here. Since the rebels have already threatened to target it if it is simply a French mission in disguise, we are asking the other Member States to participate en masse in the composition of this force, so it is clear to everyone that it is indeed a European force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This demonstrates that this type of violence is something that affects the whole world, although it has particular manifestations and forms in each case.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of the three cases that we are dealing with today, the situation in Chad, is a sad example of how, in a context of war, women frequently tend to be used as sexual objects, where rape becomes a weapon of war. This situation occurs especially in refugee camps, but not only there.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this resolution is, at least for some of us, to point out that the international community, and in particular the European Union, needs to respond to this situation and take on our responsibility to protect the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the deployment of a specific mission, EUFOR Chad/CAR, is a task that certainly needs to be done urgently, but also responsibly. I would like to join with those pointing out that there is definitely a risk that the mission will be perceived as being excessively linked to one country, namely France. I think that this would be damaging, and certainly counterproductive for the objectives of the mission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore also like to stress that the composition of the mission should reflect the diversity of the European Union Member States, in order to avoid any confusion between that mission and the French deployment known as Operation Sparrowhawk. We also need to condemn before all possible bodies, and I therefore urge the Council and the Commission to do this, the brutality of the attacks perpetrated on the civilian population by the Janjawid militias and other Chadian groups.</p>
<p class="contents">What is especially deplorable is the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, and it is unacceptable for such crimes to go unpunished. I therefore urge the Chadian authorities to take responsibility for investigating these rapes and abuses and to bring those responsible to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This unfortunately seems to be the case today for the West and for Europe, because we have already allowed the catastrophe in Darfur and in eastern Chad to go on far too long. The later we intervene, the more costly it becomes, not just financially, but militarily and politically as well. I am therefore very grateful to Mr von Wogau for moving matters ahead decisively on military and security policy and I am very grateful to Mr Dess for doing the same in the humanitarian sector. We ultimately have to take action. However, the nations are procrastinating, not only on the equipment required, but also on the troops required. We need troops and forces on the ground with local knowledge and experience. I am very much of the opinion that there should be no disguised French operation, which nobody is talking about either, but we do need the local knowledge and experience of the French. We also, however, need the cooperation of the African Union and the Arab League, which are unfortunately still keeping completely aloof. This should not, however, absolve us Europeans of our responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I say very clearly: we want to get involved but we must not make the mistakes we made in Afghanistan, namely intervening without having a political strategy. Anyone who intervenes there must also know that they must have a strategy for peace talks, for interethnic discussions and for a solution to the massive tribalism and other conflicts that exist both in eastern Chad and in Darfur along the artificial borders. As the European Parliament, we should therefore be campaigning for the deployment of troops and for humanitarian aid, but we should also be making our contribution as quickly as possible to a sustainable political peace strategy for the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This intended to develop the basis for a new partnership between Europe and Africa: a partnership that, according to the joint declaration of the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament, was to be based on shared values and principles, such as democracy, human rights and good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, Europe’s attitude to individuals such as Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya – to name but two; they were both welcomed with a red carpet – proves that there is still a yawning chasm between declarations of principle and reality. The situation in Chad today also shows, if proof were needed, that a large proportion of Africa is far from ready to form part of this ‘community of shared values’.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if we Europeans want to remain credible with our discourse on human rights and not simply practise realpolitik, an intervention should indeed send out a clear signal that lawlessness and arbitrariness must make way as quickly as possible for the most basic democratic principles. Unfortunately, the assessment of Chad also applies to a great many other regimes in Africa. Chad is not the only sick man of Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This cannot be separated from the wider regional catastrophe in Darfur: 300 000 people massacred, two million displaced persons, four million people living on Western food aid. For three years now, the international community has been wringing its hands. I recognise that the European Union has sponsored large-scale humanitarian aid to the region. That is the good side.</p>
<p class="contents">Politically, the EU’s contribution is less commendable. It fêtes the Sudanese dictator Omar El Bashir in Lisbon, along with Mugabe the oppressor of Zimbabwe, where in the ultimate sickening act of hypocrisy they sign up to a declaration on human rights and good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s other contribution is to try and engage in some half-baked military mission in order to stick the ESDP badge on another military operation. The fact is this proposed mission is poorly conceived; the size of the force is inadequate; it lacks vital medical, logistic and transport support elements; it is already three months behind schedule and there is no contingency reserve if the situation should deteriorate even further.</p>
<p class="contents">We need only look at the random involvement in this mission – what is after all a largely French-driven operation – to understand why many in Chad, Sudan and the Central African Republic, let alone our own military officers, have a seriously sceptical attitude towards this project. Soldiering should be left to others.</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of urgency it is the UN-AU effort that should be reinforced as part of a coherent strategy for the whole region. This should be politically driven by the UN Security Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union will use every instrument at its disposal in eastern Chad to do this. The Commission will provide not only EUFOR troops, but also more than EUR 50 million as part of a comprehensive plan.</p>
<p class="contents">With these funds, measures will be financed in the following three key areas, which extend from emergency aid to long-term development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The first sector concerns humanitarian aid, for which ECHO has already provided EUR 30.5 million in 2007 in the form of emergency aid measures for supporting refugees and displaced persons in different sectors in Chad. A similar level of funding has also been set aside to continue these measures in 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">The second sector comprises the organisation of a Chadian police force, which will be responsible for carrying out humanitarian protection measures. In the context of the EU and UN missions in Chad, the United Nations are setting up, training and equipping up to 850 Chadian police forces and constabularies, which are to be deployed in refugee camps in eastern Chad. The European Union is supporting this UN programme with EUR 10 million from the Instrument for Stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The third sector concerns reintegration and rehabilitation. In 2008 the Commission will be providing EUR 10.1 million from the ninth European Development Fund for development measures promoting reconstruction, conflict resolution and the organisation of administrative capacities. These are measures that are necessary for improving the security situation in the areas of the UN-EU mission. Further measures are planned as part of the 10th European Development Fund, for which EUR 311 million are estimated from 2008 to 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning displaced persons to their home country should be supported in the short term with these measures. Their aim in the long-term is to stabilise the situation permanently in Chad and throughout the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous speakers have rightly referred to the flare-up in the battles between government-friendly rebels and President Idriss Déby’s troops in eastern Chad, which has clearly made humanitarian aid more difficult. Even in the areas around the refugee camps, safety can no longer be guaranteed. In addition, the precarious humanitarian situation is coming increasingly to a head owing to the rapid increase in the number of refugees from the combat zones. In this deeply worrying situation, the restoration of security in the region is a task of the utmost urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to cope with this task, a military presence is vital. EUFOR troops should therefore be deployed specifically in these crisis areas. They will, however, be successful only if the causes of the conflict are eliminated and if a political process is introduced at the same time, with the aim of calming the underlying tensions and reducing poverty by facilitating economic development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our Deputy Foreign Minister praised the shared values of the UK and Saudi Arabia. I found this sycophancy absurd, as my values of democracy, human rights and gender equality are alien to Saudi tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the EU’s relationship with the House of Saud is based on regional stability and on important commercial ties, in particular oil and arms trading. In fact, the relationship is so important that a three-year UK inquiry into alleged bribes paid to Saudi ministers by an arms contractor was killed by orders of Prime Minister Tony Blair on the grounds of national security.</p>
<p class="contents">Worryingly, Saudi Arabia’s brand of fundamentalism, Wahabi Islam, is being exported globally. In London – my constituency – textbooks at a Saudi-funded school were found to contain hate-filled passages about Christians and Jews.</p>
<p class="contents">This case of the Qatif gang-raped woman sentenced to 200 lashings has horrified the world. Parliament’s joint motion for a resolution expresses revulsion and repudiation of the Kingdom’s values. Twenty years ago a British TV documentary similarly recounted a story of a Saudi princess who was publicly executed for adultery.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and Saudi Arabia have shared vital foreign policy interests, such as supporting the Middle Eastern peace process, encouraging the Saudis as Sunni Muslims to contain expansionist Shia Iran and supporting the Saudi fight against al-Qa’ida, many of whose adherents, unfortunately, come from Saudi Arabia originally.</p>
<p class="contents">But we also need to hold the Saudis to their UN Convention obligations to remove discrimination against women, who cannot even drive a car or vote in their limited local elections.

Saudi Arabia is governed by a ruthless dictatorship which is, to a large extent, shamefully legitimised in most of the Western world, including many EU countries, because Saudi Arabia is immensely rich in petrol dollars, some of which it uses in Western states in order to bribe them into pretending not to see, not to hear and not to understand what is going on in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">But even schoolchildren know that the comical rulers of Saudi Arabia, consisting mostly of the family of one man, His Most Royal Excellency godlike King Abdullah, are imposing on their people a brutal repression. One obvious example is that they treat women as slaves or as pieces of domestic furniture yet, as mentioned just now by Mr Tannock, Mr Abdullah and his six plane-loads of entourage were given a lavishly glorious state welcome in the UK and the Vatican only a few weeks ago. And not a single word about human rights managed to escape through the honourable lips of the Queen of England, or the UK Prime Minister, or the Pope. So much for hypocrisy and double standards, one might be tempted to say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As well as this discrimination in terms of political rights, however, there are many other types of discrimination that have been reported in various media, recently and continuously, which motivated this second resolution that we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">The trigger was certainly the incomprehensible sentence passed against a women, known as ‘the Qatif woman’, who was sentenced to 200 lashes for having been found in a car talking to a man who was not part of her family. Not only are the alleged crime, and hence the sentence, unacceptable, but they are also aggravated by the fact that the convicted woman was unable to receive adequate legal advice.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately this is not the only case in which one can deplore clearly discriminatory sentences for crimes and the failure to defend women in the legal system. This is, unfortunately, more the norm than the exception. How can a system be considered fair, for example, when it finds the victim of a rape guilty of that atrocity?</p>
<p class="contents">Structural change is needed in Saudi Arabia, and the European Union needs to help those who are working both outside and within the country to achieve this. There are no relativisms here that carry weight. Human rights, which include women’s rights, are and need to be universal and defended in any context.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore join in the request made by Mrs Svensson, and I ask the Commission and the Council once again to take any opportunity they can to ask the Saudi authorities to make the appropriate structural and institutional changes, in order to eliminate any form of discrimination against women, including recognising all their rights, in both private and public life, and more specifically, in the political, legal and judicial spheres. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Political, social and religious freedom is significantly restricted, and punishments by flogging, the amputation of hands or feet or the death penalty are meted out on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In a country that has been called ‘a human rights desert’ by <span class="italic">Human Rights Watch</span>, it is mainly women who fall victim to numerous forms of discrimination in private and public life. The identity of women was only formally recognised in 2001, by issuing them with identity documents containing a photograph. Before that they would prove their identity using a family identity document bearing a photograph of their husband or father. Even if they can afford a car, they are not allowed to drive it. They may study, but lectures given by men are watched by female students on video. They are deprived of the right to vote, and decisions on divorce and child care are the exclusive prerogative of men.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are repeatedly the victims of unjust and offensive court verdicts. The instance of the girl from Qatif concerns a 19-year-old gang-rape victim who was condemned to 200 lashes and six months in prison for being alone with a strange man at the time of her abduction.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite having signed it, Saudi Arabia does not observe the obligations arising from the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women. The authorities must start by lifting all restrictions on women where freedom of movement is concerned and take steps towards gradually increasing the involvement of women in political decision-making on an equal footing with men. Women must have general access to employment at all levels of administration and the opportunity to carry out all public functions.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of a total ban on the use of flogging and other degrading corporal punishment must also be demanded, as this is a violation of international law and the UN Convention against Torture, to which Saudi Arabia is a signatory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is led by four Saudi women. I should like to call on the whole House, in particular the Presidency, to lend full support to this Saudi Arabian initiative and I should also like to remind you that, in addition to Saudi Arabia, there are at the moment even more serious situations in Iraq. I would remind you of the execution this year in Basra of 40 women for failing to respect the dress code currently being imposed in Iraq, a country where women had the vote before the women of Portugal did, and where today the most barbarous fanaticism is being introduced.

Only a few, such as the Dutch citizen Ayaan Hirsi Ali, dare come out with it. The discrimination and subjugation of women is rooted in the holy texts of Islam itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination against women in Saudi Arabia and almost throughout the Islamic world has its basis and justification in the Koran. This is a fundamental truth that we must dare to acknowledge in this debate. It was demonstrated just recently in Sudan, where a 54-year-old teacher was sentenced to 15 days’ imprisonment for calling a teddy bear Mohammed, until being pardoned thanks to pressure from international diplomacy. In Saudi Arabia, a 20-year-old woman fell victim to gang rape but was herself convicted. It does not get any more symbolic than that.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Saudi Arabia is an ally of the US, of course, and can get away with that bit more. After all, like China, Saudi Arabia is a rich country and we can venture to be rather more flexible when the noble principles we have been discussing so often this week are at stake. Europe should thus also call on Washington to throw all its weight behind improving the situation in Saudi Arabia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The case underlying your resolution gives us cause for the greatest concern. A young woman was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months’ imprisonment after being gang-raped by seven men. The EU dealt with this matter immediately. The EU Troika made representation to the Saudi Arabian Government in Riadh and expressed the EU’s dismay at the verdict of the court in El Katif. The verdict is not only clearly in breach of Saudi Arabia’s international obligations, particularly against the UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, but also turns the principle of guilt upside down by declaring the victim to be guilty.</p>
<p class="contents">This case brings under the spotlight a country in which discrimination against women is unfortunately part of everyday life. The European Parliament has justifiably asked the Saudi Arabian Government on several occasions to remove the limitations on women’s free movement, including the driving prohibition. This request also applies to the restrictions on women’s access to employment, on their legal personality and on their representation in judicial processes. I unreservedly share Parliament’s concerns about the situation of women in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time Saudi Arabia is bound as a member of the UN Human Rights Council to protect and promote human rights. Saudi Arabia is a contracting party to the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Admittedly it has ratified the Convention with one reservation: in the event of a conflict between the clauses of the Convention and the standards of Islamic law, the Kingdom is not obliged thereafter to comply with any clauses of the Convention conflicting with this law. The European Union has repeatedly called on Saudi Arabia to lift its reservations on this UN Convention – particularly with regard to granting equal rights for women and men in relation to the nationality of their children – and will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights issues such as the situation of women are regularly the subject of representations by the European Union to Saudi Arabia. The European Union is reminding Saudi Arabia of its obligations according to international human rights standards, is broaching the issue of the need to treat women and men equally and to combat violence against women and is asking Saudi Arabia to protect and promote women’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Two recent changes that we have observed could – I say this very cautiously – could perhaps be a sign that Saudi Arabia is, making some progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The Saudi Arabian National Society for Human Rights produced its first report on the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia in May of this year. Violations of the rights of women, prisoners and workers are published in this report, as are court judgments. The results and recommendations of this report should be acted on and followed up without fail by the Saudi Arabian Government</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in October King Abdullah announced a fundamental judicial reform, reinforcing the independence of judges and simplifying fact-finding according to Sharia law supervised by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="contents">For a country like Saudi Arabia, these are encouraging steps. We should therefore not only be drawing attention to human rights violations in Saudi Arabia where necessary, but also be welcoming and supporting the reforms that have recently been discreetly emerging. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are talking about almost 200 000 women, euphemistically known as ‘comfort women<span class="italic">’, </span>who were forced to be sexual slaves during and before the Second World War by the Japanese Imperial Army. After 62 years, the survivors are still seeking justice.</p>
<p class="contents">During their lives they have suffered from poor physical and mental health, isolation and shame, and often extreme poverty. So far the Japanese Government has not complied with international rules on reparation, which include restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and satisfaction, including full disclosure, apology and guaranteeing that the action will not be repeated. This is particularly significant given that Japan is one of the main donors of aid in post-war times.</p>
<p class="contents">There was, therefore, an urgent need to react and to point out, as the survivors do, that truth must be linked to justice, and that an apology is empty if it is not accompanied by an acceptance of responsibility. I would like to stress that this is not only about the rights of an individual victim, but about collective rights, which bring with them the responsibility to remember, so that this type of violation does not happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we must ask the Japanese to conduct an exercise in historical honesty and not only acknowledge the facts but apologise on behalf of their predecessors, and to compensate the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to express my great respect and recognition for the women who had and continue to have the courage to speak out and demand justice, and for the organisations like Amnesty International that are supporting them on this journey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All these degraded women who were held in sexual slavery are still waiting for justice and redress. The Japanese authorities have indeed done a certain amount but, as the Resolution shows, a great deal remains for the Japanese Government and authorities to do in order to give those women justice and redress.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the women who were forced into this dreadful situation were very young at the time. That means that their whole lives have been destroyed by these terrible experiences. They have been forced to live out their lives in poor physical and psychological health, isolation, shame, and often extreme poverty. The fact that these women have not had full justice and redress also means that those who committed these crimes have effectively enjoyed immunity for their acts.</p>

In Europe we are less aware of the fact that in the Far East Japan committed immense crimes from the 1930s until the end of the war. One of the greatest of these crimes was the sexual exploitation of women at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">Some 100 000 women from conquered countries in the Far East were forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Armed Forces of Japan. This sexual slavery, which was in itself totally criminal, had further consequences too. These consequences were enforced abortions, mutilations and murders on a large scale, and large-scale instances of suicide among these women. Obviously any of these women who are still alive today are very old.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be conceded that during the post-war period the Japanese Government did much to compensate for these dreadful offences against the women who experienced them. Today this resolution calls on the Japanese Government to make a final political, moral and financial settlement upon those women who are still alive and with the families of those who have died. This is most certainly their due. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased that this is on the agenda, as it has taken a very long time. The European Parliament has been wavering for five months over whether human rights for women should actually be a priority or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dillen, who has now left, has just said that oppression of women is typical of the Koran – which is complete nonsense, as the matter of ‘comfort women’ shows that men do not need the Koran to repress and abuse women.</p>
<p class="contents">I am actually also rather disappointed with the attitude in the European Parliament. As I have just said, this House wavered over this for a very long time, and I have heard even Members of this Parliament coming up with arguments such as ‘Well, yes, but 90% of these women did it of their own free will’ and ‘Oh well, it is their culture, you have to understand that’. To be frank, I find this sickening. It is rape, and rape is without exception a crime in all ages and all cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">I now gather that Japanese school textbooks have been adapted; but I then hear from the Japanese embassy that the tale has to be told very cautiously, as pupils do not yet know much about sexuality and could incur psychological damage. No-one talks about the psychological damage to the ‘comfort women’ themselves. To be frank, I find that quite shocking. Anyway, I am pleased that this is now on our agenda and that we are just about to adopt it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is important that apologies be sincere and unequivocal. It is not a matter of a formality. With the previous Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, once more casting doubt on the whole issue, it is not sufficient for the current government to then say ‘Oh, but we shall continue with the previous policy’. Sincere and unequivocal is what is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, when I hear the arguments that have been forthcoming from the Japanese embassy in recent days – incidentally complete with a recognition of everything that has already been done – I think that much progress remains to be made on sincerity. I hope, therefore, that this resolution expresses the solidarity of all of us with the victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Hundreds of thousands of women before and during the Second World War were forced into prostitution by the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces. Historians’ estimates assume that around 200 000 of these ‘comfort women’ from Korea, China, Taiwan and the Philippines were handed over to Japanese soldiers as sex slaves. The ‘comfort women’ system is one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century and led to gang rapes on a massive scale and to forced abortions.</p>
<p class="contents">After the end of the war, many women were murdered by the armed forces or prevented from returning home. Many of the survivors remained silent out of shame about their past and were stigmatised and relegated to the fringes of society. The issue of forced prostitution was not broached at the war crime trials and there was no talk of reparation.</p>
<p class="contents">Not until the end of the 1980s did the fate of the comfort women come to light again. The reason for this was not an automatic change in awareness, but the rapidly growing women’s movement in South Korea. Little by little, women who had been forced into prostitution spoke out publicly. In 1992 weekly demonstrations began in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul with the words: the Japanese Government should be ashamed, not us.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997 the Japanese Government was asked for the first time to take legal and moral responsibility internationally for the most severe human rights violations committed against women. In her report the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women demanded financial compensation for the victims and court sentences for the perpetrators. The reaction of the Japanese Government at the time was an out and out rejection of these demands.</p>
<p class="contents">It has already been said several times today that the truth must be taken into account. We are therefore asking the Japanese Government publicly to reject any assertions that deny or question the subjugation and enslavement of the comfort women and we are likewise demanding that they accept moral and legal responsibility for the enslavement of 200 000 people. We are calling on the Japanese Government to implement mechanisms to provide reparations to all surviving victims and their families as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Many victims of the comfort women system have passed away or are at least 80 years old, which means speed is of the essence. We are also calling on our colleagues in the Japanese National Assembly, however, to make their contribution in parliament to help get these mechanisms accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of these pages is the story of ‘comfort women’. I refer to the officially commissioned acquisition of young women by the Government of Japan, from the 1930s and during the Second World War, for the sole purpose of sexual servitude to the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces. We do not know exactly the numbers of women who were enslaved but we know that the ‘comfort women system’ included gang rape, forced abortions, humiliation and sexual violence, resulting in mutilation, death or eventual suicide, and that it was one of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20th century, involving not hundreds but thousands of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the remaining survivors are 80 and more years of age and one could argue that the problem is no longer an important issue. But I fully understand the wish of these women and their families to clear their names. Today we express our solidarity with the women who were victims of this system. We call on the Japanese Government to formally acknowledge and accept historical and legal responsibility and to implement effective administrative mechanisms to provide reparations to all surviving victims of the ‘comfort women system’ and to the families of deceased victims.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking into account the excellent relationship between the European Union and Japan, based on the mutually shared values of the rule of law and respect for human rights, I hope that the Government and the Parliament of Japan will take all necessary measures to recognise the sufferings of sex slaves and to remove existing obstacles to obtaining reparations before Japanese courts and that current and future generations will be educated about these events. I am sure that official recognition of the existence of the ‘comfort women system’ and an apology on behalf of the Japanese Government also would do much to help heal the wounds of our painful common history. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Japanese committed immensely barbaric war atrocities in the 1930s and 1940s. To some extent, they paid dearly by having two of their cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, annihilated by the mighty nuclear holocaust brought upon them by the US.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Japan inflicted many dreadful evils on the world in the past, and one of these – the sexual slavery of ‘comfort women’ – only came to prominence relatively recently. Some of these poor and now frail elderly ladies are still with us, as the remnants of a past that is inconvenient for Japan but torturous for them.</p>
<p class="contents">These women are asking for two very simple things from today’s rich and powerful Japan: an official apology and very modest humanitarian aid. Certainly, the European Parliament, with this joint motion for a resolution, expects and demands that the Japanese Government must do both and fast. Otherwise, aside from the stigma of shame, the EU must consider taking particularly effective action against ex-imperial Japan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The sincere sympathy of the Japanese premier is currently being undermined by Japanese officials in connection with the closure of the Asian Women’s Fund programme and mandate in March 2007, out of which only monetary compensation was paid to women.</p>
<p class="contents">In supporting the resolution and the demand for compensation, we would, however, point out that in modern times, too, the boundary between the normal and the pathological is being eroded, and this flies in the face of moral norms, so there is a need for radical moves to combat prostitution as a form of modern-day slavery. Prostitutes are not just victims of wars that took place 50 years ago; it could also be women of today who are being exploited, in the Belgian Congo, for example, as reported in the press, and indeed in many other countries, even rich ones.</p>
<p class="contents">In the name of respect for the human being we should also unmask the spread of a hedonistic and commercial culture that is pointing towards abuse in the area of sex, drawing even very young women and girls into the sphere of prostitution and other forms of demoralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for the identity and dignity of women is not based solely on uncovering crimes or abuses in the sphere of sexual discrimination or other injustices; it is based primarily on the drafting of development programmes and on the real-life practice of principles embracing all areas of a woman’s life. These principles must be rooted in a new realisation of the worth of a woman as wife, mother, carer or employee, as a human being and a person who is the equal of a man, despite being different. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1995 the Prime Minister at that time, Mr Murayama, also apologised publicly to the comfort women on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. That same year the Asian Women’s Fund was set up to grant reparations and medical aid to survivors on behalf of the Japanese Government and people.</p>
<p class="contents">These attempts to obtain reparations for the comfort women and a renewed public apology from the former Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Koizumi, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in 2005 are positive steps by Japan. Japan has thereby recognised its responsibility for these unspeakable human rights violations. Only a few days ago, the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed the declaration of the government spokesman, Mr Kono, which I quoted at the beginning, as Japan’s official position.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have the moving testimony of survivors, and this moving testimony has again aroused interest in this terrible period, in Europe as well as in the United State, Canada and Australia.</p>
<p class="contents">Our actions here are not simply about the past; they are about drawing the right conclusions from the events and doing everything in our power to combat today’s forms of slavery, sexual exploitation and human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">With the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, the Commission is actively supporting NGOs throughout the world involved in preventing violence against women and children and combating human trafficking for the purpose of sexual slavery. On 23 November 2007 the Commission sent out a further signal on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, by having affirmed its emphatic commitment to combating gender-based violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is conducting a regular human rights dialogue with Japan, touching on all the EU’s concerns – including women’s rights. Japan is a like-minded global player cooperating constructively with us in multilateral forums in order to improve respect for and protection of human rights. Together with the European Union, Japan has therefore issued a resolution on human rights in North Korea and denounced the actions of the regime in Myanmar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>I would point out that the laws promulgated in the Member States to comply with the annulled Framework Decision to which the honourable Member refers, are not automatically rendered invalid by the annulment. The decision as to the consequences of a declaration of non-validity of a Community act for the national acts transposing it is an issue of national law (see Judgment of the Court of Justice of 20 October 1975, Case 23/75). That said, the Commission must now decide whether to submit a proposal to the Council in order to include in the Directive in force an obligation for Member States to provide for penal sanctions to ensure that Community standards are respected as regards ship-source pollution.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0874"></a>

<p>As far as the European Qualifications Framework is concerned, the Portuguese Presidency has collaborated closely with the EP’s rapporteur to draft a text that is acceptable to all parties and which, notwithstanding certain procedural formalities, should receive official approval at the beginning of next year. It is hoped that this ambitious new instrument will prove useful as a link between different countries’ qualifications systems, acting as a translation tool making qualifications more comprehensible for Member States, employers and individuals, and thus enabling each citizen to move more easily from one country to another to work or study.</p>
<p>The second area concerns talks between Parliament and the Council with a view to reaching a consensus on the proposal for setting up the EIT (European Institute of Technology). If everything continues to run as smoothly and constructively as it has to date, it is likely that an agreement can be reached quickly at second reading at the beginning of 2008. Although they are not directly linked to the creation of the European Higher Education Area, higher education establishments will undoubtedly play a key role in the EIT, and it is therefore hoped that they will make a significant contribution to creating that Area.</p>
<p>In addition to these two dossiers, the Portuguese Presidency’s work in the area of higher education has focused on three issues. Firstly, on the conference held in Lisbon on 4 and 5 October 2007 to mark the 20<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary of the Erasmus Programme. One question arising from that conference – how to widen the Programme’s social dimension – was discussed by Ministers at the Council meeting on 15 and 16 November 2007. Secondly, the proposal to extend its ‘sister’ programme, the Erasmus Mundus Programme (and the Council is looking forward to hearing Parliament’s opinion on that subject), was also discussed by the Ministers at the 15 November meeting. Lastly, the third issue is that of finding the best way to respond to the modernisation agenda for European universities, on which the Council approved a Resolution at the same November meeting. All these issues can be regarded as making a contribution towards creating the European Higher Education Area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0877"></a>

<p>Asthma is the major chronic childhood illness in Europe, costing the European Community more than three billion euros each year. According to the charity Asthma UK, 5.2 million people in the UK are currently receiving treatment for asthma, 1.1 million of whom are children, and there is a person with asthma in one in five households in the UK.</p>
<p>The EU is currently funding a major research project (Gabriel) involving over 150 scientists from 14 European countries in order to identify key factors in the development of asthma. Findings so far suggest that asthma is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental effects, and that increasing urbanisation may be contributing to the rise in the numbers affected.</p>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>The Council has already examined several of the fundamental factors in the development of asthma. In terms of public health measures, in its Recommendation of 2 December 2002 on the prevention of smoking and on initiatives to improve tobacco control (OJ L 22 25.01.2003, p. 31.), the Council points out that given the health risks (e.g. asthma) linked to passive smoking, Member States should try to protect smokers and non-smokers from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>The Council recommends that Member States should implement legislation and/or other effective measures that provide protection from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in enclosed public places and public transport. Several Member States have already effectively banned smoking in public places chiefly to protect children and pregnant women from exposure to tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>As for air quality, on 25 June 2007 the Council approved its Common Position on the proposal for a directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe. One of the proposal’s objectives for ambient air quality is the protection of human health, which includes targeting emissions of pollutants that aggravate asthma attacks. As well as covering the main air pollutants; special attention is given in this proposal to fine dust (also referred to as particulates) and to tropospheric ozone, as they pose a major risk to human health. This proposal will set rules for fine particulates present in the air, known as PM 2.5, which penetrate deep into human lungs.</p>
<p>As regards ensuring that asthma sufferers have access to health services and medical care, it should be borne in mind that organising the provision of health services and medical care, and in particular ensuring that consultation, diagnostic and treatment services are available for patients, is the sole responsibility of the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0882"></a>

<p>Misuse of the drug khat is an increasingly common occurrence in Europe. Some 60 tonnes of khat are smuggled into my home town of Malmö each year across the Öresund bridge alone. The people affected often belong to traditionally vulnerable groups, such as refugees and those living in socially deprived areas. Young people and children are affected most. The efforts of the customs service to stop imports of khat, therefore, not only form part of the fight against drug abuse but also perform an important function in combating exclusion and social stigmatisation in society.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the EU does not speak with one voice on the subject of khat. In the UK and the Netherlands, the drug has yet to be classified as such.

<p>In December last year, the Council noted that Turkey had not fulfilled its obligation of full non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement. The Member States, therefore, meeting at the Intergovernmental Conference, decided not to start negotiations on the chapters covering areas of action related to Turkey’s restrictions on the Republic of Cyprus until the Commission had confirmed that Turkey had fulfilled the commitments which it entered into under the Additional Protocol. The chapters are as follows: Chapter 1: Free Movement of Goods; Chapter 3: Right of Establishment and Freedom to Provide Services; Chapter 9: Financial Services; Chapter 11: Agriculture and Rural Development; Chapter 13: Fisheries; Chapter 14: Transport Policy; Chapter 29: Customs Union; Chapter 30: External Relations. Moreover, the Council agreed that Member States meeting at the Intergovernmental Conference would not provisionally close any chapter until the Commission had confirmed that Turkey had fully implemented the commitments which it assumed under the Additional Protocol.</p>
<p>The Council also agreed it would monitor and analyse the progress made on questions covered by the declaration of 21 September 2005 and invited the Commission to include information on this matter in its next annual reports, namely in 2007, 2008 and 2009, if relevant. In its 2007 report on Turkey the Commission noted that, since the Council Decision of December of the previous year, Turkey had made no progress whatsoever towards full non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol. The Council made a detailed analysis and assessment of the report at its meeting on Monday 10 December. In its conclusions, the Council noted with regret that Turkey had not fulfilled its obligation of full non-discriminatory implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement and added that it would continue to follow up and review progress on those issues. However, I can reiterate how important it is for Turkey to deal with this issue as quickly as possible, as it is clearly affecting the progress of accession negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0891"></a>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>The Council has been following the situation in Angola closely. The general framework governing relations between the EU and Angola is still the Cotonou Agreement and entails the political dialogue established pursuant to Article 8 of that Agreement and development cooperation under the European Development Fund. The dialogue provided for under Article 8 was launched in December 2003 marking the commitment, although it did lose some steam in subsequent years; the EU is now making endeavours to revitalise and consolidate this important instrument (for the record, the last talks were held in October 2007).</p>
<p>Relations between the EU and Angola have generally developed slowly in key cooperation areas established under the aegis of the Cotonou Agreement as regards, specifically, democratisation, development of civil society, respect for human rights, good governance and combating corruption. Hence there has been only a slight improvement in overall relations since 13 October 2003, when the issue was last dealt with in the Council.</p>
<p>While Angola has specific interests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it continues to be an important partner as regards stabilisation of the Great Lakes region and has contributed to the EU’s Police Mission in the DRC (‘EUPOL Kinshasa’). Angola seconded 13 Angolan police officers over the electoral period (July 2006 to March 2007) to help the Congolese police guarantee safe elections. That was the first time the Angolan police force had assumed an international commitment of that kind. Moreover, the EUSR for the Great Lakes is in regular contact with the Angolan authorities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0893"></a>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>Preparations continue for the ESDP mission to Eastern Chad and the northeast of the Central African Republic, and this includes planning for the composition of the force. Thus far Belgium, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Romania, Finland and Sweden have pledged contributions to the force. The force will receive the appropriate equipment and support. EUFOR/CHAD/CAR will operate within the scope of Chapter VII, following unanimous approval of UN Security Council Resolution 1778, with a suitable mandate to match the situation on the ground.</p>
<p>The Council has been concerned about the peace negotiations in Darfur in recent months. In this regard, the June, July and October 2007 conclusions from the (External Relations) Council meetings clearly set out the policy line followed in many bilateral and multilateral contacts, including those by SG/HR Javier Solana and the EU Special Representative (EUSR) in Sudan. That line includes strongly urging all parties to play a constructive part in the negotiations and to reach an agreement to put an immediate end to the violence. Moreover, the Council has highlighted the need for an independent investigation into the Haskanita attack as well as cooperation with the International Criminal Court. The Council also stressed that it was willing to consider new measures, namely within the framework of the United Nations, against any party obstructing implementation of the UN aid package and the deployment of UNAMID as well as measures guaranteeing humanitarian supplies and the protection of civilians.</p>
<p>With regard to the peace negotiations in Darfur, the Council firmly supports joint AU/UN mediation headed by the AU and UN special envoys. The difficult start to the negotiations in Sirte last October posed a special challenge. At present, it is still not clear whether, when, in what form and under what body the talks can resume. Despite the difficulties, we are aiming for an ongoing process and in this respect much is being done to make the peace negotiations genuinely comprehensive with wide-ranging participation. We are clearly involved in a difficult and complex process, namely with regard to consolidating the position of different rebel groups and ensuring they participate in future talks. With this objective in mind, the EUSR in Sudan, Ambassador Brylle, remains in close contact with the main stakeholders in this process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0898"></a>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>Israel and the Palestinians have been engaged in a political dialogue since last summer, starting with several meetings between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas. The Council praised the efforts both parties made leading up to the Annapolis Conference on 26 and 27 November. The EU welcomes the holding of the Annapolis Conference and the joint statement by Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas on the immediate relaunching of bilateral negotiations in a spirit of good faith with a view to signing a peace treaty by the end of 2008. Such negotiations should lead to the setting up of an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza, uniting all Palestinians, coexisting side-by-side and in peace and security with Israel and its neighbours. It is also vital that both parties implement the obligations within the framework of the Road Map for Peace, in parallel with the negotiations. The EU welcomes the broad participation of the Arab partners at the Conference and urges them to continue to play a constructive role.</p>
<p>As for the EU’s role in this context – which the honourable Member refers to in his question – the High Representative, in full association with the Commission, has drawn up an ‘EU Action Strategy’, which analyses all the EU’s activities with a view to continuing support for the parties in their current negotiations and during the subsequent implementation period. This document will act as the basis for the EU’s future work, taking on board the results of the international Annapolis meeting, as well as the next Paris Donors’ Conference to be held on 17 December. The EU will step up its programmes promoting the creation of institutions, good governance, contributions from civil society and support to assist Palestinian economic growth, working in close cooperation with the Quartet representative. The Council welcomes Tony Blair’s work, especially the recent announcement he made regarding a series of quick impact projects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0900"></a>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>The Council acted quickly and visibly to the recent events in Pakistan. Before the state of emergency was declared, the High Representative Javier Solana had spoken on the telephone with General Pervez Musharraf and had tried to dissuade him from taking that course of action. After the state of emergency had officially entered into force, the EU immediately decided to postpone a meeting of the Political Directors’ Troika with their counterparts in Islamabad, thus sending a very clear signal that under the present circumstances relations between the EU and Pakistan could not remain unaffected.</p>
<p>The Heads of Mission in Islamabad met soon after the state of emergency was declared and issued a statement that was widely published in the Pakistani press. High Representative Solana also made a statement in which he voiced his concern and called for a speedy return to the Rule of Law. In a third statement, the Presidency clearly formulated the EU’s demands to the Pakistani Government for it to: (i) restore the Constitution, (ii) create the necessary conditions to guarantee free and fair elections scheduled for January; (iii) release all political prisoners, including members of the judiciary, as well as Ms Asma Jahangir, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; (iv) honour the President’s commitment to step down as Army Chief of Staff by 15 November; (v) energetically pursue reconciliation with the political opposition; and(vi) relax the restrictions imposed on the media.</p>
<p>The Council also agrees with the honourable Member that, as a member of the Human Rights Council, Pakistan is especially bound to uphold respect for human rights and the UN mechanisms regarding human rights. [In that context, detention of or issuing arrest warrants against UN special rapporteurs is unacceptable.]</p>
<p>The Council is continuing to monitor the situation in Pakistan closely and is examining what new measures could be taken.

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>Unprecedented cultivation levels and high production led to a 34% rise in opium production in Afghanistan in 2007. According to figures from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, opium production in Afghanistan reached 8 200 metric tonnes in 2007. Afghanistan’s share of global opium production increased from 92% to 93% in 2007.</p>
<p>If all the opium were processed into heroin, the yield would be 1 170 metric tonnes. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime also reports that most of the opium produced in Afghanistan is processed into heroin inside the country. In 2007, the number of heroin laboratories in the country increased. However, the precursor chemicals required for processing are not available in Afghanistan, which means they are imported through neighbouring countries. Afghanistan exports part of its opiates and imports precursor chemicals from neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>To halt heroin imports to the European Union, in May 2006 the Council approved a document setting out measures to increase EU support for combating drug production and trafficking in Afghanistan and reducing trafficking from that country, including the transit routes. The document dealt in particular with helping Afghanistan in the efforts it has made to combat drug production and trafficking and to cut trafficking from the country. The Commission and the Member States are the major international contributors to Afghanistan (EUR 452 million). Efforts are centred on alternative crops and eradication.</p>
<p>As regards transit routes, the Paris Pact Mechanism is used. Iran and Pakistan are also involved. A meeting was held recently in Kabul, which those countries attended. At a high-level meeting, which was held in The Hague under the consultation mechanism, the European Union suggested that round table talks should be held on the Black Sea/Eastern Europe and East Africa.</p>
<p>In its work in Afghanistan, the European Union is trying to give assistance an Afghan face, namely through the Afghan Trust Fund. Stemming the flow of heroin from Afghanistan has acted as the incentive for drafting action plans for Central Asia and the Western Balkans. Troika meetings are held regularly in Iran and the first high-level Troika involving Pakistan will take place on 12 December 2007.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0921"></a>

<p>With regard to the planning process, the Council approved the Concept of Operatons (CONOPS) on 12 November 2007 and work has already begun on the process of putting the force together.</p>
<p>Three force generation meetings have been held in Brussels, on 9, 14 and 21 November 2007. The process is proving difficult, as is the case with all operations, due to a lack of essential capabilities. We shall move on to the next stage – operational planning – when the difficulties of putting these scant resources together have been surmounted. The next step is approval of the Operational Plan (OPLAN) and launching of the operation.</p>
<p>The following third countries have been formally invited to make up the force: non-EU NATO allies and candidate countries (Turkey, Norway, Iceland, Croatia, FYROM, the United States and Canada), together with Switzerland, Ukraine and Albania. None of these countries has made any material contribution so far.</p>
<p>In the meantime, negotiations on the agreement on the status of forces have progressed satisfactorily with the governments concerned (Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR)) and should be concluded soon.</p>
<p>The UN and EU secretariats have worked in close conjunction since the outset. NATO’s non-EU European members and our African partners (the governments of Chad, CAR, Cameroon and Sudan) and the African Union (AU) and African sub-regional organisations (SRO) have been kept regularly informed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0923"></a>

<p>This answer was drafted by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States as such.</p>
<p>Broadband has been mentioned in several policies: e-inclusion, accessible digital content, the radio frequency spectrum policy, research and development and the regulatory framework for networks and electronic communication services are all connected with broadband, as are the cohesion policy and rural and regional development strategies.</p>
<p>In the Ministerial Declaration approved unanimously on 11 June 2006 in Riga at the Ministerial Conference on ICT for an inclusive society, ministers agreed to give priority to reducing the disparities in internet access between all regions and increasing the availability of broadband in under-served locations. The goal is to reach at least 90% broadband coverage of the EU’s population by 2010, in particular by using the Structural Funds and the Rural Development Fund and by supporting, where appropriate, the creation of broadband Public Internet Access Points. They also decided that national i2010 broadband strategies needed to be updated to provide additional guidelines and targets regarding coverage and connectivity in public administrations, schools, health centres and other key locations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission’s Communication ‘European i2010 initiative on e-Inclusion – to be part of the information society’, which was unveiled at the Council meeting on 29 November 2007, reports that the objective set by the Riga Declaration of achieving 90% coverage of the population by 2010 had already been met at the end of 2006, when 89% of the EU’s population had coverage and 70% of the rural population had coverage in 2007.</p>
<p>The same Commission Communication sets out a European Initiative on e-Inclusion which includes a strategic action framework to implement the Riga Ministerial Declaration by enabling the conditions for everyone to take part in the information society, by bridging the existing broadband, accessibility and tackling competences gaps, namely:</p>
<p>The Commission will stimulate regional initiatives on an inclusive information society through thematic networks in the framework of the European Commission initiative on ‘Regions for Economic Change’. The Cohesion Policy Fund will continue targeting investment in knowledge in areas where commercial deployment of ICT infrastructure and services is inadequate.</p>
<p>Regional and local authorities in the EU must drive the effort to bridge the broadband gap, including by using EU Structural and Rural Development funds, to promote an inclusive information society, especially in remote and rural areas. They must support infrastructure as well as e-services and applications for citizens (e-health, e-government, e-learning and e-inclusion).</p>
<p>The Commission will support in the framework of the ICT-Policy Support Programme (ICT-PSP) a web platform on regional initiatives for the information society, and will conduct a survey on EU funding for regional information society projects.</p>
<p>The Council is currently analysing two Commission proposals (one on repealing the GSM Directive and the other on mobile satellite services), the goal being to study the possibility of freeing up frequencies for wireless communication applications by allocating them to mobile services which might benefit rural and remote areas.</p>
<p>Regarding the repealing of the GSM Directive and consequently the possibility of frequencies being used by 3G services, it is hoped that the measure will benefit European citizens by significantly reducing the obstacles to the development of advanced mobile communication services and by helping to surmount the geographic digital divide.</p>
<p>As far as the decision on mobile satellite services is concerned, it is worth pointing out that the coverage which these pan-European systems offer will make it possible to improve broadband coverage in rural and remote areas, thus reducing the geographical digital divide.</p>
<p>In addition, the Member States are also planning their broadband strategies by means of National Reform Plans as part of the Lisbon Strategy, and some new Member States are drawing up specific national broadband strategies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0925"></a>

In this regard, the Council would like to refer to the Council conclusions of 8 November 2007 on cybercrime. In those conclusions, the Council mentioned in particular that consideration should be given to whether there was a need, in each Member State, to enact legislation on identity theft, particularly by way of cybercrime and whether further action at EU level was needed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0935"></a>

<p>Although the ICC has issued an international arrest warrant against rebel leader Kony and four of his commanders, Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army are still in the Garamba national park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, from where he is destabilising and terrorising northern Uganda.</p>
<p>The peace process between the LRA and the Ugandan Government, which has the explicit support of the Council, is making little progress. According to the latest reports, moreover, Kony has sidelined his right-hand man and important negotiator Vincent Otti. Cooperation was no longer possible because Kony suspects Otti of spying for the Ugandan Government. The departure of Otti, who was seen as a key figure and advocate of the negotiations, is a serious blow to the peace talks. It also seems that Kony is already regrouping and arming in preparation for the failure of the peace talks. According to the ICC Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, food aid for the LRA is systematically being sold for arms.</p>
<p>In the light of these recent developments, will the Council exert greater pressure on the Governments of the DRC and Sudan to surrender Kony to the International Criminal Court, or is its preference rather for reviving the peace talks?

<p>The Council is fully aware of the significance of the execution of the four warrants (for the arrest of Joseph Kony, Vincent Otti, Okot Odhiambo and Dominic Ongwen) issued by the ICC.</p>
<p>The Council approved conclusions on Uganda on 18 June 2007. On that occasion, the Council reiterated its support for the peace talks under way in Juba and welcomed the appointment of His Excellency Joaquim Chissano as the UN Secretary General’s Special Envoy for LRA affected areas. The Council underlined the continued importance of reaching a peace deal that provides both peace and justice to local communities, and is compatible with the wishes of the local communities, national laws and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p>As regards the problem raised about the diversion of food aid and possibly other types of international aid, the Council will continue to raise these questions with the relevant international partners. As for food aid, the Council would like to reiterate that, in accordance with the Treaties establishing the European Union, that question does not fall within the Council’s competence. The EU, namely the EC, finances the food aid distributed by the WFP and, to a lesser degree, by NGOs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0937"></a>

<p>The IAEA Director-General’s latest report, which was analysed by the Agency’s Board of Governors at the 22-23 November meeting, contains positive and negative aspects.</p>
<p>In the statement sent to the Board of Governors, the EU voiced its concern vis-à-vis issues that still need to be resolved regarding the Iranian nuclear programme and regrets that, just as the report states, Iran’s cooperation has been more reactive than proactive. It also stated that it was concerned about the fact that, as the IAEA’s Director-General reported, the Agency is receiving less information about Iran’s current nuclear programme and that, unless the Additional Protocol is fully implemented, the Agency will not be in a position to give credible guarantees that there is no undeclared nuclear material or activity.</p>
<p>In the statement sent to the IAEA Board of Governors, the EU also noted with mounting concern that Iran was continuing to flout the UNSC’s mandatory demands, stressing that, as the IAEA reported, Iran was still carrying out enrichment activities and constructing the heavy-water reactor at Arak. The EU urged Iran to heed the appeal made by the Director-General by applying the measures decided by the UNSC.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 15 October, the Council of Ministers of the EU reiterated its support for Security Council Resolutions 1696, 1737 and 1747 and pointed out that, in Resolutions 1737 and 1747, the Security Council had shown its intention to adopt appropriate new measures under Article 41, Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter if Iran refused to suspend its uranium enrichment activities. It further agreed on the need for the EU to consider what other measures could be taken to support the UN process and to achieve the international community’s common objectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0941"></a>

<p>The Council takes note that the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which met in Kigali in Rwanda on 19 to 22 November 2007, approved the Kigali Declaration on Economic Partnership Agreements. The declaration concerns relations between the EU and all ACP countries, including the African countries.</p>
<p>The Council views it as a proactive measure in the scope of the consultation and dialogue process on Economic Partnership Agreements. The Council welcomes and encourages this process.</p>
<p>The Council attaches great importance to wide-ranging consultation on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). In the May 2007 Conclusions on EPAs, the Council specifically underlined the importance of the ACP-EU dialogue on EPAs, in addition to the important role of dialogue with parliamentarians, civil society and the business community from both ACP States and the EU. That idea was reiterated, within the context of EPA monitoring, in the Council Conclusions of November 2007.</p>
<p>The Council recognises and welcomes the important role of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in the Cotonou system. In compliance with Article 17(2) of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, its role as a consultative body is namely to promote democratic processes through dialogue and consultation and to discuss issues pertaining to developing the ACP-EC Partnership.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0944"></a>

<p>As the honourable Member points out, due to the obstacles encountered by the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) whilst preparing to send observers to the Russian parliamentary elections on 2 December, it has not been possible to send an observation mission. The Presidency regrets that the ODIHR has been forced to take that decision, given that it has sent observers every year to a vast array of OSCE States without any difficulty. However, the constraints on the ODIHR’s activities, namely the invitation arriving too late, the limit imposed on the number of observers and the difficulties election observers encountered in obtaining visas left the ODIHR little choice.</p>
<p>Given that in previous Russian elections, most of the principal shortcomings recorded by international observers were related to pre-election matters, it is regrettable that the restrictions imposed by the Russian authorities have affected in particular the long-term aspect of an observation mission. To carry out an independent assessment of elections, it is crucial for the ODIHR to observe not only how the elections are conducted on voting day, but also during the election campaign.</p>
<p>With regard to the measures taken by the Council, the honourable Member is no doubt aware that it is ODIHR’s exclusive responsibility to decide whether to send an election observation mission. The Presidency has voiced its concern to Russia and will continue to do so over the coming days.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to voice its concerns to our Russian partners at the regular meetings and will urge Russia to respect its international commitments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0956"></a>

<p>The enlargement of the Schengen area is the best Christmas present for citizens of the new EU Member States. It is an historic event, with huge symbolic significance. However, a new financial and bureaucratic curtain has been erected between the EU and its eastern neighbours – Belarus, Russia, Ukraine and Moldova. Until recently, our eastern neighbours could travel without a visa to many new EU countries, but they will now have to pay a third or a quarter of their monthly salary for a visa. For example, the cost of a visa for Belarusian citizens to the new EU countries has risen from EUR 5 to EUR 60.</p>

<p>A large number of health programmes are being broadcast on television in EU Member States. The real aim of these programmes is overt or covert advertising of medicinal products, and in particular food supplements. People are not encouraged to eat healthily and to take exercise. They are encouraged to consume more and more vitamins and medicinal products. The consequences of doing so without medical supervision may give rise to health problems. In addition, the advertising often does not reflect the medicinal products’ real effects.</p>
<p>Can the Commission comment on the rules governing the advertising of medicinal products in the EU?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The EU legislation on medicinal products for human use sets out very clear and restrictive rules on the advertising of these products.</p>
<p>They were introduced in the beginning of the 90s in the so-called "rational use" package. This reflects the underlying objective, namely that consumption should be moderate and that advertising, where allowed at all, shall not promote to an excessive use of medicinal products.</p>
<p>These rules are now contained in Directive 2001/83. It forbids direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines and allows for advertising of non-prescription medicines under the conditions laid down in the Directive.</p>
<p>The advertising of non-prescription medicines must comply with the summary of product characteristics granted in the marketing authorisation procedure. It shall encourage the rational use of the medicinal product, by presenting it objectively and without exaggerating its properties, and shall not be misleading. Therefore, the advertising should not encourage the consumption of more medicinal products.</p>
<p>Concerning food supplements marketed as foodstuffs and presented as such these are regulated under Directive 2002/46/EC which foresees that advertising must not attribute to food supplements the property of preventing, treating or curing a human disease, nor refer to such properties. In addition the advertising of food supplements must not include any mention stating or implying that a balanced and varied diet cannot provide appropriate quantities of nutrients in general.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Regulation 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims also applies to food supplements, notably to the advertising of these products. This Regulation ensures that any nutrition or health claim made is clear, accurate and substantiated. The Regulation on claims has been applied by Member States since 1<span class="sup">st</span> of July 2007, but the list of permitted health claims still needs to be adopted. Adoption is foreseen for beginning of 2010, after the evaluation of their scientific merit by the European Food Safety Authority.</p>
<p>It is important to stress that the implementation and the application of current EU legislation on advertising of medicinal products and food supplements is the responsibility of Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0901"></a>

<p>The historically high prices of oil (almost USD 100 per barrel) are due to a confluence of several factors, amongst which the following appear most important:</p>
<p>worldwide oil demand (mainly by non-OECD<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> countries, in particular China and India) increases faster than new discoveries and investments in production capacities;</p>
<p>OPEC's commitment to increasing production has been lower than demanded by consumer countries and expected by market operators;</p>
<p>unusually low stockpiles of oil and petroleum products in several large oil consuming economies (especially the United States), creating uncertainty in the market about the capacity to withstand even relatively minor supply disruptions;</p>
<p>regional conflicts in major exporting countries (e.g. Iraq, Nigeria) keep large parts of their production capacities out of function or under constraints;</p>
<p>persisting uncertainties regarding supply from Iran;</p>
<p>a weak dollar causing the suppliers of oil to demand higher nominal prices (as oil contracts are predominantly dollar-denominated).</p>
<p>Consumers are most visibly touched by this price rise through the prices they have to pay for petrol and diesel. However, it should also be noted that EU customers are relatively shielded from the implications of rising oil prices, due to the structure of taxes and excise duties in place which reduce the transmission of the shock. The strengthening of the euro relative to the dollar has also cushioned the price increase. A positive side effect of the current market conditions is that it can be expected to increase the public interest in energy saving and efficiency as well as in alternative fuels.</p>
<p>As alternative transport fuels are currently more expensive than diesel and petrol, the recent increase in the cost of oil (assuming it will be long lasting) significantly reduces the price difference. This renders investments into research, demonstration and commercialisation of technologies related to alternative fuels increasingly attractive. Such economic trends notwithstanding, the Commission is committed to devote a significant share of the energy research budget of the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research into biofuels and end-user energy efficiency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>For a whole variety of reasons (increasing scarcity of food crops, rising food prices, financial speculation, etc.) it appears to be the case that a rush to produce agrofuels might rapidly worsen the problem of hunger in the South, more especially in Africa. On 25 October 2007 the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food issued a report calling for a five-year moratorium on the production of crops intended for conversion into fuel: the idea being, once that time lag has passed, to move on directly to second-generation biofuels made from crop waste. Another possible solution would be to produce agrofuels from inedible crops grown on arid or semi-arid land. Will the Commission back adoption of the moratorium and/or encourage generous support for research into second-generation agrofuels so as to ensure that the globalisation of ‘green petrol’ is not brought about at the expense of the least developed countries and their small-scale producers, bearing in mind, moreover, that large agricultural producers and transnational companies are already in the best position to profit from the new situation on the energy market?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission does not share the view of the United Nations' special rapporteur. The recent increases in agricultural raw product prices result from a combination of low harvest, due to bad weather conditions, and an increase in the demand from large emerging countries. The Commission is of the opinion that a moratorium would ignore the potential of biofuels to improve livelihoods in rural areas, in particular in developing countries. However, the Commission will closely follow the possible impacts that "first generation" biofuels might have on food security.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees that every effort should be made to develop second-generation biofuel technologies and bring these fuels into the market. They will improve security of supply by diversifying the range of feedstocks that can be used. But the progress of "second generation" biofuels largely depends on the development of the "first generation" biofuels.

<p>The Commission does not plan to propose renewable energy consumption targets at regional and local level in addition to the binding national targets.</p>

Many regions have set local renewable energy targets. In fact, one of the agreed common indicators in the regional rural development programmes relates to the increased production of renewable energy.</p>
<p>So far, Member States have already allocated around € 8 billion to promoting renewables and energy efficiency at local level under Cohesion Policy funding for the period 2007-2013. It is however difficult to quantify the total amount of aid to regions, because additional contributions from other sources, such as the "Intelligent Energy – Europe" initiative within the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (2007-2013) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development will also play an important role in encouraging the uptake of renewables at local level.</p>
<p>The Commission is about to make a proposal for a framework Directive for renewables which would require Member States to submit national action plans outlining how they aim to reach the national renewable targets. For some Member States, considering the regional aspects, such as availability of resources in different regions, should be a key element to consider.

<p>Environment has become a cornerstone of the EU’s bilateral strategic partnerships with China, India and Russia and high-level Environment Dialogues have been established with these countries. These dialogues have resulted in concrete activities in the fields of air and water pollution, climate change, cleaner production and waste management.</p>
<p>The EU Summits with India and China in 2005 agreed to enhance co-operation on climate change by establishing Climate Change Partnerships. Under the EU-China Partnership co-operation is underway to build in China a near-Zero Emissions Coal Demonstration Plant with carbon capture and storage to address China's rapidly increasing greenhouse gas emissions from coal use.</p>
<p>Through our Regional Strategy Programmes for Asia and Latin America the Commission also supports the protection of the environment strengthening environmental governance and enhancing expertise.</p>
<p>The Environment and Forests thematic budget line (2000-2006) provided more than 300 million EUR to ensure that environment became an integral part of the region's development. The sustainable management of natural resources was among the key priority areas addressed.</p>
<p>Environment is also one of the key policy sectors to be funded under the Regional Strategy for Asia (2007-2013). Over 30 million €/year will be allocated to activities under the Environment, Energy and Climate Change heading. These initiatives will help to build the regulatory, administrative and scientific capacity needed in Asia to face today's environmental challenges.</p>
<p>The Commission also works in multilateral fora through various United Nations (UN) bodies, notably the UN Commission on Sustainable Development and United Nations Environment Programme, urging for greater international action to deal with global environmental concerns.</p>
<p>The Commission (representing the Community) takes an active part in the elaboration, ratification and implementation of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (Conventions /Protocols) and today is a party to over 50 environmental agreements covering issues such as climate change, protection of the ozone layer, desertification, nature protection, management of chemicals and waste, and transboundary air and water pollution.</p>
<p>In the field of air pollution, the Commission has played a key role in reaching agreement with partners (including Russia) to reduce pollution from heavy metals and sulphur emissions under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP).</p>
<p>Globally the Commission has pushed for strong and effective implementation and further development of the Stockholm Convention – the key international treaty to protect the environment from toxic chemicals known as POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants). The elimination of POPs requires important financial and technical resources. The Commission works closely with developing countries to help with the elimination of POPs.</p>
<p>This is just a snapshot of the many initiatives underway or in the pipeline and shows the Commission's true commitment to working in all fora to advance the protection of the global environment for all mankind.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0883"></a>

<p>The Commission is undertaking several steps to ensure that Member States are complying with the obligations under the Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>First, the Commission is checking the technical and legal compliance of the measures transposing the Directive into national legislation in the Member States. These measures should place a responsibility on producers for the organisation and financing of the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment and in particular of lighting equipment. National legislation should also ensure that producers inform consumers about this separate collection, the return and collection systems available to them, their role in contributing to reuse, recycling and recovery, and about the meaning of the symbol – a crossed-out wheeled bin - marking electronic equipment. Compliance checks have already lead to infringement procedures against two Member States (October 2007). Infringement cases against other Member States are likely to follow.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Commission is assessing obligatory reports of Member States on the implementation of this Directive. A first reporting round was due for September of 2007. The Commission is currently assessing the reports. It will publish its findings in 2008.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Member States have to report on the quantities and categories of waste electrical and electronic equipment collected, reused, recycled and recovered within the Member States or exported. The first reporting is due for mid 2008.</p>
<p>Finally, regular meetings to assess progress, solve problems and exchange best practices are held with Member States, on average three meetings annually.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission promotes the protection of children’s rights both within the Union and in its external action. Initiatives taken are consistent with the "rights of the child" as enshrined in Article 24 of the European Union Charter for fundamental rights. Moreover, they are in line with what is foreseen in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p>It is also important to remark that Article 5 of the Draft Lisbon Treaty provides that “in its relations with the wider world, the Union shall […] contribute to […] the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child”..</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that environmental changes and specific hazards have a significant impact on the health and well-being of children.</p>
<p>Thus, as vulnerable part of the population, children are covered by the "European Environment and Health Strategy" launched by the Commission in June 2003 as the SCALE<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> initiative, where the C indicates the special focus on children.</p>
<p>The concerns of children are also integrated throughout the Environment and Health Action Plan adopted in June 2004.</p>
<p>In this framework, the Commission is addressing the effects of environmental pressures on children's health in a range of research projects. For example, research projects on "susceptibility" have been funded in order to adjust policy responses to the needs of children in those cases where they are specifically vulnerable.</p>
<p>A particular concern relates to air pollution, which poses significant risks to human health. Sensitive groups including children are those suffering the most adverse health impacts.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to Community measures that are in place with the objective of improving ambient air quality and that are aimed at the public at large, there are further provisions for the sensitive groups. The ozone information threshold to prevent even brief excessive exposure of specific parts of the population is one example.</p>
<p>In addition, the new Air Quality Directive - currently in 2<span class="sup">nd</span> reading<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> -, includes objectives set specifically to push for reduction of urban background concentrations of fine particles PM2.5. This is expected to bring the largest health benefits in particular within the sensitive groups - including children.</p>
<p>Children's exposure to indoor environments is also of particular concern. The Commission has set up an expert working group on indoor air quality to give advice on possible policy initiatives in this area and has funded several research programmes related to this.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Under the Water Framework Directive (WFD)<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Member States are required to set up, by 2010, water pricing policies that serve the dual purpose of recovering the costs of water services and giving users of services an incentive to use water in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>The mechanisms for estimating these costs (financial costs as well as environmental and resource costs), enforcing such cost recovery and estimating the adequate contribution of different water users must be part of the River Basin Management Plans (cf. Article 13 WFD) to be established by end 2009. They must be then reported to the Commission by the Member States by 22 March 2010.</p>
<p>Whilst the WFD sets out the principal obligations, it is for the Member States to develop the details of their water pricing policy in line with subsidiarity.</p>
<p>To support this work, the Commission initiated and organized the preparation of an informal guidance document and other supporting tools to implement the economic instruments of the WFD. This has been carried out in close cooperation with the Member States<a href="#defann_47_3" name="refann_47_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>When developing the River Basin Management Plans, Member States are required to consult the public. Draft River Basin Management Plans shall be made available for consultation in December 2008. At that moment, interested parties can express their views on the planned measures including those selected for the recovery of costs.</p>
<p>The WFD states that Member States may take into account social and economic considerations when establishing the level of cost recovery for different users (cf Article 9.1). Moreover, Member States can exempt specific water use activities from the provisions of Article 9(1) where this does not compromise the achievements of the objectives of the Directive (cf Article 9.4).</p>
<p>Furthermore, transparency of water pricing structures is crucial for such economic instruments to be effective. The WFD does not itself prescribe provisions as regards consumer protection, as this would be outside the scope of its legal basis. In line with subsidiarity, it is for the Member States to set up appropriate mechanisms. Physical persons can however seek redress via Directive 93/13/EEC on unfair terms in consumer contracts<a href="#defann_47_4" name="refann_47_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has brought an action against Sweden before the Court of Justice for Sweden's failure to convert its waste water treatment plants in order to improve nitrogen treatment. Some 60 plants are involved, requiring development costing at least 1 billion SEK. Most are located in Norrland and south-central Sweden. The organisation representing the waste water treatment plants, the Swedish Water &amp; Wastewater Association, has accused the Commission of having insufficient knowledge about the matter. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency has established that a conversion would not have any positive impact. Researchers and public authorities in Sweden are agreed that nitrogen is not the primary cause of eutrophication of the Baltic but phosphorus, which the Swedish treatment plants eliminate almost entirely.</p>
<p>On what grounds has the Commission decided that the conversion of Swedish waste water treatment plants would actually improve nitrogen treatment? To what extent does the Commission consider that the present treatment plants are the cause of cross-border environmental problems?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Baltic Sea is one of the most eutrophied water areas in Europe because of the high concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen.</p>
<p>Agriculture and insufficiently treated waste water are the main sources of these nutrient inputs.</p>
<p>This conclusion is notably included in the Baltic Sea Action Plan adopted on 15 November 2007 by HELCOM, the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea, to which Sweden is a party.</p>
<p>HELCOM has estimated that annual reductions of some 15,000 tonnes of phosphorus and 135,000 tonnes of nitrogen would be required to achieve a good ecological status in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>In order to protect the environment from the adverse effects of waste water discharges, the European Union adopted in 1991 a Directive on the treatment of urban waste water, which lays down relevant deadlines and conditions<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in this area. A key feature of this Directive is the identification of sensitive areas where more stringent treatment for waste water is required.</p>
<p>The fact that eight Member States around the Baltic Sea have designated their coastal waters as sensitive under the Urban Waste Water Directive is a confirmation of the fact that the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea is a cross-border environmental problem.</p>
<p>The treatment plants referred to in the question are discharging water which ends up in areas that Sweden has defined as sensitive. The deadline for introducing stringent water treatment in such plants was 31 December 1998.</p>
<p>As Sweden had not complied with this obligation, the Commission started an infringement procedure against Sweden in 2002. In fact, the Commission considered that Sweden, taking into account both its obligations under the Urban Waste Water Directive and the high degree of eutrophication of the Baltic Sea as a whole, needs to remove nitrogen from the waste water.</p>
<p>A reduction of nitrogen discharges from Swedish waste water will benefit the Baltic Sea as a whole.</p>
<p>It is however positive to see that Sweden is taking other steps in this area. It is for example worth mentioning that, in April 2007, Sweden agreed, in the framework of the Council of Baltic Sea States, to increase waste water treatment in order to further remove nitrogen.</p>
<p>Reducing the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea is one of our responsibilities in ensuring the best possible environmental conditions in Europe.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commissioner in charge of Environment is currently in Bali at the United Nations climate change conference, where the EU hopes, as do many of our partners, that the international community will agree to launch negotiations on a new global and comprehensive climate change agreement for the period after 2012. The Commissioner spoke about this at length during the November plenary debate on Bali<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As he explained, the EU's climate and energy strategy and the work we have done with key global partners over the course of this year, including at the recent EU-China and EU-India Summits, has been instrumental in setting the level of ambition for Bali as well as the architecture of any post-2012 climate agreement.</p>
<p>Our projections show that, in order to achieve our objective of limiting global climate change to 2ºC, global emissions reductions of at least 50% compared to 1990 levels are needed by 2050. The targets which the EU has set itself are in line with achieving this level of ambition, but only if others also act.</p>
<p>To show true leadership, the EU must deliver at home. The Commission will adopt the climate and energy implementing proposals early next year that will provide the necessary tools to reach our targets for at least 20% unilateral emission reductions and 30% in case of an international agreement whereby other developed countries commit to comparable efforts.</p>
<p>The pressure is now on our developed country partners to follow suit in taking the lead and making ambitious commitments to absolute emissions reductions. We cannot expect others to take action on the scale needed if we are not.</p>
<p>Projections for emissions growth worldwide however leave no doubt - developing countries must also contribute – not necessarily through absolute emissions reductions at this stage, but they should slow the rate of emission growth, and we stand ready to help. We must get global emissions of greenhouse gases to peak in the next 10 to 15 years. Only this brings us on a path of keeping global average temperature rise within the 2 degree limit.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The maritime sector is an important source of air pollution as was highlighted in the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Directive 1999/32/EC<a href="#defann_52_2" name="refann_52_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> as amended by Directive 2005/33/EC<a href="#defann_52_3" name="refann_52_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, has established two European sea areas as Sulphur Emissions Control Areas (SECA). These are the Baltic Sea and the North Sea and English Channel respectively. As a result, ships passing through these areas are only allowed to use fuel with a maximum sulphur content of 1.5% by weight (or 15.000 mg/kg or ppm). This is around 40% less than the average fuel used by international shipping (2.7%). This requirement also applies to passenger ships operating on regular services to or from any Community port. In addition, from 1 January 2010 ships at berth will only be allowed to use fuel with less than 0.1% sulphur (1000 ppm).</p>
<p>It is evident, however, that more has to be done to reduce air pollution from ships. Even with the measures mentioned, total sulphur oxide (and nitrogen oxide) emissions from ships in European waters will be as high as all land-based sources combined by 2020. As such, the Commission together with the Member States is pursuing action at the international level via the International Maritime Organization (IMO). However, the Commission has stated that it will propose Community measures in the absence of progress at the IMO<a href="#defann_52_4" name="refann_52_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.

<p>The issue of reuse of treated urban waste waters is of particular relevance for countries and regions with water scarcity.</p>
<p>While international organizations have established guidelines on the reuse of treated waste water, there is currently no specific legislation at EU-level. As rightly mentioned by the Honourable Member, Article 12 of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive<a href="#defann_53_2" name="refann_53_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> stipulates that "treated waste water shall be reused whenever appropriate", subject to certain conditions, but the Directive does not lay down harmonised criteria for re-use.</p>
<p>However, the EU environmental legal framework fully applies (in particular the water-related directives<a href="#defann_53_3" name="refann_53_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>) as does the Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuff<a href="#defann_53_4" name="refann_53_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> with regards to agricultural reuse.</p>
<p>The Water Framework Directive of 2000 establishes the objective of good water quality ('good status') for all waters to be achieved by 2015 in the context of River Basin Management Plans and Programmes of measures to be developed by 2009. These provisions include incentives about sustainable water use as well as efficiency and reuse measures.</p>
<p>The Commission has addressed water scarcity and droughts in its Communication to the Parliament and to the Council of 18 July 2007 "Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union"<a href="#defann_53_5" name="refann_53_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. It fosters, among others, 'water-efficient technologies and practice'.</p>
<p>Agricultural and Cohesion policy and the use of their Funds support the implementation of the Acquis Communautaire; therefore they can contribute for the above-mentioned purpose.</p>
<p>In practice the reuse of treated waste water is nowadays practised in the EU and Mediterranean countries and beyond.</p>
<p>In addition, a comprehensive document "Mediterranean Wastewater Reuse Report" has been elaborated by experts from participating countries, stakeholders and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) during 2007 under the joint chairmanship of the Commission and Malta. It assesses current knowledge and experience (including detailed case studies), provides an overview of related benefits and risks, outlines applicable European Union environmental legislation as well as legislative frameworks in several countries, and provides a set of recommendations.</p>

The Community fully supported the decisions aimed at strengthening enforcement and conservation efforts for tigers, which were adopted at the 14<span class="sup">th</span> Conference of the Parties to CITES (CITES CoP14) in June 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission is of the view that CITES Parties must give greater priority to combating illegal trade in wildlife. In this vein, the Commission adopted an EU Action Plan on CITES Enforcement in June 2007. The Community also put forward a proposal, which was adopted at CITES CoP14, aimed at strengthening law enforcement and improving regional cooperation.</p>
<p>The Commission has on numerous occasions expressed its willingness to provide funding and technical assistance to India in order to support conservation programmes for the species and address poaching. Whilst such funding and assistance has not yet been requested by India, the Commission has provided funding through its multilateral programme for an Asian CITES implementation and enforcement workshop in China in 2005. This workshop addressed enforcement issues and regional cooperation in combating illegal trade in tiger products. The Commission also intends to provide funding for a CITES tiger trade enforcement meeting due to take place in 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission has urged China to step up its efforts to tackle illegal wildlife trade. Whilst the Commission understands that China has made progress in improving enforcement of CITES, the Commission intends to raise the matter with them again at relevant opportunities in order to ensure that CITES is effectively being enforced.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0960"></a>

<p>The quantity of CO2 emissions allocated to Bulgaria by EC decision of 26 October 2007 for the period 2007-2012 amounts to 42.27 m t CO2 eqv. This is a reduction of 37. 4% compared to the requested quota and drastically decreases the opportunities for development and growth of the poorest country among the EU Member States and its main industrial sectors. Why is there such a large difference?</p>
<p>The Commission has wrongfully accepted data presented by Bulgaria in its year 2005 plan as a starting point for analysis and calculations, without taking into account the basic circumstances in the country as required by Directive 2003/87/CE<a href="#defann_55_1" name="refann_55_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission has ignored the closing of reactors 3 and 4 of the Kozlouduy nuclear power plant, which eliminates about 17 m t CO2 eqv a year. The Commission is evaluating the carbon intensity of the Bulgarian economy by using the nominal GDP instead of GDP per PPP. Furthermore, basic documents (PRIMES model update) needed for preparations were not available, not coordinated and delayed.

<p>In evaluating National Allocation Plans (NAPs) submitted by Member States, the Commission followed a transparent and consistent methodology. The methodology used 2005 emissions as a basis for projecting future emissions in the 2008-2012 period, and took account of future Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and expected improvements in carbon intensity. The methodology was applied in an equal manner to all Member States. Given that no verified 2005 emissions data were available in the case of Bulgaria, the Commission used 2005 emissions data provided in the Bulgarian NAP.</p>
<p>When using 2005 as a basis for its calculations, the Commission took account of the closure of two reactors at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. Bulgaria receives funding from the EU to improve the capacity utilisation of the remaining Kozloduy reactors and to invest in renewables and energy efficiency. In addition, Bulgaria exported a significant share of electricity generated in Kozloduy.</p>
<p>The Commission used the PRIMES model as a basis for its own assessment because it was the best available tool at its disposal. It is a robust economic model developed by independent experts and based on up-to-date economic theory. Its input data are provided on a regular basis by Member States. The model has already been used for policy decisions by the Commission and other public institutions. Moreover, it covers all of the 27 Member States of the European Union.</p>

<p>Agricultural commodities have shown very significant price increases over the last few months, in particular for wheat, maize, poultry and many dairy products. There are several reasons for these developments. Some are of a structural nature: they had already caused prices over the last 18 months to reach firmer levels than those observed for more than a decade and were largely anticipated in the medium-term prospects for agricultural markets that the Commission published in July 2007.</p>
<p>Besides these structural factors the agricultural sector has been hit over the most recent months by a series of adverse climatic conditions in many producing and exporting regions. The combination of these structural and short-term factors has generated very tight market conditions generating a sharp rise in the market prices of many agricultural commodities.</p>
<p>The management and monitoring of agricultural markets by the Commission are based on regular and in-depth market analysis for both the short and medium term, and although the Commission does note elaborate short-term price forecasts as such, it is increasingly clear that the impact of these short-term factors on prices should slowly decline over the next few months.</p>
<p>Under a medium-term perspective and with all the caution necessary when analysing these market developments, the Commission is of the opinion that structural factors, such as the growth in global food demand and the development of new market outlets, can be reasonably expected to maintain prices at sustained levels, though at lower levels than those recently observed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0876"></a>

<p>One of the major objectives of the policy of the European Union in the rail sector is to create a regulatory framework which supports the competitiveness of this mode of transport, which knew a period of steady decline in its transport share until recently. The recipe chosen was to progressively open the rail markets so that internal gains in terms of efficiency, reliability and accessibility could also be translated into external advantages as compared to other modes of transport, such as air transport.</p>
<p>The opening of high speed lines enabled rail to obtain significant market shares on routes where transport by air was previously dominant. The effort spent by the European Community to support the development of a European high speed rail network has been remarkable as far as the financial assistance and technical harmonisation are concerned.</p>
<p>The recent adoption of the legislative proposal to open the market for international rail passenger services by January 2010 will support this move. In addition the Commission works on the European standard concerning the telematics for rail passengers which would allow a more informed and efficient choice of and access to rail services for passengers by the use of state-of-art technology.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0902"></a>

<p>The Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs is the correct basis for the European response to globalisation. Europe falls far short in achieving success in shaping globalisation, under the broad approach agreed at the Hampton Court summit in October 2005 and centred on the Lisbon Growth and Jobs Strategy, renewed in the spring of 2005 after its original launch in 2000. Furthermore, globalisation is constantly evolving and progress towards the achievement of the Lisbon goals has been rather disappointing. R&amp;D must be increased, but targets must be realistic and be clearly justified. The current Lisbon target of 3 per cent of EU GDP for R&amp;D spending is neither and should be recast.</p>

<p>The European Union's response to globalisation has moved to the heart of the EU policy agenda. The relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy in Spring 2005 put Europe back on track to face up to competition as the touchstone for creating growth and jobs in the modern global economy. As part of the response to the informal meeting at Hampton Court in October 2005, the Spring European Council in 2006, Heads of State and Government stressed the need to move up a gear in the work of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs in order to spearhead the response of the European economy.</p>
<p>The EU is working on many of the policy elements needed to equip it to take on the challenge of globalisation. The good results of the renewed Lisbon Strategy are clearly visible as we approach the end of the first three-year cycle of reforms. Budget deficits have been reduced from 2.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2005 to a forecasted 1.1% in 2007, whilst public debt has declined from 62.7% in 2005 to just below 60% in 2007. Productivity growth reached 1.5% in 2006, compared to an annual growth rate of 1.2% between 2000 and 2005. The EU-United States (US) productivity gap has started to diminish with some indications that factors other than the favourable cycle are also at work. Economic growth was 3.0% in EU-27 in 2006 (compared to 1.8% in 2005) and is expected to remain at 2.9% and 2.4% in 2007 and 2008. Almost 6.5 million new jobs have been created in the last two years. Another 5 million jobs are expected to be created up to 2009. Unemployment is expected to fall to under 7%, the lowest level since the mid-80's. The employment rate, currently at 66%, has moved much closer to the overall Lisbon target of 70%.</p>
<p>As the pace of change accelerates, the areas of work need to be stepped up to boost the capacity of the EU to shape the globalisation agenda. The Commission is putting new ideas on the table to address these key challenges:</p>
<p>- Getting the most from the Internal Market: The EU single market gives Europeans a solid foundation on which to adapt to globalisation and structural change. In its Single Market Review of 20 November 2007, the Commission has set out a package of initiatives to modernise the European single market and to bring more benefits to Europeans, building on past successes. The single market has already helped create competitive companies, reduced prices, more choice for consumers and a Europe attractive for investors. The Commission's measures are based on extensive consultation. They will ensure that the single market does even more to take advantage of globalisation, empower consumers, open up for small businesses, stimulate innovation and help maintain high social and environmental standards. Among the most important policy actions set out in the single market package are initiatives to: help consumers to exercise their contractual rights and get redress across borders; provide better information for consumers and small businesses; respond to weaknesses in sectors where the single market should deliver more; propose a Small Business Act; and introduce a "researcher passport"; clarify how EU rules apply to services and social services of general interest; and promote the quality of social services across the EU. Due to globalization, regulatory dialogues with our key partners have also become a priority. Their aim is, notably, to foster greater economic integration. It is also to develop convergence towards high quality standards (for instance in the case of accounting) and to develop multilateral responses to global challenges, such as in the case of the current financial turmoil. The EU has developed such dialogues with US, China, Japan, Russia and India.</p>
<p>- Responding to Europe's new social realities: The ongoing stocktaking of Europe's social realities is looking at the big changes under way in our societies. This will require a new approach to the social agenda. The EU will need more effective means of ensuring citizens' existing rights of access to employment, education, social services, health care and other forms of social protection across Europe. In areas where the EU has a direct role, it must better adapt its existing instruments and policies, but also build on new policy responses such as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
<p>- Sustainable energy policies for a low carbon future: The Commission's initiatives on energy policy clearly demonstrate its determination to reinforce EU policies to adapt to the changing world context. The conclusions of the 2007 Spring European Council, which largely endorsed the Commission's proposals set out in "An Energy Policy for Europe"<a href="#defann_60_1" name="refann_60_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, set out an ambitious EU approach to energy and climate change. This approach is based on binding targets – to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, rising to 30% when an international agreement is forthcoming, and to increase the share of renewable energy in the EU's energy mix from less than 7% today to 20% by 2020. It also includes a commitment to reduce energy demand in 2020 by 20% and to deliver a fully functioning internal energy market. The Commission is now implementing the Action Plan agreed by the European Council. An internal energy market package was tabled by the Commission on 19 September 2007. A Strategic Energy Technology Plan has been presented on 21 November 2007. Early in 2008, the Commission will put forward the main legislative proposals to deliver on the climate change and energy objectives, including renewable energy and carbon capture and storage. In the international context, it is vital that, at the Bali Conference on climate change in December 2007, the EU works effectively to ensure the launch of official negotiations on a comprehensive international agreement to fight climate change for the period after 2012 when our current Kyoto commitments come to an end.</p>
<p>– More research and development (R&amp;D) and innovation: Progress as concerns EU R&amp;D intensity has so far been modest, standing at 1.84% of GDP in 2006, a considerable way off the 3% R&amp;D target for 2010. However, Member States have set national targets and have increased government budgets for R&amp;D in nominal terms. Should all Member States achieve their national targets, the EU R&amp;D expenditure is now forecast to reach 2.5% of GDP by 2010.</p>
<p>Substantially greater amounts of EU funding have been made available for growth and jobs. The new regulatory framework for the Cohesion policy programmes will make some € 210 billion available for investment in growth and jobs over 2007-13, an increase of over 25% compared to 2000-06. Measures have been taken to improve the framework conditions for R&amp;D and innovation through the adoption of a new R&amp;D and innovation state aid framework and through guidance on tax incentives and knowledge transfer. On the expenditure side, the 7th Framework Programme was adopted which will raise R&amp;D spending at the EU level by 75% between 2007 and 2013 and support for major public-private partnership.</p>
<p>– A more dynamic business environment: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurship has been put high on the reform agenda. The European Council has invited Member States to set their own national administrative burden reduction targets by 2008 of comparable ambition to the target set by the Commission (i.e. a 25% reduction). To this date, nine Member States (AT, DE, DK, ES, IT, NL, SE, SK, UK) have set a 25% national reduction target, while another two Member States (CZ, FR) set a target of 20%. The average time and cost to start up a private limited company is roughly half of that needed in 2002: it is now estimated at 12 days and cost € 485.</p>
<p>The Commission will seek the views of SMEs and their representatives to help design a "Small Business Act" for Europe with a view to making a wide range of proposals to support SMEs by the end of 2008. The better regulation "culture" has begun to take root across the EU: the institutions need to lead the way. The Commission has made major changes in the way it develops new proposals and monitors implementation of the existing acquis. As well as cutting existing burdens, special consideration should be given to whether all the administrative requirements of EU legislation need to be applied in full to SMEs.</p>
<p>– Greater employability and investment in people: Globalisation and technological change risk increased inequality, opening up the gap between the skilled and the unskilled. The key to increased performance lies in modernising education and training policies. There is a growing interest in "flexicurity." This can help people to manage employment transitions more successfully in times of accelerating economic change. The Commission has proposed common principles for consideration at the December 2007 European Council. These would offer Member States a basis to draw on as they work with the national social partners to adapt flexicurity to national circumstances and mainstream this approach into their National Reform Programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Production in the cigarette industry has fallen drastically in the industrialised countries of the West, one of the main reasons being the increasingly stricter regulation of smoking in public places. In countries which have banned smoking in public places, such as Italy, Spain and France, cigarette consumption has also fallen. This policy has resulted in an overall reduction in cigarette consumption of 2-3% in Europe and the USA. A recent study has shown that, by 2010, the developed countries will account for 29% of cigarette consumption and the developing countries for 71%. By 2025, the number of smokers is expected to have risen to 500 million, 90% of whom will be outside Europe and the USA.

<p>Worldwide, according to the World Health Organization's estimates, tobacco is the second major cause of death, causing an estimated 4.9 million deaths per year.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization predicts that without further action in 2020 the mortalities attributable to tobacco world wide will increase two-fold, and approximately 70% of these deaths will occur in developing countries.</p>
<p>The EU is committed to addressing health priorities in partnership with third countries and regions, and deciding on priorities and instruments in coherence with the European consensus in development and with the principles of the Paris Declaration, respecting ownership and increasing coordination and predictability of aid.</p>
<p>The EU has provided leadership for and supported the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the FCTC, as the main international tool for this purpose.</p>
<p>The European Community and 25 Member States are now Parties to the Convention and key players in the process. The rest of the world often turns to the EU, drawing from its experience in areas such as banning advertising or fighting illicit trade.</p>
<p>The EC is committed to cooperate and is prepared to assist other Parties in implementing the FCTC through the existing mechanisms in place.</p>
<p>The Commission is advocating tobacco control at a global level. In developing countries, the EC promotes a thorough analysis of priority health problems and supports countries in planning and financing national health strategies. In this context, where partner countries identify tobacco and actions related to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control as priority, the EC will support these countries' strategies for tobacco control.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0909"></a>

<p>Official data from the Commission's Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union, show that tomato imports into the EU from Morocco in 2006-2007 were 16 259.27 tonnes over the preferential quota of 235 330 tonnes (including the 1% tolerance margin). The coincidence of the price crises that hit Europe's countryside with saturation of the internal market by the influx of Moroccan tomatoes in both November 2006 and in April this year, which is when the bulk of the quota-excess entered the EU, demonstrates the direct relationship between these illegal imports and the disruption of the European market.</p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to take effective measures to put an end to this blatantly illegal situation, apart from merely reducing the quota for the following year, under the provisions of Article 25 of the Association Agreement between the EU and Morocco?

<p>According to the figures recorded by the Commission from Member States' monitoring data, total EU imports of tomatoes originating in Morocco reached 251,589 tonnes, i.e. 16,259 tonnes beyond the quantities fixed in Protocol 1 of the Association agreement. In accordance with regulatory provisions in force, the Commission reduced the volume of the additional tariff quota by 20,000 tonnes for the period of 1<span class="sup">st</span> November 2007 to 31<span class="sup">st</span> May 2008.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the rules of the World Trade Organisation, no voluntary restraint can be imposed between the partners (Article XI of GATT). Consequently, Morocco is free to export any quantity of tomatoes apart from the preferential tariff quotas, these exports being subjected to the corresponding customs tariff. The Commission cannot therefore subscribe to the interpretation of "illegal character" of Moroccan tomato exports taking place outside the preferential quota which is made by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>The application of Article 25 of the Association agreement stipulates provisions in the event of serious injury for national producers of similar or directly competitive products on the territory of one of the parts or of serious disturbances in a sector of the economy or difficulty which can result in serious deterioration of a regional economic situation. The Commission is currently not in possession of any element likely to justify the application of such provisions.</p>

<p>The Commission follows very closely the recent developments concerning nuclear power in the EU’s neighbourhood, including in the Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>Even though it is not the European Union's role, or indeed the role of the Commission, to decide for any of the third countries whether they use nuclear energy or not, these developments can not be ignored.</p>
<p>It is useful to state that all countries of the Mediterranean region, with the exclusion of the state of Israel, have signed the Non Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission has recently addressed this issue in bilateral contact with some of the countries concerned while stressing the following pre-requisites:</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the first point of contact for any of the countries with ambitions for developing a civil nuclear programme be the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. The countries concerned should sign the necessary agreements to ensure the respect of nuclear safeguards, and adhere to the relevant international conventions on nuclear safety, physical protection and nuclear waste management.</p>
<p>It is essential that in each of the countries committed to developing of civil nuclear programme, the most advanced framework for nuclear safety is put in place. This should include the establishment of an independent regulatory authority which must ensure that the measures necessary to guarantee high standards of safety, security and non proliferation are adopted and respected. However, the safety of nuclear installations remains the sole responsibility of the State that operates them.</p>
<p>The Commission could have a significant role in the area of nuclear safety by supporting the development of the legislative and regulatory frameworks; it could also contribute significantly to the development of nuclear safety culture in the EU’s neighbourhood.</p>

The Court held that sport was subject to Community law only when it constitutes an economic activity whether performed by professional or amateur athletes. In case sport involves gainful employment, it is covered by Article 39 of the EC Treaty and the prohibition of discrimination against EU nationals on grounds of nationality under Articles 12 and 39 of the EC Treaty applies.</p>

However, the Court did make an exception to the general non-discrimination rule for matches which are purely of sportive, rather than economic, nature (e.g. games between national teams).

<p>In this context, any rule implying the establishment of quotas on the basis of nationality for the composition of professional teams other that national teams seems to be contrary to Community law on free movement of workers.

Consequently it has proposed an exemption for liquids bought at Singapore airport. The comitology procedures having been completed, the Commission adopted the regulation on 31.7.2007.</p>
<p>Since the adoption of Regulation 915/2007<a href="#defann_65_2" name="refann_65_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, countries including Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Croatia, Canada, Dubai, Israel, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Malaysia and Mauritius have asked for exemptions. The Commission has requested them to prepare reports demonstrating that they meet the security standards, which it is now awaiting. Once it receives them, it will carefully assess whether each country meets the standards, probably conducting verifications at airports. It will then decide for which countries to propose exemptions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has refused to end the excessive deficit procedure against Poland, despite the fact that, according to the Commission’s own forecasts, Poland’s budget deficit in 2007 will be 2.7% of GDP, and forecasts for economic growth and inflation in 2008 suggest that the budget deficit will be lower than 3% of GDP in 2008. Poland is one of the few EU Member States to introduce pension reforms, which places a burden of several billion złoty on its budget each year. By contrast, the two largest Member States in the euro zone, Germany and France, clearly exceeded the deficit ceiling from 2002 to 2005, i.e. four years running, but to avoid imposing a fine of billions of euro on these countries, in line with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), the Pact’s rules were changed. Both countries have yet to complete reforms to their respective pension systems. This situation creates the undeniable impression that the Commission does not measure the EU Member States against the same yardstick. The larger Member States, already part of the euro zone, are able not to adhere to SGP rules, while other countries, merely applicants to join the zone, are, in spite of the serious reforms to their public finances, continually called upon to carry out further reforms. When will there be an end to the unequal treatment of Member States as regards adherence to the SGP?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission issued on 20 November 2007 a communication to the Council on the "Assessment of the action taken by Poland in response to the Council recommendation of 27 February 2007 according to Article 104(7) under the excessive deficit procedure". In this Council recommendation Poland was recommended to correct its excessive deficit by the year 2007 and to this end to take effective action by the deadline of 27 August 2007. The Polish government notified the Commission on the actions taken and the Commission made an assessment of these actions based on its Autumn 2007 forecast concluding that no further steps under the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) of Poland are needed at this stage.</p>
<p>The communication from the Commission to the Council represents an intermediate assessment following the expiry of the deadline for taking action. For other countries under the EDP, the Commission has also adopted communciations to the Council following the expiry of the deadline for taking action, provided of course that the assessment of action taken was not negative, in which case a recommendation for a Council decision establishing that action taken is inadequate was adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p>The decision on abrogating or not abrogating is the next step in the excessive deficit procedure in Poland. The abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure can only be based on actual data. 2007 actual budgetary data will be validated by Eurostat in April 2008, thus abrogation cannot take place before. Moreover for abrogating the excessive deficit procedure it is essential that the durability of the deficit correction is ensured. This will be assessed against the Commission services' spring 2008 forecast for the period to 2009 to be published by the end of April 2008.</p>
<p>The reformed Stability and Growth Pact allows to take into consideration the costs related to the introduction of a pension reform establishing a fully funded pension pillar. When it comes to the decision on abrogating or not the excessive deficit procedure in Poland, these costs will be considered subject to the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact, i.e. provided that the deficit has declined substantially and continuously and has reached a level that comes close to the reference value.</p>
<p>The Commission treats all countries equally. The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact was undertaken in order to introduce more economic rationale, to better reflect the increased economic heterogenity of the enlarged EU, and to enhance national ownership. The rules of the reformed Stability and Growth Pact were negotiated and approved by the governments of all Member States, including Poland. The Commission closely monitors the budgetary developments in all member states reacting appropriately when it is necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0931"></a>

<p>The Commission is fully aware of the environmental problem associated with the discharge of pollutants into the river Vardar/Axios. As pointed out in the Commission's replies to questions <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2006-0637_EN.html">E-0637/06</a> and <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2000-0442_EN.html">H-442/00</a>, financial assistance has been provided to address this problem since 1997. There is currently a network of monitoring points and stations for continuous monitoring of the hydrological and environmental status of the Vardar/Axios watershed area, which has enabled an extensive analysis of the water quality. The authorities of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have announced that they will publish a report with all relevant hydrological, morphological, chemical and biological data on the water quality of the river during 2007.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the national authorities to take measures against the pollutants. As underlined in this year's progress report, there has only been limited progress in the area of water quality. However, the adoption by the government of a new law on waters which allocates clear responsibilities for water management to the Ministry for the Environment and Physical Planning is a step forward. The Commission encourages the authorities to transpose and implement the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control as soon as possible. While legislative transposition is at an advanced stage, the authorities have stated that they will not be able to fully implement the rules of the directive in this field before the end of 2009. The Commission will continue to monitor the issue and raise it again in its bilateral meetings.</p>

<p>According to aid organisations, such diseases as leprosy and tuberculosis are still prevalent in China and measures to control and treat them are entirely dependent on foreign aid. In the past five years, more than 700 new cases of leprosy have come to light in China - a worryingly large figure. In Guangxi, for example, which is one of the poorest regions of the country with a GDP comparable to that of Lesotho in Africa, sick people are banished to isolated villages with derelict houses, far from modern China. The State pays them a monthly allowance of 150 yuan – equivalent to EUR 15 – which leaves them far below the extreme poverty line as calculated by the UN.</p>

<p>The Commission shares the Honourable Members' concerns regarding leprosy and tuberculosis in China.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis remains the number one cause of death from infectious disease in adults in China. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, China has the world's second largest tuberculosis epidemic, second only to India, with more than 1.3 million new cases of tuberculosis every year.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, following the oubreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), China has demonstrated a strong commitment to confront tuberculosis and other communicable diseases, including by a large increase in domestic funding.</p>
<p>As a result, China now ranks second on the list of countries which have scaled up directy observed therapy short course (DOTS) coverage and has reached the global tuberculosis targets of 70% case detection and 85% treatment success by the end of 2005. It should however be noted that, treatment for drug- and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is not yet widely available and China must also confront the challenge of tuberculosis among internal migrants, ensuring that all patients are diagnosed, treated and reported.</p>
<p>The EC currently funds the EU-China Social Security Project with an EC contribution of € 20 million. This major project, which has been implemented since 2006, is supporting the modernisation and cost efficiency of the social sectors, including medical insurance systems at the central government level and in six pilot provinces. The project is, through improved models for medical insurance schemes, expected to have a considerable impact on the social protection of the poorest populations of China.</p>
<p>China has not yet been able to achieve the important public health goal of eliminating leprosy. According to the WHO, new cases of leprosy in China ranged between 1400-1660 annually from 2002-2005. However, by 2005 case detection rates have improved and first level sub-national elimination has been achieved in China.</p>
<p>The EC has funded a specific project (with EC funding of € 0.5million) on leprosy in Guanxi province completed a few years ago, implemented by Handicap International.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is funding a research project entitled "Tuberculosis China" which organizes the analysis of a large collection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from the 31 provinces of China. This will produce knowledge of the diversity of Chinese TB strains. The project aims to increase collaboration with Chinese scientists and transfer of technical knowledge, and collect the data in a shared-database and produce population analyses. Technical knowledge will be transmitted to Chinese laboratories.</p>

Therefore, in principle the project referred to by the Honourable Members could be eligible for co-financing by the ERDF.</p>

The Commission justified its refusal on the grounds that the 3rd CSF already incorporates a similar project run by the Greek Ktimatologio A.E. concerning the demarcation of forests and forest ecosystems.
