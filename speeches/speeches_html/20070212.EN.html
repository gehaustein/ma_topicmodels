The problem, though, is vast, and our fellow Member was right to point that out. He made a valid point when he asked the Council and Commission to make a statement. As I understand it, we have to hold a debate on Wednesday evening, and neither the Council nor the Commission will be present or provide a statement. We will be thrashing things out among ourselves, and that will, of course, be very unfortunate.

The Russian political elite is watching carefully to see whether or not the European Union will unite to stand behind one of its members. I am convinced that the time for the European Union to grasp the nettle, to state its position and to deploy effective instruments to resolve this dispute is long overdue.

Contrary to the EU’s nature protection directives, the Polish authorities gave permission for the Via Baltica road to be built. The plan is for it to go right through a Natura 2000 area in one of Europe’s genuinely unique areas of natural beauty. This happened in spite of the fact that, back in December, the European Commission sent a letter of formal notice to Poland. Now, the green light has been given for contractors to begin felling 20 000 trees this week. It is scandalous that the authorities of an EU country should be consciously infringing EU legislation. It is not only appalling for the natural environment, it also in fact undermines legal certainty and the EU’s reputation and may become a slippery slope whereby environmental legislation and environmental considerations are set aside as people see fit. I therefore very much hope that the Commission will live up to its responsibilities, follow up its letter of formal notice as quickly as possible and put a stop to what Poland has set in motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, the comments from President Barroso with regard to the holding of referenda on the draft constitution. His inference was that countries might consider not holding referenda. Well, coming from a country where a referendum must be held on these issues, I find this extremely puzzling to say the least. On the one hand we have Commissioner Wallström talking about plan ‘D’ for democracy and dialogue and debate and engaging our citizens; on the other hand we have the comments from President Barroso. At the end of the day, are we supposed just to inform and consult and debate and discuss with our citizens, but not to trust them when it comes to voting?</p>
<p class="contents">The other issue I wish to highlight is that a bill is currently being debated in the Irish Parliament that would give sweeping and retrospective powers to ministers to create indictable offences in order to comply with European legislation. In this context, the directly-elected Irish Parliament would be bypassed. So, on the one hand we are bypassing citizens; on the other hand bypassing national parliaments.

Under this law, no radio frequency may be allocated to broadcasts in a foreign language. The termination of BBC broadcasting has caused great disappointment among Slovak citizens, all the more for the fact that the current government has been emphasising the need to improve foreign language education, of which the BBC was a model.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the culture ministry too realises how absurd such regulations are, it is planning to impose stricter controls and sanctions, rather than coming up with a positive solution. The free movement of services is one of the basic principles of the European Union, and information dissemination cannot be made conditional upon the language in which the information is conveyed. This case proves that the language law in question does not comply with the principles of cultural and linguistic diversity or the values of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fifty-seven states signed it and I congratulate them. I regret that my own country, Ireland, was not among them.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 50 000 people have been disappeared by governments over the last 25 years. Forty thousand of them are still missing and their families do not know if they are dead or alive. It is astonishing to me that only eight EU Member States signed last week, given that it was agreed last November, following five years of negotiations and a twenty-year campaign.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also worrying reports that the United States and some EU Member States are going to refuse to sign this Treaty. The reason I am raising it here, Mr President, is that I would ask you to have the Commission and the Council clarify in this House that all EU Member States are committed to this Treaty and will sign it without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

True, the accused states, for example the Czech Republic and Poland, have often raised their voices recently on behalf of Cuban democracy. However, their efforts can only be crowned with success if the European Union takes a united stand in defence of the island state’s democratic forces. Even in the midst of its own reforms, the EU has to find a way to lend support to those dissenters, inside as well as outside of Cuba, who are raising their voices ever more loudly.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the role of Europe in the world will be defined not only by its economic performance but by its commitment, expressed in actions, to the cause of freedom. Though hundreds are still in prison for political reasons, in my opinion the Fidel Castro brand of socialist dictatorship is already on its last legs. But for this to herald the advent of democracy, the international community, including the European Union, must stand up unambiguously for fundamental freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know for a fact that this is not the sexiest issue we have ever discussed here, and given the highly technical content, everyone assumed that an agreement at first reading was on the cards. This was, however, overlooking the fact that some Member States were dead set against any form of harmonisation of spatial environmental information, and that were, above all, also concerned about compensation and licences and saw this initiative as a threat to national monopolies. No fewer than five Council presidencies had INSPIRE listed as a priority, but it was the Finnish Presidency that managed, during the night of 21 November 2006, to persuade the Member States to end their resistance. I should also like to take this opportunity of warmly thanking everyone who has done their bit to achieve this success, not least the Commissioner and his staff. They have done much of the groundwork, in tandem with an international team of experts that has responded with particular enthusiasm, as a result of which no time has been lost. I should also like to make a point of thanking the shadow rapporteurs and their staff, Parliament’s Legal Office, the Secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the conciliation secretariat, the Council presidency and all their staff.</p>
<p class="contents">Having discussed the procedure, I should now like to turn to the content. As you know, INSPIRE seeks to set up an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe in an attempt to assist environmental policy at every level. Everyone will be agreed that sound policy can only be adopted on the basis of information that is reliable and of the highest quality. When drafting fresh policy measures, policy makers must allow for the fact that problems that affect today’s quality of life have become ever more intertwined and complex. The areas to which the Sixth Environmental Programme gives attention are this reliable knowledge along with informed participation on the part of the public. The directive that we hope to approve tomorrow sets down the objectives, and the Member States now have two years to fine-tune their national legislation and administrative procedures. In other words, by the next European elections, INSPIRE will be a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> and will be based on the existing infrastructure for spatial data of the different Member States. After all, via a geo-portal, INSPIRE will offer Member States the opportunity of making all geographical databases available as a first step towards harmonisation. This idea, which everyone obviously welcomes as such, was, however, the cause of heated discussions within some Member States that were anxious to protect their returns on the sale of geographical data, but also with regard to access to information, wanted to impose stricter restrictions than provided for in the Treaty of Aarhus. It is precisely these two latter challenges that have prevented Parliament from reaching agreement with the Council at second reading. I should like to repeat to the House that I am delighted that during the conciliation procedure, we managed to ensure that in general, services for searching and consulting spatial information must be made available free of charge. Only if the conditions are clearly formulated can compensation be applied for so as not to jeopardise the financial viability of some government services.</p>
<p class="contents">As for intellectual property rights, Parliament has decided to impose the provisions of the Treaty of Aarhus concerning access to information in environmental matters to the letter and thus not to admit any stricter restrictions on the basis of confidentiality, in line with the Council’s request. I think we have struck an honourable compromise, and I hope that tomorrow, Parliament will be supporting this agreement unanimously so that implementation can really start in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add a brief comment about the scope of applications. This is virtually inexhaustible once the loopholes have been plugged and inconsistencies between European geographical databases have been resolved, which at the moment, often make planning impossible and, in certain cases, even cause chaos. The system as it stands is essential to improve and manage the water quality in Europe. The information collected can also help prevent and control floods.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I would go so far as to say that INSPIRE is a valuable addition to existing environmental legislation in the European Union, and we will follow its transposition in the Member States from close range and with much interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my warmest thanks to the parliamentary delegation involved in the compromise proceedings with the Council on 21 November 2006. In particular, I should like to thank and congratulate Mr Vidal-Quadras, who headed the parliamentary delegation and, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Brepoels, whom I should like to praise and thank in particular for her exceptional contribution to the discussions throughout the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have secured a sound basis on which to build an integrated infrastructure for spatial information in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We need this infrastructure for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, good legislative arrangements are based on good information. Good information means integrated analyses of the environmental problems we face, the reasons for them and the possible repercussions of various solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">These analyses depend on geographical data. At the moment, our policy making is hampered by the fact that these data are scattered over various databases which are difficult to access. In addition, different data storage rules are used, with the result that it is impossible to combine them with other data, which would facilitate policymaking.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that we managed to overcome the final difficulties and reach a satisfactory result. The Commission approves the text of the compromise unreservedly and I would like to urge Parliament to accept the good result achieved by its negotiating team. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Finnish Presidency also deserves credit for the conciliation process.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the Community’s environment policy is largely dependent on the availability of scientific information and the smooth flow of such information. So this proposal for a directive, which has come about through conciliation, and which will establish a legal framework for establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe, is a precondition for scientific evaluations carried out on the basis of environmental legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">At various stages of the debate on INSPIRE, the main aim was to remove some of the barriers that in particular hamper the shared use of environmental data among authorities. In conciliation, general agreement was reached on the principles enabling authorities and other Community bodies to use cartographic and other special data within the scope of this directive and now in the possession of other authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">A good end result was also achieved with regard to public access to information. In the future, a wider range of Internet services relating to the environment will be available. These services, meant for the general public, will in most cases be free.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be permitted to charge for rapidly changing information, such as certain weather information services. Even before INSPIRE, the Community used certain instruments to enable it first to promote the accessibility of reliable information, especially information on the public sector, and later on to harmonise information in order to make comparisons possible at Community level. One of them is the Directive on Public Access to Environmental Information, for which I was rapporteur. The problems noticed during the debate on this have been taken into account in preparing INSPIRE, and I would like to thank everyone warmly for that. All in all, the directive will create a sound and viable basis for developing spatial information infrastructures in the European Community and making it possible to maintain quality data and services in the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe the result to be positive, thanks to the work of this House, which has improved it considerably, to the efforts that the Commission has made in helping us – I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Sornosa – and also, lastly, to the understanding of the Council in the Conciliation Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I have absolutely no doubt about the usefulness of this proposal as a fundamental tool for drawing up, applying, monitoring and evaluating environmental policies at all levels and policies or activities which may directly or indirectly affect the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we believe that it is appropriate to base this Community infrastructure on the spatial data infrastructures already established and managed by the Member States, in full application of the principle of subsidiarity, particularly when the Member States have several levels of public administration, as is often the case, in my country, Spain, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Network services are necessary in order to share spatial data across the various levels of public authority in the Community. Those services must make it possible to locate, process, view and download spatial data, and also to access spatial data and electronic commerce services.</p>
<p class="contents">This instrument must serve to exploit as far as possible the benefits and possibilities that the globalisation of data and services offer to governments, to private enterprise, to universities, to society as a whole and, most importantly, to the citizens. I believe that it is essential because it brings us up to date with something that is already common as a result of the Internet and the information that it provides.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that it is crucial that it has been designed as an instrument for providing public information. In this regard, we hope that INSPIRE complements public sector information and the directives on access to environmental information adopted in application of the Aarhus Convention, which we approved recently, and that it deal with a series of issues not provided for in those directives, such as the sharing of data amongst public authorities and issues of interoperability.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must express my satisfaction with the agreement reached by the Council with regard to free-of-charge access to the service, in the majority of cases, as well as the chapter relating to the confidentiality of data, which in the end will coincide with the provisions laid down in the Aarhus Convention, on public access to information on the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Waste policies play a fundamental role in reducing the environmental impact of the use of natural resources. The primary aims of the thematic strategy and the draft directive are to prevent waste generation and, insofar as it cannot be prevented, to minimise the effects on the environment and public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last thirty years, the European Union has developed important waste policies and legislation in the aim of protecting public health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's aim in the recent review of the directive on waste is to bring the legislative framework into line with current environmental challenges. The updated policy takes account of the progress made in the field of ecological innovation and supports our state-of-the-art knowledge of the sustainable use of natural resources. The proposed package of measures is designed to:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, reduce the environmental impact of waste during its entire life cycle;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, make the prevention of waste generation a priority. This effort requires action at national, regional and local level. The Member States must apply waste generation prevention policies through mandatory national programmes. This is expected to help reverse the current trend towards increased quantities of waste. Similarly, targets at national level will help to reduce the quantities of waste at Community level;</p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly, promote recycling by setting standards which safeguard the quality of recyclable materials. This will foster confidence in recycled materials and increase the demand for them on the internal market. We propose that this should be done using criteria to determine when recovered waste loses its status as waste;</p>
<p class="contents">- fourthly, the proposed measures even aim to modernise and simplify legislation on waste. Certain definitions are clarified which in the past were a source of difficulty and contradictory interpretation. The aim of the strategy and the directive is to achieve a balance, to maintain what has proven to work over the last 30 years and, at the same time, to modernise the legislative framework for coming decades.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to make two important comments on the framework directive on waste:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, the text which emerges from the codecision procedure needs to be clear and to provide security of law. Some of the amendments tabled do not safeguard this legal clarity, especially those concerning the distinction between recovery and disposal;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, if the legislative act in question is to be environmentally effective, it must retain its character as a framework directive. In other words, it must be a stable and clear legal framework which, at the same time, will provide adequate flexibility, so that it can adapt to changing needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Caroline Jackson (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">. –</span> Madam President, it is nice to see you in the Chair! This directive is a very important successor to the first framework directive and it dates me because I can remember the 1975 waste framework directive going through Parliament. People were rather surprised to find Europe dealing with waste at all at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the likely longevity of such a measure, it is important that we get it right. We do not want a repeat, as the Commissioner has said, of what happened recently where recourse to the European Court of Justice for clarification has sometimes produced judgments that are confusing, contradictory and just plain bizarre. Legislators, not judges, should make laws.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all this is a directive which is very important in defining terms. The Commission has produced a number of definitions, which we have amended and added to. Many of these changes were the subject of general agreement in the committee in compromise amendments. I make no apology for believing that this plenary stage offers us the chance to fine tune these suggestions, as I and others have done. For example, in the committee we failed to find a definition of by-products, which is a vital issue. I think Parliament should have a proposal to vote on and so I have submitted an amendment for a new Article 3a defining by-products. The same sort of gap affects the issue of bio-waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have spent much time defining the waste hierarchy. This is often referred to, but until now has not been defined in any EU legal text. The committee preferred the five-stage waste hierarchy to the Commission’s rather muddled, flatter version. The problem is how to establish that the hierarchy should not be used as a rigid requirement, but should be seen as a flexible but general principle. The committee opted for life-cycle assessment and cost-benefit analyses as the essential background to any departure from the hierarchy. I believe that to be too bureaucratic, and a PPE-DE amendment proposes a more realistic, but still demanding, alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we grappled with the issue of how one defines when waste ceases to be a waste. This gave us the opportunity to indicate through this directive which items should be given priority by the Commission, if necessary by drawing up specifications to define when they cease to be waste. We proposed seven items, but did not support a proposal that solid recovered fuel should be on the list. In the view of the committee that remains waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the question of the energy efficiency criteria, which, if met by a particular energy from a waste plant, would allow that plant to be categorised as a recovery and not a disposal operation. This seems to me an eminently sensible idea. Such a designation has environmental and commercial advantages. The criteria for designation as a recovery operation need to be high enough to be something of a gold standard, which, if adopted, would mean that anyone thinking of buying or building a new incinerator would have to meet it.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee adopted an amendment accepting the principle that energy from waste could qualify as recovery, but they moved the definition from the annex into Article 19. Such a move creates problems. It would mean that compliance with the formula became a permanent requirement, possibly leading to the immediate compulsory closure of all non-compliant plants, which would be an absurd development. In the light of this, the PPE-DE Group and other groups have tabled amendments to put the formula back where it belongs, in the annex.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this is a directive that mainly defines terms, we felt it should address the issue of waste prevention. It is no good the EU being a world leader in waste terminology if it continues to be a world leader in waste generation. I am therefore proud that, at my suggestion, Parliament’s amendments contain for the first time a proposal for an EU commitment to stabilise overall waste production by 2012 at the levels which it reached in 2008. Given that the volume of waste the EU produces is increasing every year, this is an important first step and I do hope that the Commission and Member States will support it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two comments on amendments from colleagues. I note that some colleagues want EU-wide recycling targets. I think this is a mistake. Recycling is an important practice that each country has to tackle in its own way within the overall imperative of the landfill directive and its reduction targets. Apart from anything else we need to establish the carbon efficiency of recycling before we promote it as the best answer to our waste problems. I note that some Members want to restrict what can be landfilled on the basis that this is what works in their own country and that this allows them to have good recycling and low landfill figures. Well, they need to talk to their eastern European neighbours. They complain now that they are receiving huge amounts of German waste. Whatever else it means, recycling does not mean throwing your waste over the national boundary fence and hoping for the best.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can soon make progress on this directive with the Council, but the recent history of waste directives teaches us that it is better to get it right than to rush to early adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Johannes Blokland (IND/DEM), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, it is with gratitude that I take on the task of enlarging on the waste strategy report, which met with unanimous support in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Before I do so, though, I should like to thank my fellow Members for their good cooperation and the unanimous support that I just mentioned. One could almost be forgiven for thinking that waste is not a controversial issue in this House. The objective of the resolution adopted by the Committee on the Environment is to give clear direction to future waste policy, the core goal of which is to protect the environment and public health. The Committee on the Environment is largely agreed on the guiding principles in this respect, namely the precautionary principle, the 'polluter pays' principle, self-sufficiency, proximity and producer responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I have to say, however, that these principles were generally ignored when the report was fleshed out further. Allow me to demonstrate this with an example. There is broad agreement on the five-steps of waste hierarchy which comprises prevention, re-use, recycling, recovery and, as a last resort, removal. This waste hierarchy is included in both Mrs Jackson’s report and my own. However, amendments have been tabled that mean that the waste hierarchy has become so flexible that one could completely circumvent it. I would argue in favour of holding firm to the provision in paragraph 16 of the resolution, namely that the waste hierarchy can only be deviated from if a certified life cycle analysis clearly demonstrates that this protects the environment more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is that of changing the definitions. The main reason for changing a definition is to change its wording for the better or to do the environment a favour. Changing definitions is not meant to make it easier to achieve objectives, to improve one’s image or to be able to corner the market. I should like to quote two important examples of this, namely by-products and the difference between recovery and removal.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to by-products first, according to paragraph 10 of the resolution, we have to be very careful about declassifying waste. If something is no longer waste, it no longer falls within the environmentally-protecting waste legislation, in which case waste can be transported anywhere. Creating a new category of so-called by-products constitutes an additional risk. It is not clear under which regime this falls and the use, or misuse, of this category is set to rise astronomically.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to removal versus recovery, the discussion about the difference between recovery and removal has been going on for years. The discussion mainly revolves around the question as to when incineration of mainly household waste can be considered recovery. The intention has always been to arrive at a clear distinction. The opinion of the Committee on the Environment is included in paragraphs 12 to 14 of the resolution. Waste intended for energy recovery or incineration must in any event meet the emission standards of the Waste Incineration Directive. The Committee on the Environment also takes the view that the same environmental standards must apply to waste incineration and waste co-incineration, in other words, equal emission standards and equal criteria for energy efficiency. In addition, I have reached the conclusion that it is always better to consider waste incineration as removal. The objective of waste incineration is always removal. This achieves the necessary clarity and is in keeping with judgments of the European Court of Justice. The final point, as formulated in paragraph 31 of the resolution, is a ban on dumping waste that can be incinerated and waste that can be re-used and recycled.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to call on the Commission to take paragraph 30 of the resolution seriously. This is about the long awaited proposals for directives on organic waste, building and demolition waste and sludge waste. This has been in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme since 2002, and it is high time the Commission launched these proposals so that we can create a well regulated recycling society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the one hand, she has listened to everybody and to all of the countries, she has listened to industry, but she has also listened to those most directly affected, and, on the other, she has tried to take a flexible and open approach, so that the Directive on waste should not become a problem but rather that it should resolve the existing problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous legislation has to a large extent resolved problems, but it has also created problems that have led the Court of Justice to issue more judgments in the field of waste that in any other area. It has also created a huge problem for municipalities, which, at the end of the day, have to apply the rules, which are small, which vary hugely throughout Europe and which number many hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore applaud your flexibility and support you fully. I also support and welcome Amendment 112, on biodegradable waste, because we are trying to create a society in which we try to minimise the use of resources and, at the same time, take the greatest possible advantage of what we are using through recycling and recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Compost, that is, what in Spanish we call ‘<span class="italic">abono</span>’, from waste, is one of the Earth’s most ancient forms of recycling. It is also one of the forms of waste that is essential because it is the only 'ecological' way to fertilise the soil, to enrich a soil that is poor in organic material.</p>
<p class="contents">I am the rapporteur for the Directive on waste and I am in favour of this amendment in particular, because, until there is a specific directive, and there must be one, for biodegradable waste, until a Directive on compost is created, which for the moment is not in prospect nor part of the European Commission’s strategy — which has left it to one side in this policy of less legislation — this issue must be given a framework with a view to creating more discipline in the purification of waste and also so that farmers can use this resource with full confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much and I believe that flexibility is something that we can only afford where there is viability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the interest so many people and organisations have shown during this first reading in terms of both the strategy and review of the directive demonstrates that waste offers many opportunities. Although waste is increasingly seen as a valuable source of raw material, it also remains a problem. As we heard today, the total amount is on the increase; too little waste is being reused or recycled; existing legislation is often implemented ineffectively and there are also major discrepancies in how the waste problem is addressed in the different Member States. As I see it, there is no doubt that whilst this review contains positive steps towards reducing the harmful effects of waste processing on the environment and health – such as, for example, the five-steps hierarchy, waste prevention programmes for the Member States, a better definition of a number of concepts, criteria to distinguish products from waste, the introduction of the proximity principle, the ban on mixing waste with a view to diluting it and obviously a procedure to clarify when waste stops being waste – many bottle necks remain. Commissioner, Amendment 85, for example, springs to mind which states that landfills where gas is extracted may be considered recovery. This is, as I see it, diametrically opposed to the policy to phase out the dumping of biodegradable waste. I also take the view that Amendments 81 and 82 should not provide for scrapping, precisely because Amendment 39 refers to the ban on incineration at sea. In addition, Amendment 26, where reference is made to the definition of ‘recovery of energy’ should be deleted, in my view, since otherwise, many incineration installations would fall within the scope of recovery, and a free market would be created for waste incineration. This would be completely at odds with the proximity principle, which is, in turn, also very important if we want to achieve a high recycling level. Finally, I do not think there is a place for the introduction of energy efficiency criteria here. This should, instead, be seen in conjunction with a review of the Waste Incineration Directive. A thorough impact study has not been done either.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must also certainly ensure that some provisions do not result in achievements attained in some Member States being pared down or that the present policy efforts are being cancelled out. Flanders, the region from which I come, is a European trailblazer in reuse and recycling, and would be affected by this. These high figures are possible only if the local authorities are involved, and also if a number of flanking measures, such as levies and dumping bans, are taken. The Flemish earth-moving regulation, for example, is also liable to suffer by keeping out unpolluted excavated soil from the directive. Different Member States will, in any case, end up with different interpretations where cross-border transports are concerned. I would like to hear what the Commissioner has to say in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They led us by the hand, so to speak, to reach a consensus supported by a huge majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and to achieve a result that was by no means a foregone conclusion at the outset: improving the consistency of two documents, one on the recycling strategy and the other on the proposed review of the waste framework directive, which are now more consistent than the Commission's original documents.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I very much appreciated the way in which Mrs Jackson conducted the discussions with us shadow rapporteurs, which allowed us to resolve almost all the problems consensually. That is why I felt rather surprised and also a little hurt, Mrs Jackson, when I saw you had tabled some amendments on behalf of your group that called these agreements into question on one particular point. That places us in a difficult or, I might say, embarrassing position.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at the priorities. First of all, a highly positive point is that we prioritised the prevention of waste generation much more than the Commission had done: we defined it better and laid down a target for stabilising it by 2012, together with a whole raft of practical monitoring measures. Secondly, there is a point that I am going to fight for to the bitter end, Mrs Jackson. We defined and specifically laid down a five-step hierarchy. Just as in a hierarchy, first you do one thing and only then the second, third and so on, namely prevention, re-use, recycling, recovery and lastly disposal. We did not rule out the possibility of departing from this hierarchy, but we tied the possibility to strict evaluation criteria, starting with cost/benefit analysis throughout the life cycle of consumer goods. I am therefore somewhat astounded that you are now calling this solution bureaucratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is a problem that we did not resolve through our compromises and that we must now resolve by putting it to the vote in this Chamber, even though the Committee on the Environment did find what I believe is a good solution: we cannot undermine the hierarchy by regarding energy recovery as recovery, since it is actually disposal. By doing so we would straight away undermine the hierarchy and risk creating undue competition with renewable energies. Let me be quite clear: this is not an ideological rejection of incineration and energy recovery, but I too very much agree with Mrs Brepoels that reaching a definition on this subject should be left to a more appropriate forum.</p>
<p class="contents">Is a review of the incineration directive planned? Well, I think that would be the best place to define the issue of energy recovery, and in that respect I have therefore tabled Amendment 136, which I regard as highly reasonable. We should not fill this directive with too many problems, so let us examine the issue more calmly and with some in-depth technical input.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I too should like to make a stand on the subject of bio-waste. The subject of composting has been put off for too long, but it is a strategic element in a recycling society and I do not see why we should not at last provide an opportunity for this option, on which there has been agreement for some time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are aiming for a balanced approach that takes account both of the consequences of the increase in waste generation, that is to say its risk factors in relation to the environment and human health, and of the demands for the growing market in new waste management technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the waste hierarchy, we support, in principle, the separate collection of waste and recycling in all locations where it is financially and environmentally efficient. However, we also support the efficient management of other types of waste that cannot be recovered or recycled.</p>
<p class="contents">We have found that those Member States which are most successful in reducing their dependency on waste landfills have achieved this objective through a combination of recycling, biological waste treatment – that is to say composting – and energy recovery, with the proviso that specialised plants must comply with demanding criteria as regards emissions of gaseous pollutants. If they meet these criteria, they should be given the opportunity to be recognised as energy recovery plants instead of ending up at the bottom of the waste management hierarchy, at the same level as landfills.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunity of achieving R1 status would motivate these plants to become energy efficient, something that is also in accordance with the European plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. Our proposal for Amendment 133 provides for a compromise solution which complements the Commission’s initial formula with the conclusions of the discussion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We link the hierarchy to the product life-cycle criteria. If we were to introduce that line of thinking, it would contribute to the sustainability of resources and raw materials. This is an approach that is not only aware of the harmful effects and risks to the environment caused by waste, but also the potential preservation of natural resources. However, life-cycle assessments should be coupled with a cost-benefit analysis that will guide operators when choosing appropriate courses of action.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say that much progress has been achieved in waste management in recent years, in the past decades we might say. The technology is improving and the costs are gradually falling, so there is no sense in dismantling procedures that have been tried and tested. This has led our group to prepare draft amendments on the definition of recycling and on the two directives on waste oils and hazardous waste that will no longer be in force. I can say that we also fully support the ideas expressed today by Commissioner Dimas on the need for legal clarity, because that too is one of our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Court of Justice is indeed a very important institution; however our objective must be to take charge of the legislative work and allow the Court to rule only in borderline cases that arise in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, would like to congratulate both rapporteurs, Mrs Jackson and Mr Blockland for their sound work and cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We complain all the time of the lack of engagement between the European Union and its citizens. Through this legislative proposal the EU is demonstrating its leadership and assistance to Member States, addressing the snowballing problem of waste and its environmental and health impact, while further jump-starting a sector that is already providing upwards of two million jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">As our economies modernise in our respective countries across the Union, we are simultaneously producing 1.3 billion tonnes of waste annually, some 40 million tonnes of which is hazardous. Decoupling waste generation from economic growth is vital, otherwise, according to the OECD, we face, at our current rate, the generation of 45% more waste than in 1995. Prevention is key, and to succeed in this we need to involve all stakeholders, producers and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States will now be obliged to provide waste-management and waste-prevention plans, focusing policymakers at EU, national and local level on prevention, thereby triggering an increase in waste-prevention policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety calling for binding targets to stabilise waste production at anticipated 2008 levels by 2012 and calling for greater reuse and recycling to reduce pressure on landfill sites.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to engage with the citizens – producers and consumers are equally important. We need to make citizens aware of their current and possible future impact in the reduction, reuse and recycling of waste. Community and local authority recycling facilities need to be practically located and accessible for maximum impact. Our citizens are becoming more conscious of the environment and it is up to us, the politicians, to lead them. The success of the plastic-bag levy in Ireland is an obvious example. Now we need to work together to make prevention a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of moving ahead to focus on prevention, reuse and recycling, it was in fact a step backwards: a worrying combination of no action or targets on preventing, reusing and recycling, plenty of legal loopholes for unscrupulous operators and the promotion of incineration, sending out completely the wrong message.</p>
<p class="contents">We had very good cooperation between the shadow rapporteurs leading up to the committee vote and we agreed on many compromise amendments and although it did not go as far as we wanted, it moved the proposal ahead to such an extent that the Verts/ALE Group withdrew our amendment rejecting the Commission proposal outright. Our group could vote for the report tomorrow if this Parliament upholds the position of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety but I fear that will not be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The basis of the whole waste strategy must be the binding five-step waste hierarchy of prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery and disposal. It is essential to have national prevention programmes with Europe-wide measures and targets. Prevention has been talked about an awful lot since the first directive back in 1975 but we have seen very little action and we have heard many excuses for not doing it. That is why we welcome the target of stabilisation of waste by 2012. It is not as far as we would like to go; it is weaker than our original proposal; but we will accept that to ensure that prevention programmes with binding targets do come forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support EU-wide recycling targets. A 50% recycling level for municipal waste and 70% for construction, demolition, industrial and manufacturing waste by 2020 is perfectly achievable and realistic. And as everything cannot and should not be included in this one framework directive, we also want the Commission to bring forward proposals on specific waste streams before the end of 2008, and, in the case of biodegradable waste, by the end of 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">But the key issue for us in this directive is incineration. Reclassifying waste incineration as energy recovery would completely undermine measures on preventing and recycling. Yes, we have to move away from landfill, that is a legal obligation already. But incineration is not the answer. It is blatantly contradictory to endorse a five-step hierarchy and then upgrade and give incentives to the lowest level of that hierarchy. A recent report showed that incineration is not green energy or safe waste disposal. We should not participate in the ‘greenwashing’ of incineration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it should be noted that the most frequently disputed topic at the European Court of Justice is environmental legislation, a substantial portion of which concerns waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, I support the rapporteur in her efforts to prevent extensive comitology. On the other hand, the framework directive is so important for the Union that for all of the articles referred to, namely Articles 5, 11 and 21, it is necessary to insist on the codecision procedure. It would be desirable to re-classify waste incineration as a form of recycling, rather than a form of disposal, which is how it is categorised at present. Recycling also reduces our dependence on primary raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to improve border controls so that some Member States do not become landfills for others. We are very well aware that for many people waste management offers the lure of very lucrative but illegal business opportunities. However, I have a reservation concerning Amendment 70, which modifies Article 30 of the directive, aiming to remove specific qualitative and, especially, quantitative indicators from the waste management programmes of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to lower the volume of waste, quantitative indicators are essential. A decrease in volume does not automatically mean that the most hazardous waste will be eliminated. Excessive flexibility within the programmes, or inaccurate and vaguely defined objectives, will not result in the desired outcome, and will certainly be abused by Member States. This is certain to happen since the directive leaves it up to the Member States to achieve results. Waste management programmes must also include quantitative indicators; otherwise the programmes will not be ambitious enough. At the same time, I agree with the rapporteur that the Member States should have their programmes in place within 18 months of the directive coming into effect. It seems to me that three years, as suggested by the Commission, is too long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that recovery needs to be unambiguously defined, although there may still be further fine tuning needed after we vote tomorrow, and that the energy efficiency criteria (which should be in the annex) to determine whether municipal waste incinerators should be classified as recovery or disposal operations are a realistic and logical contribution to Europe’s waste and energy challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that it is of critical importance for the environment and for human health that municipal waste incinerators conform to gold standards and use best available technology. The debate is ongoing as to whether the efficiency criteria should be included or not, and at what levels they should be set. Waste is a resource and an energy source, and we must not exclude ways to use it as such after the five-step hierarchy.</p>
<p class="contents">The wording of the Commission text and that of the latest PPE-DE Group amendment referred to energy efficiency criteria as being ‘equal to or above’ the stated levels.

The intention was good, but the legislative proposal is unequal to the challenges and is well below the objectives that must be attained.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures proposed in relation to the prevention of waste and, thus, to the reduction of the volumes produced are not very practical, and none are binding. Equally, I regret the absence of quantified targets for recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission proposals on hazardous waste are inadequate when compared with the Community legislation in force. The objective of merging the texts in order to simplify them and to improve their implementation must not mean the provisions on the treatment of hazardous waste being toned down. When it comes to waste, no toning down can be tolerated, and even less so when the waste is hazardous. Recent events encourage us to be vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">When hazardous waste is mixed with other waste, it does not become any less dangerous. Equally, we cannot support the possibility of derogations from the obligation to hold an operating permit when having to deal with hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the concept of using waste as an energy source, I understand the aim, but it is dangerous to confuse energy exploitation with energy recovery. There is nothing stopping us from recovering energy generated during incineration operations even if incineration is classed as a disposal operation. This is a point requiring clarification. A proposal such as this, which enables incineration to be classed as a recovery operation and no longer just as a disposal operation, puts waste recovery and energy recovery on the same footing. Above all, though, it contradicts the five-step hierarchy adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and, by extension, the objective of preventing and reducing the production of waste. This objective is backed by Mrs Jackson’s report, which significantly enhances the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The waste issue is a considerable challenge for society, one that warrants ambitious legislation. An increasing number of surveys show us that a large majority of consumers want more environmentally-friendly products, and want to be better informed of the nature and quality of those products. We must listen to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say, though, that the impression I got from the way the first reading went was that this House is engaged in doing the opposite of what we originally sought to achieve by revising this legislation, that is to say, simplifying European law on waste and making it less bureaucratic. What is needed in the application of the hierarchy of waste is flexibility, a flexibility that is necessary if economically and ecologically reasonable flows of waste are to be made a practical possibility. What I would say to Mr Sacconi, who is unfortunately currently leaving the Chambers, is that life-cycle analyses are a bureaucratic business, and, rather than in practice ensuring the flexible management of the hierarchy, will have precisely the opposite effect. Contrary to our aim of avoiding waste, they produce superfluous paper.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that people have very considerable reservations about a flexible hierarchy of waste, but taking a look at the practice of modern waste management will help to reduce them; new technical processes have brought new solutions with them, and we should not use the revision of a law to make tried and tested practices illegal; there is no longer any reason not to treat recycling and the use of waste as an energy source as being of equivalent value. If you really want resources to be better used and lifecycles to be managed, you have to abandon your ideological blinkers.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just add something about autarky. There is, in principle, no place in environmental legislation for market regulations, which are, both ecologically and environmentally, counterproductive in their effects. It is regrettable that it is in the field of environmental legislation that we avail ourselves of the internal market or dispense with it as we please. This is not about the prevention of waste tourism but about seeking, through Europe-wide competition, those solutions that work best both environmentally and economically. It is a lamentable and obvious fact that, in the current debate about the autarky principle, national and regional interests take precedence over everything else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it does appear that we should clearly define ‘waste’ as the residues from manufacturing processes that cannot be re-used as raw materials or as input in other manufacturing processes at the present stage of technological development. Although a great deal of waste can be re-used in this way, there is unfortunately a large proportion that cannot. This includes the bulk of the waste from chemical processes, two examples of which I would like to draw to your attention.</p>
<p class="contents">The first are chlorides, which are produced in the manufacture of phosphor-based fertiliser. There are whole mountains of chlorides, which the wind disperses and which cause acid rain in places such as Scandinavia. There are at least two such manufacturing sites in Poland, near Szczecin and near Gdańsk. And how many are there in the entire European Union, in Ukraine, in Russia?</p>
<p class="contents">The second are ‘hot spots’, of which there are a number in the European Union, including one in Jaworznia near Krakow. More than 150 000 tonnes of waste are created by a nearby factory, which manufactures plant protection agents. At one time it also manufactured cyclon B. The chemical compounds are washed away by water, and the effluent has poisoned the nearby river and the ground to depths of tens of metres. We do not know how to dispose of this and other waste, or what to do with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Environmental Protection Agency and research institutes to become more involved in developing methods of eliminating chemical waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Waste management is complex and raises the question – implicitly, of course – of our ability to respect not only the environment and people’s health, but also our own European policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1976, we have been developing fairly ineffective common legislation. This second directive, which is a revision of the ‘Waste’ Directive, cannot hide behind the existing provisions, which have just been made simpler. The figures speak for themselves. Volumes of waste continue to increase: 3.5 tonnes are produced per inhabitant per year, which equates to an increase of 460 kg in ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above legislation that can be converted into future provisions, it is important to give Europeans an overall view of the route travelled by our bins. The European hierarchy, founded on five key principles – prevention, sorting, recycling, incineration and disposal – must not be undermined by efforts to promote incineration. Like many citizens living near incineration plants, I am concerned that the Union is not showing itself to be more proactive in terms of waste prevention and recycling, by putting in place genuine sectors for recycling, for example. We must drastically reduce our use of incineration and prevent it from being granted the status of an energy recovery process.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, it is important to develop recycling, so that we attain a rate of 50% of waste managed by local authorities and of 60% of other waste being recycled by 2020, with a gradual reduction in the burying and incineration of all materials that can be re-used, recycled or composted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also draw your attention, Madam President, to the inclusion of the ‘Hazardous waste’ Directive in the new legislation. Hazardous waste must be strictly controlled; it must come under a traceability system and an extremely restrictive authorisation system. We agree on the need to prevent and reduce the impact of waste, Commissioner, but succumbing to the easy option of incineration would be unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, implementing the complex legislation about various waste streams and various methods of recycling contained in the directive will be a difficult task, especially for local councils and small enterprises. Huge amounts of reporting will not solve the problem either. The poorer local councils in the new Member States, which lack experience in separating waste and lack funding, may not manage, and the blanket fines imposed on Member States for non-fulfilment of the provisions of the directive will further impoverish local governments and small and medium-sized enterprises, which will ultimately mean there being even less money for implementing environmental targets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why the Commission is right to concentrate very strongly on the definition of vague legal concepts in the old directive and laid down once and for all a clear definition of what is meant by the disposal of waste. I am glad that a commitment has been made to achieve high levels of energy efficiency when waste has been extracted for use as a source of energy, for what we demand of cars, fridges and many other things we ought also to demand of incineration plants. This certainly is an example of the principle of ‘better regulation’.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the hierarchy as agreed on by the committee as a good move; perhaps I might point out to our good friends in the Greens that it is a five-step scale – not one to be set in concrete, though, but one that also allows mutual flexibility, for even paper must, when it has been recycled seven or eight times, at some point end up in a proper reprocessing or incineration facility.</p>
<p class="contents">I find this talk of autarky very worrying indeed; using autarky as a means of protecting municipal undertakings in Europe is in vogue, yet we need both the small and medium-sized business sector and municipal undertakings as competitors in the same market, and it is good when we manage that. I am much obliged to you, Commissioner, for having given us an undertaking that you would be energetic in taking action against illegal exports outside the European Union, and that is something that will have to be followed up.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say, by way of conclusion – and this I say to Mrs Jackson – that I regret our inability to find a common denominator where the issue of ending the ban on landfill is concerned; it would be best if landfill could be pretty much closed down, for then the recycling really would flow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">49% of urban waste in the EU is deposited in landfill sites. 18% is incinerated and only 33% is taken for recycling or composting. The European Environment Agency predicts that there will be around 40% more paper, glass and plastic waste by 2020. Against this backdrop, the revised Waste Framework Directive should help reduce the environmental and socio-economic impact of waste management, by taking account of the whole lifecycle of products and materials and by attaching priority to protecting human health.</p>
<p class="contents">The reduction, prevention, reuse and recycling of waste should be priority issues. The Commission must take the lead in drawing up an action plan for waste prevention that could act as a source of information for the Member States as they draw up their prevention programmes. The Member States should take measures to stabilise waste production by 2012. For this to happen, manufacturers and importers must take on greater responsibility for the waste generated when their products are placed on the market, pursuant to the polluter pays principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The thematic strategy refers to the need to clarify concepts. To this end, I have tabled two amendments, in which I have sought to clarify the definitions of recovery and elimination of waste, which I trust will be adopted by Parliament. As regards dangerous waste, Parliament recently adopted REACH. It is now up to the Member States to adopt the measures needed for the collection, production and transport of dangerous waste, and for ensuring that the waste is stored and processed in the best possible conditions in terms of safety, environmental protection and public health protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Waste, as we all know, is a major problem of modern day living, and it is greatly worsened by the exaggerated consumerism-based global society we live in. Hence, the most important task is not to find out how best to cope with the waste we generate, but to try to reduce the waste we produce in the first place. However, things being as they are, we have to deal with an effective waste framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Time constraints preclude extensive individual debate. I shall just mention two points. The first is the much-discussed Article 3, and I will say straightaway that I tend to favour the amendment by Mrs Jackson and Mr Florenz regarding the recycling definition, not because I approve of incineration as such but because I believe it is vital to take one step at a time, and it is important to keep the existing recycling industry alive and functioning.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns implementation and monitoring. We all know that many directives are comprehensive enough but, to a large extent, remain good only on paper. We must make sure that the application of this waste directive is effectively monitored and properly implemented in practice.

My fear, though, is that we are now, where waste policy is concerned, taking a step backwards, with the intention being to encourage the burning of waste rather than a hierarchical approach to the recycling of waste. It really would be a portent of doom if we were to fail to make clear our desire to become a society that avoids and recycles waste and instead start making the burning of waste respectable and socially acceptable; it would also do a disservice to the protection of the climate, to which we know this practice would be detrimental.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows, then, that, when we vote, we need to administer an unmistakeable corrective; not only must the burning of waste not be reinterpreted as the generation of energy, but Europe also very definitely needs its own policy on material and product flow. I also hope that we will manage to specify clearly targets for the avoidance and recycling of waste, for it is only by these that we will be able to make it clear that we are striving to go in new directions, and towards new targets, in waste policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are at risk of slowly drowning in our own waste. It is therefore high time we cracked down on it before we literally get in it over our heads. In this respect, it is important to bear in mind that waste has now become a trading product with its own adverse effects to boot. According to physical inspections, one third of the extremely lucrative waste transports are illegal. Fresh, tough policy is therefore called for, but we do have to choose the right methods. The restriction, reuse and recycling of waste are all sustainable options, whereas investing heavily in combustion furnaces, as Mrs Jackson suggests, is going completely the wrong way, both from the point of view of the climate issue and from the point of view of retaining our natural resources.

What I meant was that we should not introduce a new confusing concept called by-product, and that we should not label waste incineration too easily as recovery. Needless to say, the forced and immediate closure of all kinds of combustion furnaces as a result of Amendment 57 is not what I have in mind. I do think, however, that the idea of Amendment 57, namely including criteria for energy efficiency in a licence, can be very beneficial for both the environment and the climate. I would therefore argue in favour of the idea being endorsed, so that it can be further developed and improved.</p>

But, as ever, the answer from Brussels seems to be more legislation. Would it not be more sensible to review the existing laws and make them work before adding new layers of legislation? If legislation is being poorly implemented, if there are different approaches to solving the waste problem, if current wording causes differing interpretations, what will be usefully added by putting in new laws without first streamlining, and ensuring implementation of, the existing legislation? We hear much talk in this House and from the Commission about the simplification of regulation but, frankly, so far little of substance has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, on illegal cross-border shipments of waste, it is vital that the waste source is identified and the ‘polluter pays’ principle rigorously enforced. In my constituency in Northern Ireland, we are afflicted with illegal dumping of waste from our neighbour in the Republic of Ireland. It can and must do more to stop those illegal shipments and it must pay for the damage that has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the export of waste from the EU to developing countries for processing involving methods far less sustainable than those within the EU is something which I think we really need to address. On top of that, the carbon footprint of those exports makes that a practice which should be reversed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am fairly satisfied with the clarification that has been provided with the five-stage hierarchy. What is most important is prevention, which consists in reducing the volume of our waste and which truly requires substantial efforts, and recycling. However, not everything is recyclable. The necessary market still does not exist. Recovery is therefore necessary, for want of other solutions, but it must be matched by high energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">This hierarchy must be a guiding principle, but one that incorporates many parameters, not least local parameters, because it is important to introduce some flexibility by varying, where appropriate, the priorities in line with practical aspects and with the necessary complementarity of management methods.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, I also welcome the inclusion in the report of the producer responsibility principle, on the one hand, and of the control and traceability requirements imposed on hazardous waste, on the other hand, which also cover the provisions governing the granting of the authorisations necessary for treatment plants and the checks on the transport of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to the amendments concerning by-products, I am radically opposed to a definition that would exempt certain types of waste from environmental obligations; this definition would allow types of waste that are considered as by-products to be exempt from legislation on waste and not to be subject to traceability and transport authorisation requirements, or, in certain cases, to the REACH legislation that applies to goods.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have reason to fear that certain types of combustible waste from the manufacturing and chemical industries, such as, for instance, fuel substitutes, which are currently considered as hazardous waste, will easily comply with the proposed definitions for by-products, not being toned down, as they are, by other criteria. That seems particularly dangerous to me, because there is then the risk of a general declassification of all the waste streams fulfilling these criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have both done an excellent job in handling this complex issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Our waste mountain is still growing, and that is certainly a trend that needs to be bucked, because we have to move towards a world without waste, a world where all spent products and packaging materials form the raw materials for new products, where raw materials do not lose their value and where recycling is not the same as downcycling. The new framework directive is moving in the right direction. According to the waste hierarchy, we first need to prevent waste, and if any waste is created, we need to focus on reuse and recycling, in that order. At the moment, 34% of waste is being recycled, and this share must, and indeed can, be increased.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two things that I regard as important. First of all, there is producer responsibility. They must be given more responsibility to prevent and process waste. They will need to commit to reuse and recycling. This producer responsibility must be developed further and can, for example, take the form of a duty to take back packaging.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a world without waste is still, unfortunately, a long way off. Waste is still being created, despite recycling and prevention, and we must use it as effectively as possible. The unfortunate fact is that 50% of the European Union’s waste is still being dumped, even though dumping is invariably inefficient. This really must stop. Incineration is in any event a more efficient way of disposing of waste than dumping. Modern waste incineration installations can recover waste by extracting energy from it. The choice is therefore not between recycling or incinerating. We need to go for recycling all the way. In the next few years, though, it will be impossible to recycle 100%, and the choice will therefore be between dumping and incinerating, in which case it is better to opt for incineration combined with energy recovery. If this is done in a very effective manner, we will, in any case, be able to substantially cut down on CO2. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I support the five-stage hierarchy of waste, but flexibility should only be on a case-by-case basis, otherwise we run the risk that this approach may mean everything and nothing at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I agree with the rapporteur that we should only use the comitology process for technical purposes and that we should move to codecision processes in Articles 5, 11 and 21.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I believe that waste incineration should not be reclassified as a recovery operation but remain as a disposal operation. To do otherwise would undermine the principle of prevention, reuse and recycling. However, this should not blind us to the fact that dioxins are produced from many other sources, from barbecues to fireworks to open fires.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to illegal cross-border dumping of rubbish in Ireland, lest anyone in Parliament be misled, let me say to my colleague, Mr Allister: it goes both ways. Illegal waste dumping knows no borders and it is most certainly not one-way traffic; greater vigilance is needed on both sides of the border. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Witness Mrs Jackson when she says you must absolutely resist the Member States and the Commission in their efforts to keep the comitology process closed. Naturally, I am with her as far as the Commission goes, but the Member States? A British Tory talking about resolutely resisting the Member States? This is the true face of British Conservatives.

The topic of waste illustrates well how environmental friendliness can sometimes differ very greatly in theory and in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time we clarified, simplified and harmonised Community legislation on waste. All too often we have witnessed situations where the Court of Justice of the European Communities has ultimately defined what constitutes waste or how it should be managed. We now need clear and workable criteria and guidelines so that our laws on waste can also support the objective we agreed on at Lisbon, which at the same time would guarantee operators the sort of working environment that can be predicted.</p>
<p class="contents">There needs to be both qualitative and quantitative prevention of waste. We have to be able to specify what constitutes by-products and to say when waste is no longer waste for us to cut down on the use of virgin materials as much as possible. At the same time, we need to increase the scope for utilising materials considered to be waste, in order to reduce as much as possible the amount of waste that has to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am extremely concerned, because the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, hinting as it does at compromise, especially as regards quality, cannot meet the targets set. For example, the recital where it says that all by-products will basically be regarded as waste when there are no clear and case-specific criteria in the law would be a catastrophe for our Community. In practice, however vital and useful a substance or material generated as a by-product is, for example in auxiliary production or re-use, it would always be regarded as waste in order to be on the safe side, or included within the scope of waste legislation. The truth is, though, that there are huge volumes of material produced in industry whose precise composition is known, and which could be regarded as a fraction separate from the rest of the waste stream at source. This way, its exploitation would be easy, the risks would be totally under control and energy would be saved.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, a rigid waste hierarchy, which now can only be avoided after a case-by-case lifecycle assessment and a cost-benefit analysis, would be legislation that we could not in any way justify from the perspective of the feasibility and competitiveness of our waste management procedures. This option would only slow down the process and bring with it a huge amount of needless red tape. We now need to avoid blunders such as the two examples I have given. I am confident that the amendments that Mr Florenz and the rest of us have tabled together will help Parliament solve the problems that have accompanied these compromises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A large majority on the committee were in favour of the five-step waste hierarchy remaining the cornerstone of EU policy on waste in the future. The most important section of the hierarchy is the reduction in volumes of waste. To achieve this aim we need clear targets binding on the Member States at EU level to reduce volumes of waste and increase re-use and recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to reassess our lifestyles. Our production and consumption habits need to move more in the direction of sustainability rather than the current culture of disposability. It has been said here that waste volumes are growing and growing all the time. Indeed they are, but in Finland, for example, we have already succeeded in controlling volumes of household waste. We nevertheless now really have to work hard to get waste volumes down.</p>
<p class="contents">The waste hierarchy is crucially important to us, but when clear environmental criteria based on life-cycle thinking allow us to show that alternative measures are sensible, there can be flexibility in this. Burning waste cannot be an option other than for landfill sites, and even then, of course, the criteria on emissions must be in effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The amount of waste involved is enormous; therefore, this reality demonstrates the topicality of legal regulation of waste at the European level and the necessity of increasing people’s awareness in regard to dealing with waste disposal. I support the Commission’s initiative to revise the General Directive on Waste Disposal, making it less complicated and much clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">Sections 29–31 of the Directive set out new requirements for member countries to arrange national waste minimisation programmes. It is very important that more attention should be paid to the issue of waste, not only at the European level but also at the national level. However, the requirement to arrange a general waste minimisation programme for all types of waste is difficult to implement, since there are specific streams of waste and different possibilities for applying preventive measures. It would be more expedient to prepare guidelines for arranging national waste minimisation programmes and targeting certain types of waste for priority action, while leaving member countries the right to decide for themselves which other types of waste should also be targeted by the aforementioned programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The principle of the five-step hierarchy will not in itself be able to prevent that, and therefore we must aim at recycling at least 50% of biodegradable waste, promoting separate collection and recycling systems, and ensuring that re-usable or recyclable materials are not disposed of in landfills or incinerators.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jackson’s amendments, whereby municipal waste incinerators may be classed as recovery rather than disposal facilities, do in fact undermine the application of the five priority stages and throw the door open to private incineration businesses.

With regard to the various elements of the reform, I wish now to say a few words about selective collection.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking around the European Union, we see a considerably diverse picture. A Europe that is united in so many respects has split in two on the subject of selective collection. Among those leading the field are Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany, where the proportion of municipal waste collected selectively stands at around 50%, while those bringing up the rear are at scarcely more than 2%. Similarly, great differences may be seen with regard to the selective collection of industrial waste. There are countries, Italy and the Netherlands, where this represents 80-90%, while in others it has hardly reached 10%.</p>
<p class="contents">My country, Hungary, provides a good example of this duality. Less than 2.5% of municipal waste is recycled, which is one of the lowest proportions among the EU Member States. In the case of industrial waste, on the other hand, this figure stands at over 70%, which puts us in a higher performance category.</p>
<p class="contents">Why this duality? Well, in Hungary selective waste collection was made mandatory for industry a few years ago. This is the main reason for this fine result of 70%. By contrast, the authorities wish to introduce selective collection of municipal waste on a voluntary basis, by creating waste collection islands. The result speaks for itself: only 2% of all domestic waste is collected selectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this example provides a good illustration of how important it is that we establish uniform, binding minimum goals for selective collection for all Member States, both for industrial and for domestic waste. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, please believe me that we will not need to spend as much time debating incineration if we succeed in resolving the question of selective collection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is for this reason that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety is in favour of mandatory targets for the reduction and prevention of waste, and also of any future European waste policy being founded upon the five-level hierarchy of waste. I hope that the reports adopted in the Committee on the Environment will also find a big majority in the plenary, for that will amount to a significant improvement over the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of enormous importance that the distinction should continue to be drawn between the disposal and the reprocessing of waste; the Commission proposal no longer categorised the thermal treatment of domestic waste and similar refuse as removal, but rather as reprocessing, provided that the incineration facilities met certain criteria laid down in respect of energy efficiency. This approach would have had disastrous consequences in the shape of environmental dumping the length and breadth of Europe and a marked increase in waste tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">There would, in future, be nothing unproblematic and nothing illegal about transporting waste right across Europe and burning it wherever it was cheapest to do so and most damaging to the environment. It is important that the Member States should be able to invoke the proximity principle, which is now enshrined in Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">It was said today that we should seek out an approach that entails the minimum possible bureaucracy; well, my view is that that approach, that solution, would be for the municipalities to be, in future, responsible for the provision of municipal services of general interest, and capable of deciding for themselves how they would meet the demands of the new policy on waste, for not only would it minimise bureaucracy, it would also maximise democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On average, each person is responsible for almost half a tonne of waste each year.</p>
<p class="contents">The most effective and long-term method of solving the problem of waste is not to create it in the first place. Our wasteful and inefficient methods of exploiting natural resources are having a huge impact on the environment. We can, however, effectively counter this by taking preventative action: reducing the quantity of waste, re-using products and re-processing waste into secondary raw materials, in other words, recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to a particularly striking proposal in the report on which we are voting. The proposal is to re-classify installations that thermally neutralise waste into waste recovery installations. Reclassifying waste incinerators will mean that in the eyes of the law, the transportation of waste for incineration between Member States will become legal, as it is legal to transport waste that is subject to recovery. This will lead to a significant influx of waste to the new from the richer Member States, where waste incineration is considerably more costly. Nine new waste incinerators, currently in the planning stage, may be set up with European Union funding. This would constitute using EU funds in a way that is exceedingly harmful to the environment and to society.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot have a situation where a number of poorer states become a bonfire for waste from the whole of Europe, emitting vast quantities of carbon dioxide in the process. But that is exactly the situation provided for by Amendments 116, 133 and 135. Waste incineration contributes to climate change and pollutes the environment. It also increases our dependence on the import of valuable raw materials that could be obtained through recycling. A similar position was adopted by four environmental ministers of the Vyšehrad Group in May 2006. For this reason I appeal to all Members of this House to take these reservations into account, and not to vote for the change in the classification of waste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In actual fact, the percentage by which it is increasing is higher than that by which our wealth and also our GDP are increasing. We are now in a position in which every single European produces an average of 500 kilograms of waste per year. That is half a metric ton each, ladies and gentlemen. These are, of course, huge quantities, and something needs to be done about the situation. The primary objective of this legislation must therefore be to reduce the quantity of waste. It is ironic, I think, that we are all totally agreed on the targets but that these are not particularly clear from the Commission’s proposal. We are therefore in favour of having binding targets of both a qualitative and quantitative nature for reducing waste in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, there are unfortunately other drawbacks too to the Commission’s proposal. A reading of the proposal reveals, firstly, that no great distinction is made between recycling and incinerating waste as long as, if it is incinerated, the waste is used for creating energy. That, emphatically, is wrong. Both processes are referred to as recovery, but appearances are deceptive in this case, as, from an environmental point of view, a huge amount more is recovered through the one process than through the other. For example, washing and then recycling a plastic bottle is obviously much more beneficial to the environment than incinerating it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another problem with the way in which the Commission has organised matters, for what we need are very specific requirements in those cases in which we are obliged to incinerate waste. That much is obvious. In those cases, we must require use to be made of the best technology in terms both of energy efficiency and also, of course, in terms of preventing the potentially harmful environmental consequences of incinerating waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We also wish to prevent cross-border environmental transport or environmental tourism, but that is what we shall have if we regard waste as a commodity.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up: we must reduce the quantity of waste and we must ensure that there is a hierarchy of solutions, in which recycling takes significant precedence over incineration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly want to consider the proposed hierarchy of waste treatment from the point of view of the conservation of resources; it is because of that that this directive needs also to be seen in the context of the security of energy supply, which is the burning issue of the day in Europe at the moment. Europe’s dependency on energy supplies from various third states puts the issue of the scarcity of resources and the protection of them at the centre of almost every policy debate, and so, in order to stabilise energy supply, reprocessing of waste should be given high priority. It may not, to be sure, guarantee the security of energy supply, but it is a small contribution to it. Let us take oil as an example of this. Since it is generally estimated that the world’s stocks of oil will have been used up by 2050, it strikes me as irresponsible for us in Europe to continue to burn waste oil in such large quantities when, across Europe, it is used to produce around a third of all lubricants – an example of good technology of the sort that ought to be promoted in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, of course, flexibility is vital; after all, paper cannot be reclaimed and reprocessed an infinite number of times, and that is why I think the amendment that has been tabled on the subject of flexibility is so extremely important and relevant. For the sake of legal certainty, though – particularly where reprocessing is concerned – it is very important that, when the directive is transposed, it should be clearly laid down precisely when a substance is still waste and when it is that it becomes a product. There must be no legal grey areas here, for they result only in fraud and uncertainty, which we cannot afford.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying something about the revision of the landfill directive. It is indeed the case that the disposal of waste in landfill sites is to be cut back, but the argument based on the alleged discharge from them of methane, which damages the environment, takes us down blind alleys. The technology exists to deal with this, and even now the gas is being trapped and turned into biogas. That is something we should take into account. Quite apart from that, I endorse the proposal from Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on the subject of the reprocessing of foodstuffs, and I suggest that you, Commissioner, should have a rethink about that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The time has come for us to learn to live differently, because, as with climate change, the consequences may be difficult to eliminate, if not fatal.</p>
<p class="contents">In Lithuania, as in most new European Union Member States, the disposal of waste in landfill dumps is still the most widespread method of dealing with it. Municipal councils lack the specialists and the funds that would be required for waste minimisation, sorting and recycling. The majority of people are still not prepared to support progressive methods of dealing with waste, and there is a lack of legal control.

It has also become apparent what the cost might be of seeking exemptions from these kinds of constraints, which are imperative.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, we need quantified targets, in particular for waste reduction, which our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was right to establish as a long-term objective. This is important not only where protecting the environment is concerned, but also when it comes to making us less vulnerable in the area of supplies of raw materials, which we know are much fought-over in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if incineration cannot be prohibited, then maximum restrictions must be imposed on it. This is a form of disposal, not recovery. Of course, energy production is better than disposal, but let us not get confused: incineration is a form of disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to strengthen the principles of proximity and self-sufficiency in relation to waste management, especially for the various forms of disposal and incineration, otherwise we are going to see an almost uncontrollable phenomenon develop regarding the transport of waste, with an increase in greenhouse gases and in the risks of environmental dumping. The fact is that the best practices are not always the cheapest.</p>
<p class="contents">Weakening the principle of proximity in order to create a large market in waste would benefit the large economic groups concerned and not the environment. To do so is therefore unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Waste – of which the 27 EU Member States produce 1.3 billion tonnes per annum – is a core issue rather than a marginal one.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, it is easy to define the goals but difficult to achieve them. Preventing waste must be first on the list, and, if the amount of waste generated is to remain stable until 2012 and decrease thereafter, a number of steps will have to be taken, among them an eco-design product directive, more responsibility on the part of manufacturers, the traceability of hazardous substances and a properly thought-out recycling system. It is more important to recycle waste than to reprocess it, just as in medicine, it is more important to rehabilitate people than to give them a disability pension. These things hang together perfectly.</p>
<p class="contents">No quarter is being given in the arguments about this. In my own country, the municipal service-providers’ association has over EUR 60 billion in turnover and precious little love of open competition, of which I take a positive view, seeing it as benefiting both customers and the environment. We need only to lay down the ground rules for this competition, not the details of it. It is the portability of waste that needs to be regulated by reference to the materials and the risks involved, not the issue of who should transport it.</p>
<p class="contents">My thinking on this subject revolves round the future tasks of recycling and product design, for it is here that I see Europe having the chance of building a future on technology and the protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am all in favour of an open internal market of the kind on which we in the Committee on the Environment have agreed; it is absurd to believe that more and more new and restrictive measures will get Europe any further along the path mapped out by the Lisbon Strategy. I also believe that municipal service providers stand a good chance when they compete in a growing market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Even though progress in waste management has been made over recent years, there are still huge differences between the Member States as regards the volume of waste that is re-used or recycled and as regards its method of disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, for example, and perhaps to a lesser degree in other countries, a very large proportion of waste ends up in uncontrolled dumps and re-use or recycling are underdeveloped.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, as my honourable friend Mr Sonik said earlier, about one and half tonnes of waste are generated annually per average European citizen, most of which ends up in landfills, not in residue landfills.</p>
<p class="contents">Re-use and recycling are at excessively low levels and we have not done much to reduce or even stabilise overall waste generation.</p>
<p class="contents">The negative effects will only be addressed if we create national programmes to put prevention first and reduce the amount of waste to start with. Just think that in Greece in the year 2000 there were 4.5 million tonnes of waste and in 2006 there were 6 million tonnes of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to set up a hierarchy of targets which prioritise reductions in the volume of waste, re-use, recycling and recovery and lay down a specific implementation timetable which is common to all the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In recent weeks the Hungarian police has initiated legal proceedings for repeated infringements of waste management regulations through the illegal shipment and dumping of a large amount of waste from Germany into Hungary. Such an act is, of course, in violation of the current rules, but at the same time highlights the need for effective and Europe-wide regulations. Such regulations should take into consideration, beyond binding recycling targets, the different abilities and resources of Member States and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on this, I would like to bring to your attention three viewpoints in the present debate. First, in addition to the waste hierarchy, we must consider the social costs of the treatment of given wastes at particular levels of the hierarchy. This way the application of the waste hierarchy can not only benefit the environment but can contribute to the efficient use of natural resources as well as to reducing energy dependence.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the principles of proximity and self-sufficiency must be emphasised, since the transport of waste, and especially the increasing volume of hazardous waste, result in significant environmental problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it would be appropriate to make room for market-compatible tools in the regulation of waste management. Although technical specifications, for instance limit values, are in many cases unavoidable, we could assign a greater role to external fees for waste production that internalise its economic costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust the directive to be formulated will also take into account the above points and as a result, people will not have to worry about their neighbourhood becoming a garbage dump, as was recently the case, unfortunately, in Hungary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in the present draft, loose terminology has increased problems of interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, it contains a definition of recycling of materials defining it as ‘recovery and re-processing of waste into products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes’, without specifying what these ‘other purposes’ are. Nor does it distinguish between a product that may become waste from a material and a substance. In its formulation, for example, scrap created within steelworks could be treated as waste that completely bypasses the recycling loop to the plant via the market, and may become an element of abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to draw attention to another issue already raised by my colleagues here, which is that minimising costs, which includes the social costs, of implementing the directive, is made largely dependent on a more balanced treatment of recycling and other forms of reclaiming materials, and a certain liberalisation of the waste hierarchy for those countries that are not yet ready for costly recycling. However, we must develop effective systems for collection, separation and disassembly in order to encourage ordinary EU citizens to dismantle and recycle materials rather than incinerate them. Unfortunately, I see none of this in the Directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe they have performed a significant task and – along with those who have spoken before me – I must express my appreciation of the way in which, in connection with the report, we are now establishing the hierarchy and giving primary importance to prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason I asked for the floor has to do, in practice, with two points. I would like to mention my two favourite sayings. First: we cannot take medication and drink alcohol at the same time; in other words, we need to take into account that through enlargement, we have seen the arrival of a region that is increasingly diversified but also ever more vulnerable. Secondly, we cannot say that every operation has been a success, only unfortunately the patient has died.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I saying this? As my colleague Mr Gyürk has previously stated, I too am experiencing in my own electoral district that an enormous quantity of rubbish and domestic waste is arriving in Central and Eastern Europe. The reason for this is that in Germany it is clearly much cheaper to get rid of waste – even if illegally, larded with a few corrupt methods – than to sort it locally and recycle it by means of an extremely bureaucratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the first message is that we must be careful with bureaucratisation, and try to make sure that waste is indeed recycled at source. The second is that we must see to it that waste is at all times successfully disposed of and is traceable, since otherwise it is impossible to achieve results. As well, we will soon have to establish categories of criminal sanctions in this matter, I believe, if the ‘polluter pays’ principle does not seem to be working.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it unacceptable that we as victims should be the ones who have to prove where the waste originates from, and that we should have to bear the cost of its disposal. In practice, this runs counter to every European philosophy and legal principle, and we need to take measures to put an end to this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I believe we must also pay closer attention to the local implementation of these regulations. Commissioner, you are well aware of what is going on in Malta at present, where the decision was taken, against all reason or logic, to build a mega recycling plant instead of opting for a regional solution. This action has proved, beyond all doubt, that the way this decision was taken goes against every rule that exists when it comes to taking decisions on adopting proper and transparent consultation processes. Suffice to say that when the supposed list of alternative sites was drawn up, not one of the sites mentioned was large enough to accommodate this recycling plant, and therefore, very conveniently, the type of plant chosen was the one favoured by the government. The planning regulations that are enforced with much zeal when weak individuals are involved were flouted to such an extent that even the Maltese ombudsman had to intervene. Shortly after your meeting with the local residents, Commissioner, the authorities stepped up the pace as much as possible in order to try to close this chapter, once and for all, as best suited them. We acknowledge that the Commission is looking into this case; however, we now need to act as quickly as possible and, in so doing, prove that the European Union is capable of ensuring that its written laws are implemented at local level in the best way possible.

One has to do with catering waste, which is sterilised using a particular treatment process in which they are heated to over 130° and can then be re-used for feeding pigs. This is something that we see as being of enormous importance, and it also reflects the circulatory concept of waste management, since waste that is not needed by human beings can be taken out of the food chain, sterilised, and then put to good use as animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the question of biowaste; here, too, I would like to ask the Commission to follow the examples of a few Member States that have very well-developed and well-functioning systems to deal with biowaste, and bring in a proposal in addition to the one we have already, although it should also take a favourable view of the amendments tabled by our group in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, this is where we get close to a core issue in our prosperous society, in that we must at last succeed in decoupling economic growth – which is generally desirable – from the growth in the volume of waste, both in relative and absolute terms. It is not acceptable that the mountain of refuse should be constantly growing, and that we should think ourselves richer as a result. As is envisaged, this state of affairs must be stabilised by 2012 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though I see the proposed measures – including a mandatory hierarchy with the possibility of deviation from it only when this is clearly justified by life-cycle analyses – as the right way to go about it, I do nevertheless believe that the Member States need to transpose this in the right way, with the Commission monitoring it properly, if the abuses described by some Members are to be avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Environmental Protection Agency in Ireland has pointed out that something like 25% of domestic waste in Ireland is unaccounted for and we know that the Commission is already investigating a number of illegal dumps in Ireland where this domestic waste – and some industrial waste also – is going. There is a serious need to police the regulations we put in place: it is not enough to have laws in place, we have to police them and ensure that penalties are sufficient to deter dumping of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to outline the Commission’s view on a number of key issues raised by Parliament. I will start with those aspects of the thematic strategy not covered in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the support given in the report to developing common European minimum standards. The next step will be a new proposal to regulate certain additional waste treatment activities under the IPPC directive. I also agree with the emphasis placed on preventing waste and notably on the role chemicals policy and eco-design could play in this respect. Finally, the resolution you have approved proposes a number of additional measures for increasing recycling and recovery of waste. The Commission will take this into account when developing further measures implementing the strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the waste framework directive. Many of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament provide useful clarifications to the proposal and can be accepted. Others would have consequences that would be undesirable. I would like first of all to comment on some of the points made in tonight’s debate and on some of the key amendments that the Commission can accept in full, in principle, or in part.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept the stricter and clearer reference to a five-step waste hierarchy. However, it is important that we recognise that the hierarchy needs to be applied in order to take the best environmental option. Excessive procedural requirements such as those set out in the second part of the amendment will not help to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also accept a number of useful clarifications with regard to some important definitions including waste prevention and recycling. In addition, elements such as the promotion of reuse and producer responsibility can be supported in principle. The Commission also welcomes the reference to the interpretative communication on by-products, which I hope will satisfy the need for clarity in this domain when it is adopted very shortly. However, there are also a number of amendments that the Commission cannot support.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission is committed to having clear and unambiguous definitions of the key terms in this directive. As I stated earlier, the amendments proposed in relation to reuse and to recovery and disposal do not meet this test. The recovery and disposal distinction is a key framework condition for the functioning of the European recycling market. It needs to be applied by the authorities in order to process waste shipment decisions, and the recovery definition in the directive must be sufficiently clear and robust to allow this to happen. Otherwise, there will be frequent and unnecessary referrals to the Court of Justice and this would adversely affect recycling activities and the environmental benefit they can deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important to deal with the grey area in the energy recovery definition with regard to classifying municipal incinerators, where the amendments proposed do not tackle the issue and weaken the level of environmental protection. This problem dates back ten years and we need to find a compromise now in order to deal with it clearly in this revision.</p>
<p class="contents">Making the efficiency criterion from the Commission proposal obligatory for municipal incinerators and extending this to co-incineration facilities as well is not the answer to the question. It will be neither technically possible nor environmentally useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, certain amendments are either unnecessary references, duplicate other elements of European Union legislation, or add an unnecessary administrative burden for stakeholders or the European Union institutions. Notably, a number of the amendments relating to hazardous waste would penalise businesses handling such waste for no apparent environmental benefit and in some cases are technically impossible to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, it is not good for the environment to have a total ban on the mixing of hazardous waste with other waste: it could lead to substandard treatment of some kinds of hazardous waste. More generally, it is essential that the work on developing common standards for the recycling market, such as the end-of-waste criteria, should be allowed to reach its full potential. These standards are necessarily technical and must adapt to improvements in environmental performance in order not to become a drag on eco-innovation. The time taken by the preparation and the procedures for codecision means that this is an inappropriate route for such technical work and some comitology will be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wanted to comment on the amendments relating to waste prevention. Waste prevention, as I said before, is one of the key elements of this revision. I welcome the support for the waste prevention programmes in the report. I also understand the approach behind the inclusion of a waste prevention target. However, the target, as presented in the relevant amendments, is too bland. It will have an uneven impact on different Member States – too difficult for some, not ambitious enough for others – and it will be difficult to interpret and enforce. I cannot, therefore, accept the amendments in question.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already explained, this is a framework directive, whose role cannot be to regulate specific recycling targets. Such targets will be elaborated and proposed by the Commission in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Many speakers have asked for specific legislation, for example in areas such as bio-waste. The Commission is examining ways to make legislative proposals in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Many other speakers raised issues which are not to be dealt with in this directive, such as illegal cross-border shipments of waste, for which we have special legislation. Municipal waste cannot be transported across borders for incineration, even if the municipal incinerator across the border is classified as recovery. A Member State may oppose such a transfer.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a prohibition on the dumping of waste in the developing world both in European Union law and international law: the Basel ban. A few days ago, a directive was proposed to punish environmental crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Soil pollution from illegal landfilling is covered by the Landfill Directive and the soil thematic strategy. The conclusion must be that the role of the waste framework directive is not to deal with special dysfunctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the 92 amendments tabled just before the plenary. We welcome some of the suggestions, such as maintaining the energy efficiency formula as a basis for distinguishing between recovery and disposal for municipal incinerators, but we cannot accept certain other amendments.</p>

Illegal bulk waste shipments have been delivered from Western Europe to both Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to prevent the dumping of Western Europe’s trash on new Member States, we need a new framework directive that leaves no loopholes, while putting great emphasis on waste prevention. Self-assessment by companies is insufficient – official controls are also needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is important to re-use and recycle the waste produced, according to the five-stage hierarchy contained in the framework directive, thereby minimising the amount of waste that ends up in dump sites. I would suggest as well that when new regulations are introduced regarding waste concerns, the European Commission build into them a central registration of waste shipments, which would make for easier verification. Uniform, compulsory labelling on the outside of vehicles used for waste shipment would also be useful. I expect action from the Commission on this matter as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst I endorse the conclusions, I should also like to make an urgent appeal to the European Parliament to set a good example. All citizens have their own responsibility to shoulder in this respect, and MEPs are no exception.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it would be a big step forward if we were to limit the number of working languages from 23 to 2 or 3, for despite all technologies at our fingertips, the European Parliament is still producing a huge quantity of paper, 99% of which is destined for the waste paper basket.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is now more reason than ever to designate Brussels as the seat for the European Parliament. The monthly move of MEPs and staff to Strasbourg is not only a waste of money, but also contributes to the CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Parliament’s official cars need replacing. The group chairmen are currently driving around in Mercedeses and Audis, although there are cars out there that are far more economical. I propose disposing of these polluting cars and replacing them with their economical, hybrid counterparts. This will also hopefully work as an incentive for German car manufacturers to start complying with European standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could not imagine a nicer Valentine’s present for women in Turkey than the adoption, tomorrow, of the report on women’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There are 40 million women in Turkey. They want to be given the opportunity of developing and improving their living conditions. My report alone will not be able to bring this about, but it is a means for the women and the women’s movement in Turkey to claim their rights in respect of their husbands and their fathers, the Turkish Government, but also the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My report is building on last year’s findings. I have taken note of what has happened since then and what has not. Legislation, by and large, is now as it should be, even though a few things still need to be done in that area. The second step is creating a framework in which legislation can be implemented, that is to say sufficient funds and a well-trained government apparatus, with a government that shows sufficient commitment and is not afraid of making that commitment public. Only if the second step has been taken can we move on properly to the third step, when women notice improvement in their daily lives – a step which we have not yet reached. People are still working very hard on step two, and that is why women are still seeing little in the way of practical improvements to date, although the government is committed. Whilst two years ago, women’s rights were not yet really an issue, these days, Prime Minister Erdogan opens nearly every speech with it. The different ministries too devote more attention to women’s rights. Our report of last year has contributed to this, and we in this House should be proud of this.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also better government instructions to officials and police on how to deal with women’s rights. The police and the army are being trained and memos contain clear instructions for ministries and municipalities. These instructions, which are desperately needed, focus on blood feuds and violence against women. Indeed, the number of sentences that have been passed with regard to blood feuds is still giving a mixed picture. Some judges are tougher in their sentencing, while others are more lenient. This has got to stop.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also contains other areas that need attention. Fighting violence against women must be priority number one in government policy for women. More refuge centres must be created which I intend to visit so as to monitor whether these places of safety meet the quality requirements. This year, a committee on women’s rights and gender equality must be set up in the Turkish Parliament. A committee of this kind is indispensable if legislation is to take real account of gender issues, and is also an important and essential interlocutor for the European Parliament and the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly. More objective and accurate data are needed about the situation of women in Turkey, particularly in relation to violence, illiteracy and discrimination. Fortunately, this is an area that is being addressed by Turkey and the Commission together. Finally, there is a need for proper anti-discrimination policy if women are to be given full access to education and the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a brief comment about one compromise amendment that has been jointly tabled by the European People’s Party, the Socialists, the Liberals and the European United Left, and about which I am sure you have received a huge number of letters. It is about the use of the words ‘Kurdish minority’ in the report. Kurds themselves, as well as the Turkish Government, have indicated that they have difficulty accepting these words. In order to avoid confusion, we have now decided to say that all women, irrespective of their race, language, origin, religion or political persuasion, must have access to women’s rights programmes. In this light, I would urge you to support the compromise amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, 2007 will be an important test for Turkey to see how seriously this country is taking women’s emancipation. That country has parliamentary elections coming up in November. Far too few women are taking part in politics at the moment. It is not that they are not there. Only two weeks ago, I spoke with women of nearly all political parties, but their names are not yet included in the electoral lists. How Turkey solves this, is up to Turkey. If, however, the political participation of women does not increase, then Turkey will not be able to say that it did not know what to do. The report contains suggestions, including temporary measures of positive discrimination. Temporary, because I am convinced that once women become more visible in politics, this will have a snowball effect. Girls need role models so that they can see that they too may be able to carve out a career in politics.</p>
<p class="contents">I am hopeful for women in Turkey. The country is moving in the right direction, but should not backpedal. This is why I would make a plea for accelerating the implementation of reforms, and also for actually carrying them out. The accession negotiations with the EU can work as a catalyst in this respect. I hope that our report will be able to do its bit. I would like to thank you all for your support in advance. I am persuaded that the women in Turkey will also be indebted to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an accurate and carefully balanced description of the situation as regards women’s rights in Turkey and it is also a valuable contribution to the debate on women’s role in the social, political and economic life of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">There has indeed been progress in the area of women’s rights: legislation has been passed; an Advisory Board on the Status of Women has been established; an official circular has been issued by the Prime Minister, instructing the administration to deal with domestic violence; a joint EU–Turkey project is setting up a database on violence against women; and the ‘Let’s go to school, girls’ campaign has resulted in the enrolment of 177 000 girls in school. All this is positive and is acknowledged in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also very much share your concerns as regards women’s rights in Turkey. Women’s participation in the labour market, political representation of women, education for girls and violence against women are areas of main concern and we concur with the thrust of the analysis and recommendations of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Low levels of participation by women and low employment rates, together with the large size of the informal economy, represent a major employment policy challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree that political participation by women in Turkey is dramatically low and that important efforts have to be made to deal with this issue. In addition, we cannot agree more with the importance education has for the economic independence of women.</p>
<p class="contents">You will know that gender equality is a major theme in the context of the political criteria. That is why the Commission follows all these issues closely as part of its regular monitoring. We also cover them in the context of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We report regularly on the situation in the annual progress reports. Inadequacies are also raised in our bilateral monitoring meetings with the Turkish authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the framework of our pre-accession assistance, the Commission also funds a number of projects aimed at promoting women’s rights. Particular emphasis is given to violence against women. In 2007 we will support the establishment of eight shelters for women who have been subject to domestic violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Gender equality is also given a high priority within the civil society dialogue between the EU and Turkey. This dialogue aims at improving mutual knowledge and understanding. Several projects have already been funded, including some involving women’s NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to promote actively non-discrimination against women in all areas of life. This will include future projects. We will also continue to encourage civil society initiatives aimed at increasing public awareness, such as the ‘Stop the Violence Against Women’ campaign. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to make three points in connection with this debate. Firstly, there is still some misunderstanding in terms of the difference between the simple act of debating the role of women in Turkey and that of concluding from the debate whether Turkey can or cannot join the European Union. This merging of the two does not help us to focus on the role of women in Turkey, which is an issue in itself. In this House, we regularly debate the role of women in Afghanistan, the Maghreb and Africa, without Afghanistan, the Maghreb or Africa necessarily being called on to become members of the European Union. The same applies to Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">From this perspective, I also call on our counterpart from the Council of Europe to demonstrate responsibility and to conduct a dialogue with Turkey as a Member State of the Council of Europe. I call on my fellow Members to continue to focus on the role of women in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">We, as women, represent added value for the common good of society; we bring about peace, we have knowledge to share and a special kind of wisdom to pass on, wherever we are, including in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the debate on the role of women in Turkey reminds the EU Member States of their own responsibilities. How can we lecture Turkey when we are incapable of fulfilling our duties in our own countries? We will only be able to criticise Turkey when we are ready to criticise ourselves. So let us not pretend to sermonise.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we cannot tackle the situation of women by disregarding the role of men. The fact is that no one dares mention this obvious fact which, politically-speaking, is a very accurate one, but men also have a very important role to play where gender equality is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">During our meeting in Istanbul, Prime Minister Erdogan clearly confirmed his opposition to violence against women. I called on him to express himself publicly on this matter and to set a good example to Turkish men. It is not enough to be deeply convinced that violence is not a solution; he has to say it out loud, bolstered by his political reputation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am repeating my call to Mr Erdogan from this Chamber. Take a public stand against violence against women, including in your country. Mr Erdogan, set a good example of which men can be proud; we can then take a step forward together and improve the situation of women in your country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The possibility of Turkey joining the European Union means that we in this House must give pride of place to respect for human rights – and in this specific instance women’s rights as an integral element in them – as an indispensable precondition for its accession.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking as a member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I see three great blocks on which work is urgently needed. The first is education and the world of work; the unfortunate fact is that the presence of women on the labour market has decreased from 35% in 1998 to 25% today, even though there are hopeful signs in some areas – in the number of women practising as lawyers and physicians, for instance – but, if the Lisbon Strategy’s targets, which include 60% participation of women in the labour market, are to be met, none of this fits together, and, if Turkey wants to be a candidate, it has to be well aware of that. Education is a key to bringing about development and change; unfortunately, particularly in eastern Turkey, a very large number of women are still excluded from it, and 25% of them are still illiterate.</p>
<p class="contents">More also needs to be done – and as a matter of urgency – where the combating of violence is concerned. Mr Erdoğan has committed himself to more being done on this front, but that is far from enough; the establishment of women’s refuges would be another step in the right direction, and the public debate on violence against women and ‘honour crimes’ must go on.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have an appeal to make in relation to the Turkish elections; it is that there has to be discussion of quotas if Turkey is to continue to make progress. The existing level of women’s participation in parliamentary life – 4% at the national level and 1% in the municipalities – is unsustainable, so urgent action, including such things as a quota system, needs to be taken to deal with this, and that will do a great service not only to women but also to cooperation between Europe and Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report by Mrs Bozkurt is a good one; it will move democracy forward and help to improve the conditions under which Turkish women live, yet all the things that we, this week, are enjoining on Turkey as it seeks accession are things that we would do well to act on ourselves. Let us, then, once and for all, stop denying fundamental rights to an ethnic group here in Europe. Let us enable them to put forward their demands and claims here in this House. Let us, at last, allow them to trade with the EU and with the rest of the world. Let us allow them to attend schools and universities legally, and let us recognise their qualifications. Let us allow them to participate in European sporting events. Let us do away with this discrimination within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">You will be aware of whom I am talking; I am talking about an ethnic group that, in 2004, and by an overwhelming majority, said ‘yes’ to the European Union and sought reunion with the other ethnic group in their homeland, and whose isolation we then promised to end. I am talking about the Turks in Cyprus. What is the winning card up the European Union’s sleeve? What is that thing of which we are rightly particularly proud? It is that the European Community is a peace-building project. How is it that we can become so indifferent as to look away when an EU Member State has serious problems with getting two ethnic groups to live together peacefully, when it needs UN troops and is over-militarised and full to bursting with soldiers and weaponry? If Christian and Muslim cultures cannot manage to co-exist in Cyprus, how is that going to be possible in the far more complicated structure of the European Union? The EU is losing credibility by being insufficiently committed to addressing its own problems. It cannot be united in peace for as long as Cyprus remains a divided island. Let us help not only the women of Turkey, but also the Turkish women of Cyprus, to avail themselves of their rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a document that addresses subjects of prime importance and highlights the status of women in Turkey and hence in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people say that the progress made by that country on its journey towards EU accession should be judged first on respect for human rights and then on equal rights for men and women. We agree with that, but I believe that women should gain equal rights in Turkey regardless of any aspiration to join the European Union. This is an issue that lies at the basis of any modern, democratic country, but unfortunately, in this context, the European Union is not particularly well qualified to stand up as a champion of safeguards and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur specifically points to the extreme scarcity of Turkish women in positions of power, and item 41 suggests that adopting a mandatory quota system would be a short-term remedy. I remain sceptical: if the quota system has proved ineffective for us in the European Union, why should it ever work in Turkey?</p>
<p class="contents">I have two contrasting reactions to the approach taken in the report: on the one hand, I am pleased to see that there is no reference to cases of torture or of excessive policing during demonstrations, but on the other I am concerned to note that a great many problems like female illiteracy and honour crimes are still worryingly common. I am afraid that the time to put them right is still a long way off, much further off in fact than any optimistic prediction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even two years on from its first publication, and despite the small amount of progress that has been made, I see that there are still serious deficits as regards the equality of women and men in Turkey. The problem lies mainly in the high level of illiteracy, which stands at 25%, rising as far as 40% in some regions – and the still very small number of women in decision-making positions at local and national level.</p>
<p class="contents">What I find even more appalling, though, is the continuing violence against women. Mrs Bozkurt rightly takes a critical line in her report on the regrettable and continuing lack of exact data on this, and what I find disconcerting in this regard is the fact that, in Turkey, which has a population of 70 million people, there are no more than thirty women’s refuges, even though Turkish law requires that a refuge for victims of violence be set up in communities with over 50 000 residents.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards honour killings, one gets the impression that the number of them has decreased since the penalty was made tougher, but I cannot dispel my own concern that the increased incidence of suicide in some regions might well conceal honour killings. The Turkish Government cannot – it must not – stand idly by and let these things happen. It must compile reliable data and set up women’s centres offering women facing the threat of violence not only protection but also emotional support. That is the only way to offer women and girls, from the very outset, the prospect, most of all, of coming out unscathed from a situation that appears to be hopeless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the present stage, however, it is obvious that the great diversity of the European Union means that many of its recommendations have not had the desired effect and create various conflicts as well as being – contrary to the slogans – a denial of freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">There are huge cultural as well as religious and moral differences between the two societies, which is why it would be more relevant to give Turkish women the tools to resolve their own problems in their own way, rather than imposing a mindset and solutions on them that are alien to their traditions and culture. Our Community is based on the principles of dignity and freedom of nations, as set out in countless documents, and our task should be to provide support to combat poverty and violence and to promote education, rather than imposing an alien world outlook on the Turks, which in itself constitutes coercion of the kind the European Union supposedly does not tolerate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If one considers how things work in practice and the attitudes of the broad majority of the population, it is at once clear that most of these improvements have been accomplished only on paper.</p>
<p class="contents">In theory, for example, domestic violence – which statistics show is frequently resorted to – now constitutes grounds for divorce, yet the incidence of divorce is lower in Turkey than in many other developing countries. In what sense can the rule of law be said to apply when the state discontinues prosecutions when the suspect objects to them, and when women under threat only very rarely get protection from the police? What is the point of making improvements to laws, when court rulings take them to absurd conclusions?</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the high level of illiteracy among women, and the high incidence of forced marriage, not to mention the increasing number of honour killings disguised as suicide, speak volumes, and, in the event of the poorly educated women losing their jobs – in which they may well work under conditions analogous to those of slavery – they do not even appear in the official statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">This falsification of the unemployment rate and the consequent threat of large-scale migration is reason enough for the EU to step on the emergency brake, for the way women are treated in Turkish society and their position in it constitute, as I see it, yet more proof that Turkey is not a European country and will never become one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much welcome the report put forward by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality under the guidance of Mrs Bozkurt, for it is even-handed and constructive, highlighting not only the progress achieved on women’s issues but also the deficits that still remain, and spelling out the need for continued and consistent progress down the road of reform on which Turkey has set foot.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s Prime Minister, Mr Erdoğan, would therefore be well advised – despite having many elections to fight – to press on with the gender justice policy and encourage women to work independently. The report gives a good overview of the role of Turkish women in their country’s social, economic and political life. It is good that measures are being planned to combat violence against women, among them the initiative to prevent violence during military service or training in the police force. The principal exponent of this approach is the Turkish Minister for Women, and it is an important and good one, for it is only by means of initiatives such as these that attitudes can be changed – and they need to be. Mr Erdoğan’s decree in response to the Turkish parliament’s report on violence against women and killings on the alleged grounds of honour and morals is another move in the right direction, in that it incorporates many different aspects of policy on women’s issues and instructs all ministries, public institutions and local authorities to be consistent in counteracting violence against women. It must be said, though, that it now has to be followed up by binding and specific instructions on how to implement this, which have still not yet been forthcoming, for his circular will remain a toothless tiger for as long as there are no specific details of how to implement the necessary measures or proper sanctions against the event of them not being put into effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The most recent experience gained in the combating of violence against women indicates just how important it is that such public bodies as the courts, the administration, the police or the health authorities should be involved in it, for, here too, a change of thinking is urgently needed; it has been a too frequent occurrence that women seeking protection have been turned away by the authorities and fallen victim to domestic violence, and that is why we are urging the Turkish government to afford women affected by violence all the protection they need and, where public institutions fail to protect its victims, to set in motion a judicial inquiry and cause those responsible to be prosecuted. State institutions must also work more closely with independent women’s organisations and support the latter financially. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Turkey had a female Head of Government 14 years ago. Eighteen of the 27 Members of the EU have not yet reached this landmark. Yet that does not stop this Chamber from hectoring Ankara about women’s political representation.</p>
<p class="contents">No, this report is really about Turkey’s membership bid. It demands, for example, that Kurdish women’s groups be explicitly recognised as such: a deliberate provocation to Ankara, which has long maintained that all Turkish citizens are equal before the Constitution. Once again the bar is being set higher for Turkey than for any past applicant. We hector the Turks in the most importunate manner about Cyprus, about the status of minorities, about the Armenian massacre. We damn them either way. If they repress signs of Islamic devotion, we call them authoritarian. If they do not, we call them fundamentalists. The truth is that there are many in this House who are determined, in Gladstone’s infamous phrase, to ‘turn the Turk, bag and baggage, out of Europe’. Their real concern is not about human rights. It is that the accession of a populous, proud and assertive Muslim country would retard their dream of a federation, of a country called Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I do not share their position, I recognise that it is a legitimate point of view. But it would have been better for all concerned had Brussels been honest, had it said ‘no’ at the outset and then settled down to work out an amicable bilateral relationship. Instead we shall string Turks along for perhaps another ten or fifteen years, wring painful concessions from them on foreign and domestic policy, force them to assimilate tens of thousands of pages of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and then, only then, turn them away.</p>
<p class="contents">This is no way to treat an allied nation, colleagues, a nation that guarded Europe’s flags for a half a century against the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union and whom we may look to one day to do the same against the totalitarianism of the religious fanatics. Turks are as entitled as any other people to their pride. By abusing them in this manner the EU risks creating the very thing it purports to fear: the rise of anti-western sentiment among a people who have long been our friends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A report of the European Parliament at the end of last year noted the slowing down of the reform process, and gave special emphasis to the fact that there is insufficient progress in guaranteeing women’s rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable that Turkish women suffer discrimination in nearly every area of life: in the labour market, in decision-making and in education, and that they experience considerable disadvantages in comparison with their male counterparts. Rights guaranteed by law are of no use if their implementation in practice is not ensured.</p>
<p class="contents">The political will of the Turkish Government can best ensure implementation of these rights. For this to happen, a social dialogue is necessary, involving organisations of civil society. Information campaigns would be the most effective way of drawing society’s attention to guaranteeing the rights of women.</p>
<p class="contents">The continued violence against women is shocking, and is unacceptable in a country which seeks to adopt the basic principles of European integration. It is the task of the Turkish Government to find suitable instruments for solving this shameful problem and for gradually phasing it out. To this end, the European Union can offer help by sharing the experiences of its programmes and best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">I am hopeful that Turkey is willing to accept a helping hand, and will truly take action to tackle this problem. I thank my fellow Member Mrs Bozkurt for her work, for the report is excellent and I recommend its adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Looking back many years ago, women in Turkish society were regarded more as objects than human beings. They have suffered enormously and it is only in recent years that this sad situation is beginning to be remedied. But although steps have been taken in the right direction, there is still very much that needs to be done. It is my view in fact that progress is not as much as we would have hoped for. Indeed, in large parts of Turkey, especially in the south-east, women are still treated as second-class citizens and are grossly discriminated against. Illiteracy amongst Turkish women is at record levels for a European-orientated country. Additionally, the degree and extent of violence against women is still unacceptably high and unfortunately is in many cases accepted as the norm by large sections of Turkish society. The despicable criminal and offensive activity of honour killings still happens only too regularly in Turkish villages and cities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the Turkish Government is making some efforts to correct matters. For example, much attention has been focused recently on better education for women and on educating the police and the judiciary in order to deal more appropriately with violence against women. A country-wide information campaign and stricter implementation of the law are taking place, but are not having the desired effect, because drastic changes also have to happen at a core political level.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Erdogan himself recently drew attention to the ‘deep state’ in Turkey that is opposing his Government’s reforms and is fighting against parliamentary democracy. This deep state, supported mainly by the army and other extreme nationalist elements, is impeding progress in Turkey – and incidentally, Mrs Resetarits – is keeping Turkish Cypriots isolated and Cyprus divided. Such forces do not want liberated women equal in all respects to men. It is our duty to support this report and bring liberation to Turkish women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, despite all the declarations of intent from the Turkish authorities and the pseudo-reforms undertaken in the area of human rights, the reality is that domestic violence, honour crimes and forced marriages keep increasing, and that discrimination against women in the workplace and in education still goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this finding should not make us forget that, while it is true that these violations of women’s rights are incompatible with the concept of human rights, as they are laid down, for example, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the fact remains that Turkey is not European and that its future should not lie in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, even when it turns out that all the economic, legal and social criteria laid down at the Copenhagen Summit have been met, Turkey, 99% of whose population is made up of Muslims and 94% of whose territory is located in Asia, will still not share our values, which bear the stamp of Christianity and humanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey is a beautiful country, a great country, with a courageous, proud and hospitable people. We should, of course, preserve the privileged relations that we already maintain with Turkey as part of the customs Union, but Turkey cannot and must not under any circumstances join the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this context, Mrs Bozkurt’s excellent report places great emphasis on how the situation of women in Turkey is evolving, for which the rapporteur deserves commendation. I should like to highlight a few of the report’s recommendations: incentives for the social partners to promote the involvement of women in social dialogue, calling on the Turkish authorities to establish a monitoring system to keep girls in the education system, a quota system operational in various countries – from the Iberian Peninsula to Scandinavia – to guarantee fair representation for women on electoral lists, instructions for judges to deliver severe sentences for ‘honour crimes’ and forced marriages, a campaign to promote the image of women as players driving economic and social development, and the inclusion of the social partners and some NGOs in the Advisory Board on the Status of Women.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Bozkurt's report is thus an excellent contribution to progress in assessing the situation of women in Turkey. Ladies and gentlemen, I must take this opportunity to tell you that there can be progress on the situation of women throughout Europe. Yesterday in Portugal, the Portuguese people voted in a referendum to decriminalise the voluntary termination of pregnancy. This was a great day for Portugal, and an absolutely marvellous day for women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it is wrong to think that Turkey is simply a country where a couple of things need fixing and that everything can be solved with a few new laws and rules or with the absorption of some tens of thousands of pages of <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, whereupon a new European Member State is allegedly created. This is absurd. First of all, Europeans are people who live within a very specific geographical European framework, and that framework does not include Turkey. In addition, Europeans are also people who form part of a very defined community of law and a community of values, which comprises, among others, gender equality. Other areas that play a role are culture, mentality and even religion, when this religion, as is the case with Islam, is not restricted to internal perception but wants to impose its outdated and, in many cases, totally reprehensible rules on the whole of the community. Returning to the subject of this report, I would say that Turkey is without a doubt the most modern Islamic country, but it remains, where women's rights are concerned, a backwater. Indeed, it is an Islamic country, where women are deemed inferior, something which will not improve as Islamicisation gains ground; quite the reverse. Let us therefore stop treating the symptoms, rather than the cause, which is the fact that Turkey may well be a neighbouring country, but can never become a European one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While appreciating the changes that have been made, it needs to be said that there is still a high level of illiteracy among girls and women in Turkey. Estimates provided by UNICEF show that every year between 600 000 and 800 000 Turkish girls do not attend school because their families forbid it or because just getting to school is difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Turkish women face other problems as well. Violence against women is common, and honour killings as well as forced marriages violate the fundamental human right to make one’s own decisions about one’s life. In some parts of south-eastern Turkey, girls are not even registered at birth, as a result of which they are deprived of rights such as access to education or health services.</p>
<p class="contents">Women play a very small role in Turkey’s political life, and the Turkish parliament does not have a permanent committee on women’s rights and equality. The Turkish Government must implement women’s rights legislation as soon as possible so that those rights can be effectively implemented in practice. Public institutions such as the courts, the police and the health system must guarantee to protect and afford all assistance to women reporting violence against them. The social partners should also play an important role by promoting the rights of women and organising debates or courses to promote the image of women as equal citizens of Turkey with an important role to play in their country’s economic and political life.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to congratulate Mrs Bozkurt on her important report, which I hope will contribute to further positive changes in the situation of women in Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to her good work, the issue of women’s rights is being treated on a par with other policies. I believe that you are making history in that regard, Mrs Bozkurt. Congratulations!</p>
<p class="contents">As someone who has been closely following this process, your first report, the extremely interesting working meetings that a delegation of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality held in Istanbul and Ankara, and now this second report, I must say that I agree with you that we must now ensure that the legislation on women’s rights is not revoked.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the improvement in the legislation in this field has, generally speaking, been a success, it is urgent that we create the appropriate environment to make it possible for the legislative reforms to be applied. It is very difficult to carry on making progress if the important changes introduced into the legislation are not implemented in practice. Women must be able to see their situation improve in their daily lives. It is not just a question of their having rights, but also of their being able to complain in practice when they are not respected. Only by speeding up the practical application of the legislative reforms throughout the territory will we be able to ensure that the new legislation on women's rights is maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that the Turkish authorities’ willingness to tackle cases of violence against women and to accept the use of positive action measures with a view to combating gender inequalities is particularly significant.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to highlight the government’s willingness to hold dialogue and to better coordinate with women's organisations active in the field of gender equality, and therefore the rapporteur’s request that the European Commission provide support in order to facilitate that cooperation seems to me to be highly appropriate.

Combating domestic violence against women: EUR 2.968 million. Strengthening civil society in the pre-accession process: EUR 2.5 million. Establishing shelters for women subjected to domestic violence: EUR 8.5 million. Through these and many other activities the Commission will continue to support that which is focused upon in this report.</p>

<p class="contents">On 4 October 2006, the European Commission adopted a regulation amending the rules governing airport security. It was certainly guided by the best of intentions. However, it acted in secret, Commissioner, by including in these rules an annex that was declared secret, and therefore hidden from the citizens for whom it is intended, and whose lives it directly affects.</p>
<p class="contents">This text, with its measures and their considerable impact on the entire European Union, was drafted in just one week. It therefore took the European Commission just one week to decide on everything that needed to be done. In the space of a week, the European Commission made a law compulsory for millions of people, on the basis of a secret meeting of the Aviation Safety Committee, held on 27 September 2006. The only information given to the citizens on this subject was given via a press note. The citizens learnt of the regulation directly, and exclusively, through a press note published by the Commission. And even the press note says in point 7: ‘and recognises that this measure is based on the US experience’.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that you can hear the interpreter, I shall switch to Spanish. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(ES) </span>This regulation lays down exceptions, the Commission has told the press. Since the regulation is secret, however, no citizen can apply these exceptions should they need to and should they be faced with someone abusing their authority.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the European Commission has created legislation that imposes obligations on the citizens, which restricts their rights, but which, as a result of its secret nature, cannot be applied by any court anywhere in the European Union. Commissioner, press releases and information leaflets do not yet carry any weight in the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the way in which these rules have been approved means that their application has been left to the Member States, which are applying them in an utterly chaotic way throughout the Union, and by a chaotic way I mean, in practice, an arbitrary way.</p>
<p class="contents">Each airport acts as it sees fit. In some places, a liquid cheese is seen as a threat to our security, in others it is not. In some places, a cake filled with cream is seen as a threat to security, in others it is not. What is a threat on the flight from Madrid to Barcelona is not a threat on the flight from Barcelona to Madrid. What is a threat in Zurich – because they also apply your rules – or in Heathrow, or in Charles de Gaulle, is not a threat in Milan-Malpensa airport.</p>
<p class="contents">There are supposed to be exceptions to this rule, Commissioner, for passengers in transit for example — you also announced this is in the infamous press release, in paragraph 16 — but in practice, nobody knows how to apply these exceptions to passengers in transit.</p>
<p class="contents">There are supposed to be exceptions for medicines, but nobody knows how the exceptions for medicines should be applied. Furthermore, amongst other things, nothing is said about medicines that do not require a prescription.</p>
<p class="contents">Your press release says that water is prohibited because it is very difficult to distinguish it from other liquids. Are there any bombs that can be drunk, Commissioner? We do not know.</p>
<p class="contents">You have created an entirely arbitrary system, which in some cases verges on the absurd, in the face of which the citizens have no mechanism for defending themselves against the absolute power of the uniformed private agent in front of them. With no defence, in the literal sense, the passengers have no rights. They must keep quiet and obey or cancel their journey.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the citizens have an almost blind faith in the notion that what the authorities do — and you are an authority, as are we — is for their own good and security, but we Members have the obligation — not just the right, but the obligation — to ensure that fear of terrorism is not used as a pretext for restrictions of freedom, which may be pointless unless they are well-founded.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament has not delegated powers to the European Commission to legislate in secret and impose obligations on the citizens, without any kind of jurisdictional control of their application. And it does not even have that power within the context of comitology. I would therefore ask the Commissioner, as other groups are also asking you, what impact analysis has the Commission carried out? What powers does it believe it has, within the framework of comitology, to carry out what it has applied here? What is the theoretical basis and what is the true basis, backed up by studies and reports? What other security models has the Commission employed?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, rather than promoting it, these measures seriously harm the image of security and the image of the European Union as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This process, in which we are informed without being allowed to enquire further or to seek a legal opinion, cannot remain as it is, for it creates a state of affairs that is ceasing to be sustainable. Even though these measures have been being implemented for some months now, passengers’ criticisms of them are no less strident. Why is this so? The reason is obvious, for we are now in the period of reflection. Let us consider that more closely. If a measure is understood to be directed against terrorism, nobody will reject it, provided that they regard it as necessary, understand what it is meant to do, and know that it can fulfil its purpose, but if – to take one example – people have the liquid for moistening their contact lenses taken off them and find later on that they can buy in the duty-free a bottle of whisky containing more than 100 ml, then nobody is going to think that that makes any sense at all, nor can the point of it be got across to them.</p>
<p class="contents">What is now needed is an explanation of where the logic is in depriving an airline passenger of a bottle of wine that he has brought with him when he can buy the same bottle in the duty-free shop later on. People have to have these things explained to them, or else they will not consent to measures that are needed in the interests of air safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a nuisance, and it has caused still longer waiting times at airports. It has to be asked whether there is any thinking person who believes that this procedure is likely to prevent even one terrorist act. The sole effect, if any, of such bureaucracy will be to make other places containing large numbers of people – for example, buses and underground systems - the replacement targets for acts of terrorism. Instead, all our efforts should be put into preventing terrorism by removing the causes of the hatred and bitterness that are the breeding grounds for terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">How did matters go so badly wrong? It is because the Commission rushed these arrangements through on the basis of secret memoranda of which the citizens were unaware and the quality of which the citizens’ elected representatives were unable to verify. I must therefore urge the Commission, in the strongest possible terms, to stop being so secretive and to reconsider these arrangements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am merely standing in for Mrs Mastenbroek, who could not be here this evening. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council has adopted Commission Regulation (EC) No 1448/2006 on aviation security, which contains a secret annex with restrictive measures on liquids that passengers are allowed to carry on aircraft in their hand luggage.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission explain and illustrate, firstly, how the secrecy of the annex can be brought to comply with the democratic principle of publicity of the law? Which sanctions are applied in the case of refusal to follow or of breach of the rules? How it is intended to avoid arbitrariness in the practical implementation of a secret rule and its exceptions?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, does this text provide for the passengers’ right for information and right of appeal? How can airline passengers contest decisions and sanctions taken on the basis of the new hand luggage rules on the spot or at a later stage and look for legal remedy?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what is the justification for these measures? Did the Commission carry out an evaluation of the information and evidence presented by the United Kingdom’s secret services upon requesting these restrictions? Was specialised expertise gathered before the decision was made? Are the measures based on proper risk assessment and will they yield an appropriate reduction of security risks? Will they be evaluated after implementation?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, have these measures been subject to an impact assessment on fundamental rights? Have they been deemed compatible with citizens’ rights, the free movement of persons and goods? On what grounds are these measures to be considered proportionate and necessary in a democratic society in compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights? Have these measures been subject to an impact assessment on consumer rights and the practical impact on airport operations and passenger flows? Was there any prior assessment of the extra costs consumers and airports will face after the implementation of the new rules?</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the aviation security implementing rules are developed by the Aviation Security Regulatory Committee, established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002. This committee only gets external advice from the stakeholder advisory group on aviation security. It is an informal body of aviation industry stakeholders. Would the Commission agree that this body needs to be formalised as requested by Parliament during the first reading of the ongoing revision of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002? Would the Commission accept the idea that this committee also needs systematically to take into account appropriate expertise on civil rights and consumer interests?</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, if I may add one personal question, Commissioner: what happened to my almost-new shaving gel that was confiscated at Brussels Zaventem Airport? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall also avoid repeating the threat that I made in committee of demonstrating in this Chamber the dangerous – albeit non-lethal – potential of mixtures that are easily made from materials to be found in duty-free shops or from other substances not subject to the restrictions that we are debating. Any ill-intentioned person could certainly use materials that can be found on board an aircraft or in any case acquired after boarding control.</p>
<p class="contents">On my frequent trips through airports, I have been saddened and, at the same time, amused to see full containers and harmless items being taken from passengers – mothers and babies not yet able to talk, elderly people perhaps having their first fraught experience of travelling, and other absent-minded travellers who, armed only with common sense but uninformed about the EU’s useless preventive measures, end up being deprived and disarmed of their shaving cream and shampoo, their lethal nail scissors, nail files and penknives, their drinks and whatever else they may have purchased from the duty free shops.</p>
<p class="contents">These controls are, of course, for the sake of everyone’s safety, but to what extent are they really keeping us safe and are not just silly, tiresome annoyances for passengers and additional burdens for both travellers and airport managers?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, since I do not know of any studies or research that have been carried out on the actual dangers posed by the banned articles or particularly on the statistical frequency of cases where these products have been used for criminal purposes, I wonder whether any studies or research might even have been kept secret, like the annex to the Commission regulation. How many hijackers have used nail files to carry out their crimes? How many have sprayed shaving cream over on-board equipment or held passengers and crew hostage with it? How many have been caught carrying chilled and cushioned cartons to keep their nitroglycerine stable? That would give me and the citizens of Europe a real sense of the need for the measures in question and of the secrecy now surrounding this enigmatic business. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I cannot let it be said that these measures were adopted in a rush and in secret, Mr President. I am going to demonstrate that they were not, even though I always find Parliament’s comments very useful and I listened to the speakers very carefully. However, I should really like to explain, first of all, why new rules restricting the presence of liquids in hand luggage on aircraft were introduced within the Community on 6 November 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, what is the reason for these restrictions? The measures laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006 should enable us to face up to the new threats created by home made liquid explosives. We have worked on the basis of information communicated by the Member States, in particular the United Kingdom, which indicates that liquid explosives are a genuine threat to civil aviation.</p>
<p class="contents">Last summer, on 10 August 2006, the British secret services uncovered a terrorist plot aimed at blowing up several aeroplanes in mid-flight, with the aid of liquid explosives. According to the results of the investigation, the explosives were home made, and created from chemicals that are relatively easy to acquire. The police discovered liquid explosives hidden in soft drinks bottles, which appeared perfectly harmless. The old security measures would not have made it possible to detect those explosives.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that information on how to make these kinds of bombs may be in circulation, and that the necessary ingredients are easy to get hold of, it was concluded that the threat associated with these devices was genuine. The honourable Members must know that it is possible to disguise the colour and smell of these explosives. Furthermore, they may come not only in the form of a liquid, but also in that of a gel or cream. A solution needed to be found that was both achievable and effective. The Commission wanted, on the one hand, a consistent approach to be applied throughout the European Union and, on the other hand, passengers to clearly understand the situation, so as to provide a uniform level of security in every EU airport and on every flight.</p>
<p class="contents">Imagine, ladies and gentlemen, if very different rules had been laid down in the European Union, without any coordination. Imagine the confusion that that would have caused, especially in the minds of passengers. The management of airport security would have been very problematic as a result. Could these difficult issues have been avoided? Could the Commission have dared wait for a real attack to take place on board an aircraft to show that measures were necessary? Could the Commission have made do with seeing the Member States implement a patchwork of disparate security rules that would have made transiting through Europe's major airports difficult and chaotic?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission thus examined this issue in cooperation with the Member States' aviation security experts and with the technical task force of the European Civil Aviation Conference, ECAC, which brings together experts from throughout Europe. Those experts advised the Commission to limit the authorised capacity of bottles containing liquids to 100 millimetres and the total volume of liquid to that held in a one-litre bag. They deemed that sufficient to prevent a home made bomb, made from liquid explosives, and of a size sufficient to cause catastrophic damage on an aeroplane, from being carried on board.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been in contact with the US authorities, which came to the same conclusion, and the approaches adopted on both sides of the Atlantic are compatible in every respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore decided to establish the provisions necessary to implement this coherent regulation throughout the European Union, pursuant to the framework legislation laid down in Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to procedural issues, because I cannot allow it to be said that we have not complied with the procedures. A number of MEPs had some fears about the way in which the security rules to be applied in airports have been revised.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you of the European legal framework. Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security constitutes the framework legislation. This regulation was adopted by both the Council and the European Parliament, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in the months following on from the World Trade Centre attacks. This regulation established the principle whereby the Member States must lay down common basic rules applicable to aviation security measures, with the aim of ensuring that these measures are systematically complied with throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as is often the case with particularly sensitive issues, this framework legislation does not take up all of the details of the common rules and of the measures laid down for the implementation of those rules. This information appears in annexes that may be adapted in accordance with the comitology procedures. In the case of aviation security, such recourse to comitology is required if certain details need to be able to be amended in due course so as to take account of new information. Many passages in these technical annexes contain sensitive data, insofar as they specify the methods for applying the security measures on the ground in airports. One cannot simply divulge certain precise information on airport security. Public access to these detailed implementing measures could help criminals and potential terrorists get round our security measures. That is why Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council specifically stipulates that this information is secret and must not be published.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules applicable to liquids carried in hand luggage are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006 of the Commission, and not, Mr President, in Regulation (EC) No 1448/2006, as is indicated in the questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EC) No 448/2006 also covers aviation security, but it lays down rules applicable to the explosive detection systems used in airports. May I point out at this stage of the debate that the nine other regulations were adopted by the European Union, that these regulations are in force, and that we followed the same procedures for this tenth regulation, which is the subject of our debate today?</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006, which we are discussing, includes an annex classed ‘European Union restricted’, which prohibits its publication in the Official Journal. However, there are no grounds to conclude from this that the adoption of this regulation has been marred by irregularities. It was approved by the EU Member States within the Aviation Security Regulatory Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It was after this committee had given its approval that Parliament, through your Committee on Transport and Tourism, received the draft regulation, pursuant to the comitology procedures laid down in Council Decision 1999/468/EC and in the framework agreement on relations between the Commission and the European Parliament. In a letter dated 4 October 2006, the Committee on Transport and Tourism informed me that Parliament had exercised its right of scrutiny and that no comment had been made on the draft measures.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be noted that the bodies representing the airline operators and airports fully supported the legislative proposal and played an active part in drafting the rules. It cannot be said that this regulation was adopted secretly and undemocratically. Frankly, if there was a procedural flaw somewhere, I would be the first to acknowledge it.</p>
<p class="contents">The following issue concerns the transparency of the rules. As I have already said, the aviation security rules, particularly those laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006, have not been published because potential terrorists could use them as a source of information. In that respect, the Community rules are no different from the national rules on aviation security.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted, however, that this regulation is intended for the competent authority of each Member State and that, pursuant to Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security, the Member States’ authorities are bound to communicate information to interested parties on a ‘need to know’ basis in accordance with the national rules applicable to the distribution of sensitive information.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that substantial efforts have been made and continue to be made to inform air passengers of what they can or cannot carry. What they need to know in order to prepare for their journey is pointed out to them, and if it appears that this information is not being clearly communicated to passengers, then the Commission will raise this point with the national authority in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have really taken it upon myself to champion passengers’ rights. I have shown this, not least in my dealings with airline operators, and we are currently conducting an investigation – I have briefed Parliament on the initiative of this investigation – to find out whether passengers’ rights are really being respected.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, I feel that I cannot be suspected <span class="italic">a priori</span> of not taking an interest in passengers. On this point, the message contained in your questions to me is loud and clear. These questions highlight the difficulty of the issue, but what I would like to say to you first of all is that the procedures have been followed to the letter, in accordance with our regulations, and that, while the application of the measures is causing problems, we are ensuring and are anxious to ensure that the Member States inform us of those problems and allow us – I will make the point, moreover, by replying to the other speakers – to evaluate this arrangement, which I hope will be a temporary one, insofar as developments in technology and equipment will enable us to better detect the risks that I mentioned in liquids.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, what I wish to say is that security still remains a major element of aviation transport in particular and that, while we had to take these measures, we did so with some reluctance; that there really was a risk; and what would have been said, within this European Parliament, and with good reason, if I had not made sure that the measures were consistent throughout the European Union? Just last week, I travelled to Washington, and I can tell you that we are doing everything in our power to ensure that passengers are subject to the same rules on both sides of the Atlantic. Clearly, if this were not the case, the problems would just be transferred to US flights and transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I wanted to show how much of an interest I take in each of the authors and speakers who are going to take the floor and yet reiterate too that, in this difficult matter referred to me, we, together with the Commission, have genuinely complied with all the rules, and I cannot allow it to be said that the measures taken were taken hurriedly and secretively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Good intentions are not, however, always put to good effect, as many of us, and many millions of ordinary Europeans discover on a daily basis when they are confronted, at European airports, with behaviour the rights and wrongs of which they are unable to judge and the point of which escapes them.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, there are three questions that remain to be answered. How far are these measures actually allowed to go? Where is the boundary at which harassment and arbitrary authority begin? I might add that people are not even dealing with officials, but rather, on the whole, with the staff of a security firm, who suddenly put their acting sheriff's hats on and demand everything conceivable of them. Secondly, are the annoyances to which passengers are exposed acceptably proportionate to the gain in security? Thirdly, do these measures really enhance security or are the powers-that-be merely covering their own backs?</p>
<p class="contents">Until such time as we are able to examine for ourselves the actual legal documents by which the inspectors are guided, we will not be able to ascertain whether or not we are being treated properly, and until such time as credible risk assessments are carried out and communicated to the public in proper form, Europeans will be unable to judge whether what is being done is right and proper and really does enhance security or whether – as some feel – it is being used as a form of harassment, something that will end up rebounding on the European Union in a way about which none of us can be indifferent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, in the final analysis, what matters is that we strike the right balance between two things that are very dear to us and that can appear conflicting at times, namely the pursuit of the highest level of effective security and a sense of security on the one hand and protecting fundamental human rights, citizens’ rights, including the right to privacy, and the free movement, to which we have grown so accustomed, on the other. The consequences of the measures that have been taken were quite spectacular: longer waiting times at security check-in, confiscations of large amounts of perfume, drink and other consumer goods, but also many questions the answers to which were only slow in coming, such as what to do with liquid medicines and other items.</p>
<p class="contents">One could say that the rapid reaction of the European security agencies can be interpreted as a sign of decisiveness. On the other hand, we are also faced with two types of questions, the first one concerning the effectiveness of the measures, for we all know that a number of exceptions will inevitably be made for such persons as medical staff, for example, and so we are justified in asking whether well prepared, well informed terrorists would be stopped by these measures, while vast numbers of people are left to suffer the effects. I understand that the Commission will be planning an initial assessment this spring. This is to be welcomed, and should be done on a regular basis. In addition, we should also keep an eye out for side-effects on such things as personal freedoms. This balance is at risk of being lost, and this requires a democratic debate, as we are having this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to a second fundamental issue, which is the democratic control over decisions of this kind and hence the involvement of this House. Commissioner, I am convinced that the Commission has purely formally complied with all the rules. There is no doubt in my mind about that. Indeed, a few days before the regulation was formally ratified, a number of members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism – and I was there – managed to verify the lawfulness of the draft regulation; they did so individually, alone, without staff, without taking legal advice first, without any form of consultation. We were therefore able to conclude that the committee of experts has taken a decision in accordance with the regulation that applies in this context. Allow me, Commissioner, to say that it has become apparent that the comitology procedure applied to this issue is inadequate. We will therefore need to join forces in order to look for ways of holding a truly democratic debate on sensitive issues of this kind that have a major impact on our citizens' way of living. To make it absolutely clear, I am not arguing in favour of Parliament being able to decide on the types of scanners used at airports or determine when a threat is alarming. What is important, though, is to become more involved, more so than today, in the thorough assessments and the impact analyses, for example.

Air passengers that rely on medicines can take these with them if necessary during the flight. These passengers must carry a note with them and if upon arrival, it transpires that their luggage has once again not arrived and they do not have the rest of their medication, then that is their bad luck. It is difficult when you depend on heavy medication. It is unclear where passengers can lodge complaints or appeal in the event of security officials mishandling the situation. As yet, there is no uniform explanation whatsoever in the 27 Member States. If in Member State A, mozzarella is regarded as suspicious, then this presents no problems in Member State B, and so, Commissioner, this confusion among passengers, which you just mentioned, is still there even though there is European legislation in place. What is clear is that the measures are far from watertight. I still try it every time at random airports and I always manage to get a bottle of about 200ml through security. Democratic societies are open societies. It is this openness that makes them appealing and successful, but also, unfortunately, vulnerable. The tendency to minimise that vulnerability to terrorist attack by imposing more rules on society and by taking away some of the privacy, appears to many to be an understandable first reaction. Where, though, does one draw the line? The reasons seem increasingly far-fetched. Of course we should not underestimate the threat, but to what extent does this threat justify these – what does, after all, amount to – far-reaching measures which were issued in quick succession in the past few years and whose effectiveness is far from obvious? For let us be honest, Commissioner, what lacks more than anything in the discussion is insight into the supposed effectiveness. In other words, do all measures taken and planned really give us extra security or is, above all, a false, and expensive, sense of security being introduced? The hand luggage rules have been in place for more than three months. I should like to find out from the Commission and Council, whose absence this evening is unfortunate, whether they consider the rules to be effective and if so, on what basis. Containers full of shower gels, alcohol, water bottles, lotions and suchlike have meanwhile been confiscated and destroyed. What does this produce, Commissioner, other than a considerable cost and much irritation? Are you still convinced that these rules are a bitter necessity in the fight against terrorism? Is this a permanent or temporary measure? If temporary, how do you define temporary?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, of course the procedure followed is lawful. Nobody is in any doubt about this. Do you, though, also actually take the view that this procedure represents a proper manifestation of European democracy? Is this procedure, as you see it, adequate for what we think democracy in the European Union stands for? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Could we have some common sense applied to this issue?</p>
<p class="contents">Several decades ago, the opponents of European integration claimed that the policies of the European institutions at the time led to wasteful butter mountains and wine lakes. The imagery associated with this catch-cry created an unfair and damaging negative perception of the EU when it was in its infancy.</p>
<p class="contents">The new mountains and lakes imagery, which is likely to feed Euro-scepticism today, can be seen in Europe’s airports, where massive volumes of duty free are being confiscated every day from transit air passengers as a direct consequence of the new aviation security measures, signed off behind closed doors without democratic accountability and introduced on 6 November 2006. Under these regulations, as my colleague said, 20 tonnes of duty free products are confiscated every week from passengers travelling through Frankfurt Airport, 1 500 litres of alcohol and perfume daily at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport and 10 000 items every week from transit passengers at Madrid’s Barajas Airport. It therefore comes as no surprise that these actions are causing immense frustration and annoyance to those affected, who blame the EU for their personal financial losses. It is legalised robbery!</p>
<p class="contents">But the story does not end there: fear of having duty free purchases confiscated has meant that increasing numbers of air travellers have stopped buying goods at third country airside retail shops. This will spell economic disaster for European businesses, as many of these non-EU duty free outlets are owned by European companies, such as Ireland’s Aer Rianta International, which has outlets all over the Middle East, Russia and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland has a particular interest in this issue: after all, we invented duty free shopping in the first place, and duty free outlets throughout the world have provided a valuable showcase for selling iconic Irish products which have contributed significantly to the Irish economy, such as Irish whiskey and Baileys.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not support any change in a policy which would undermine the safety of our airports or airlines. However, common sense should prevail, and I urge the Commissioner to enter into bilateral agreements with countries in which airport security is at least as good as that which exists at European …</p>

<p class="contents">I have been slightly surprised at the ferocity of the attacks by some of my colleagues on this system. It is clear that there is a serious and more subtle threat to airport security than we have ever faced and that the screening of hand baggage needs to be made as easy as possible. As the Commissioner rightly said, liquid explosives can be disguised as very innocuous substances, and a patchwork of 27 separate regulations would have been unacceptable. I therefore support the initiative he took in introducing these measures but, as he rightly says, these measures can be improved and need to be examined in the light of experience.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to follow on from what Mr Ó Neachtain and Mrs Doyle have said about duty free in transit from third countries. Many Scots have returned to the UK via Frankfurt Airport, Schiphol Airport and other airports and had the duty free they had bought as presents confiscated at the airport. That is unacceptable. As has been said, it has had a serious impact on the sale of duty free – 12% in EU duty free shops, 40% in some of the third-country duty free shops. Scottish whisky uses duty free as a shop window for its sales and does so very successfully. This process has hurt EU companies and it is undermining the confidence of consumers in duty free.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to suggest a very simple solution, as did Mrs Doyle, i.e. that we try and encourage third countries to adopt the tamper-evident bags that we use for duty free inside the European Union. I would argue that this does not undermine European Union security and, indeed, can enhance it if we encourage our third-country partners to improve their security at airports by adopting this system. If we have mutual recognition this will ease flows within airports and prevent a lot of the personal grief that is created around this issue. I hope the Commission will look seriously at this and consider entering into immediate bilateral agreements with suitable third countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I look at the situation positively. Alcohol that has been confiscated and not drunk is healthier. To me there is no theoretical aspect to the issue. I am one of the millions of victims of this regulation. Like one of my predecessors, my shaving cream and deodorant have been confiscated on two occasions. At the same time, on two occasions I successfully carried a knife in my hand baggage. Granted, it was a penknife, but it was far more capable of doing damage than my shaving cream.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, there is no consistency in this. In addition, the levels of restrictions vary depending on the airport. At some airports you can carry more in your hand luggage, in others less. These regulations should be identical, which would make them easier to accept. But everything is done in an atmosphere of secrecy which causes irritation and leads to obstinacy.</p>

It is fine to talk about citizens’ rights, but safety is of paramount importance, and the most fundamental right of any passenger is the right to, and the guarantee of, travel safety. I genuinely believe that the people who are talking most and criticising the regime in place would be the very first in here if we had another 9/11.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is a problem, Commissioner, because every single day thousands and thousands of litres of duty free alcohol, perfumes and make up are confiscated, as has been said, from transit air passengers arriving at EU airports. These passengers have broken no law whatsoever in bringing these products into the EU – products that can be found in any high street shop in any part of the UK, Ireland or elsewhere in the EU. They are confiscated because of the aviation security rules that were introduced on 6 November, and this has resulted in significant falls in sales. Many of these items being confiscated are well known nationwide. We are talking about, for example, worldwide brands, which include, as has been said, Irish whiskey and Scotch whisky, French perfume, Finnish vodka and Spanish wine; I could go on. Furthermore, many of the third country duty free outlets are European. As has been said by my colleague Mrs Doyle, Ireland’s Aer Rianta owns shops in the United States, Russia, Canada and the Gulf States among others. Germany’s Heinemann owns duty free shops in Turkey, South Africa and the Balkans. Spain’s Aldeasa group has duty free outlets in South America.</p>
<p class="contents">However, solving the transfer passenger problem is relatively simple, as has been said by my Scottish colleague. The travel retail industry and producers have proposed that airports with large passenger flows into Europe introduce the same airport and airport retail supply chain security that exists in the EU. Once recognised by the EU, this would allow passengers departing from these airports and transferring at an EU airport to use a standard tamper-evident bag, just as passengers do within the EU itself. Mutual recognition of airport security standards between the EU and non-EU countries is the solution. Will the Commission consider taking action along these lines as a matter of urgency? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, like some others, I should like to concentrate on the consequences of the implementation of the aviation security regulations after 6 November, which have particularly affected, among the other areas already mentioned, my own region of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received a large number of complaints from constituents who have had their duty-free goods confiscated as they transited through EU airports on their way home back to Belfast in Northern Ireland. This is primarily a problem for transit passengers coming from third countries; the people from my constituency have suffered tremendously simply because, when they are flying back to Northern Ireland from outside Europe, they have to come through some other airport within Europe, be it Heathrow, Schiphol or even Frankfurt, before they make their way home – we do not have direct flights as other areas do.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that concerns me as a Northern Ireland MEP is the fact that there has been, as I have learnt, a considerable drop in duty-free sales airside from third countries, and certainly as one of Northern Ireland’s oldest and most prestigious products is a whiskey called Bushmills – Mr Martin would like to hear that, I am sure! – a considerable amount of which is sold worldwide in duty-free shops. Any drop in the sales of that will affect the economy and jobs back home. I am sure you understand that very well, Commissioner, because your own country equally suffers from the continued drop in sales of prestige French products, such as perfume, champagne and wine.</p>

That does not prevent me from understanding the difficulties associated with applying the regulation and from remaining alert to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am completely open, contrary to what you said. I am open in most cases; the recent visits I have made to Zurich and Washington, in particular, testify to this. On these occasions, I submitted to the same rules as all other passengers; I was even subjected to a fairly systematic search in Zurich.</p>
<p class="contents">Like you, I understand the problems and I do not want to give you the impression that I regard this debate as totally useless. It is important for me to clearly understand the difficulties, and I am grateful to many of you for helping me to understand them. A word of warning, however: just because the controls have flaws, it does not mean that all controls should be condemned. The same applies to speeding on the roads. Just because the controls carried out have shortcomings, it does not mean that those controls are useless.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to try to respond to some of the points raised, then I will draw some conclusions. I should like first to remind you that we have drafted some fairly detailed guidelines with the aim of ensuring that the rules are applied as uniformly as possible in all of the Member States. That is one thing.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised the problem of transfer passengers. I am going to respond to you in more depth. It is true that we now have to go through the International Civil Aviation Organisation to conclude bilateral agreements. You are right, that is how we should proceed. I believe that we need to resolve this matter of transfers, which is currently unsatisfactory. We fully agree on that. We will have the opportunity, during the International Civil Aviation Organisation General Assembly, to raise the problem and to see what can be done in relation to third-countries. You are perfectly right, and I wanted to stress that.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say to you that I am very aware of the problem of duty-free sales. I myself have received the Irish representatives, who have very solid experience of the duty free system, and you are right in thinking that I myself, as a Frenchman who hails from regions in which prestige products are promoted, am also worried. I do not think that the solution is perfect, but, in view of the regulations that we have adopted, I think that we have tried to find solutions for duty free. However, I too am still very conscious of this problem, and you can obviously write to me personally in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr El Khadraoui was right in saying that an assessment really needs to be carried out. I should like to confirm to you, ladies and gentlemen, the commitment made by the Commission to re-examine the regulation on a regular basis. Given the developments in technology, the first re-examination – which is currently in preparation – will obviously have an impact on the situation in airports and will affect passengers. You are therefore right, regular assessments need to be carried out. An assessment is under way and, without prejudice to the confidential nature of certain provisions, I will be quite willing to give an account of it.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of research, you state that technology would enable us to avoid restrictive measures for passengers, as a result, for example, of the installation of detectors that are capable of assessing risks. That is obvious. A research effort is therefore required in this instance. During my stay in Washington, I also saw how we could cooperate with the US research services to design equipment that would enable us to avoid these restrictions. This is clearly a major element.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not respond to a point raised in the first part of the debate. It relates to issues concerning the Stakeholder Advisory Group on Aviation Security, known as SAGAS. The Commission created SAGAS so that it could record the opinions of the various industry sectors. It is true that the Group is vital. When Parliament proposed at first reading to amend the new framework regulation aimed at formalising SAGAS, Mr Berman, the Commission gave its support. And I confirm that support. Parliament is absolutely right to want to formalise, as it were, the structure of SAGAS. However, it is true that the opinions of SAGAS only sustain the work of the regulatory committee. Every initiative taken into consideration by the committee is examined by all of the Commission services, and attention is paid to aspects such as civil rights, consumer rights and legal aspects, before the Commission makes a decision.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware that I have not responded to everyone. I was asked a question about whether the interim measures will be temporary or long-term. I am convinced that, in this area, we can be hopeful that new technologies and equipment will enable us, at some point, to suspend these emergency provisions on the basis of the unanimous – I must say unanimous – evidence of the experts from each of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the reasons why we have laid down these rules. Have no doubt that, for me, as someone who is very attached to the development of air transport and to the comfort of passengers, it is with some reluctance that I must oversee the application of this regulation. I can tell you that this debate has been useful and that we will remain more mindful than ever of all the problems that many of you have raised, but that is without forgetting that the security rules will only be genuinely effective if they are applied by the entire international community. In this regard, the body that oversees civil aviation worldwide, the ICAO, also needs to be able to take up the issue quickly and allow us to pass as many bilateral agreements as necessary with third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, while thanking the MEPs who have spoken so frankly, I should like to assure them that the procedures have indeed been complied with. However, I am well aware of the many everyday problems caused by the application of these measures; I remain conscious of them and I will take them into account in the very precise assessment that the impact of these measures requires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is why new – more restrictive – security measures have been implemented in airports, and I fully endorse the process under way. Nevertheless, attacks on the freedom to travel should remain proportionate.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, while I support the bulk of the measures taken, I remain sceptical about the restrictions on liquids in aircraft cabins and about the way in which they have been decided. Indeed, these measures cause a great deal of bother and many drawbacks in practice for people who travel, and they are not proven to be effective, so different are they from one State to another, and even from one airport to another. Moreover, the MEPs, as elected representatives, were informed of the implementation of these measures only after they had been decided upon.</p>
<p class="contents">I am perfectly aware that some information cannot be divulged because of its highly strategic nature where the fight against terrorism is concerned, but I believe that we should be more involved in the decision-making process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Day-to-day life on Europe’s airports is characterised by impenetrable rules that frequently vary from one airport to another, by hopelessly overworked staff and frequently despairing and angry passengers, who find themselves, for example, deprived even of their contact lens solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It is because it is to the detriment of passengers that they are told they are being kept safe, while that cannot be guaranteed in a crisis situation that the Commission and the Council must revise the relevant regulation. What is needed is for reasonable, understandable and effective rules to be laid down in good time for the holiday season, and it would be sensible, when drafting them, to listen to those who have to put them into practice in airports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title17"></a><a name="creitem17"></a>
