<p class="contents">We are making efforts to preserve and strengthen the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity, unity and stability of Lebanon. The European Union upholds the Lebanese democratic institutions and the legitimate government of the Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are concerned because of the long-term paralysis of the Lebanese institutions. This has been going on since November 2006, and when in November 2007 the President's position became vacant, the paralysis became even more critical.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from being the largest financial donor to Lebanon, the European Union has been making efforts through intensive diplomatic activities also to find a solution for the country's political paralysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework we support the efforts of the United Nations, Saudi Arabia and the Arab League. Thus the European Union upheld the three-part plan, which the foreign ministers of the Arab League unanimously adopted. As is well known, this plan envisages the immediate election of a president, the forming of a government of national unity, and the adoption of a new elections act.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of expressing support for this plan, the Lebanese political parties differ in their interpretation of its execution. There are two main obstacles for the realisation of the proposal. The first one is internal, because the parties cannot reach an agreement regarding their representation in the government, the sharing of ministerial posts, and the new law on elections. The second obstacle is connected with Syria, which refuses to give up its influence in Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of everything, the plan of the Arab League is, at this point in time, still the only initiative which can contribute to the resolution of the political impasse in the country. We expect that the General Secretary of the Arab League, Mr Moussa, will continue with his efforts to resolve the existing situation. In this respect the European Union will provide him with every support.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent summit of the Arab League, held in Damascus at the end of March, regretfully did not bring the desired results required for the resolution of the situation. Because of Syria’s interference in the presidential election procedure, Lebanon expressed its protest by not sending their representative to the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this, I should like to emphasise the commitment of the European Union to the viewpoints set out in a number United Nations Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Another demonstration of the European Union’s support of the efforts of the United Nations is its participation in the UN mission in Lebanon. Member States have contributed the largest share of the military force in Lebanon. Despite numerous attacks, during which six members of the Spanish contingent were killed and three Irish soldiers were wounded, the mission has been successful, and in August 2007 it was extended for another year.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union Member States also support the establishment of the special United Nations Court for Lebanon in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">Also worth mentioning is that in 2007 the EU–Lebanon Action Plan came into effect. This instrument is an upgrading of the existing cooperation within the framework of the Euro–Mediterranean Committee for the Barcelona Process, and activities within this framework have already commenced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many other developments in the Middle East – especially events in Gaza – have recently occupied our attention. This should, however, not make us forget the strategic importance of Lebanon for the region and as a partner of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The present situation in Lebanon is extremely worrying. The deep political crisis continues: on 24 March, the parliamentary session to elect a President was postponed for the 17th time since November 2007. The Summit of the Arab League in Damascus has not delivered a solution either.</p>
<p class="contents">While the security situation has remained relatively calm with no major incidents, public tension and anxiety have increased. Violence could break out at any moment as the political crisis goes on, with unforeseeable consequences for the country and its people.</p>
<p class="contents">Indications that Hizbollah has replenished its military capacity since 2006 are worrying, especially in the light of the recent threats against Israel, following the death of Imad Mugniyeh. Moreover, the protracted crisis is having a very negative impact on the socio-economic situation in Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, Europe is active at many different levels to help Lebanon: we remain the biggest contributor to UNIFIL, and the European Union has also been the most important donor at the Paris III Conference. We have been firmly supporting the Arab League’s Initiative since it was launched in January 2008 and our Community instruments have allowed us to provide a targeted response to some of the major challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Neighbourhood Policy has developed into a major instrument to support Lebanon’s reform process and to contribute to economic and social stabilisation, even though reform efforts are severely hampered by the current political stalemate.</p>
<p class="contents">What are our priorities for the immediate future? Continued support for the implementation of the Arab League Initiative remains our key priority. Despite all difficulties, this initiative enjoys broad support and it represents for the moment the only option to find a solution. An important date in the process will be 22 April, when the next presidential election session in the Parliament is scheduled.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of a special Lebanon Summit within the Arab League framework has recently been floated. If it materialises, we should see how we can best provide support for this initiative. We should note, however, that it is Syria that currently holds the Presidency of the Arab League.</p>
<p class="contents">A clear and continued commitment to the full implementation of the Security Council resolutions relevant to Lebanon also remains essential, indeed crucial. The publication of the next implementation reports on UN Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701 – in May and July 2007 respectively – will therefore be essential milestones.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also continue efforts to maintain momentum in the Middle East peace process, which has an impact on Lebanon. I remain in close contact with my Quartet partners and am looking forward to the Middle East conference planned by the European Parliament later this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is now the 17<span class="sup">th</span> time that the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, Nabih Berri, has postponed the planned vote to elect the President. This decision has not been taken because of a lack of consensus on the figure of the candidate for the presidency, who, as everyone knows, is a Maronite Christian, nor because of a lack of consensus on the person – the head of the armed forces, Michel Suleiman. This was clear to us as a delegation of MEPs who were in Damascus with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and representatives of Lebanese opposition parties, such as Hezbollah and Amal.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem, Mr President, comes down purely and simply to the distribution of power; it is about establishing blocking minorities in the Lebanese Council of Ministers and about allocating the positions of head of the secret service and head of the armed forces. This whole situation, as the Commissioner rightly said, seriously affects the credibility, functioning and international image of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore want the European Parliament to call for the current opposition forces to find a solution, in order to put the higher interests of the country before these internal issues, so that we can continue working, as we did in the EU electoral observation mission promoted by the Commission, towards a sovereign, democratic, free, viable Lebanon that can be constructed in peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is feverish external activity on the part of the Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora, and the Speaker of the Lebanese parliament, Nabih Berri. These two strands of diplomacy that I would say are running in parallel, but until now have not been communicating, represent the dialogue of the deaf that has been dragging on for months between the majority and the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, any attempt to contribute to solving the crisis in Lebanon must necessarily take account of both the internal and the international situation. In fact, all the Lebanese forces have strong links outside the country, some of which are tighter than others. Against this background it will be important to assess the results of the summit taking place today in Sharm el-Sheikh between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. It would be useful if an extraordinary meeting of Arab League Ministers could be called as soon as possible, as requested by Prime Minister Siniora, to try to bring Damascus to a position where it respects Lebanon independence.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, however, I would not leave out an analysis of the truly unique socio-economic situation in that, despite the crisis that followed the war, Lebanon saw its GDP grow by 4% in 2007. However, the social situation is very difficult. A general strike has been called by the trade unions for 7 May, in a bid to raise minimum wages, and according to UN data, one million Lebanese out of a population of four million are living below the poverty line on less than two dollars a day.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to help with finding a solution, let us ensure that 22 April is not wasted, not least because 21 August looks like it will be an impossible date to get through. This is the date the candidate for the Presidency has given for his resignation as head of the armed forces because he has reached the age limit. If a solution has not been found by that date, the crisis will spread to the army, as well as bringing an end to the candidacy of General Suleiman for good.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish with the words of Prime Minister Siniora: ‘Lebanon cannot be governed from Damascus, but it cannot be governed against Damascus either.’ This seems to me a balanced position, and a benchmark for any initiative by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say ‘almost’ because I think that ultimately we need to bear in mind certainly Damascus, certainly other capitals, but in particular the fact that in Lebanon what they are facing, in apparently new forms now, is a policy of systematic assassination of one’s opponents. The more popular they were, the more likely the former communist leader, and all of them, were to be killed in this series of assassinations.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore can – and must – certainly pay attention to the diplomatic dimension, but unless we remember that in today’s Middle East, as in Europe in 1937, 1938 and 1939, what is being faced is on the one hand an assassination policy and on the other the political reality of victims in the name of freedom, even of enemies, I do not believe we can find the right direction, a direction that can only be given by Europe if it remembers that it was itself delivered from having to renounce national sovereignties, for which reason we have not had wars in Europe in recent years, except in Yugoslavia and elsewhere. That was the imperative, and should also be so in the Middle East: to have something based on freedom and human rights as opposed to the ostracism and blackmail of the dictatorships of the 1930s, and those today in the Middle East and Far East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This proposal could be carried out in the next few weeks as, given the deterioration of the situation in Lebanon, we cannot remain impassive, and Lebanese democracy is one of the weakest links in the Middle East.</p>

<p class="contents">On one side there is the United States, quick to play the Lebanese card against Syria and Hezbollah as part of its pro-Israeli stance to try to stabilise an area devastated by its illegal war against Iraq and to consolidate the military might of the State of Israel. It cannot allow itself to lose Lebanon. On the other side are Iran and Syria and their allied regimes that are playing out their contest for political, military, nuclear and regional supremacy in Lebanon. It does not matter if this means massacre, even the physical massacre, of the Lebanese. They do not want to lose Lebanon either.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s role is not to align itself with one or the other in this international chess match. As Europeans we need to do what we can to try to keep Lebanon politically united, by protecting its sovereignty and encouraging dialogue between the government coalition, Hezbollah and General Aoun, starting with the presidential elections. The person elected must be a candidate both parties are happy with. That is Lebanon.

The answer is actually too simple for words, and I am convinced that the Council and the Commission are also well aware of this. In any case, my clear answer is: start with the disarmament of Hezbollah. A highly efficient, heavily armed organisation outside the legal authorities’ official means of exercising power is obstructing the normal functioning of the Lebanese state institutions and has so far also blocked a national political compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Simple answers to international crises are often difficult to put into practice. This certainly also applies to the urgent disarmament of Hezbollah; after all, the spectre of renewed civil war is looming. On the other hand, Hezbollah’s continuing position of military power is guaranteeing the continuing influence in domestic affairs of its two great sponsors, Syria and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The consequence of this is obvious: the real threat of a further violent confrontation with neighbouring Israel. Besides, the connection with Tehran’s present hardline nuclear course is evident.</p>
<p class="contents">Council and Commission, what solution will Europe supply to this Lebanese dilemma?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have one further brief question. According to reports in today’s US press, a Member State, Bulgaria, is channelling profits from the drugs trade to Hezbollah. I should like the Council to tell me what the situation is. An EU Member State earning money for Hezbollah from the drugs trade – that strikes me as particularly serious. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all attempts and initiatives on the part of European bodies, I believe we are acting as though we have abandoned to its fate a people ensnared in successive political crises.</p>
<p class="contents">Our treatment of the situation is awkward. We seem not to realise that the situation in Lebanon is connected with the challenges in the Middle East and that these challenges are crucial for international security and peace as well as for the EU’s strategic plans in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Parliament should be made to understand clearly that we in the EU must adhere to the commitments made in our partnership with Lebanon. This obliges us to support the legally elected government, which was formed after the last elections in accordance with constitutional requirements, and which today is the target of attacks and threats.</p>
<p class="contents">We must demonstrate our support through deeds. As Mrs Napoletano has also said, we are not giving enough money, because we are keen on an outcome that resolves the crisis and ends insecurity. Such an outcome requires institutions to function. Parliament has to work as a forum for democratic dialogue and state control; it has to voice the diversity that is an essential part of Lebanon’s identity.</p>
<p class="contents">A certain parliament is still closed, not just for the election of the President of the Republic, but for all business. If any way is to be found out of the crisis, the President of the Republic needs to be elected immediately and a new government must be formed in accordance with the Constitution. Regional forces competing with each other ought not call the tune, as currently seems to be the case in the presidential election. We must also demonstrate our support for the Lebanese seeking the truth behind political murders. Hundreds of thousands of people are demonstrating in the streets, waving ‘We Want The Truth’ banners.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the EU must act more effectively and strategically in the region. We must promote responsibilities and genuine interests. We must also find possible resolutions and peace in the states in the area and in the Arab states. There must be understanding and national dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me end on an optimistic note. I believe that the political powers have acted responsibly: events could have led to civil war and a coup, but this did not happen. Let us therefore make the most of these positive elements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The crisis that this country has been experiencing for several months obviously goes beyond the challenges of a simple presidential election or the formation of a government. We know that it is the very foundations of the political system that are in question, based as they are on the subtle balance between the different religious faiths in the Lebanese patchwork.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also in question is the place Lebanon hopes to take in the regional arena. Does it want to be an aircraft carrier of the United States and their allies in the region, or the advanced post of a so-called Shi’ite crescent? I do not believe that Lebanon really has to choose between the American camp and the Syrian/Iranian camp. The only viable camp for Lebanon is the camp of Lebanon itself.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly not for the European Union to interfere in Lebanese internal affairs. Europe does not have to support one coalition over another. What the European Union can do is offer itself as a mediator, help the Lebanese parties to find a minimum of trust in each other - which is essential before any agreement can be reached - and put forward its good offices to launch a process of understanding and compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">We are right to support the Arab League’s plan based on a triple consensus: one president, one government of national union and the reform of the electoral law guaranteeing fair representation of all the components of Lebanese society. That is the condition <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for the political secularisation that is provided for in the Taif Agreements and that a growing majority of the Lebanese people want to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">We must support every initiative to achieve this. In this regard, the proposal by Nabih Berri, speaker of the Lebanese parliament, which proposes to revive national dialogue, is a positive signal. Just as we have done for many years, we must continue to support a Lebanon that wants to be sovereign, united and at peace with itself at last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Council has been making efforts in several ways. Some of you, amongst others Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou and Mrs Napoletano, have emphasised that sending money and financial funds to Lebanon is not enough, and that just electing a president will not be enough either.</p>
<p class="contents">This is true. However, in Lebanon and in connection with Lebanon the European Union is doing much more. Here I should like to express gratitude to Carlos Carnero González, who, like myself, in his introductory contribution emphasised the considerable commitment of the European Union in the area of security through its military forces, a commitment which has already cost lives. However, that is not nearly enough. The Presidency of the European Council agrees that it is necessary for the European Union also to play a political role.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage we must not forget that the Arab League initiative, which the European Union supports, is on the table and that the ongoing efforts of the Secretary General, Mr Moussa, deserve to be supported; and the European Union does support them and will continue to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall be adapting our actions in connection with Lebanon to suit events as they unfold. I have already mentioned that the presidential election alone will not resolve all the difficulties. A new government will also need to be formed, an electoral reform will be necessary, and, of course, we shall continue to strive for all of this.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that a resolution of the political crisis would also have an effect on the economic situation in the country. And in making these efforts, the Council and the European Union remain committed to providing support for Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a country with a huge potential; and that is why we wish to help it and are determined to provide all the assistance that is within our scope, so that Lebanon can achieve political stability and full economic prosperity as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall report its contents to my colleague, Benita Ferrero-Waldner.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that we – that is, Parliament, Council and Commission – share the basic view that we will certainly continue to support our long-standing partner, Lebanon, in this very critical phase. Given the complexity of the challenges Lebanon currently faces, it is indeed essential that, as European institutions, we coordinate our efforts as much as possible and take full advantage of our capabilities. The European Parliament has already made valuable contributions to our cooperation with Lebanon in the past. A good example is the European election observation mission at the 2005 parliamentary elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed one of the key tasks ahead is to help Lebanese democracy to become more robust to face challenges like the present crisis. Electoral reform is a crucial element in every initiative that is expected to make a lasting impact on Lebanon’s political system. In this context, the European Parliament, with its particular expertise and know-how, can – and, I trust, will – play a key role.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also true that the conflicts in the region are interlinked, as was underlined by several speakers. As you know, Lebanon and Israel have never reached a peace agreement. Lebanon hosts 400 000 Palestinian refugees partly because Israel and the Palestinians have not yet reached a peace deal. Part of the Hizbollah’s <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> is the ongoing occupation by Israel of the Shebaa farms. Therefore, from the point of view of the European Union, a sustained and lasting solution can only be achieved through a comprehensive approach to the peace process. Solving one track of the peace process will help in other areas, but no one track can be secure without progress on others. Certainly, reaching an agreement between Israel and Syria could help to diffuse tensions in Lebanon, and therefore we have thrown our full support behind the current political process. We are hopeful that progress can be extended to other tracks in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hannes Swoboda, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. − <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, and the other fellow Members in particular, who have helped in producing a good, very balanced report.</p>
<p class="contents">My philosophy on this report is as follows. I might perhaps mention a visit I made a few weeks ago to Vukovar – which, as a reminder, is the town where the war was particularly brutal, where hundreds of people were dragged out of the hospital and killed. It is a particularly painful wound for the Croatian population. I have also seen the memorial there and I have talked to the people. The wound goes deep, but no hatred, no rejection of neighbouring Serbia has emerged, but instead an attempt to cooperate anew with the Serbian population there.</p>
<p class="contents">The mayoress has sat down at the table with the Serbian representative and colleagues from other ethnic groups and together they have represented the interests of the people there. This shows clearly – perhaps more clearly even than the fact that the country’s Deputy Prime Minister comes from Serbia, which is also to be welcomed – how this country has tried passionately to overcome the schisms, conflicts and wars of the past and to create a modern Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">All these things, of course, do not resolve the problems that Croatia still has to solve. They do not resolve the issue of the reform of the judiciary or of the public administration, nor do they resolve the issue of the shipping industry – Croatia still has much to do there. Therefore, it is simply not the case that we are ready to conclude the treaties and negotiations – absolutely not. We are, however, on the right track, and that is something that is important for Croatia, but also for the entire region, as the region is also being sent a positive, an important signal with Croatia’s accession: if you fulfil your duties and responsibilities, if you do your homework, then you can become a Member of the European Union. The European Union has to stand by this obligation, and that is something we also make clear in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the internal reforms, there are, of course, needs and a few problems, including in relations with the country’s neighbours. I was sad when it was unilaterally decided to introduce the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone. It was not that there were no good, substantial or objective reasons for ecological administration of the fisheries, but it did not make sound sense to take this step unilaterally at the same time as promising Italy and Slovenia that no unilateral steps would be taken before finding a common solution. Now, Croatia has taken that not-so-easy step and the fishing zone has been abolished for the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament now believe that the preconditions exist to overcome many of the impasses there have been – I do not want to put up for discussion here whether or not these were justified. Hence my request to Slovenia – Minister Lenarčič is here as a Council representative rather than as a Slovenian minister; he has to wear two hats – as well as to our Slovenian fellow Members in this House, is to help us overcome the bilateral problems. Croatia must, of course, play its own part in this, as we have always said, but if we want to convey the European spirit to the regions or to bilateral relations, we need this help.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, also, the proposal in the report – I am saying this now very informally – that a third person or a third institution help to solve this problem. Whether we call it mediation or arbitration or whatever is not the crucial issue. What is crucial is that both countries, Croatia and Slovenia, come together to decide the conditions, and that they accept the judgment to be given by the third institution, by mediation. Things will then be on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems in the border area cannot be insoluble. I perfectly appreciate Slovenia’s interest in having access to the sea. This is a perfectly justified concern. I believe that this concern of Slovenia’s is perfectly reconcilable with Croatian interests. This is not insurmountable if we are not deeply and directly involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to state clearly that I should have liked to have been able to conclude negotiations on the part of Croatia in 2008. Unfortunately, this is no longer possible or realistic. I would therefore ask my fellow Members to take a realistic date, 2009, as the date for the completion of negotiations, so that the newly elected Parliament will then be able to give its assent and ratification to take effect.</p>
<p class="contents">If we all apply ourselves, Croatia can become a Member of the European Union in 2011. This is a fine aim, a good aim. Let us give it our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Erik Meijer, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. − <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, if the seven states of the former Yugoslavia all come to form part of the European Union in future, this will have happened on seven different dates as the result of seven different ‘road maps’. Accession <span class="italic">en bloc</span>, before the federation broke up, would probably have been easier for all concerned. Slovenia is now a member, Croatia will follow within the next few years, and the third former Yugoslav republic concerned is Macedonia, which has been awaiting the opening of accession negotiations since back in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that my subsequent annual report, at the start of 2009, can be all about normal domestic developments in Macedonia, including care for the environment, independence of the media, improvement of the judiciary and the fight against corruption, modernisation of the railways, equality of the various religious denominations, and freedom of negotiation for the trade unions. This will be possible if the two problems leading to discord that are attracting the most attention are solved definitively. We have not yet reached that point.</p>
<p class="contents">Relations between the two major language communities have improved greatly since the major conflict of 2001. The Ohrid Framework Agreement that followed, and in particular the agreement on qualified parliamentary majorities and administrative decentralisation, has made an important contribution to improving mutual relations – which are not yet free of conflict, however – resulting in a temporary parliamentary boycott and a short-lived governmental crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in everyone’s interests that the problems underlying this be solved as quickly as possible. In a multiethnic state, the complete equality of status of regional languages, including in administrative communication at national level, is an essential symbol of the complete equality of all inhabitants. Macedonia can learn from more than a century of linguistic conflict in another bilingual state, Belgium, that delaying this inevitable outcome just leads to unnecessary tension. The desire for everyone to be able to use the Albanian language everywhere must be taken seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the issue that, at the preparatory stage, not only the rapporteur but also all the shadow rapporteurs believed had to be resolved quickly, is still receiving the most attention. We all refuse to side with either of the conflicting viewpoints of the two neighbouring countries regarding the significance of the name ‘Macedonia’.</p>
<p class="contents">To the candidate country, looking back over more than a century, Macedonia has been, successively, the name of a resistance movement against the Ottoman Empire, of a Yugoslavian federal state, and of an independent country. To its southern neighbour, Greece, Macedonia is an important part of its own long history and the name of the region around the Greek city of Thessaloniki.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece has invested a large amount of capital in its northern neighbour and is the most emphatic supporter of the country’s accession to the European Union. It is an important step forward that Greece has abandoned its attempts to replace the name ‘Macedonia’ for its northern neighbour with ‘FYROM’, a term completely incomprehensible to everyone, in favour of emphasising that this state does not cover the whole of historical Macedonia, but only the Slav and Albanian northern part.</p>
<p class="contents">I have always opposed the view that a state – particularly one formerly under Communist rule – must become a member of NATO before it can be admitted to the European Union. In Macedonia’s case, the refusal on 2 April to admit this country to NATO does affect its chances of joining the EU in the near future. Each Member State has the opportunity to block any newcomer, even if it would like to admit this newcomer if there were not a difference of opinion on one sensitive detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, section 37 is central to this debate. In this connection, and in agreement with the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I tabled a compromise amendment this morning. I await the reactions to this before my second turn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are glad that the European Parliament has placed the discussion on the progress achieved by both the candidate states on the agenda of this session. This is because the Slovenian Presidency attaches exceptional importance to integrating the states of the Western Balkans into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should like to remind you that at their informal meeting at the end of March the foreign ministers communicated to the region of the Western Balkans a positive message concerning its European prospects. At this difficult time for the region, in my opinion, such a message is welcome and appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as regards Croatia: the accession negotiations with Croatia are proceeding according to plan and at this point I would like to express my agreement with Mr Swoboda’s view that, over the last two years, Croatia has made substantial progress in meeting the accession benchmarks.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixteen out of 35 negotiation chapters have been opened so far, and two have already been provisionally closed. Two accession conferences with Croatia are scheduled, one in April and another in June; and provided that all the benchmarks are met, several other new chapters will also be opened at the two accession conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise that the Slovenian Presidency is committed to continuing the process of expansion of the European Union and achieving further progress in negotiations. The dynamics of negotiations depend primarily on the candidate state itself, and on its progress as regards the meeting of the benchmarks. These have been determined within the negotiations framework, in the revised accession partnership which the Council of the European Union adopted in February this year, as well as in other legal acts.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, Croatia has achieved considerable progress; however, the fact is that a lot of work remains to be done. As was stated by Mr Swoboda, in the future much more attention should be paid to further transfers and effective implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. Croatia must continue its efforts to meet the benchmarks and achieve faster progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I would like to mention the following: the reform of the judiciary and administration, the fight against corruption, economic reforms, minority rights, the refugees' return, and full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">The documents I have mentioned also consider it essential for Croatia to continue making efforts to achieve good relations with neighbouring countries. Of course this includes finding solutions for the unresolved issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to move on to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: as Mr Meijer stated in his report, this is the only country with candidate status since 2005 which has not yet commenced the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, once the benchmarks are met, this situation should be finally resolved this year. That is why the message conveyed in the European Commission's latest document was that the autumn report on progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia could be positive, provided the key priority tasks are fulfilled. And a similar message was also communicated at the foreign ministers’ informal meeting in Slovenia at the end of March.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must not forget that the country has already proved its importance for stability in the region. The country's role must be recognised, and it must be encouraged with positive signals to continue its constructive role in the region, and to continue with its reforms. One such signal is the dialogue on visa liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We concur with Mr Meijer's opinion that the government in Skopje has been implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement, especially in the sphere of decentralisation and the level of ethnic minorities' representation in the public administration. Our wish is that progress be made as soon as possible in finding solutions for the remaining issues, which are crucial for the Albanian community.</p>
<p class="contents">As the country presiding over the EU Council, Slovenia has been encouraging all the political parties to step up their political dialogue and systematic cooperation, so that the next stage in the process of joining the European Union can be achieved this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to emphasise how sorry we are that, because of the open issue of the name, the latest negotiations have failed to bring the desired results. Also, I regret that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has not been invited to become a NATO member. Considering that the country has made considerable efforts to secure this invitation, we hope that it will soon follow in the footsteps of the other two candidates, who have each received such an invitation.</p>
<p class="contents">In its statement, following the NATO summit, the Slovenian Presidency has called for the negotiations on the name issue to be continued, and to be concluded as soon as possible. The Slovenian Presidency also called for all the politicians in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to preserve the achieved level of unanimity as regards their country's European and Euro-Atlantic future. The Slovenian Presidency has also recommended that the country should take full advantage of the time that is still available before the Commission produces its regular autumn progress report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Mr President, I welcome Mr Swoboda’s report on Croatia and Mr Meijer’s report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">On Croatia, I find that the Swoboda report addresses the main issues where Croatia will face challenges on its path to the European Union, focusing particularly on the political sphere. It is a solid report that will reflect realities even better if Amendments 15 and 16 by the rapporteur are adopted, for instance concerning the timetable of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia’s accession negotiations have generally been going well, although they have been affected by the application of the ecological and fisheries protection zone – the famous, or infamous, ZERP issue. I welcome the recent decision of the Sabor, the Croatian Parliament, to suspend the application of all aspects of the ZERP for EU vessels, in line with Croatia’s earlier commitments. I commend Prime Minister Sanader for his leadership and I also thank Commission President Barroso for his personal involvement in settling the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I visited Zagreb in early March and found that Croatia’s European vocation was strong enough to settle this problem if it was hampering the accession negotiations. The removal of this obstacle by Croatia should allow chapters that have been blocked to be unblocked as of now and negotiations to resume again at normal pace, allowing for substantial progress in the remaining months of the Slovenian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I do agree with the rapporteur and with Mr Lenarčič that Croatia has much work ahead. Concrete progress is needed in judicial, administrative and economic reforms, in the fight against corruption and on refugee return and minority rights. Croatia will also need to continue to make progress on various open bilateral issues with its neighbours. This year could be a decisive one in the accession negotiations, provided that a number of conditions are met by Croatia. The Commission is ready to present in this autumn’s enlargement package an indicative timetable, or a conditional road map, for the technical conclusion of the accession negotiations in the course of 2009, preferably even during the mandate of the present Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve this, Croatia needs to deliver on all opening benchmarks by June. There is not much time to waste. It will also need to comply with all obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and ensure urgent and significant improvements in the management of the EU’s financial assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ready to process negotiating positions in the various chapters once benchmarks are met. Essentially, the ball is now in Croatia’s court. The sooner concrete results are achieved, the sooner Croatia will join the European Union. I fully agree with Mr Swoboda that Croatia can become a leading benchmark for the Western Balkan countries showing how they can realise their European perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I can by and large share the assessment of the Meijer report regarding the reform process. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation with the Commission services on the report. Following the granting of candidate status in 2005, there was a slowdown. However, the Commission’s rather critical progress report of November 2007 has been followed by corrective actions. Important reforms have been adopted since then, especially to strengthen the judiciary, reform the police and improve inter-ethnic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I note the recommendation that the Commission should develop a set of benchmarks for the opening of accession negotiations this year. I would like to inform you that we have established eight benchmarks, derived from the key priorities of the new Accession Partnership. A recommendation to start accession negotiations will depend upon the progress which the country has made in meeting these benchmarks. We shall make our assessment in the coming autumn in the enlargement package, which will most likely be presented in early November.</p>
<p class="contents">Evidently, political stability will be essential for success. I met President Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Gruevski in Skopje some weeks ago, in March. I called upon all political forces in the country to concentrate their energies on the reform agenda in order to take advantage of the opportunities which this year holds for the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat this call today, as it is no less important now, in the aftermath of the NATO summit in Bucharest. The name issue has consumed much political energy lately. While I congratulate Croatia and Albania on their success in Euro-Atlantic integration with NATO membership, I can understand the disappointment felt in Bucharest last week by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I encourage the political leadership to continue on the road towards NATO and EU integration with full determination.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by noting that we are discussing developments in the two countries at a very appropriate point in time. Both countries are in a position to make this year a very special and even decisive one in terms of getting more and more integrated with the European Union. Support and encouragement from the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will be highly important for these countries. Therefore, I very much appreciate your invaluable contribution to our European policy of stability and progress in the Western Balkans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We hope to be able to conclude the negotiations with Croatia by the end of this year, or by next year at the latest. We hope to be able to begin negotiations with Macedonia by the end of this year, or by next year at the latest. We want to prevent both countries becoming hostages to bilateral problems, and I appeal in particular to our Greek fellow Members to show movement on this issue, as the erroneous decision taken in Bucharest is already starting to destabilise Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Croatia, the Sanader government has been actively pressing ahead with reforms and negotiations. I appeal to the Council and Commission to keep up with the pace of work. I appeal to the Commission actively to strengthen its capacities and to process the relevant documents quickly. I appeal to the Council to open all the negotiating chapters as quickly as possible. When they are closed naturally depends on the negotiations and on Croatia’s efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia has done a massive amount of preliminary political work. It has settled and resolved the issue of fishing zones with great courage, it has endorsed arbitration with Slovenia, and it has above all sent a signal of great significance to the entire region by appointing a Serbian Deputy Prime Minister to the Sanader government, and this in the light of the situation Mr Swoboda has rightly described in Vukovar, for example. Protection of the rights of minorities that goes way beyond what most Member States guarantee in terms of minority rights is taking place there.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to say that we should acknowledge Croatia’s political achievements and decisively support the country on its way into the European Union. We are abiding by the ambitious aim to take a decision in the current period. Should this not be possible, it will be the autumn. We would support your motion, Mr Swoboda, if it contained ‘latest’ and ‘should’, but ‘could’ is only a status report, and we shall therefore keep up the pressure on the Council and Commission. We know that this is ambitious, but Croatia deserves to see justice at long last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To begin with, compliments to my colleague Mr Swoboda, who has succeeded this year, too, in presenting us with another balanced report. When we talk about Croatia, we are talking about the final steps that the country has to take to enable the conclusion of negotiations. Hopefully these final steps will take the form of a final sprint.</p>
<p class="contents">The gaps ascertained by the Commission must be filled. We hope that this can be done apace, even though, as is always the case at the end of negotiations, the dossiers concerned are difficult ones, for example the dossier on shipbuilding. I would appeal to everyone, including the Government of Croatia, to reach the necessary political consensus within the country, too, so that even the difficult decisions can be taken quickly. I also concur with Mr Swoboda’s words about the dates by which all of this, particularly the conclusion of negotiations, can take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding FYROM – Macedonia – it is important, as the Commissioner has already said, that the country endeavour to reach the Commission’s benchmarks this year, so that a decision can be taken on the start of negotiations. I believe this to be fundamental. It is true of Macedonia, too, that a consensus must be reached in the country itself; I am very concerned in this regard about recent problems with the Albanian minority and the vote being held in Skopje tomorrow or the day after, which may lead to the fall of the government. If this were to happen, the country would be at sea, as there could be no negotiations with Greece over the name or any work on the benchmarks to which the Commissioner referred. I think that it is important to appeal to everyone in that country to ensure that the consensus holds and to prevent us being faced with a situation of new elections in the next few weeks; it is important to invest in this consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we, too, think it a shame that no consensus could be reached in Bucharest on Macedonia’s accession to NATO. In our opinion, another attempt must be made, based on mediation by the UN and Mr Nimitz, and I hope that both sides invest in a somewhat more productive atmosphere, so that a solution can be found quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us hope that this is now over, and the negotiations will pick up momentum once more. The Croatian Parliament’s decision to suspend the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone that had been applied to European Union Member States has certainly helped in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years Croatia has achieved a great deal that warrants recognition: there can be no denying that it is a functioning democracy; it has a functioning market economy and is implementing the provisions set out in the Stability and Association Agreement. At the same time, however, there are undeniably serious problems that also need to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these I would like to mention is procrastination over the reform of the judicial system – this cannot be delayed any longer. I believe it is important to strengthen the fight against corruption, and ensure that it extends not only to more minor cases, but also to the ‘big players’, as Croatia has not made much progress so far in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Improvements need to be made as regards efficient use of Community resources, and major structural reforms must be initiated. In this context I would like to highlight the situation and role of the shipbuilding industry, which is in need of restructuring. If Croatia manages to do all this, then it really ought to be able to conclude the negotiations in time, within the deadline set in the report, and must be given every possible support to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia’s accession process has a regional significance reaching far beyond the process itself. If Croatia’s accession is successful, it represents a model and an incentive for the other Western Balkan countries too. Prompt and successful conclusion of the negotiations is therefore not only the joint responsibility of Croatia and the European Union, but also in their common interests. I hope that Croatia will assume this responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, I would like to congratulate Hannes Swoboda on the outstanding job he has done in carrying out his duties as rapporteur. Thank you, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very good report. It is a very good thing that Croatia and Macedonia may obtain membership of the Union before the 2009 European elections. In respect of the latter we must clearly avoid adding political conditions for accession, especially in spheres that, like property rights or indemnity claims, belong to the sphere of bilateral relations. The process of enlargement cannot be allowed to be hostage to such tensions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a broader context to this process. Enlargement of the Union into the Western Balkans is a European contribution to stabilisation of this region – a region in which we failed in the 1990s. For this process to be completed, we must also send a positive signal to Belgrade. By recognising Kosovo, we have placed the pro-European section of public opinion in Serbia in a very awkward position. We are left with little time to go even part of the way towards balancing out that impression.</p>
<p class="contents">A road map for a visa agreement with Serbia is needed. We should sign a stabilisation and association agreement as a matter of great urgency. Today this agreement has become hostage to the internal policy of two Member States, but the whole Union may have to pay the price of stopping it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all the tangible efforts, however, we must not forget certain problem areas that still require comprehensive reforms before Croatia is able to join the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, the facts are the only reliable benchmark for a country’s readiness for accession. Examples are the clarification of unresolved border issues, the fight against corruption, administrative reform and respect for human rights. Cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is another benchmark for the country’s readiness.</p>

It is comforting that Europe has at last taken a position on an issue concerning it, as there is usually little enthusiasm to take a position when others are making decisions.

This new republic has not yet learnt European diplomatic practice, having placed its hopes on accession to ΝΑΤΟ simply because of US promises and infantile, misguided hopes of liberation from bondage.</p>
<p class="contents">In negotiations between European states provocation and fanaticism should never be an option. Choices should not be made on the imaginary basis of ancestry, neighbouring cultures and history; instead, we should act in a spirit of consensus, comprehension and, above all, probity in order to find a solution rather than worsen problems. A positive approach will benefit FYROM, which we hope will be helped to join both ΝΑΤΟ and the EU. If FYROM refuses to accept the name chosen for it and persists in this refusal, it will find that there are obstacles to its accession, because it has undermined its own efforts. If its efforts are undermined now, perhaps its future will also be undermined. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Each year in Skopje, the memorial plaque of the Bulgarian woman Mara Bouneva, a fighter for Macedonia’s freedom, whom the French press named ‘Macedonia’s Charlotte Corday’, is desecrated. In 2007 this desecration was accompanied by a physical assault on Bulgarians and on Macedonian citizens identifying themselves as ethnic Bulgarians.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time the Macedonian government put such manifestation of hatred against Bulgarians under restraint because such manifestations of hatred do not belong in the European Union.</p>

The report is good throughout. It is well balanced and gives an objective description of developments in Macedonia; commending what has been achieved and appealing for a little more time to be devoted to what remains to be done. But, as so often before, the debate is reduced to discussing our various views of the dispute over the country’s name rather than working out how we can get Macedonia into the EU as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know what happened at the summit in Bucharest. I will not go into who was right or wrong or who had greater national interests to defend, but I have to say that foreign policy is not just a matter of who is right and who is wrong. Foreign policy is about getting solutions which best serve peace and security in one’s own country or region and, in our case, Europe. This is achieved by a mixture of goodwill, compromise, good diplomacy and clear leadership. To prevent a country in southern Europe from becoming a member of NATO when the possibility arose is, to my mind, not a particularly wise move, given the complexity of the situation in the Balkans right now and all the challenges we face: independence in Kosovo, which is a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>, the departure of the government and new elections in Serbia and still-ongoing police reforms in Bosnia.</p>
<p class="contents">But to block the EU membership of a Balkan country, or even just to think of doing so, is not just unwise but downright dangerous! Only three hours ago I spoke with a colleague here in the European Parliament who said: ‘If they don’t do as we want, we can block them, not just in NATO, but in the EU. The law entitles us to do so’.</p>
<p class="contents">My reaction is to say: then we must change the law! Surely laws are not there for us to block, disrupt or blackmail one another? Surely they are there so that we can all get along together as best we can in a peaceful and secure Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">It is my firm opinion that, the sooner all the Balkan countries are in the EU, the sooner we shall have a secure Europe. There is absolutely no doubt that Macedonia belongs to Europe and that Macedonia should be brought into the EU as quickly as possible. I urge you to support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its successful negotiations will help all other neighbouring countries to make additional efforts to gain candidate status.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to overcome the dispute over the name, external initiatives are required. Symbolic gestures are necessary both in Skopje and Athens, as well as perseverance. Now is the right time to look for a less provocative name for Skopje Airport, and to condemn the disrespectful treatment of the Greek flag. However, any further difficulties and the discrimination which holders of Macedonian passports are subjected to in connection with Greek visas are also unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, we are building a community of modern post-national states. Mutual respect of differences and national identities is also an issue of respect for fundamental human rights. Only in this way can we prevent, or at least limit any negative consequences of the feeling that one's nationality is threatened. We need to abolish the visa regime for all the countries in this region. However, also required is a rapid and permanent solution for the country's name and a comprehensive alliance between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece. Peace and stability, and fast and successful Euro–Atlantic integrations are in the interest of both the states and all the nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Commissioner, and Mr Lenarčič, the Slovenian Presidency ought to table the Macedonian question for the next summit. There is no need whatsoever to wait until autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">And one more thing about Croatia: by implementing the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone, Croatian politics was hoisted by its own petard. In the future such surprises will not be possible.</p>
<p class="contents">If this adventure has taught us something so be it, but if they have not learnt anything, then all the words and vows about finalising negotiations in 2009 is just dust in the eyes. No one needs dust in their eyes: not the citizens, nor the economy, nor the neighbouring countries, nor the European Union. What we now need is a success story.

Integration of the Balkan Peninsula without Croatia is not feasible. It should also be stressed that the last two years of cooperation have brought unexpectedly good results, and this undoubtedly bodes well for the process of integration with the European Union. Obviously there are certain areas where more resolute action is needed. In my view, however, the efforts made by this state should be given their due, and the whole of the EU should support such action. Over the last two years Croatia has made laudable progress in most of the areas covered by Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would consequently express the conviction and the hope that with mutual engagement and suitable support from other Member States, negotiations will be successfully completed in time for the accession treaty to be finalised before the European Parliament elections in June 2009. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Rehn has said that we are encouraging Macedonia to move forward in the reform process. ‘Yes,’ we all say in unison, ‘we want negotiations to be opened this year.’</p>
<p class="contents">However, we still need to name names. The party who has put paid to Macedonia’s ability to enter into alliance commitments is Greece, with its veto against the country’s membership of NATO. There is admittedly a naming dispute, but we cannot ignore the fact that, in 1995, Greece made a binding statement, valid under international law, agreeing that the naming dispute would never be an obstacle to Macedonia joining the international community, the EU or NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">Greece has broken this internationally binding agreement, and if we want to impose reforms in this regard, I say that Greece is in breach of European criteria and not Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a step backwards, it is a slap in the face of a small state that is really making every effort to go along with us and open negotiations. I would also say, therefore, Mr Swoboda, that the sleight of hand to stop, or postpone, tomorrow’s vote again further risks destabilising the government in Macedonia, encouraging as it does the nationalistic forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The actual problem is that with Greece we have an allied country that refuses point blank to recognise any kind of minority in its own country. This is contrary to the Copenhagen criteria, which is embarrassing to the European Union and to the alliance.

Therefore, we should not be putting any unnecessary obstacles in its way. With the settlement of the fisheries dispute, Croatia has once more affirmed its readiness for EU membership, and the Croatian Government is also strengthening its efforts to combat corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Croatia’s rapid admission, which has now come within its grasp, should not in my view lead to automatic entry for any other states. As is generally known, Macedonia is having to battle with not only corruption, but also economic problems and the rule of law. Particularly with regard to Kosovo’s declaration of independence, it remains to be seen whether the ethnic peace with the Albanian minority can continue in the long term. We must not repeat the mistakes of past enlargement rounds. The EU must in my view finally wake up to the fact that unresolved conflicts, cultural differences and socioeconomic problems do not vanish into thin air with accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As chairman of the Croatia-EU Joint Parliamentary Committee, I feel that recent months have brought a favourable turn of events in Croatia’s Euro-Atlantic integration process. A few weeks ago, Mr Barroso outlined the road map for concluding accession negotiations by autumn 2009, and last week Croatia received an invitation to join NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">Both of these developments are an acknowledgement that Croatia is on the right track, and the international community is rewarding the efforts of the Croatian government. It is no coincidence that the Eurobarometer result in Croatia has risen above 60% again for the first time in a long time. I also think it was a remarkable and wise attitude that led to our Croatian friends’ decision not to enforce the fishing protection zone in the case of European Union Member States in the interests of Croatia’s membership of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of Kosovo’s independence, the government of Mr Sanader has likewise pursued a moderate course by aligning itself with the majority of EU Member States and recognising Kosovo’s independence.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the fact that the Croatian Serb minority has been given the post of deputy prime minister in the current cabinet has contributed greatly – as others have already said – to stability in the region and peace among the different ethnic groups. I believe it is unfair on the part of the Slovenian Prime Minister to announce that he would not rule out vetoing Croatia’s accession to the EU because of the border issue between the two countries. EU enlargement and the fate of a nation must not be tied to resolving a bilateral dispute over borders.</p>
<p class="contents">The report carries a positive message in that it recognises the progress made by Croatia as regards stability in the Western Balkan region, as regards ensuring the country’s economy is ready to compete in the European Union context, and as regards institutional reforms and adoption of European Union legislation. Alongside the positive points, however, the report does not shrink from mentioning the challenges that face us: reforming the judicial system, combating organised crime and corruption, bringing refugee returns to a conclusion, and resolving or alleviating bilateral tensions.

Both reports are excellent. As a Socialist Group shadow for the report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I would like to thank Mr Meijer for his serious and honest cooperation during the making of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia hails the achievements in the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which deals with the political aspect of inter-ethnic relations. The report comments on economic performance, the adoption of several crucial laws on prosecutors, and progress in the fight against corruption. On the negative side, we regret the signing of the Bilateral Immunity Agreement by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the United States, which grants exemption from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in contradiction of EU standards and policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The report calls on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece to increase efforts to overcome the dispute on the name of the country. That should in no circumstances become an obstacle to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s membership of international organisations. On the name issue, the report does not criticise either of the two sides. It only encourages both sides to carry on negotiations, despite what happened at the NATO Summit in Bucharest last week. Fortunately Javier Solana said yesterday in the European Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee that negotiations on the name will continue. If the two sides agree, NATO can take a decision to invite the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia immediately, even at ambassador level, so a new summit will be needed. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia could get a date for the start of accession negotiations this year. The European Parliament should give a clear lead for the country towards European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU’s long-term objective is the accession of all Balkan countries. For this objective to be achieved, results are also expected on the part of the countries themselves. A common European future is the joint task of the Member States and all the Balkan countries. We Nordic countries are no stranger to historical conflicts, but are now working together. The Balkans, like the Nordic region, are bound together by a common history, common languages and a common culture throughout their length and breadth. It should be possible, therefore, to launch a process of cooperation to ensure peace and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, there are a number of cooperation agreements between countries in the region. Why not go one step further? Taking inspiration from Nordic cooperation, the Balkan countries could establish a cooperation forum along the lines of the Nordic Council or the Baltic Council. Intensifying the existing regional political cooperation in the form of a Balkan Council will enable these countries to enter into practical, forward-looking cooperation, which will offer an opportunity to stabilise the region and make those countries that are not yet Member States or official candidate countries more prepared for accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first step, of course involves meeting accession requirements and complying with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. Although FYROM has made progress, it must continue its journey of reform as stressed both in the Meijer report and in various other reports by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The second step concerns internal policies and social cohesion. It must continue to abide by the Ohrid Agreement, especially as far as the Albanians and also other minorities in this multi-ethnic country are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The third step is resolving the differences between FYROM and its neighbours in accordance with the Salzburg Declaration. Let me stress here that Greece was – and continues to be – at the forefront of endeavours to achieve the accession of all the Balkan states to Euro-Atlantic structures, since it firmly believes that the development of the countries in the region will benefit all.</p>
<p class="contents">For Greece, however, the name issue is not simply a historical, psychological or emotional problem. It is a genuine political issue for all Greek citizens, as it concerns the European values of good neighbourliness and regional cooperation. May I remind you that Greece agreed to FYROM being awarded the status of accession candidate subject, of course, to the proviso in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2007&amp;nu_doc=0663">COM(2007)663</a> that a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue be found through negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should point out that even after the postponement in Bucharest of an invitation to FYROM to join NATO pending the resolution of the name issue, Greece is in favour of continued negotiations. In fact, it has taken the generous compromise step of suggesting an acceptable composite name, so all that remains for the other side to do is to meet Greece halfway.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to believe that compromises will be reached regarding the few points still to be clarified, enabling us to go ahead with the vote in Strasbourg. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is quite an achievement for a country which only a decade ago was practically at war. Equally, however, that is not enough to eliminate the challenges still facing both Croatia and the EU on the way to completing those negotiations. The timetable is extremely tight; practically each day counts, irrespective of the different dates advanced for the finalisation of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when I visited Zagreb some time ago at the head of the delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I took note of the determination of the Croatian authorities to do away with those problems and achieve membership of the Union. In this respect, the recent decision of the Croatian Parliament to exempt the EU states from the application of the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone (ZERP) following Commissioner Rehn’s visit, is both a testimony to that determination and is an important step in the right direction. I am convinced that, with the right administrative capacity to implement the required legislation, Croatia, in both the EU and NATO, will be a solid factor of stability and progress in an area that still needs our full attention. I congratulate Mr Swoboda on all his work reflected in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Croatia plays a key role in the democratic development of the Western Balkans, and it is immensely important that the process should continue. We saw that, for understandable reasons, it slowed down somewhat during the Croatian election campaign and the formation of a new government, but now I really hope that the process will put on some speed. As previous speakers have noted, the timetable is extremely tight.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the temporary lifting of the restrictions in the Ecological Zone in the Adriatic. It is a positive signal for relations between Slovenia, Italy and Croatia, but environmental considerations must continue to weigh heavily in our treatment of this unique marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia still has a great deal to do as regards the reform of the legal system and the judicial process. Far too many people still have to wait far too long for a verdict on their cases. This must be prioritised, and the country’s administrative capacity must be developed and expanded.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the work done by the EU Committee of the Croatian Parliament, which is headed by my good friend Vesna Pusić. We now hope that the negotiations will be excellent and that they can be concluded rapidly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate him on it. It shows the progress Croatia has made, such as its exemplary legislation on minorities, its constructive cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, its increased commitment to fighting corruption, and above all the agreement of Parliament and government regarding the fishing zone, which has been particularly difficult to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia and the European Commission now have to bring all their resources to bear to negotiate the forthcoming chapters quickly and satisfactorily. An international arbitrator should have the opportunity at long last to resolve the border issues between Slovenia and Croatia. Croatia has a key role to play in the region and should be admitted to the European Union soon. Bilateral issues must not be an obstacle.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Macedonia, I can tell you that I was at a conference there at the weekend and the mood is really very agitated following the rejection by NATO. People feel they have been unfairly treated. Mr Meijer’s report shows the stony path the country has already successfully trodden. There is certainly a great deal still to do, but when the naming issue continually hangs over everything like the Sword of Damocles it is difficult to move on in other areas of policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been monitoring the situation there since 1992 and would like Macedonia and Greece to find a solution at long last to the dispute regarding the name, particularly for the young generation. Both sides have made concessions in recent weeks and both must take another step closer to each other. I would find it incompatible with our European values and actually irresponsible if a veto were once again to provide the opportunity to bar the country from joining the European Union.

Frankly speaking, the people of Macedonia deserve far better treatment from us.</p>
<p class="contents">With the independence of Kosovo and the recent failure of NATO accession, the situation is even more complicated. In Macedonia there are separatist elements on one side and nationalists on the other who try to challenge the stability of the country, and the Bucharest decision does not help the situation at all. But perhaps our Macedonian friends can learn at least one lesson from Bucharest. It is not enough to get the support of the US. Many decisions depend on the common accord of the Member States, not only in the European Union but also in NATO, and any Member State may use its veto.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the latest events Macedonia should reconsider its standpoint on exempting the US from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Many mistakes were committed on both sides – by us and the Macedonian politicians – but we cannot punish ordinary people for our mistakes. That is why at least in the field of visa liberalisation we should act quickly, assisting the Macedonian people to travel, learn and have closer contacts with everyday European life. Three and a half years ago when I was elected Vice-Chairman of the EU-Macedonia Joint Parliamentary Committee, I had many optimistic plans on how to improve our relationships. Very few of these ideas were realised. I hope at least in the field of visa liberalisation we can make a step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Macedonia Mr Thaçi recently caused a collapse of the coalition government and demanded federalisation, bilingualism and recognition of the Skanderbeg flag.</p>
<p class="contents">Albanian separatists behave in a similar way in the Preševo Valley in the south of Serbia, where they threaten to boycott elections. This crisis can be expected to reach Montenegro. In my opinion, we need to help Macedonia, to offer it all the help it needs to be a stable country, but we must refuse to give any help to Albanian separatists because we can see clearly that the 10-year attempt to transform terrorists into democrats has failed completely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not very wise, it is not fair and it is not helping either the cohesion policy of the EU or the situation, because it will not only make the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia more intransigent in its claims about the name in the negotiations and it will also mean that there will not be a proper solution for a long time to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I got a very clear picture of a country that does not have a proper market economy and a country that has far too much government engagement in the judiciary, in the media and in business. It is what we describe as crony capitalism. The Government expends more than 50% of Croatia’s GDP. It is simply not a free market in the sense we understand.</p>
<p class="contents">They need to implement transparency in government contracts, which are subject to graft. They need to implement full disclosure of interest in planning decisions, which, at the moment, just provide income for officials.

Once again I should like to thank the rapporteur, Hannes Swoboda, for the report he prepared, providing a very clear picture of the current situation, the level of development reached, and the future challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that Croatia will seize the opportunity and make fast progress. The fact is that its progress will primarily depend on Croatia itself, and on the pace and the quality of reforms they must complete.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out, Mr Schmidt, that the Slovenian Presidency will conduct this agenda with the utmost responsibility. The Slovenian Presidency supports Croatia's progress primarily because its fastest possible progress towards the European Union membership is important for Croatia, but also because it is important for the European Union, and because it is important for the region as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the responsible conduct of this agenda is to be based on the negotiations framework, which has been agreed with Croatia, based on the revised accession partnership recently adopted by the EU Council, and on other legal acts of the European Union. And it is on this basis that we hope that Croatia will progress as quickly as possible, and the Slovenian Presidency will work towards this end.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: Mr Wiersma, Mrs Berès and others have mentioned the danger of political instability in this country. The Slovenian Presidency has sincere hopes that this will not happen. Any political crisis, or possibly early parliamentary elections would slow down the necessary process of reforms for a couple of months.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to see the unity of the citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia preserved and strengthened, irrespective of their political and ethnic allegiances, their unity of views on their joint future in the European Union and the Euro–Atlantic structures. Also important is that, with the Albanian party DPA rejoining the government coalition, the internal political situation has been consolidated.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time, but the time is limited. We have time only until the next European Commission autumn report, their regular report on the progress that has been achieved. It is important that work completed during this period, which at the end of the year gained additional acceleration, is continued, especially as the political dialogue has been rekindled, and as concrete results have been achieved in the sphere of reforms. A National Council for EU Integration has been established, and an ambitious plan for the fulfilment of the Accession Partnership tasks was adopted. This course should be continued.</p>
<p class="contents">The Slovenian Presidency will continue to provide the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with decisive support on this path.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with the following thought: the issue of Western Balkans stability and the region's faster integration into the European framework must remain one of the Union's top priorities. The Slovenian Presidency has set out this issue as one of its priority tasks. We hope this will continue to be so in the future as well. The fact is that any investment in the future of the Western Balkans in Europe is also an investment in the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my gratitude to the Member States and the Members of the European Parliament for their very extensive support for the European prospects for the Western Balkans, as well as for your contributions to today's debate.

<p class="contents">A number of important issues were raised and I can only comment on some of them in this short response. I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the Slovenian Presidency for making the Western Balkans a key priority of its term of office. I found the Foreign Ministers’ informal meeting in Brdo, Slovenia, some weeks ago, to be very important, and it certainly gave a new stimulus and dynamism to our policy in the Western Balkans, like this debate. In my view, we are now on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">The region has made steady progress over the past couple of years and once the major risks of instability, like the aftermath of the Kosovo status process or the fragility of democracy in Serbia, can be handled well, then I am sure that the region will have a very bright future and that this future is, indeed, in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency has already responded to the points made as regards the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I can only second those views and say that the country is well placed to take an historic step forward this year if it acts with determination and sustained efforts to meet the benchmarks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is encouraging that the Macedonian Government has established an action plan to meet benchmarks and a new national plan for the adoption of the <span class="italic">acquis</span>. Now I want to encourage the country to implement its own plans and thus pave the way for a positive recommendation from the Commission in the coming autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Several of you referred to visa liberalisation. I can inform you that the Commission is currently working on a road map for visa liberalisation for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We will present a draft to the country shortly and, as the country is quite advanced in many respects, for instance on biometric passports, I hope that it will be able to meet the conditions of the road map rather swiftly and thus achieve the goal of visa-free travel for citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia§.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to inform you that we shall shortly – before the end of April – present a road map of this kind for visa-free travel for Serbia where, likewise, ordinary citizens value this extremely highly. We want to facilitate, on our part, this important objective.</p>
<p class="contents">On Croatia, I can conclude that a clear majority of the European Parliament has a realistic view of what needs to be done by Croatia for the country to be able to succeed in concluding accession negotiations in the course of 2009. This is good, because the real friends of Croatia should not sweep the problems under the carpet but be honest about what needs to be done and encourage Croatia to implement the necessary reforms on the ground and without delay. Sustained efforts are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Posselt asked the Commission to step up its efforts and I can assure him that the Commission will have no problems whatsoever in processing negotiating positions in the various chapters once the benchmarks are met by Croatia itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Ek referred to the environmental aspects of overfishing in the Adriatic and I would like to respond to her and inform you all that Prime Minister Sanader told President Barroso and myself of his concern for a special area in the middle of the Adriatic, the ‘Jabuka Pomo Pit’, which is an important spawning ground. The Commission is strongly in favour of the sustainable management of fish stocks and Commissioner Borg has been very active in this matter. The Commission is ready to work on a proposal to establish a fisheries protection area in the Adriatic, as foreseen under the new Mediterranean Regulation. This will need further discussions with Slovenia, Italy and Croatia and, of course, the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Lebech mentioned the Nordic model as a source of inspiration for the Western Balkans in terms of regional cooperation. I believe that the Nordic Council has already played such a role: it has been used as <span class="italic">the</span> model for the Regional Cooperation Council for South-Eastern Europe, based in Sarajevo, which is now the forum for regional political cooperation in the Western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it encouraging that regional cooperation has substantially improved over the last couple of years and both Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have actively contributed to this success. We have clearly moved from a situation where, only a few years ago, regional cooperation was considered with significant suspicion that it was an attempt to recreate Yugoslavia. There is now a new understanding of its importance, both because of the concrete benefits on the ground – economic benefits, communications, transport, people-to-people contacts – and because regional cooperation moves the countries closer to the European Union. After all, cooperation across borders is what the European Union is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank you once again for a very responsible and substantive debate and congratulate the rapporteurs on their important contributions to this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We supported that very much and we wish you all the best. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate, which has been highly productive and constructive. I should like to take up on what Mr Schmitt said regarding 2009. I believe we shall find a common solution tomorrow, as it is important to have a common broad base.</p>
<p class="contents">Why has Croatia been successful? This is because a broad consensus has been achieved in the country and, despite a slight disagreement with regard to the composition of the Joint EU Committee, this will hopefully be the case in future as well. It is also because – even if the country has sometimes had to force itself to do so – it has achieved a real consensus with its neighbours, as was the case with the fishing zone, for instance.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore – if I can now establish a link to Macedonia – I should like to make a very clear appeal to our counterparts in Macedonia to learn from this example, to try to reach a consensus at domestic level and also with its neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy, of course, to add fuel to the fire here and, like Mrs Beer, to act as a great advocate. As Mrs Pack and many others have said, however, both countries – Greece and Macedonia – have to make a move: and this within the next few days. Making a Macedonian domestic political crisis out of it at this point in time does not help Macedonia. It blocks the path to the EU; it prevents a solution being found with Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the link with Croatia I mentioned. Croatia has succeeded thanks to three really very good governments – including the Račan and Sanader governments – which have really taken substantial steps forward and also changed their spots when ‘national interests’ were involved. Hence my appeal once again to continue to establish this common ground in Croatia, my appeal to attempt something similar in Macedonia as well, and my appeal to the Presidency to continue what it has been doing in recent weeks, namely making progress for the region as a whole. I am convinced, Commissioner, that the Commission will do everything it can to bring the negotiations to a close in 2009. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Up to now, both parties have been expert in explaining the other party’s long-standing commitment. Greece expects Macedonia to change its constitutional name, and until 2 April Macedonia expected Greece not to block its accession to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Both parties fail to realise that all of this is completely incomprehensible to other Europeans. Both parties want this enlargement of the European Union to succeed, but at the same time are helping to delay it further. It now seems to be a game of who makes the first move. If no one does, the enlargement everyone desires will come to a temporary halt.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Kacin and Mr Pinior that we should not wait for any subsequent reports, but rather seize the first suitable opportunity to start negotiations with Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I should like to conclude my speech in this joint debate on two candidate countries with one remark about Croatia for which my group has not requested separate speaking time.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia wanted to join the EU at the start of 2009, but it will be 2010 or 2011. The main problem still outstanding is shipbuilding on the Adriatic coast. It is not without reason that the EP delegation to Croatia is visiting the Rijeka shipyards on 29 April. In my group’s opinion, we should not make any requirements of Croatia that the population could perceive as an insoluble problem and that could make the country’s accession to the European Union unnecessarily controversial.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, let us try to promote both countries’ progress towards the European Union, so that, in a number of years’ time, we are able to welcome both Croatia and Macedonia into our midst. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European and transatlantic perspective of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is unanimously acknowledged and the 2007 Report welcomes the efforts made in this direction.

The accession of Croatia should become a driving example for all other candidate and potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans.</p>

<p class="contents">These points are essential, as further developments in the above areas would indeed bring greater stability to the country and to the region as a whole.

<p class="contents">The accession of Croatia to the European Union would have enormous regional consequences and would help to test the scope of the obligations taken on by the EU for the Western Balkans. Croatia’s considerable engagement in the accession negotiations is a positive sign, the evidence being provided by the large number of open chapters in the negotiations. It is also worth stressing that Croatia has made considerable progress in most of the areas covered by Community law. Immense and continuing engagement is, however, needed to overcome the problems that exist in individual sectors if reforms are to be pushed through. To facilitate integration, a list of the funds required for facilitation purposes needs to be drawn up. It is particularly important to accelerate the process of increasing the powers of the administration for the purpose of introducing new regulations. Acceleration is also required in the process of public sector reform, at local and regional authority level. The administration of justice is another sector requiring fundamental reform.</p>
<p class="contents">One major achievement of the Croatian authorities is their unremitting efforts to have war crimes judged by national courts. The improvements noted in the Croatian economy and the reforms in the environmental protection sector are further achievements of the Croatian Government that facilitate the accession process. The report on the progress made by Croatia in 2007 supports the belief that this country, by implementing the goals facing it, is taking an active approach to the accession process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Irish turf-cutters and bog owners are now being asked to cease cutting turf for personal use. This situation has arisen because of the unrestricted industrial and commercial turf-cutting right across the EU, which has resulted in virtually all of Europe’s raised bogs being destroyed. It is vitally important to understand that for many Irish people, both rural and urban, turf-cutting has been practised for generations. These people should not be made to pay the price for the destruction of bogs by others. Also, given that oil is now fetching approximately EUR 110 per barrel, we can see that turf is now a very valuable economic resource for the individuals concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, at national level there must be full compensation for the loss of turf-cutting rights, and flexible arrangements will have to be put in place so that we can balance the rights of owners against the need to conserve the raised bogs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The mayor of Mlynky has evicted five Slovak associations from the two rooms in which they carried out their activities. Let me say that when it comes to treatment of the Slovak minority, this act is only the tip of the iceberg. In a Slovak school in the Hungarian village, Slovak is taught as a foreign language for 3 hours a week and a priest says mass in Hungarian. The bilingual village paper is not published any more.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank the Hungarian President, Mr Sólyom, who visited the village right at the beginning and listened to both parties. I also want to thank the Hungarian Ombudsman, who in this case favours the Slovak minority. The local authorities, however, seem to be standing their ground.

In this progressively unifying Europe, do the Germans wish to resurrect the phantoms and demons of 20th century politics, i.e. unions and pacts that led to wars, crimes, the Holocaust and the division of Europe?

The Canadian Government has given its assurance that this hunt will be conducted humanely and, as a condition of their licences, sealers are now required to stun seals and check they are unconscious and then bleed them out before they are skinned.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, according to independent observers, there is little evidence of this happening. That is, of course, when they have actually been permitted to observe sealing activities. The Department of Fisheries’ systematic attempts to block the observation of this year’s hunt have been almost as alarming as the blatant violations of the sealing regulations that have thus far been recorded. If the Canadian authorities are so very confident that these regulations are being adhered to, then why are they doing their utmost to prevent animal welfare specialists and journalists from witnessing it?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we should not forget that no such animal welfare guarantees have ever been made for the commercial seal hunts elsewhere in the world, such as Russia and Namibia. With the current legislature coming to an end, it is vital that the Commission take swift action, in response to Written Declaration 38, by publishing a proposal to ban the import and export of and trade in seal products. Such a ban would not affect subsistence farming, but it would demonstrate a commitment to protect animal welfare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This comprises a number of buildings, towers, hangars, warehouses and parking areas along with adjacent land, excellently positioned, often beside important international communication routes. The local government districts in which these facilities are located are interested in managing them, but they do not have the funds to do so.

There would perhaps not be anything untoward about this, but for the fact that MPs ratified the Treaty in a great hurry and often failed to get to grips with its content. In view of this situation, the numerous initiatives to ratify the Treaty through national referendums are entirely justified.

The atmosphere in Cyprus is full of renewed hope, but one thing is threatening to destroy the euphoric climate. This is the continued interference of the Turkish Army.</p>
<p class="contents">A week ago the Chief of Staff of the Turkish Army paid a sudden visit to Cyprus and made a number of inflammatory statements that almost stopped the peace process in its tracks. Today, the commander of the Turkish land forces was due to go to Cyprus and his presence is expected to create more problems for the peace negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the President of this House and all my colleagues to use any diplomatic means at their disposal to strongly point out to the Turkish generals in Ankara that they should stop trying to destroy the peace dialogue in Cyprus and leave the Cypriots free to get on with the job of finding a solution to their island’s intercommunal problems.</p>

Although serious reasons prevented me from listening to her presentation in person, I must say that she made an excellent impression on the members of my committee and was unanimously welcomed in her new capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the oral question, I would like to begin by explaining what made us tackle this issue and ask individual states to pay more attention to this serious diagnosis. You probably know, from the emphasis in the report and in the question, that cancer cases in Europe are on the increase. There are a number of reasons for this: as we know, the population is ageing and more and more people are exposed to carcinogens. According to the trade unions, at least 8% of annual cancer deaths are directly caused by exposure to carcinogens in the workplace. We have to bear in mind that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in four Europeans dies from the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important matter is the significant differences in cancer treatment success rates between the old and new Member States. This imbalance is surely also food for thought. What can we do in this area and what can we recommend to the European Community? A structure such as the EU undoubtedly has the capacity and power to coordinate individual national policies. By adopting national cancer control programmes we can reduce cancer mortality by as much as 30%. We know that only 3% of the total budget in developed countries is spent on cancer prevention, compared with 97% on treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take this opportunity to make an appeal on behalf of patients, who become the focus of our treatment and should become the focus of our care: they should have better access to new scientific knowledge and new information. The European Union should push ahead with a single register and, as far as possible, common education. Paradoxically, the European Union has not yet introduced in all its Member States as undeniably important a topic as oncology. Although oncology is an interdisciplinary subject, its recognition as a subject in its own right is a necessary condition if we want to successfully fight this disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I would like to allow my colleague from the PPE-DE Group, Professor Trakatellis, to use some of my speaking time, I will now conclude my introduction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I repeat what I said at my hearing: I aim to cooperate with MEPs fruitfully and to the best of my ability.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Mr President, to the subject of cancer: </p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the priority given to cancer by you and by the Slovenian Presidency, this issue has been a particular concern of mine for many years, so I am pleased that it is the first topic for me to address in front of the plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">Every year 3.2 million Europeans are diagnosed with cancer, but this burden is not spread equally across the Union. For example, the most recent data shows that cervical cancer is over four times higher in Bulgaria than in Finland, and the risk of dying from cervical cancer is almost five times higher in Lithuania than in Italy. These variations show that there is scope to do better across the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the primary responsibility for comprehensive cancer services lies with the Member States, but European action can make a difference. The Commission is currently preparing a report on the implementation of the Council recommendation on cancer screening of 2003. I expect that this will show that progress has been made, but that more still needs to be done. We will work with the Member States to pursue this.</p>
<p class="contents">But even though screening is important, I think that Community action against cancer must cover a wider range of topics. For example: health information and data on the cancer burden that will highlight inequalities and best practices across Europe; preventative measures and health promotion on topics such as tobacco, nutrition and alcohol; best practices on treatment and integrated cancer care, such as palliative care; bringing together expertise through European reference networks; providing investment in infrastructure through the Structural Funds; and support for cancer research at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">I plan to bring forward proposals for an action plan on cancer next year. This will aim to provide focus and coherence for all these actions. We will also consider whether the scientific evidence justifies updating the existing recommendation on cancer screening. Some actions are already under way. We plan to include provisions for European reference networks as part of the forthcoming proposals on the application of patient rights in cross-border health care. The proposals later this year on rare diseases will also help to improve, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the situation regarding rare types of cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, when a person has cancer, it affects them most, but it also affects their family, their employer and society as a whole. My proposals will be accompanied by an impact assessment that will make clear not just the human cost of cancer but also the wider social and economic costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to hearing your suggestions on issues we need to address as we develop those proposals. You may be sure that your proposals will be taken into account as we develop this action plan, and I count on your support for all our future actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the views she has already expressed on cancer. Commissioner, I think it is time for us to adopt an effective strategy on cancer in line with current scientific and technological progress, so that the disease can stop being the main cause of death in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, one third of all cancers are preventable. We must therefore review the existing preventive programmes and measures and create new ones to cover every eventuality.</p>
<p class="contents">If we expand our scientific knowledge, we must review the Council’s recommendation on early diagnosis and improve diagnostic methods for more types of cancers. In addition to breast, cervical and colorectal cancer, we must add skin cancer, and possibly lung and prostate cancer. Strengthening prevention and early diagnosis could cover nearly 70% of cases.</p>
<p class="contents">For cases where prevention or early diagnosis is not possible, as you said, we need to improve therapeutic strategies and practice by being more effective and innovative. We must ensure that full use is made of the treatments provided by ever more successful innovation and research. It is necessary simply to incentivise research into innovative cancer treatments and to increase research funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, bureaucratic formalities should not hinder research. Moreover, authorisation procedures should be reviewed in such a way that it becomes possible both to accelerate procedures for new drugs and to adhere to high standards of safety. Commissioner, this is all feasible today. The means made available by the EU may allow us in the immediate future to control cancer, thus almost freeing European citizens of this scourge.</p>
<p class="contents">With steady focus on this goal, we are thus called upon today to move forward. We must do so, as you said, by drawing up the various composite elements of this strategy. We hope that both the European Commission and the Council will support Parliament’s resolution and will take appropriate measures to achieve our targets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore this disease has a twofold cost: firstly, the human cost in terms of its impact on sufferers and their families and, secondly, as a major health burden to society as a whole. Further, due to the demographic changes we are experiencing, and with an ageing population, this is a problem that will only increase.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ensure that all our citizens have access to high-quality screening programmes, diagnosis and treatment, including palliative care. A cancer task force would ensure a cohesive and coordinated approach to all aspects of the disease, ensuring exchange of information and promotion of best practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that more is done to secure research and innovation, giving as many people as possible access to the best in cancer prevention and treatment. We also need to highlight the link between cancer and obesity – the most avoidable cause of cancer after tobacco. It is also vital to ensure that workers are protected from cancer-causing substances – around 8% of all cancers are caused by exposure to carcinogens at work – and we need binding limits on crystalline silica, which can cause disabling illness and fatal lung disease. On that point, I would urge Members to support paragraph 33 and recital K of the original text agreed by the committee – remember the construction industry is not party to the social partners’ agreement on crystalline silica.</p>
<p class="contents">There are massive disparities in cancer treatment and screening across Europe. Many of the deaths from cancer could be avoided by prevention measures, such as access to information and to comprehensive screening programmes. Tackling these disparities must be a priority. It is our moral duty and it is possible. What we need is the political will to achieve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to highlight one initiative in particular: the European Cancer Patient Summit, which was held this week here in Brussels under the patronage of the Slovenian Presidency, with the participation of more than 150 patient groups from all over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This very successful summit, where I also had the honour of addressing the audience, was the first event our new Commissioner for Health attended in this capacity. I must admit I was impressed by the Commissioner’s speech and the commitment she expressed for the fight against cancer as a whole and the concerns of cancer patients in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also very happy to learn that the Commissioner intends to put forward a new cancer action plan, starting next year, to ensure that cancer remains high on the Commission’s agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">These initiatives from the Presidency and the Commission must encourage all of us to focus on what should be done, rethink what we have achieved and discover where the current deficits are. And now we are very much looking forward with high expectations to the upcoming Council conclusions on this topic. I am confident that these conclusions will provide a very good and solid basis for the following presidencies to continue along the lines set out therein. Therefore, I would like to strongly encourage the upcoming French Presidency to follow up on established initiatives and to keep cancer high on its agenda.</p>

You are a cancer expert, since you were the director of an oncological centre before you came here as a Commissioner, so you must be used to what you are hearing now.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not take issue with the statistical data that my fellow Members are giving you. Mr Trakatellis said that 30% of people can be saved by prevention. As an oncologist myself, I can assure you that a further 30% can be saved by reliable screening programmes. Yet how many of the 27 Member States have such programmes?</p>
<p class="contents">You must do something about this; coordination and hence assistance need to be assured. Perhaps you will also have to use funds from the Structural Funds and the 7th Framework Programme so that all these methods can contribute. You must help to raise the profile of oncology, since, as you have said, this is very important. The Slovenian Presidency is to be congratulated, but just as important is the creation of a task force wholly dedicated to the issue of cancer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It makes me very happy to see that the issue of cancer is being dealt with not only by experts but also by politicians, which is very important in this case. The experts are drawing our attention to alarming statistics and the trends in cancer occurrence are extremely unfavourable. Yesterday I was talking with patient organisations until lunchtime, and I can tell you that what they want is adequate treatment, which can be very demanding, especially in the case of rare types of cancer. There is still a huge gap between the 15 old and the 12 new Member States regarding the occurrence of this disease, its late diagnosis and the approach to its treatment at all stages of the disease. Insufficient prevention and late diagnosis or treatment aggravate the patients’ state of health and their chances of getting better.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, please ensure that the fight against cancer is not just a priority during the six-month presidency, or for professional medical organisations such as ESMO or patient organisations. We, the Members of this Parliament, will also give you our support in the search for a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because knowing that health is the responsibility of member states, the European citizens wish certain tasks to be performed at European level, since it is only at this level that they can be performed properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that you have announced the action plan to fight cancer. We need it urgently, and if cancer has the exponential dynamics of epidemics, we too must have our own political dynamics, otherwise the gap and the consequences of cancer will become even more serious.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased the Slovene Presidency has strengthened expectations that, in the future, activities will be more coordinated, there will be more continuity, and the initiatives will be more vigorous, and, as you yourself put it on another occasion earlier this week, that this will coincide with multi-partnerships.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I believe that it would be better if countries holding the EU presidency did not prioritise only single aspects, but continuously considered the entire frontline against cancer, as has already been mentioned today.</p>
<p class="contents">In this spirit, I hope that with your help, a task group could be formed – or we could call it something else – to bring together the main institutions and key actors in the fight against cancer, not with the intention of creating a new bureaucracy, but in order to achieve better combined results owing to good methods of cooperation.</p>

I expect a lot from this new cooperation and, personally speaking, her presentation in the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety convinced me of her qualifications and her appetite for solving certain problems, for example those related to smoking, which is a subject dear to my heart.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would now like to concentrate on a similar topic. We know that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and that the most common diagnoses are lung cancer, bowel cancer (which some people have mentioned) and breast cancer. It is well known that lung cancer occurs up to five times more often than all other types of cancer combined. There is absolutely no doubt that passive smoking causes cancer just as active smoking does, and we also know that up to 95% of people who are diagnosed with lung cancer are smokers or passive smokers. Putting warnings on cigarette packets is not enough. It is time for adequate legislation to protect non-smokers to be introduced in the old and new Member States that are still putting if off, for reasons that are difficult to comprehend. In countries where good and sufficiently restrictive laws are in place, the health situation has improved significantly and billions have been saved instead of spent on cancer patient treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, articles recently published in professional medical literature point to a direct link between hormonal contraception and breast cancer.

<p class="contents">Of course, much remains to be done and this is why the EU must take it upon itself to declare an all-out war on cancer. We must fight this disease on all fronts, with strong aggression and endless determination. Our efforts must, for example, be directed at making sure that efficient screening programmes are in operation and implemented among those sections of the population that most need them. They must also be directed at ensuring that sufficient funding is always available to the research institutions that provide our hope for the future. Our citizens must be reassured that cancer can be defeated and we, in the European Parliament, are determined to continue to support this fight until, and unless, this is accomplished.</p>

<p class="contents">Sadly, in the European Union cancer reaps a harvest of one million lives each year. The numbers are shocking. During our lifetime, a tumour will be diagnosed in around 33% of people living in Europe, and for 25% it is the cause of death. The highest percentage of people dying of lung, prostate or breast cancer is recorded in the new Member States, i.e. in the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Action needs to be taken at EU level to enable the disparities in oncological services to be ironed out, and especially where monitoring and screening are concerned. Let us not forget that early detection of cancer offers the best chance of curing it. It is estimated that one third of cases could be avoided by adopting a healthy lifestyle, not smoking tobacco or abusing alcohol, and participating in sport and keeping to a diet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have been described as an expert on cancer. I must say that I am not an expert on cancer. There are people here who are really experts on cancer, but I am a person who has worked for many years in the fight against cancer and I will remain as such.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard very interesting comments. I will try to answer some of them, but rest assured that I have taken note of all the comments that were made, and we shall include them in our deliberations when we formulate our action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Structural Funds, the Commission has now included health as one of the priority areas for funding, so the funds can be used for health infrastructure, including cancer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention was made of carcinogens in the workplace. We already have strong European standards, as you know, on health and safety. The Commission will, of course, work to keep those standards updated as science updates our knowledge of risks. I will work on this with Commissioner Špidla, who is responsible for this area of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The suggestion was made repeatedly concerning the setting-up of an interinstitutional task force to fight cancer. I would examine this during the deliberations of the forthcoming Health Council in Slovenia, and I would also make another addition to this suggestion: that I would like to see representatives of patients and of professionals included in this task force.</p>
<p class="contents">Recognition of oncology as a specialisation is something that is, indeed, very necessary, but I would point out that this is something for the Member States to do. But, as far as I am concerned, I will exert all my influence in encouraging Member States to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Many speakers spoke about anti-smoking campaigns. We all know that smoking is one of the most serious detriments to health, and my intention is not only to continue the campaign against smoking but also to try to involve youth in this campaign, not only to make it less trendy for them but also to make them understand that it is to their benefit not to start smoking, and make them involved actively in the campaign so that the word is spread among young people, because that is the first stage to prevent smoking – to start with the young people.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, many other interesting proposals have been made. I will take all of them into consideration, and I will continue to work closely with Members of Parliament in reaching a very good action plan for next year.</p>

On one aspect, however, I believe we need to be clearer and more decisive: greater resources must be invested in research, in fact and not just in words, and researchers must be guaranteed better conditions.

However, epidemics spread in those countries where the hygiene and epidemiology standards are not met and people live in poor conditions or do not have access to effective health care. I do not know which of these conditions the EU fulfils.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about a cancer epidemic in the EU at the same time as we are talking about improving the economy and competitiveness, about massive investment in prevention, in new effective treatment methods and in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p class="contents">My country, the Slovak Republic, has for more than 30 years been running a national oncology programme to prevent cancer. In spite of that, cancer incidence rates continue to rise. Is this the doctors’ fault or the patients’ fault?</p>
<p class="contents">How are the EU funds for cancer prevention used? In 2003 the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality prepared an own-initiative report on breast cancer. Although it accurately identified the causes and possible solutions, only a little of what was included in the report has been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes I feel that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing and that our society, and the EU as a whole, deliberately keep quiet about the real reasons for this disease, perhaps in order to project a better image and for fear of telling the truth. Fighting cancer cannot be a priority for just one EU presidency. Its implementation as a systematic EU policy should already have been the norm for several years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

<p class="contents">The thematic strategies planned as the cornerstone of the Environment Action Programme and the legislation passed and largely now adopted based on them are insufficient to achieve the environmental targets. The decline in biodiversity is unlikely to be halted and legislation on the protection of the seas will not have any effect until 2012. Soil protection, as we know, has run into problems, not just in the Council but also here in Parliament. Legislation on waste is now on the home run, and it does not look good. We need to achieve satisfactory targets in the reduction in the volume of waste. Nor are the targets agreed in the air quality directive at the level agreed in the Sixth Environment Action Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The targets in the Environment Programme are, however, being achieved in one area, and that is climate policy. That is the case especially when the measures which have now been agreed are actually implemented. We have to remember that the implementation of climate policy also helps when it comes to air quality and partly also waste, so in that respect it is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">What then can we still do to get back on the road to achieving the targets in the Sixth Environment Action Programme? First of all, Member States have to step up national implementation of EU legislation. The Commission must be given the necessary resources for it to be able to ensure that all Member States are attending to their obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Another big issue, and one which is perhaps the most important of them all, is how we manage to integrate the environment within all European Union legislation. We have spoken about this for years, but as yet nothing has been done in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have areas where we subsidise activity which is environmentally harmful. We must now do away with environmentally damaging subsidies, and Parliament should propose a timetable for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Any policy that is environmentally favourable is to be recommended, including taxation measures. Unless legislation at European level can be used to develop eco-taxation, we will have to employ the means available to us, for example, flexible cooperation, using that to take tax matters forward. If the state of the environment is to be improved, binding legislation still needs to be a priority.</p>

Our environmental policy has been – and is – a very successful EU policy, since it has offered its citizens clear and tangible benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Around 80% of the Member States’ environmental legislation is based on corresponding EU legislation. The latter has made a vital contribution to major improvements in air and water quality, as well as to the protection and maintenance of Europe’s natural resources. The EU is thus able to play a leading international role in issues such as climate change, biodiversity and legislation on chemical products.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly a year has passed since the Commission published its Communication on the Mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme. Last year was particularly important, since environmental issues were constantly to at the top of the EU’s list of political priorities. Over this period we have wholly fulfilled our political commitments. Let me give you three examples of this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Bali Summit last December, a procedure was launched to achieve a new agreement on global climate until the end of 2009. The EU’s ‘green diplomacy’ was largely instrumental in achieving this positive result. The package of proposals on climate and energy produced by the Commission in January was ambitious and demonstrated the EU’s continuing commitment to setting a global example.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed new directive on industrial emissions strengthens the provisions already in force and simplifies existing legislation merging seven different directives, on integrated pollution prevention and control. Thus our legislation has become easier to implement and we are contributing towards making it more environmentally effective.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past year important progress was made. One of the main messages of the mid-term review – that the long-term viability of the European economy needs to be based on sound environmental principles – was largely accepted by industry. The high standards set by EU environmental legislation encourage ecological innovation, which in turn boosts industrial productivity and creates new employment. In other words, the ambitious environmental goals are both improving European citizens’ quality of life and central to achieving our goals in economic development and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">These positive developments contradict scientific evidence that Europe has not yet entered a phase of sustainable development. In fact, we are only half-way through the time period covered by the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, so there is obviously plenty more to be done in tackling the current and emerging threats to our environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming months the Commission will produce new proposals, many of which are included in Parliament’s report. These initiatives include the review of the directive on national emissions ceilings, and a package of proposals in the area of sustainable consumption and production.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also preparing a legislative proposal on restricting timber trafficking from illegal logging. After the summer, communications will be ready concerning the European view on the issue of halting deforestation and on finding ways of recording companies’ results using criteria that go further than GDP.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also preparing a proposal to prohibit trade in the skins of seals that have been inhumanely hunted.</p>
<p class="contents">Improved implementation of Community legislation is a major priority; it is the key to creating a better environment. Only by ensuring the correct implementation of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> in its entirety can the goals of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme possibly be achieved. Effective implementation is connected with better legislation. I can now express my satisfaction because in the last two years the Commission has been able to disassociate better legislation from lower environmental standards. The truth is that the older and simpler legislation is one of the better ways of improving the implementation of the new rules and can thus contribute to better environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am especially pleased that in your report there are constructive conclusions on the way in which Europe can successfully create a better environment and genuine sustainable development. I assure you that the Commission will examine these conclusions with great care when analysing areas where it can see policy gaps and when setting out priorities for the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, for her efforts and likewise Mr Karim, Mrs Jeleva and Mr Navarro from the Committee on International Trade, the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their excellent recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that there is broad agreement as regards the way forward. It now remains for us to transform this support policy into concrete action to ensure a better environment from 2012 onwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Water supply and water treatment, waste management, public transportation and urban planning are just a few examples. The Member States, their regional and local authorities should be encouraged to make the best use of structural funds while ensuring that their operational programmes contribute for a more effective implementation of environmental legislation. It is obvious that some regions experience difficulties in implementation. Special measures should be developed in the framework of the cohesion policy to overcome these difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, regional cooperation should be used as a vital tool in environmental policy.

<p class="contents">The air in our cities is polluted and unhealthy. In the absence of Community legislation, in many cities achieving the goals set out in the thematic strategy on the urban environment seems a very long way off. The Commission must therefore put forward legislation that clearly defines a framework for the urban environment and urban transport in the whole of the European Union, as otherwise our citizens will continue to suffer from poor air quality and other forms of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, implementation of the Water Framework Directive keeps stalling. If legislation on industry does not accord with policies on agriculture and rural development, then our water resources will continue to be polluted. As demonstrated by the foam on the River Raba in Hungary resulting from pollution by Austrian leather manufacturers, current legislation is not able to prevent contamination of water resources.</p>

<p class="contents">As the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety says, the implementation of the EU’s Environment Programme is in many respects late, but what is even more startling is that, even if all the concrete targets set thus far were fully achieved, the EU would still not be on the road to sustainable development. For example, we probably will not manage to halt the decline in biodiversity by 2010, even if we are committed to doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The unpleasant truth is that our society is constructed to work in a way that is unsustainable. If everyone on earth consumed resources the way Europeans do, we would need four earths to produce the necessary resources. If the middle classes of China, India and other developing countries copy our consumption habits the planet will be in crisis. I hope that the wake-up call that is now on its way thanks to climate policy will result in a more comprehensive reassessment of our lifestyle and production habits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me begin by saying that I, too, disagree that implementation of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme is going according to plan. Moreover, in many cases concrete quantitative and qualitative targets and timetables are lacking, not only in the Action Programme, but also in the thematic strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that implementation of the Sixth Action Programme is behind schedule; we have not yet managed to meet the priority environmental objectives set out in the Programme, and implementation of the legislation in the Member States keeps stalling. Let me give you a concrete example.</p>
<p class="contents">First: no concrete steps have been taken to draft legislation concerning indoor air quality. A particular priority in this regard is the drafting of provisions relating to schools and other public indoor spaces used by vulnerable groups. At the very least, pilot projects should be initiated.</p>
<p class="contents">Second: implementation of directives on the Natura 2000 networking programme has also stalled. Best practice needs to be disseminated, and fiscal measures put in place against polluters. I myself have approached the Commission with a submission relating to contamination of Natura 2000 areas, but the Commission has merely been sitting on its hands and has not taken any action.</p>
<p class="contents">Third: illegal dumping of hazardous and municipal waste in the territory of other countries has proliferated in recent times. Africa and Asia are often the destination of European waste, and this is unacceptable. Equally unacceptable is the fact that several German <span class="italic">Länder</span> are illegally transporting many thousands of tonnes of waste to eastern Europe, and then refuse to take it back – take the case of Bavaria, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth: whatever happened to the fine principle of preventing cross-border pollution? One Member State, Austria, has been polluting the River Raba for the past seven years, as Mr Hegyi mentioned earlier. Thick foam floats on the surface of the river. I have raised this issue at least half a dozen times already, and indeed I have also made a formal complaint, but to no avail: the foam on the river remains, while the Commission sits there doing nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Fine principles are meaningless unless they are implemented. The Commission is the guardian of European Union law. It is time for this guardian to do its duty and not give in to Member States, but instead to ensure compliance with the laws that we have jointly adopted. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s mid-term review reveals that coordinated efforts are required to plug the gaps in legislation with new legislative proposals. It is also necessary to secure the requisite resources to ensure proper implementation of Community legislation. Meanwhile, it is becoming understood that a greater reliance has to be placed on a sustainable model of production and consumption, and that economic growth must become more dependent on natural resources.</p>

I do not think that it is an assessment document. It is not a detailed assessment document that could have helped us to plan for the future, perhaps because the Commission is not accustomed to being judged or assessed, nor does it vote, or have a group of shareholders that demand results from it. I do think, however, although it may appear to be a contradiction, that the Commission can be congratulated on the results that it has had in recent years, but not on the document.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that environmental policy has been absolutely integrated into municipal and regional policies, and industry itself is responding to the European Union guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the document lacks a projection of how we need to change for the future, because those points where the system has not worked well need to be reviewed. Europe has been making environmental policy for more than 25 years and it needs to review some of its methods, because this is not the only thing that explains the failure of some policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not see any examination of how we can change the ways that we involve the regions and create networks, whether or not these are EU dominated in attitude. There are now many countries, as happened with the Soil Directive, that already have much better regulations than Europe can give them and others that do not have any. In response to this imbalance, Europe needs to take different positions and look for new ways of working, because it is logical that, if the world has changed, we should change our working methods.</p>

The Commission will of course take these into account and put them to good use accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">In its mid-term review, the Commission came to the conclusion that the EU was generally on the right track as regards fulfilling the measures set out in the Sixth Environment Action Programme. If we continue to make progress in these crucial years, we shall be able to carry out the proposals contained in the programme up to 2012. The preparation of the proposals, however, and even their adoption and approval, account for only half of the work required. As has been pointed out tonight, without effective implementation of environmental policy, we will certainly not reach the environmental targets set in the Sixth Environment Action Programme, however well the legislation may have been prepared by the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">For precisely this reason, I fully share Parliament’s view that greater efforts are needed and sufficient resources must be made available to the Commission to enable us to continue to deal properly with implementation issues. This will allow the Commission to help national authorities to develop those capacities necessary to achieve the results we are aiming for.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also shares Parliament’s view that it is vitally important to incorporate environmental issues into other policies. As the report makes clear, this integration is crucial in trade policies, since the EU has highly significant economic relations with other countries of the world, and trade has an obvious environmental impact. It is just as important, however, that environmental issues be incorporated into agricultural, regional and transport policy: if the essential funding is provided, Community policies will have a significant effect on the regions of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact study procedure, also established by the Commission, aims to improve the cohesion of Community policies and includes an assessment of all the environmental parameters of our proposals. The Commission would like the European Parliament’s support so that a full assessment of all environmental aspects can be guaranteed during the consideration of proposals by other institutions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report highlights the key role of the national, regional and local authorities, as well as of citizens, consumers and businessmen, in attaining the environmental targets set in the EU’s Sixth Environment Action Programme. I assure you that the Commission will do everything it can to raise the programme’s profile and to secure the support of the parties concerned. I am sure that Parliament will assist in these efforts and I hope that the protection of the European environment will be one of the main issues of concern to voters in next year’s elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament and I, as rapporteur, are actually aiming at a situation where the Commission acquires new instruments to get environmental policy on a path which leads to the targets under the Sixth Environment Action Programme being attained. In its mid-term report the Commission said it was its opinion, just as Commissioner Dimas remarked, that the means cited in the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme would be enough to achieve this, but a study which has been undertaken on the Commission’s current policy indicates otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, which hopefully will be adopted tomorrow with a large majority, indicates areas where improvements are still needed at European level, and it mentions very largely the same remedies as those proposed in the Commissioner’s speech. In other words, we are of the same opinion as to what needs to be done, but, as Mrs Hassi said here, whether or not the means proposed are generally adequate to get the European Union on the road to sustainable development we shall certainly have to have very frank discussions together. We are now on the right path with regard to climate policy. If we establish such ambitious policies in the other areas, then surely we will succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">I said I had tabled a few amendments in order to clarify this report. I would just like to mention that that the Finnish in Amendment 14 is very odd: the English text should be used as a reference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Protecting the environment is a matter of exceptional importance for the EP, which, after all, represents some 500 million Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Including the EP in the codecision procedure distinctly demonstrates the role it has. The 10 year operating period of the Sixth Action Programme requires regular evaluations, especially as regards its priorities. It is true that the thematic strategies included in the programme have improved the participation of stakeholders and developed the dimension of environmental policy, but at the same time they have delayed or prolonged the process of law-making in this sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">A disgraceful example has been set by the unfinished air quality directive. Parliament has rightly commented that the greatest progress has been made in those subsections of the Programme concerning which no separate thematic strategies (e.g. climate change) were drafted. On the other hand, though, we should bear in mind that the Sixth Action Programme urges us to support sustainable production methods and consumption models by fiscal means.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is difficult to see this mid-term review as highly satisfactory, it is nevertheless the only mechanism through which the EU can effectively push for achievement of the goals set. A lack of achievement in this area would damage the credibility of the EU and of its Members who are genuinely concerned about the deteriorating state of the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Taking into consideration the measures implemented so far by this programme, it is improbable for the priority environmental objectives to be achieved by 2012. For instance, the objective of stopping the loss of biodiversity by 2010 cannot be achieved, and the strategies proposed for protecting the marine environment and the soil will give no concrete results by 2012. At the same time, the actions taken to improve air quality, as well as those set in the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution and the objectives regarding ambient noise reduction are not enough to achieve the EAP objectives. Neither the settlement of problems, nor the reticence of certain Member States toward the implementation of directives regarding the habitats and Natura 2000 are dealt adequately with in the Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the N2000 sites are designated, it is necessary to formulate, promote and monitor the conservation objectives. This review calls attention to these problems and requests the Commission to aim at ambitious results in the field of environmental protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title24"></a><a name="creitem24"></a>

<p class="contents">The Eurostars Joint Programme aims to support research and development performing SMEs. These SMEs are able to bring new products and services onto the market thanks to their own research and development work. They have the ambition and the capacity to grow and to become the ‘stars’ of tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">A group of 29 EUREKA countries, and now Luxembourg, which has just applied to join, have decided to develop the Joint Programme, specifically designed to support SMEs undertaking their own research and development activities, in cooperation with their partners.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to enhance the impact of this initiative, the Commission has proposed to the European Parliament and the Council participating financially in the Eurostars Joint Programme, based on Article 169 of the Treaty, with an amount of up to EUR 100 million. This amount will leverage approximately EUR 300 million from the participating countries for the next six years.</p>
<p class="contents">An essential aspect of this initiative is that the participating countries commit themselves to integrate their national programmes in order to create a joint European programme. In addition, Eurostars reinforces the cooperation between the Framework Programme and EUREKA. For these reasons, I think that this initiative is a further step towards the realisation of the European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Rübig, and also to the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for the good cooperation and the improvements they are proposing to the Commission proposal. On behalf of the Commission, I can inform you that we accept these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly appreciate the fact that you agreed to handle this proposal swiftly, so that we will be able to contribute to the first Eurostars call. A rapid adoption by Parliament and the Council would indeed send a strong signal to the SME community that a continued investment in research and innovation activities is crucial to maintain and enhance their competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Eurostars should be a good example of how Member States can cooperate by bringing their national programmes closer together, and of where Community funding results in more impact for the programme, for the benefit of the European SME community and, of course, for the benefit of Europe as such. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like to thank all my fellow Members, of course, because we have demonstrated once again here how effective European legislation can actually be. When you think that the report was only introduced in January and that tomorrow we shall be voting on it, then you see that this House, the Presidency and the Commission are able to work together very effectively. We can be extremely proud of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the Secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, as it is not easy to negotiate a relatively complex matter in such a short space of time, to prepare and implement the basic principles accordingly. We are very happy that Slovakia, the United Kingdom and – at the last minute – Luxemburg, which we did not know about until yesterday, have expressed a wish to join this programme in recent weeks. I shall also be tabling an oral amendment on this tomorrow, and I would ask the Presidency that Luxembourg therefore be considered tomorrow when the Member States are named, so that small and medium-sized enterprises in Luxemburg, too, are able to take part in this programme successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">During the negotiations, we in Parliament have been emphasising a transparent and above all unbureaucratic, but efficient programme for promoting research. This should also, in particular, make possible our very earnest wish for one-off payments to be made and quick decisions taken, so that enterprises raise the funds needed to carry out research activities and do not take out a bank loan in advance, and then often have to wait a very long time for the money.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Commissioner Potočnik, that this programme is a sign of better regulation, that we have really succeeded here in implementing the objectives concerning SMEs and better regulation under the Seventh Framework Research Programme appropriately. Participation and management by Eureka is also exemplary, as Eureka is able to make very efficient and rapid decisions on this as well as ultimately bearing a large share of the responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community ultimately provides up to one third of the support. Commissioner, as you have already said, we are talking about up to EUR 100 million. New to the programme is also the fact that this is a genuine bottom-up programme, and therefore comes from the business community, from the small, research-intensive or medium-sized enterprises. I am actually proud of the fact that the Eurostat Secretariat in Brussels is operating on the market here very efficiently and very quickly in close cooperation with the national funding agencies, and that it is therefore also becoming possible to focus on market-oriented research activities aiming at short- and medium-term commercial results.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a key element of the work of small and medium-sized enterprises, and it should be cost-effective. High costs should not be incurred in the process for either the enterprises or the authorities; instead, everything should be clearly and coherently worded in order that each individual enterprise is also able to respond to the questions asked as part of its activities without a huge outlay. We have recently checked this. It has been a great success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have known, Commissioner, at least since the first evaluation report on the Lisbon process, that SMEs play an essential role in the field of research and innovation. However, their level of participation is not yet meet expectations and the latest investment figures are proof of this.</p>
<p class="contents">This special programme should therefore facilitate the participation of SMEs, and also reduce any excessive bureaucracy. In fact, in some ways it is a matter of setting things straight, covering the risk and counteracting the hesitancy of companies when it comes to investing in research and innovation, which is perhaps also an evil of the European corporate mindset.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate our rapporteur for insisting on adoption at the first reading, which should accelerate the implementation of this programme, guarantee its effectiveness and prove that European legislation is perhaps not as cumbersome as people sometimes accuse it of being, but that it can act effectively in the interest of citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, thank you for attending this debate. I would also firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work.</p>
<p class="contents">For some time now, in various forums and also in Parliament, the possible relationship between the Community Framework Programme and the EUREKA intergovernmental programme has been the subject of analysis and debate, as both involve considerable aid to SMEs. The result of these synergies has been Community funding for the Eurostars programme, on the basis of Article 169 of the Treaty, a programme that complements the Framework Programme through what I understand to be the main virtues of EUREKA: its bottom-up structure, which enables better adaptation to the needs of SMEs and facilitates participation, given that the bureaucracy required in order to participate in the Framework Programme is, in many cases, an excessive burden that is impossible for many SMEs to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">Supporting greater integration of SMEs into R&amp;D is something that Parliament has always advocated, and Eurostars can have a considerable mobilising impact. We therefore especially welcome this initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a very important subject, since the introduction of research results into industrial and business practice may be relatively promptly facilitated via SMEs. This is a fundamental aspect of the Lisbon Strategy. It is consequently a good thing that the Eurostars programme builds on the 7th Framework Programme for transnational enterprises and finances work in the sphere of science and technology put into effect by SMEs in cooperation with higher education institutions, research entities and other companies – large ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The direction of research is also important; it should be pro-market and have practical applications that are as prompt as possible. This good idea, which supports business initiatives and should be free of bureaucracy and clear, including its financial aspects. This is important for all partners, especially for business people. The success of this programme will set a good example for the future. Let us hope that our one hundred million euros are not wasted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That said, these enterprises invest only 4% in science, research and technological development, which is without any doubt the reason why they do not make better use of their business potential. We need to develop the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises within the framework of the renewed Lisbon Strategy. There are several ways to do this: give them better access to information, offer them better credit conditions, enable them to cooperate better with the public sector and help them to improve ties with large businesses so that both small and big systems are mutually linked.

The problem is that there is no principle for deciding what the EU should do. A sound principle is the one paid lip-service in policy speeches but ignored in decision-making: the subsidiarity principle. That argues against centralising research and development, except as regards very large-scale projects on the lines of Galileo or fusion energy. Research and development bureaucratised in large organisations gives less return on the money put in, not more. There is seldom any reason for Member States to send money to Brussels and then have their researchers ask for it back later. This assessment is particularly valid when it comes to research and development for small and medium-sized businesses. The enthusiasm shown by researchers and businesses comes from the fact that they are conned into thinking that more funds will be available overall. There is nothing to indicate that this is the case. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that thanks mainly to Mr Rübig this Parliament has managed to find a compromise that is acceptable to both the Commission and the Council and should result in adoption of this proposal at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the EUREKA initiative concerning a research and development programme for small and medium-sized enterprises is very much welcomed by the business community. The fact that so many countries participate in this initiative confirms that prior to this programme there had been a lack of interest in solving the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the European Parliament’s efforts, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development has not solved the problem of how SMEs approach the funds provided to support their research, development and innovation activities either. It is thus extremely encouraging to see that this bottom-up initiative has met with so much approval in all the relevant European institutions. Although there is no doubt that some progress has been made, the fact is that some questions still remain unanswered. I am thinking here of the eligibility criteria for the SMEs, in particular the proportion of time and annual turnover dedicated to research activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I am of the opinion that when setting these criteria we should be more broadminded and consider opening the Eurostars programme up to smaller enterprises with substantial innovation and development potential in spite of their size.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I want to say how pleased I am that my country, Slovakia, is also involved in the cooperation: this should improve the situation of small and medium-sized innovative enterprises whose development has to some extent been lagging behind until now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 22 Member States and the 5 states in Eureka that have decided to invest, together with the Commission, the 400 million euros to support the research carried out by small businesses, contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not forget that the SMEs represent 99% of the total European enterprises. The selection of projects to be financed by the Eurostars programme shall be made according to the scientific excellence and economic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I call attention to the difficulty that small and medium-sized enterprises meet in ensuring the co-financing of 50% of a project’s value.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the small enterprises would rather assign their specialists to projects bringing rapid income, to the detriment of long-term research programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the financing of small businesses based on a business plan might determine a very large number of SMEs participating in the European research.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, during this programme, the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs will also continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

SMEs need a solid technological base to enable them to boost their contribution to economic growth and development.</p>
<p class="contents">As a rule SMEs have a great capacity for initiative and adaptability since they are not stifled by bureaucracy and are normally run by entrepreneurs and managers who are highly committed to their work of wealth creation. That capacity for initiative and adaptability makes it easier to launch new business ventures involving the manufacture and/or sale of new products or the operation of new services tailored to the needs of consumers or other businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Such new products and services could frequently require a more solid technological base than is available in many such small enterprises, therefore the Eurostars joint research and development programme aimed at supporting SMEs could be very important because of its potential impact on the ‘real economy’. It will thus help to improve the skills of small and medium-sized enterprises in various European States, serving citizens as consumers as well as the European economy. It will thus also help to create more and better jobs. For all those reasons Mr Rübig’s report has been most useful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Potočnik and Mr Rübig. The Eurostars Joint Programme is an excellent means of achieving the Lisbon goals, of enhancing competitiveness, and of strengthening innovation. Research and development SMEs that spend at least 10% of their turnover on research and development are key players in this domain.</p>
<p class="contents">Hungary is a member of this programme, and interest in it has been enormous. More than 200 businesses fulfilling the criteria have applied, although a problem now emerging is that Member States have not set aside adequate resources. In Hungary, for example, only EUR 500 000 are available, sufficient for only 2-3 projects. Consequently, I think the Member States should at all events increase the resources allocated for this, or try to spend at least 3% of GDP on research and development so that we can be competitive at world-class level too. I believe that Eurostars and EUREKA are the kind of programmes that provide an excellent means of achieving this. Congratulations again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Scientific studies have shown that small businesses with simple technologies have room for good innovations, and I would very much like to emphasise this. This is also the case with family firms, in which investment is made in one child in the given firm’s line, so there is a certain continuity, and I consider this to be a very sound way of going on. Moreover, these firms are highly flexible, and for a small outlay are capable of moving from one place to another, and also from one product to another; I believe, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that if more than 60% of income in the EU comes from SMEs, it would be a major error on our part to skimp on investment in them and their development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

SMEs are a vital part of the European economy and here, as I have already said, in the Eurostars programme we are talking about SMEs which will be the ‘stars’ of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an innovative approach. It is not easy to implement approaches where we combine money from the Member States with Community funding, but it is definitely worthwhile, because that is exactly the direction in which we should go in the future. We are joining the best of EUREKA – flexibility, simplicity, decentralised approach, market orientation – with the best of the Framework Programme: centralised management, common evaluation and common selection. I can assure you that also in the other parts of the Framework Programme we are keeping our eyes very much open for the benefit of the SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Simplification is the name of the game, so we have introduced, as you are probably aware, a higher funding rate for SMEs than for the rest. So they have a 75% co-funding rate in the Framework Programme, while the rest of the bigger companies have 50%, which means that we are stimulating their participation. We have introduced a guarantee fund, which very much simplifies their participation in the Framework Programme, because the fact that they have to submit some bank guarantees in advance was one of the major problems for SMEs; and we are also about to introduce a ‘unique registration facility’ which will again ease the job because you will have to apply only once and all your data will be stored and the next time you apply this will be done automatically.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if we look at the results of the first year – and as you know, we agreed about the target of 15% funding which should go to SMEs from the cooperation part of the programme – we can say that it is working. While in Framework Programme 6 we were not achieving the target, from the first evaluations and first insight into the results, we can see that this figure is closer to 20% than 15%, which is a major step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also working in the Commission. I have just come from a meeting of the competitiveness group where we discussed the Small Business Act – that is the working title – where we want to address all the issues connected with SMEs in an organised way. I would also like to mention that, although today we are deciding about financial participation from the Community side, in fact this has already begun, and more than 200 have applied for the first call, which is an important success.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention that I am extremely glad that Luxembourg has decided to join. There is definitely no problem in substance. We should all do our best to make its accession to the programme as quick as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Implementation of research results in the short-term will, we hope, create new jobs and lead to higher net wages. Of course, an essential feature of innovation is that new products are offered, and thus also success is achieved on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that, together with the European Investment Bank, we have succeeded in providing an additional instrument for risk sharing, and that these sums can therefore be spread significantly further. We have also devised an evaluation in order to see whether the funds are actually being claimed and check that the European Parliament is not having to make cutbacks again on account of the funds not being completely exhausted in the previous year, as happens with other programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this programme can ensure that the funds are exhausted, and I would ask my fellow Members to ensure in the Member States, too, that cofinancing works as intended. It is in the interest of all of us that the take-up of this programme be good. I believe that it should also be communicated accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also ask Commissioner Potočnik to arrange with Commission Vice-President Wallström for this programme to be presented to the public as exemplary: this is part of the process. I should like once again to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency: this is a product and a project that is really worth showing off. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the EU economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In Germany alone, almost 20 million people are working, researching and developing in more than 3.3 million small and medium-sized enterprises. Whether Europe grows or stagnates mainly depends on them. Small and medium-sized enterprises produce more patents, innovations and jobs than the large conglomerates. Yet the SMEs continue to have too little access to loans and funding programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Eurostars is a good example of how things work. Unlike the Seventh Framework Programme, which is based on a top-down approach with central funding by the EU, Eureka and Eurostars are bottom-up approaches. The programmes are managed by the Eureka Initiative. This is a good thing, and could also perhaps be a model for our Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The advantages of the Eurostars programme are as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">•	research-intensive SME required in leadership role</p>
<p class="contents">•	eligibility checking and evaluation by international experts</p>
<p class="contents">•	harmonised invitations to tender and workflows in all Member States</p>

Small and medium-sized enterprises can often be effective participants in research and development but they have to put up with less favourable conditions than those that apply to large international corporations.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, SME associations performing research and development can avail of financial support from Europe and operate within a European network together with other small and medium-sized enterprises. Slovak SMEs will thus be able to contribute their knowledge and capacities to the European research and development sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In Slovakia many small and medium-sized enterprises are located in rural areas with less developed infrastructure, which hampers their development. Many women are employed in research and development performing SMEs, whether directly or indirectly. European funds are useful because they give SMEs a start, thus allowing their professional capacities to serve the common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurostars programme is a programme for researching and developing new products and services at European Union level. SMEs play a key role in Eurostars projects. It is a real pity that the Slovak Republic, an EU Member State, does not participate in this programme.

<p class="contents">Let me also thank the chairwoman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Ms Niebler, and the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Laperrouze and Mr Březina, for their constructive help. I understand that the request for a debate was made by a number of members of the ITRE Committee. I am therefore more than happy to summarise what is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, a protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice created the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, a smart financial design using the interest accrued from the assets made available at the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Treaty. Activities under that Treaty were funded through a levy paid by the coal and steel industries, 27.2% and 72.8% of the budget being respectively allocated to coal and steel.</p>
<p class="contents">Through a bottom-up approach, this Research Fund is intended exclusively to fund research projects in the sectors related to the coal and steel industries, two major traditional sectors where research is still needed: firstly, to comply with current EU policies on environmental standards to combat global climate change and, secondly, to maintain energy security of supply by having a fuel mix that meets European demand.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential principles and proper decision-making procedures related to the management of this fund are defined in the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel. These technical guidelines are to be reviewed or supplemented every five years, the first period ending on 31 December 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">On 10 July 2007, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision on the revision of these technical guidelines. This proposed revision looked to further the positive results achieved during the first five years of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel research programme, notably in terms of environmental protection. In the Commission’s view, no major overhaul was needed, but rather a fine tuning of the existing rules in order to adapt the guidelines to EU enlargement, to the Seventh Framework Programme and to current European regulations, notably in terms of gender balance and financial management policies. This proposal for a Council decision was sent to the European Parliament for consultation, and this is the reason why we are here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my appreciation of the fact that Mr Gierek’s report by and large supports the Commission’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This fund arose as a payment of 72.8% made by the steel industry and 27.2% made by the coal industry following the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty. The interest from this Fund amounts to around EUR 60 million a year, which makes it possible to provide top-up subsidies for research that does not come under the 7th Framework Programme. This concerns essential research for rationalisation of the functioning of both the iron and steel industry and coal mining, as well as research leading to further improvements in finished product quality in this industry, that is to say coal and steel. The need for such research activities is particularly relevant to these industries in the new countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Steel. Steel is still the most important construction material. The technological potential to raise the quality of various grades of steel and improvements in the efficiency of steel production are still far from exhausted, particularly where new technologies for the production of intermediate products for subsequent machining are concerned. Increased reliability of steel structures and increased operating efficiency of various items of machinery and equipment require considerable volumes of empirical research in this sphere. This also applies to improvements in chemical composition, and to improvements in the functional properties of various steel grades. Work on an effective and environmentally sound method of recycling scrap, e.g. steel from problematic galvanised automobile industry scrap, is also of exceptional importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Coal. Coal means energy security. The competitiveness of this solid fuel, the definition of which, according to the proposal made in this regulation, is to be expanded for practical purposes to include bitumen shales, also known as oil shales, which are mined in Estonia, depends on efficient utilisation of its regional reserves.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific problems of coal mining depend to a large extent on local geological conditions and require routine surveying work. These studies should precede the construction and operation of, for example, deep coking coal mines with a methane problem. Coal utilisation can also include the non-conventional method of its underground gasification. The continued proper functioning of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel requires that each advisory group include in its make-up experts able to guarantee optimal representation from the aspect of the location of the coal and steel industry in the European Union, with particular regard to experts from the new European Union countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Fund manages the assets of the now expired European Coal and Steel Community and invests the interest generated by the capital in coal and steel research.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the Commission’s proposal consistently reflects the changes that have taken place over the last five years, takes account of the provisions laid down in the Accession Treaties at the time of 2004 enlargement of the EU (one specific example already mentioned is Estonia’s Treaty of Accession), incorporates the fact that the definition of the term ‘coal’ is now broader, and focuses in particular on job protection and on effective use of materials and energy resources in production and manufacturing industries.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions dealing with amendments to the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development and to those areas that the Seventh Framework Programme does not cover in detail are also an important part of the proposal. In addition to the Commission’s proposal itself, I would like to praise the work of the rapporteur, Adam Gierek, and his report. The results of the vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which adopted all the substantive amendments, are a testament to the excellent groundwork and sensible approach to further investment in science and research in the area of coal and steel, two raw materials for energy and production that are currently irreplaceable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to ask my colleagues to reject unambiguously the proposals by certain groups aimed at undermining the importance of coal and steel and conventional energy sources in general, or, as the case may be, the importance of the future of this Fund, which has proved to be irreplaceable in terms of financing research. Coal and steel are among the most important raw materials for energy and manufacturing that have developed significantly in recent years. The report should thus take into account, for example, the geographical location of reserves: this will contribute towards more effective energy use and better energy security in the European Union as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">James Hansen, climatologist and research director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, recently declared that the scale of climate change had been underestimated but that we have various tools at our disposal, one of which is the closure of all coal-fired power stations by 2030. One gas-fired power station emits between 300 and 400 kilograms of CO<span class="sub">2</span> per megawatt-hour, a latest generation coal-fired power station emits 800 kilograms and a power station running on lignite emits 1 000 kilograms of CO<span class="sub">2</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">How consistent is the European Union being if, on the one hand, it is developing an ambitious plan to combat and adapt to climate change and, on the other, it is supporting coal as a clean energy source?</p>
<p class="contents">Humanity has gone from the wood age to the coal age, then to the oil age. Today, Parliament has the choice of supporting a return to the coal age or being consistent with the climate package and therefore not establishing coal as a clean energy source. For this reason my Group intends to support some of the amendments by the Verts.</p>

It is ‘all hands on deck’, as it were; the input of this fund, however small, contributes to the technological revolution necessary to keep the steel sector competitive and to make coal a clean fuel, a clean raw material: ‘clean coal’.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has also opted for this, on the eve of our pilot projects to achieve carbon capture and storage, for example as a technological innovation. I am emphatically in favour of this. I am not in favour of closing; I am in favour of keeping open. For example, NUON, a Dutch electricity company, is envisaging in Groningen a coal gasifier involving complete capture etc. This kind of project requires support and more resources than are currently on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">More important – as Commissioner Potočnik knows – is my plea for a better combination of funds, Structural Funds, input from the European Investment Bank, etc. More matching, bundling, is required to enable major research into infrastructure and investment. The existing rule ‘one fund, one project’ is a definite hindrance. We must also tinker with these rules, and fortunately the European Commission is already testing the boundaries in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">On 5 and 6 March we spoke in Brdo, Slovenia, about more focus and bundling of European projects. This summer, the Commission will be presenting a new profile for the Esprit programme, to achieve more targeted investment. This is what we want to hear about, not the phasing-out of coal.

<p class="contents">I believe Europe’s economic power relies on having the best steel at the lowest costs, therefore the results coming from common research should be shared at the Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">In many European countries, there are regions that depend mostly on coal and steel production. The conversion of the labour force employed in coal and steel production is still unsolved and, unfortunately, the regions in question have entered the category of regions with problems in the standard of living and need cohesion programmes.</p>

I must make it clear that today we are talking about additional funding for R&amp;D based on an existing fund, based on a protocol – to be more precise, we talk about the technical guidelines. I believe that it is better that this money is used for research and development rather than for anything else, because it is true that in energy and climate change there is no room for complacency.</p>
<p class="contents">CCS is one of the activities which will also be addressed, but it is far from being the real answer. So the real questions, and the real debate about the issues which you opened today, will come when we discuss the strategy for the energy technology plan – how to approach this, how to act in the future, and how to find the right answers. In this respect, it will be extremely important that we are aware that ‘business as usual’ is not an option. We lack human resources and we lack funding. The Framework Programme is only partially a solution for that.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to address that issue seriously because we need to look at it both from a short-term point of view, looking for possible solutions to fill the gap where the need is urgent, and at the same time for long-term solutions. Such solutions are very much needed and we must concentrate on renewables from today onwards. So I think that will be when we have to discuss that. Do not forget that the financing of energy in 1980 was approximately four times higher in Europe than it is today. So approaching these problems as though business as usual could continue would be another illusion. Do not make that mistake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that energy security, for example in my country, in the Czech Republic and in many other EU countries, is not consistent with this view, and this view is not generally accepted. Quite the contrary, in fact: if only because of new technologies that are being developed, such as ‘clean coal’ and ‘CCS’, we shall probably be opening new mines in the future. Coal will continue to be an important and competitive source of energy in Europe for some time to come. We must also not forget – and here I am addressing those who would like to close all mines – that coal is not only an important raw material for energy, but also a chemical raw material.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, then, the Research Fund for Coal and Steel is necessary. Secondly, this Fund is not met by the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme, as it deals with an entirely different sphere of action. Thirdly, a rise in qualified costs from 40% to 50% is indicated.

Consequently Poland is particularly interested in new technologies for coal utilisation that improve efficiency in power stations, reduce CO2 emissions and enable coal to be converted into hydrocarbon fuels with restricted CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">New technologies open up the possibility of utilising nuclear reactors as emission-free heat sources to achieve the stated aims of the coal industry.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to implement the synergy between coal and nuclear energy, however, we need high-temperature reactors (HTRs). In Europe, research into high-temperature reactors has been going on for some years now. Unfortunately there is not a single European research centre working on HTRs that might have the goal of introducing a coal-nuclear synergy programme. Such a centre would enhance Europe technologically, including the coal industry. It could also do much to support the acceptance of nuclear power in Europe through direct cooperation with the coal industry, striving to modernise it and not competing with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the importance of coal in the Polish energy sector, it would appear to make sense to set up such a European centre in Poland. Without decisive action, we shall lose the technology race in this sphere against the United States, South Africa, China and South Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Commission to consider the need to establish such a centre as part of long-term technical guidelines relating to the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The revenue from these assets is to be used for research in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry. The Council has adopted two regulations to improve implementation of the research programme: a financial regulation and a technical regulation. The Gierek report concerns the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Treaty of Accession of Estonia to the EU, oil shales were given the status of coal. As a result, the European Commission proposed that the Council should make the technical guidelines for the research programme on coal and steel consistent with the Treaty and included oil shales in the definition of coal under the technical guidelines. As a result, Estonian research into oil shales is eligible to apply for funding under the research programme on the same basis as coal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Polish rapporteur, Adam Gierek, has proposed replacing ‘oil shales’ in the definition with ‘bitumen shales’, on the ground that the term ‘bitumen shales’ also covers ‘oil shales’. In fact, the opposite is true: ‘oil shales’ is a broader term than ‘bitumen shales’. The Greens have made a proposal to remove oil shales from the definition of coal completely. Once again I draw your attention to the fact that when it acceded to the EU, Estonia agreed that oil shales were to have the status of coal and therefore the basis of funding for the oil shales research programme must be the same as that of the research fund for coal and steel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have therefore prepared this report by consulting as much as possible with all those involved in the sector. Consequently I would like to thank all the experts and professionals from the industry, as well as web user and consumer associations and finally my colleagues in the Committee on Culture for all the discussions we have been able to hold on these crucial issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is based on the following postulate: culture and the economy have today become inseparable. The economy needs culture and culture needs the economy. In view of this, culture urgently needs to be restored to its rightful place on the Lisbon agenda. With this in mind, I make a number of proposals in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">The first would be to set up a task force to explore the relationship between culture, creativity and innovation in the context of Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is essential make more room in our Community funding for the cultural industries. In this report, at the level of the Member States I recommend private/public funding as well as the promotion of a regulatory and fiscal framework that favours cultural industries, and more specifically the application of tax credits and reduced rates of VAT to all cultural products, including online works. I also call upon the Commission to look into the possibility of setting up a programme similar to the MEDIA programme for all the cultural industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, this report proposes that culture be better incorporated into the European Union’s external policies because – and I want to stress this – what makes Europe so rich is its culture or rather, as I should have said, the diversity of its culture. I therefore invite the Commission and the Member States to increase the amount of aid for translation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if you will allow me Mr President, I would like to return to the issue of intellectual property rights, which are the subject of a great number of amendments in this report. On this subject, I strongly oppose the position of some Member States whose repressive measures are dictated by industries incapable of changing their economic model in line with the needs imposed by the information society. Cutting off internet access is a disproportionate measure in view of the objectives. This is a penalty with powerful effects, which could have serious repercussions in a society where internet access is essential for social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to make a distinction between mass piracy and consumers acting without a profit motive. Rather than criminalising consumers, we need to set up new economic models that strike a balance between the ability to access cultural activities and content, cultural diversity and genuine remuneration for those who hold intellectual property rights. It seems to me that this is the only way cultural Europe can truly enter the 21<span class="sup">st</span> century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure, as he said, that culture is important to our lives and it is more and more central to the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that it defines our Community much more than business or geography. We also need to understand that culture makes a contribution; culture creates; culture is something positive, not consuming our budgets or conflicting with our needs but bringing a lot of enrichment, including jobs and growth. This was the first time that the European Union was able to explicitly recognise last year’s summit conclusions, in the study we presented some time ago, and now in the cultural agenda for the European Union at a time of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline just three specific ideas or items from your report, because there are many and I will not comment on all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">First, you ask us to establish a European vision of culture, creativity and innovation. The European agenda we have now agreed does exactly that. We are strengthening the cooperation between Member States, including the promotion of creative industries. This is one of three pillars. Part of that work will need to look at how to measure more accurately the contribution these industries make to the economy and how best to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, you ask us to look at the external dimension. This is one of the three priorities of the agenda and we are very active now in encouraging our partners, our Member States, to ratify the UNESCO Convention – because not all Member States and also other countries in the world have done so – and also in ensuring its implementation. And we are increasingly including cultural elements both in our development cooperation and in our bilateral relations with emerging economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, I agree with you that full attention has to be paid to implementing Article 151 fully in EU policies. I have established really good contacts and cooperation with my colleagues, including Commissioner McCreevy on the internal market, on the various aspects of copyright protection. I am confident that, with the help of all of you, we will achieve the objectives laid down in this Treaty article.</p>
<p class="contents">You also mention the mobility of artists and cultural workers, which is very high on our agenda, especially this year. Member States have already constituted a working group on this topic and the Commission is implementing the pilot action on the mobility of artists proposed by this Parliament last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will support all these efforts, in particular with a study to better understand the links between culture, creativity and innovation, as well as another study on how to have an environment conducive to the development of creative and cultural industries, including support for small and medium-sized enterprises and risk-taking.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of these initiatives will feed into a Green Paper on cultural and creative industries, which the Commission plans to publish in 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">I am looking forward to the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particular attention must therefore be given to protecting intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">The task of the European Union, and of the Member States, should be to provide the necessary resources to ensure that intellectual property rights are respected and protected. Combating piracy is particularly important in this regard. All those involved should be aware of their rights and obligations regarding a common solution to this task.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report, our committee has argued in favour of awareness-raising and education campaigns, particularly with regard to consumers. Preparatory and education measures explaining the value of intellectual property should start among young people in schools. In this context I should like to emphasise once again the committee’s opinion that criminalising consumers who are not seeking to make a profit is not the right solution to combating digital piracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have repeatedly emphasised that free information structures such as the World Wide Web are of great significance to the European creative sector and that we have to strike a balance between the openness of the Internet and the protection of intellectual property. In this context, Mr President, allow me one final comment on the revised version of Amendment 22a tabled by 40 Members. My group – the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats – has clearly stated that it is prepared to support the first part of the amendment, and to emphatically reject the second part of this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At this stage, over and above Article 157 of the Treaty and the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, Europe must aim at an appropriate balance to help businesses, agencies, production and services in this sector to be fully competitive. At the same time, Europe must not put its distinct cross-cultural nature at risk or endanger diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, Commissioner, during the coming year, which is the European Year of Creativity and Innovation, as you have said yourself, I think that it is the right time for the EU to turn actively towards the cultural industries. We must get away from the perception that they are a luxury, but make specific policies to boost investment in this sector.</p>

<p class="contents">With the digital world comes a paradigm shift.

The free circulation of works is culture’s natural habitat. We combat piracy for profit, but we are completely opposed to criminalising consumers. We still need some constraints and blocks in the digital world because we have not yet discovered another way of providing authors with suitable remuneration; but those days are numbered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sector contributes 2.6% of the EU’s GDP, as has been said. It shows higher growth than the economy in general and over five million people are employed in it.</p>
<p class="contents">These are three very clear reasons why the Commission should keep its hands well away, unless we want to see culture go the same way as fishing and agriculture. However, the trading deficit in motion pictures alone between the EU and the United States grows year on year as European audiences choose American, rather than European, products. That deficit, according to the latest figures, was GBP 7.2 billion in one year alone.</p>
<p class="contents">Free from the restraint placed on them by reliance on state funding, the six major US motion picture companies turned over USD 42.6 billion in 2006, whilst, according to a report by the European Audiovisual Observatory, the overall situation of the European film industry is deteriorating. That is because subsidies and legislation do not inspire artists – they breed bureaucrats and parasites. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, these developments have been almost exclusively positive. Culture has been vitalised, democratised and disseminated widely. Despite this, much of the European debate currently focuses on problems which the Internet is claimed to create for those engaging in cultural activities. That is unfortunate.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not to say that there are no challenges to culture. Copyright infringements and illegal file sharing are examples of such challenges. Large parts of this report also focus on these problems. Many proposals are currently circulating in Europe on how we are to deal with these issues. Unfortunately, in many cases little attention is devoted to our fundamental freedoms and rights as citizens. For example, perhaps the most controversial of these proposals right now seeks to ban those who have committed copyright infringement from accessing the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity of urging my colleagues to support the amendment which I have tabled to this report. Briefly, my proposal emphasises the positive role which the Internet has played in culture and democracy, but it also rejects the idea of banning individual citizens from access to the Internet. Copyright infringements and file sharing must be combated by sanctions which are proportionate and which respect fundamental rights and freedoms. Forbidding individuals to access the Internet is in my opinion a gross violation of freedom of expression and information and is anything but proportionate. The Internet is more than just a copying machine or a channel for the illegal dissemination of films or music. It is an arena for free speech, information and communication.</p>
<p class="contents">For my younger brother, the Internet is as natural as watching television or chatting in the school playground at break time. And are we going to impose similar restrictions when a copyright is infringed in other ways? It was not so long ago that I was at university and there, unfortunately, many students illegally copied their course literature, but to punish them by forbidding them to read books or write articles would clearly be unreasonable. Someone who has shoplifted food is not forbidden to buy milk and someone who has stolen a bicycle is not forbidden to use the street. So let us not do anything so silly as regards other offences just because they have been committed on the Internet. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to comment briefly on one aspect that I consider to be a priority: in the information, communication and digital technology society new forms of production and distribution are constantly emerging that mean new opportunities for producers, creators, artists and consumers. In this new context it is essential to find new, balanced formulas that combine respect for the rights of creators with citizens’ access to these cultural assets.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, cultural industries and creators, including SMEs, due to their dual cultural and economic roles, contribute both to promoting cultural diversity and to creating new jobs and possibilities for economic development and, given that they are part of one of the most dynamic sectors our economy, aid for the creative sector should be seen as an investment. Therefore, promoting lifelong learning that fosters creative talent and the phenomenon of synergies between businesses in the sector and schools should be a priority in European policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The statement that, if he had to start all over again, he would start with culture, is attributed to Jean Monet. The written history of Europe goes back two and a half thousand years, and how rich and various is its content. Culture is a significant component of the development of our civilisation. Action favouring the industry that is linked to culture should be supported. It would be a good thing if funds could be found for the development of a network of modern libraries in Poland, with thought for people who cannot afford to buy books. There are still districts in Warsaw where there are no proper academic reading rooms. There is no working inter-library exchange system. Young people have to go into the city centre to access scientific works. The library system in the United States might serve as a model. Funds are needed for the development of local libraries that would provide access to the necessary materials, thus enabling people to educate themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not fully agree with Recital T of the report. National identity and language are at the root of creativity. Modern European culture only began when Dante and Petrarch began writing in Italian. The reason for the development of European civilisation has always been the spread of human individuality, its spiritual progress and the fact that peoples have made use of this to enrich the content of their own collective life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The topic of the cultural industries is closely connected to the topic of the economic value of culture. Culture is now referred to in terms of means towards economic growth, and many studies now emphasise the economic impact of cultural activities. In this context, I recall the study <span class="italic">The Economy of Culture in Europe</span> made in 2006 by a private consultant, KEA European Affairs, that presents some impressive numbers for the cultural sector; however, these numbers are debatable since MP3 players, mobile phones and publicity are also considered by this study as ‘culture’.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we feel that focusing on such economic aspects may lead to confusion, and important things such as creativity or artistic potential may be put in second place if they do not turn out to be sufficiently profitable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am in favour of a cultural policy that supports cultural diversity, artistic creativity and the development of the artistic potential of individuals and communities: these are all guidelines that I think we should keep in mind for future action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, the report itself is very interesting and as the Chairwoman of the Committee, Mrs Batzeli, said, in many ways it also represents a stimulus for the Commission, for the Member States and for the world of culture and creative industries.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the main theme or main goal is to get an overall picture, to make these stimuli a centre of attention and to create an environment that is favourable to creativity, innovation, culture itself and the status of culture in our society and our relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say just a few words. We cannot exist without the economy but it is culture that lends meaning to our relations and our identities, and that defines the values that unite us in the Community. That is my answer to those who worry about everything being seen nowadays in economic terms and expressed in monetary values. Culture is about more than money but it is important to see it as a creative asset, as something that creates jobs and helps to develop the economy. The absence of culture in most cases results in the deterioration not only of the economy but also of politics and society. The absence of culture therefore has many consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am pleased to see broad support for creativity and innovation in the proposals concerning the European Commission’s proposal for 2009. The formal proposal itself is already in this Parliament and I hope that the legislative procedure will soon lead to its adoption and to preparations for the European Year of Creativity and Innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would just like to say a few words about fighting piracy. I believe, like many of you here today, that we must achieve a balance between accessing culture and its accessibility, communication and cultural opportunities on the one hand, and protecting intellectual property rights on the other hand. We must combat the abuse of intellectual property rights since this is often the reason why smaller and weaker enterprises collapse. That is the position of the European Commission. One way of dealing with this problem is through education: raising awareness of the importance of protecting intellectual property rights and not abusing freedoms. The other method is to invite and organise all stakeholders or those who have responsibilities in this area, to get them to cooperate and contribute to the efforts to protect intellectual property rights while developing access to electronic networks in modern communications. This is, after all, what we proposed for the first time in our recent proposal to reform the electronic communications networks and services (Telecoms Package) and it is also the European Commission’s attitude to the fight against piracy. Of course, a lot has to be done by the Member States themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">That is all I wanted to say, thank you. I look forward to further cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite what some subjective studies would have us believe, it is not the 13% of Europeans downloading cultural content illegally who are threatening our culture, but it seems to me that it is the concentration of our culture in the hands of a few large groups that is damaging our diversity and therefore the richness of our cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">I will only give you one example, that of records. Today, 95% of what is distributed comes from the four big record companies. I believe it is important to ensure that consumers have genuine choice and it is necessary to guarantee pluralism of content in a very concentrated market where those chiefly responsible for innovation and creativity are small, not big. You were talking about SMEs, Commissioner, recommending a study which I think is a really interesting idea.</p>
<p class="contents">The permission for a merger between Sony and BMG granted by the Commission totally contradicts the European policy to support SMEs in the music industry, which create more jobs than the large companies and represent 99% of the market players and 80% of innovation in this sector. It seems, therefore, that there is an urgent need to support diversity in the cultural sector, which is a genuine driver of growth and a means of development for individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I will say that it is the diversity of culture that makes it rich and not the other way around. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the EU must make a stronger commitment to supporting cultural industries by stimulating job creation in this area to counter the relocation of the EU’s traditional industries to emerging economies.</p>

When pondering the status of cultural industries in European society, there are two basic principles that need to be remembered.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we need to understand how important culture is for people’s quality of life. Cultural products enhance wellbeing. The Community recognises that Europeans have basic rights to education, which include people’s right to culture. We are therefore talking about fundamental civil rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to understand how important culture is for those who produce it. For many the work is not just a passion - it is a livelihood. Receiving appropriate payment for one’s work is a basic right. It is up to the legislators to ensure that such people can work in an environment which is not detrimental to their rights. There is no cultural output without its creators, and if they are not paid for the work they do, the result is a limit to cultural growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation on cultural industries, such as the protection of intellectual property rights and neighbouring rights, therefore always has to strike the right balance between culture’s two social dimensions. It requires special sensitivity on the part of the legislator. It has to be recognised that cultural industries are a very special sector and therefore require a very special legal status.</p>
<p class="contents">The main challenge for cultural industries is obviously information technology. They clearly benefit from developments in technology and the information market, but at the same time they need protection when new systems are being used.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need the Commission to deliver prompt measures to clarify the relationship between intellectual property and culture and the economy. The main challenge is how we can guarantee fair and genuine remuneration for every right holder and each individual cultural industry for the work done, at the same time ensuring that consumers have choice and easy access to cultural products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The KEA study commissioned by the European Commission significantly underestimates the contribution of cultural industries to our economy and society. While only 3.1% of the EU’s active population may be directly generating monetary value in the cultural area, their impact is noticeable almost in every aspect of our lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Pop culture carries cultural and social messages. Musicians and actors were instrumental in releasing the green economy wave. Music and film are powerful promoters of better understanding between people and of European values. Cultural industries predominantly created the demand for new technologies, for digital platforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is vital that the European cultural industries remain viable. First of all, we must ensure that creative people are able to sustain themselves by their creativity. This means that we must enable the creators to distribute their work as widely as possible, without any fear of abuse from the middlemen or the consumers.</p>

The European cultural heritage, in all its dimensions, must, by every means, be preserved and disseminated both within and outside the Union, without denying the fact that it is wholly desirable to take as open an attitude as possible to every other culture, which has, moreover, always been the hallmark of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our cultural heritage, encompassing its diverse forms of expression and the combination of its founding sources, such as, Graeco-Latin and Judaeo-Christian antiquity, has, over the course of history, placed Europe in the vanguard of all the continents. It has proved to be an unrivalled driver of innovation, development and progress, which has spread in every direction, and today still constitutes an essential reference point for humanism, spiritual enrichment and enlivenment, democracy, tolerance, and citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">In an increasingly globalised world, the outstanding specific qualities contained within the nucleus of Europe’s cultural richness constitute genuine European added value and their identity-giving role is vital for Europe and the Union in that it helps them to understand the world, bring about cohesion, emphasise their uniqueness, and assert themselves in relation to other peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The particular ways in which the influence of European cultural heritage has over the course of history found expression in other continents must lead to special measures emphasising those factors which serve to build civilisation, mutual understanding and a constructive approach uniting the peoples represented. We recommend the Council and the Commission should enhance the prestige of Europe’s classical heritage and the historic contributions of national cultures in all their dimensions down through the centuries, while also allowing for the needs of the culture sector in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore suggest that the year 2011 be considered ‘European Year of the Greek and Latin Classics’ in order to make the peoples of the Union and the rest of the world more aware of this essential aspect of cultural heritage now in danger of being forgotten. For the same reason we stress the need to develop the promotion of European languages in the world and their role in creative artistic activity in other continents, so as to facilitate both mutual knowledge and understanding and the cultural interaction generated and conveyed by those languages in their extra-European dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the existing Community programmes in the culture sector do not fully reflect the implications of Europeans’ common cultural heritage, which is why we need specific programmes in order to foster creativity and preserve the links, on a wider scale and at a deeper seated level, with the goods and values, both tangible and intangible, that constitute European cultural heritage and to enable those goods and values to interact according to the humanist conception of identities and differences and in present-day cultural works.</p>
<p class="contents">The programmes in the cultural sector will all do a great deal to foster cohesion, real convergence, economic growth, sustainable development, innovation, employment and competitiveness, but we should not forget that culture and cultural products have value in themselves (culture qua culture). We would remind the Council that the intended budgetary funding for the measures proposed in the Commission communication and those already in existence need to be reviewed immediately and as a matter of urgency. Finally, since there is no time to mention any more points, I welcome the Commission’s communication and its approval by the Council. We agree with the objectives set. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it confirms that culture deserves a more central place in our discussions, and in our days and years of cooperation. I think it is confirmation that we have moved from an original agenda dominated by hard material – coal and steel – to intangibles like culture, education, creativity and citizenship. We cannot measure it in kilos or tonnes but it is about the future of our unity, of our communities at local, regional and national, as well as European, level.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that is why we put forward the proposal. Since last year it has received a great deal of concrete attention and support in the public domain in the Member States as well as in the Council. I am happy to see it because this was the most important answer: we want to work more through culture, for culture and also for the world of cultures or culture in the world. I am happy to see your support for this agenda, which is also very important. It has always been very clear to me as Commissioner, and also to the Commission, that the Parliament seeks to do more in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we need to adopt a common approach. This is the way to implement this agenda. The three basic areas are important, and were also mentioned in the previous report: creative industries; cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue; and, equally important, the external dimension – external cooperation in culture and culture in the Union’s external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you that we should not give too much weight to the economic importance of culture, but we really need to get the right balance in our cultural policies. Your report rightly recognises the importance of giving culture a larger role in international relations. We consider that this is an opportunity to build a proactive and constructive agenda on cultural diversity in Community policies. I know I can count on your collaboration in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of mobility, we support the need for transnational mobility of cultural players as a major tool for building a European cultural area. Look, for example, at Erasmus in education. After a decade – now two decades – we have a European higher education area, the most popular programme and a lot of modernisation and openness at our universities. I think this quest for mobility, knowledge, respect and acceptance should also be developed in the area of arts and culture. I believe we can achieve a great deal now by starting the pilot project on mobility that you in the Parliament proposed last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, it is important, as I said, to adopt a common approach. I am happy that Member States endorsed open methods of coordination. In November last year two expert working groups with representatives of Member States were set up with the aim of enhancing mobility of artists and culture professionals, as well as maximising the potential of the cultural and creative industries. You will be duly informed of the results of the work within these groups. As you know, we set up the cultural forum and the first was organised under the Portuguese Presidency, for which I am grateful. We also suggest that the cultural and creative sector at large should set up a platform on the cultural and creative industries and one on the access to culture, along the lines of the existing platform on intercultural dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there is a growing volume of potential contribution and I am happy to work with my colleagues in the Commission, as well as here with you in Parliament, to reinforce the mainstreaming of culture in many other EU policies. I am, of course, looking forward, not only to the debate, but especially to the implementation of this agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report shows the importance of culture for the development of the European Union and for enhancing the potential for innovation and increased competitiveness. Culture is a sector that creates jobs and gives a genuine boost to economic growth. On behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I would like to draw your attention to the significance of the regions of the European Union as an important forum for cultural cooperation. Culture and language stimulate the development of regions and are a magnet for investment, especially in poorly developed regions with meagre natural resources and few tourist and leisure attractions. This is why local and regional authorities have such an important part to play in generally supporting and nurturing culture in the areas under their control. There is just one item in the report about which I have reservations – and here I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, so that I do not have to repeat myself in a moment – and that is what we find under Recital K, which suggests that we demand that immigrants and tourists subordinate themselves to European tradition and heritage. This is not a good piece of phrasing. During the Committee’s work, the members of the ALDE Group voted against this.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Year of Intercultural Dialogue it is worth pointing out that the European Union should, in putting into practice the values of intercultural dialogue, be open to other cultures. It should promote and create common ground for cooperation by putting forward interesting programmes. It is therefore not a good thing that the potential for European third countries to take part in the exceptionally engaging and prestigious European Capital of Culture programme after 2010 has been scrapped.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I was supposed to be making a further speech in just a moment, so I would like to request another 10 seconds this time round, if I may, and then I shall not get up a second time.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is first and foremost those countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy that should have the possibility of taking part in this programme. I keenly support the demand made in the report for 2010 to be declared as the European Year of Fryderyk Chopin, given that it is the 200<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary of the birth of this composer of genius, who made an incontrovertible contribution to European and world culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you, too, to the Commission for presenting this communication on the European agenda for culture. It can count on Parliament’s support for culture as a horizontal task, for increasing artists’ mobility, for increasing regional cooperation and for strengthening international cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also note the absence of something on this agenda. This is a subject we discussed in detail a little while ago. The cultural industries and their growing significance also mean that the economic aspects are becoming considerably stronger than has been the case in the past. The agenda for culture is not only about issues of better cooperation on the cultural agenda or of increased funding, but also of the legal framework. In that regard, it is indeed true even within the European Union that, if culture is in competition with internal market law or competition law, it always draws the short straw in case of doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">You will all remember the Lévai report: the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services described collective management societies for online music as obstacles to competition on the internal market. Here culture clearly draws the shorter straw and is in a weaker position than European internal market law. Hence the urgent need, and tomorrow Parliament will decide the same way as the Committee on Culture and Education. The Unesco Convention must be applied not only to securing cultural diversity with regard to third countries, but also as a matter of the utmost urgency in our own European law.</p>
<p class="contents">Our heartfelt plea to the Commissioner, therefore, is that we have just one time slot, and therefore need a proposal quickly for strengthening cultural diversity in European internal market law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As shadow rapporteur, I express my thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to focus on just a couple of points. As of the beginning of 2009 our circumstances will have changed: the Lisbon Treaty will have entered into force. In order for our diplomatic representatives to be able to represent our cultures properly, the cultural dimension should be consistently incorporated into our external policy. Currently we are a long way from achieving that. Initially we are talking of incorporating a cultural dimension only into development activities although this in itself poses difficulties for us. There are many very valuable elements in European culture, but instead of enjoying the aggregate of those elements we seem to achieve only an arithmetical average. European culture has, unfortunately, only a small presence worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">I venture to believe that the world’s finest film-makers and writers live in Europe, yet the world’s cinemas are dominated by Hollywood and the bookshops are full of entertainment in paperback form from America. Why do we translate mass foreign products, and why do we not translate each other’s best authors? Why do third countries aided by us prefer to spend money on American cultural products? This situation is in need of change.</p>
<p class="contents">We must without doubt place greater focus on re-establishing a common European cultural space. A cultural space which includes the countries of the Mediterranean and Central Europe as well as the Nordic, Baltic and East European countries. We will be stronger as a result, and will achieve an aggregate incorporating all the valuable elements, an aggregate which is greater than the sum of its parts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The draft resolution draws attention to the need for a specific approach to the problems of culture at a time of globalisation. Regardless of our openness to the heritage of other cultures, it is exceptionally important to protect, disseminate and promote European culture. It is important to remember the roots of our culture, and especially the role of the Greek and Latin classics; however, we should also look at those areas of culture that cross borders without hindrance and without the need for translation. I have in mind music and painting.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2010 it will be 200 years since the birth of Fryderyk Chopin – a composer of genius who is known throughout the world. Emphasising the significance of this event will make it easier to perceive the part played by all the outstanding European musicians – Mozart, Liszt, Handel, Haydn, Schumann, Verdi, Grieg, Berlioz, Paganini and many others – in the creation of European civilisation and in its contribution to world culture.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also draws attention to current problems faced by artists in such matters as crossing frontiers, as well as the impact of their mobility on artistic development, and emphasises the role of art in economic development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This really is a new quality. It changes the European Union’s self-image regarding the importance of culture and its strategic importance to policy as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture is always a double-edged sword, and this is what is particularly interesting. It is always a product, but it is more than a product because it carries meaning and purpose. This evening I should like once again to put it in graphic terms: I am anticipating that this dual nature of culture will really have an effect in all policy fields, particularly regarding internal-market logic.

This, however, is a term that can be interpreted in many ways. Across the European Union a global culture can be the essence of the best that individual European cultures represent. It can also be a post-modern universal culture that gradually overrides and forces out original European diversity. Personally, I favour the former scenario. I want the European Union to promote cultural diversity that enriches nations and lets them learn from each other. A globalised world globalises our lifestyles and ways of working. Multinational companies have turned our cities into a common marketplace so that sometimes we do not know whether we are in Paris or in Prague. As far as I am concerned, we have now had quite enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Culture has a place in the soul of a nation and roots in its place of origin. Culture can be communicated and is capable of both absorbing and eliminating. It is also vulnerable, however, if it becomes a mere commodity or makes concessions to popular tastes in order to be ‘accessible to all’. Culture should indeed be accessible to all but it should promote high values instead of pandering, set higher targets instead of reflecting our low demands, because the general public does not need a great deal to satisfy it. I would like to thank the rapporteur for emphasising in his report the importance of preserving the cultural heritage of all European nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He quite rightly calls for the strengthening of actions in areas such as literary translation, the promotion of European languages, the teaching of art and the cultural industries, but also in the protection and promotion of our heritage. In this regard, we need to promote existing cultural programmes and support new initiatives such as the creation of a European heritage label, which will help to develop a common identity while encouraging cultural tourism.</p>

Once again the central role of culture in European integration and in the worldwide image of the European Union is being highlighted. How we choose to deal with this recognition, which is not new but is extremely important, and integrate it into every area of policy – as is already specified in Article 151 – has been well defined in the present agenda for culture.</p>
<p class="contents">It is pleasing that, during the preparatory work, a wide consultation process took place with various cultural stakeholders who do essential cultural work, for which we must thank them. We urgently need this cultural strategy in order, for example, not only to be continually referring to our cultural diversity with pride, but also to be able to cope with the challenge of dealing with this diversity and the problems that arise.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementation of the strategy will be crucial, however. President Barroso announced a task force for culture back in November 2005 in Budapest, which could be an important signal to the outside world, but has not so far been implemented. I hope this will not be the case with this agenda for culture. Promoting culture is a return on investment in the areas of intercultural dialogue, of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and of internal relations, and it is also above all a social value added.</p>
<p class="contents">We use art and culture. It offers us great benefit in almost every social and economic field. It should not be exploited, taken advantage of or starved out, however, and we should also therefore be thinking of an appropriate budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Creating a parallel with the European Union, in order to know and understand European culture in a globalized world, we should learn the history of European construction, especially since, as of 2009, the new Treaty of the European Union will become effective, we will all be European citizens and each citizen has the obligation to know his/her history.</p>
<p class="contents">My initiative aims at preventing future situations in which young people learn parallel histories, which have no ground in reality. Since the European Parliament has just celebrated half a century of existence, I believe it deserves to have a history that promotes cultural identity and European culture in the context of globalization. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If this plan is to be implemented, it must receive political and financial support. The Community’s existing cultural programmes do not fully reflect the scope of our common European cultural heritage. I support the calls to the Commission to propose specific programmes to promote both artistic creativity and the tangible and intangible goods and values that constitute European cultural heritage. This cultural heritage should be managed in a sustainable manner. The support of public/private partnerships is vital to achieve this goal. The proposal to establish a European arts sponsorship scheme may be a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore, I welcome the drafting of this report, which correctly emphasizes the importance of this field and the need to mobilize its potential fully.

<p class="contents">From the report’s multitude of recommendations, I would like to reiterate two aspects. First of all, at an internal level, it is essential for the local and regional actors to get involved in promoting culture, as factors of economic development and Lisbon Strategy implementation, as well as of consolidating cultural heritage and promoting cohesion in contemporary society. Second, it is in the European Union’s best interests to promote culture and intercultural dialogue at an adequate level in its foreign policy.</p>

This is a testimony to the belief in the importance of culture and the current agenda. I want to assure you (although I am one of the new arrivals from the enlargement) that never before in the Union has culture been as prominent and as central as it is today. Of course, this is not only about the formal agenda: it is about a process, progress and implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years several things were achieved for the first time in history: the European Commission’s role as a representative of the Community as well as common representation of Europe’s 25 or 27 Member States in UNESCO are the results of a certain cultural maturity.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago the Member States agreed to introduce an open method of coordination although many people did not expect them to do so. We have a permanent forum for culture, 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and there is a consensus on making 2009 the European Year of Creativity and Innovation: all this represents enormous progress.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, culture has of course a dual nature. It has an economic dimension but it is also a vehicle for conveying meaning and substance. That is why culture is specific and lacks exclusivity in European law. That is also why in individual cases or disputes we want European law to apply but at the same time we want the specific nature of culture to be taken into account: the need to maintain and strengthen the culture diversity that is our heritage, our distinguishing feature.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, let me say that I agree that more investment is needed. The Commission proposed a budget of EUR 500 million for the Culture Programme but only EUR 400 million was approved. In the future it may be possible to support cultural aspects under other programmes as well. When we were summing up the contributions of the Structural Funds to individual structural operations in the 27 Member States, I was very pleased to find out that for the period 2007–2013 approximately EUR 5 billion have been allocated to culture as a whole, across the entire Union, from the Structural Funds. If we act responsibly, we can combine our individual potential, resources and policies. This, I assure you, is also my responsibility and I would like to invite you to cooperate and help to implement this agenda. Finally, I would like to thank Mr Vasco Graça Moura once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First I should like to stress the new policy to introduce culture in the terms set out in the Commission’s communication. That was mentioned by Mrs Trüpel and it is a question of ensuring that the cultural aspect is included in other European policies. I think that is fundamental. The second point was raised by Mrs Mikko, and concerns the cultural dimension that should be incorporated in Europe’s external policy, not merely European Union culture but the culture of the Member States – it is absolutely essential. Thirdly, as Mrs Hieronymi mentioned, there is a fine balance between economic aspects and the economic utility of culture and culture as a value in its own right (culture qua culture).</p>
<p class="contents">Just two more points, Mrs Staniszewska mentioned the importance of cultural action at regional and local level that is also emphasised in the report, but I think needs to be underscored. I am in complete agreement with that. Finally, I must also stress that giving families and students access to culture via schools and society, as well as building bridges between cultural heritage and the exact sciences, innovation and technology, are fundamental aspects of those concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, since it is impossible to go into any further aspects, I should merely like to conclude by saying that culture is an inalienable and indispensable system of individual collective values and experiences and that it is with those collective and individual values and experiences in mind that Europe should approach the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should also focus more on the preservation of cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Culture Programme is good, but is not enough, and I support the idea that we should have other programmes alongside it, more focused on the preservation and promotion of European cultural heritage.

In this Year of Intercultural Dialogue, it is important to devote special attention to promoting diversity and intercultural dialogue, as culture is a key dimension of the Lisbon Strategy and we will not achieve the fundamental Lisbon goals unless we treat it as such.</p>
<p class="contents">I was disappointed to see that the report pays scant attention to relations among cultures, minorities, national or ethnic groups, or among the countries they live in. We cannot ignore the fact that the arts have a prominent role to play in the integration of minorities, but they can also provide social support for talented but impoverished artists. By supporting the arts and artists, we can provide prospects for poor ethnic groups that are transnational in character, such as the Roma people, who have preserved their centuries-old cultural tradition to the present day.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must ensure that regulations governing commercial (Internet) relations are open and transparent to ensure fair market access, thereby allowing European cultural industries to develop all their potential, particularly in the audiovisual and musical sectors. Alongside adequate consumer protection, we must eradicate the root causes of counterfeiting and piracy, and protect Europe’s cultural diversity by means of sound and fair regulation of competition based on achievement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title28"></a><a name="creitem28"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joe Borg, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Madam President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report. Since the adoption of the Council Regulation on fisheries outside community waters in 1994, many conditions have changed and international obligations have increased for the authorisation of Community vessels outside Community waters.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal has, therefore, been put forward as part of the 2006-2008 Action Plan for simplifying and improving the common fisheries policy. The aims of the proposal reflect that spirit by integrating existing legislation into one regulation, while ensuring that the rules applying to Community vessels in third-country waters are applied equally to third-country vessels in Community waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Many provisions are unchanged regarding the current system of issuing fishing authorisations. The major new points of the proposal can be summarised as follows. Firstly, all fisheries agreements under which Community vessels fish are included in the scope of the proposal, those being fisheries partnership agreements, bilateral fisheries agreements, agreements in the context of regional fisheries management organisations and private agreements. This wide scope is essential, as all flag states under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea are responsible for the vessels flying their flags. Consequently, vessels fishing under all kinds of agreements should be included.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a mechanism to reallocate under-utilised fishing opportunities has been introduced in order to optimise the utilisation of fishing opportunities under the fisheries agreements. This point was raised during the discussions on most fisheries partnership agreements and is now integrated into each of them in order to increase the value for money under each agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As a last point, I would like to mention the proposed provisional application of fisheries agreements, which will grant the Commission the necessary legal basis to transmit licence applications to third countries prior to the adoption of the Council Regulation concluding the agreement. This will, in most cases, ensure that Community vessels can continue their fishing activities in third-country waters without interruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the report, I would like to comment on the amendments proposed. The Commission can agree to Amendments 1, 3, 5, 11 and 16. As for Amendments 7 to 9 concerning the eligibility criteria, this list has been transformed into a positive list, rather than a negative one, in the first Presidency compromise text. In general terms, the compromise text, however, covers the Committee’s concerns, except for the extension of the eligibility criteria regarding infringements in the past 12 months, which is Amendment 8. The Commission finds that this provision should remain unchanged, believing it important as a precautionary measure in case of possible serious infringements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment 2 on the definition of infringements, as the definition of serious infringements is clear and is set out in Regulation No 1447/99. Regarding the amendment concerning non-transmission of all applications, which is Amendment 12, it should be noted that Article 10 has been deleted as part of the Presidency compromise text. This was done on the basis of the opinion of the Council’s legal service, which stated that the Commission has no legal basis to penalise the vessels of Member States as proposed in this article.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also finds that the Member States’ possibility of giving their opinion on any decision is already provided for in Article 9(2) and that any informal procedure prior to or after a negotiation should not be contained in this regulation. Therefore, Amendments 6 and 10 cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Before closing, I would like to stress the following. Firstly, the daily transmission of catch data is required under the Regulation on electronic logbooks. Secondly, closing a fishery implicitly means that fishing authorisations are no longer valid for the stocks or areas concerned. Thirdly, all fishing activities in mixed fisheries must be considered as affecting the stocks concerned. Fourthly, national legislation determines what can be used as evidence in a court of law. This is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments 13, 14, 15 and 17. Amendment 4 and Amendments 18 and 19 cannot be accepted, since the text proposed by the Commission is correct – in the case of Amendment 4 – or is sufficiently clear – in the case of Amendments 18 and 19.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, I cannot accept Amendments 20 to 24, since the scope of the proposal is to cover all agreements and not just third-country agreements, as I said at the outset. In addition, the reallocation of unused fishing opportunities is necessary in order to ensure the best possible utilisation of the fishing possibilities under the agreement. Such reallocation is best dealt with in the context of the issuing and renewal of licences.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress that this proposal is part of a package containing the proposal on combating IIU fishing, as well as the revision of the Control Regulation to follow later this year. As referred to by the Committee on Fisheries, the Commission will, while keeping transparency and simplification in mind, aim to harmonise these proposals and avoid any overlap between them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, thank you for that very detailed exposé. I would simply like to recall here that the declared objective of the Council’s proposal for a regulation is to simplify and improve the procedures for managing fishing authorisations. It was a question of introducing general provisions applicable to all authorisation applications, as you yourself said, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">A single procedure for managing all fishing authorisations has been proposed. The sharing of responsibilities between the Commission and the Member States is defined. New eligibility criteria, penalties in the event of infringements and provisions regarding reporting are also proposed. Compliance with the international regulations laid down by the different agreements is strengthened by the introduction of measures requiring Member States to exclude vessels from fishing if they are found to be involved in a serious infringement or if they have been placed on a list for taking part in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Stihler had been designated for this report but because the majority of members of the Committee on Fisheries did not agree with her on two points she considered key, she preferred to remove her name from the report. It therefore falls to me to present this draft as Committee chairman. However, I would like, in passing, to thank her for her work and I will leave it to her, when she presents her amendments, to give us the reasons for her decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the consultation procedure, in her report which is now mine, the Committee on Fisheries has proposed a number of amendments to the Council’s proposal for a regulation, and you gave an exhaustive list of these – not a list but the numbers, Commissioner. These were adopted by a large majority of 19 votes for, 5 against and 2 abstentions. I will only present the main ones here.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the regulation should not apply to overseas territories of EU Member States. Secondly, an infringement should not be considered to be serious unless it has been confirmed by a successful prosecution in accordance with the relevant national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the IUU list should be understood to mean the list of fishing vessels identified in the framework of a RFMO or by the Commission under the Council Regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing - that very important task, Commissioner, which you are personally rather keen on.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the Commission shall not refuse to transmit applications to the authorising authority without having given the Member States the opportunity to submit their observations.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the Commission may not refuse to pass on applications unless it comes to the Commission’s knowledge, on the basis of duly substantiated facts, that a Member State has not complied with its obligations under a particular agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly and finally, Community fishing vessels for which a fishing authorisation has been issued shall transmit to their competent national authority the data concerning their catches and fishing effort with a frequency appropriate to the agreement and fishery concerned. The transmission requirements shall be compatible with those contained in the <br />e-logbook regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will leave it to my colleagues to talk more about some of these amendments, because some of them are the authors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is therefore going to vote against the amendments already rejected by the Committee on Fisheries that have been tabled again with 40 signatures, which go precisely in the opposite direction, in that they insist that agreements on exchanges of quotas should remain outside the general legislation on licences to fish.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, given that the Court of Auditors’ report on the shortcomings of the control policy is still making the headlines and it has been decided to tackle once and for all the fight against illegal fishing, it is not very acceptable to claim that some agreements should continue to be outside a general framework that is very necessary as a basic legal guarantee of equal and non-discriminatory treatment, both among operators and among Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be pointed out that we are immersed in working on an integrated and coordinated focus for the different Community policies, in particular maritime policy, a focus that Parliament has fully supported, as well as the even more necessary process of simplifying Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, it should not be forgotten that we are talking about more than 9 000 vessels that operate under the different agreements and regional fisheries organisations, which means processing more than 16 000 fishing authorisations, as no agreement, in either the North or the South, is exempt from this obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is time for anything, then, it is time to harmonise and simplify a framework to make it as standardised as possible and not to continue creating differences that only make monitoring difficult and generate mistrust of the rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the original rapporteur, I was compelled to remove my name from the report when the Committee on Fisheries rejected my key amendments. The report was supposed to simplify fishing authorisations. Instead, the Commission over-reached itself with an unnecessary article awarding itself the right to reallocate fishing quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">If supported unamended, this report will unjustly discriminate against northern countries and their historic fishing rights and jeopardise relative stability. To give the Commission carte blanche to reallocate fishing opportunities beggars belief, especially when fishing opportunities are scarcer. We have to ask ourselves whether we are facing a fishing free-for-all in the North Sea. This is not in the interests of Scottish fishermen, nor is it in the interests of protecting and conserving stocks. The next review of the common fisheries policy is due by 2012 and this report is a wake-up call that historic fishing rights are under threat in the North and Baltic Seas. I have retabled key amendments for the plenary and urge colleagues to support them. If these amendments are defeated, I urge voting against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is always a great cause for frustration, after a rapporteur has put a great deal of hard work into the preparation of a complex bit of work like this. But I can well understand her reasons for doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">While few in this Parliament would argue with any proposal that seeks to enhance fisheries compliance, it is of major concern to me that Article 13 of the report, which deals with under-utilisation of fisheries opportunities, will simply provide the Commission with the right to reallocate fishing opportunities from one Member State to another. This would clearly undermine the entire concept of relative stability and as such would destabilise one of the core principles of the common fisheries policy. In fact, Article 13 is something of a Trojan horse, as it seems to have more to do with gaining access to fishing opportunities previously allocated to other Member States than with reducing bureaucracy and red tape and improving compliance, which I thought the report was all about.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that in the Fisheries Council the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark have all expressed similar concerns, so, as Ms Stihler said, this is a resurrection of the old North-South divide, which I thought had disappeared long ago, and that is something that we do not want to see coming back. I very much hope – contrary to what Commissioner Borg told us in his earlier remarks – that tomorrow Parliament will vote in favour of Amendments 20, 21, 22 and 23, tabled by Ms Stihler and signed by 40 MEPs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Stevenson, I am sure that we are going to vote against the amendments that you have just mentioned, and I do not have any doubt that this North-South situation is completely new to you. So far you have only experienced the situation in the North and we have experienced the situation in the South. We would now like to experience something of the situation in the North, because it seems to us that it works well for you in the North, and therefore those of us in the South would like to share some of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would firstly like to congratulate the Commission for agreeing to simplify the text of the proposal as it is true that the first version had some elements that were difficult to accept. The review of the control Regulation, the Agreement with Greenland and something that the Commissioner mentioned, the proposal for a Regulation on IUU fishing, all enable the scope of this proposal to be limited.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that tomorrow my group will, as it did in committee, vote against those amendments that aim to avoid the adoption of a general mechanism for using surplus fishing opportunities, something that we have always advocated, just as we have always been in favour of the need to have a uniform system for using surplus fishing opportunities that applies to all agreements, not just to southern agreements, which was the Council’s commitment when it ratified the Partnership Agreement with Greenland. Consequently, I think that I can say that my group will vote against those amendments that are an attempt to make this system apply only to southern agreements and not to northern agreements. Therefore I think that we are going to apply it to all of them, so all of us will feel more comfortable.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Article 12, we agree with there being an interim procedure for allocating licences before the Council adopts the decision ratifying the agreement, for and we think that a legal solution needs to be found this issue. We therefore agree with the Commission on the need to have a mechanism that ensures that fishing opportunities are not put at risk, as stated in Article 12, if the process of ratifying a fisheries agreement has not been completed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Community fishing fleet is active in the territorial waters of around 20 countries under the scope of bilateral agreements. But as we seek to manage our fisheries sustainably by limiting fishing in the European Community waters, we should be careful not to export the problem of over-fishing by handing out authorisations for vessels to freely exploit waters of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As I pointed out to Commissioner Borg only last month, we must pay particular attention to our international moral obligations to Africa. Unsustainable exploitation of marine resources in Africa’s oceans on a massive scale is causing the collapse of fisheries, the loss of critical ecosystems and the extinction of marine wild life. A large part of the problem is unreported illegal and unregulated fishing by the EU and other fishing companies. In 2005 alone an estimated 40% of fish were caught without licence or in violation of regulations in the waters of Guinea-Bissau. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it does apply to the outermost regions, which are considered Community waters.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who have supported this proposal as it stands, with its wide scope in order to make all agreements more effective and to ensure more value for money, in line with the overall objectives set by the Committee on Fisheries itself and others, like the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">On the amendments, let me again say that some of the amendments are accepted, as I indicated. Others have been overtaken by virtue of the first Presidency compromise text or because the proposed amendments are already provided for elsewhere in the regulation or in some other legal provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to repeat that all fisheries agreements under which Community vessels fish are to be included in the scope of the proposal. This is essential, because the states party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as I said before, are responsible for the vessels flying their flags.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the reallocation of under-utilised fishing opportunities is there to optimise utilisation of fishing opportunities under the fisheries agreements. This is, after all, only proper management of fisheries agreements and it will not undermine relative stability, given that Article 13(6) of the proposal states the following: ‘Transmission of applications in accordance with this article shall not in any way affect the future allocation of fishing opportunities amongst Member States.’ So it will be a reallocation to maximise the fishing opportunities granted or available under fishing agreements and not a means whereby a precedent would be set which would undermine relative stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to say that this provision is becoming a regular feature of fisheries partnership agreements with third countries and it has also been included, with the agreement of the Council, in the Greenland agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You will have realised, Commissioner, that there are two concerns on this matter. You replied in part to the first concern expressed, which is the maintenance of relative stability. That is the purpose of amendments 20 to 24 tabled by our colleagues. The second concern is the one expressed by Mrs Stihler, namely that with this revision of the regulation, there could be unreasonable exploitation of fish stocks, in particular the fish stocks of third countries. Some of my fellow Members here have echoed this and that is why they signed.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I can say, regarding this, that there is nothing in the text of the report that will be voted on tomorrow that could give rise to this concern, but it is up to our fellow Members tomorrow to decide because I think, Madam President, that you are going to announce that this report will be put to the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In some public debate, rights-based management is equated with the employment of individual transferable quotas. The report takes a much broader view, treating the term as covering any of the forms that can be taken by the right to harvest fish, given that these are seen as a common public good. So understood, it is clear that there is a variety of such forms currently in operation throughout the EU. For example, the extent of the right may be specified by reference to the territory to be fished, the amount of fish to be harvested, the effort allowed or some mixture of these. Similarly, although the right is implicitly transferable, there are various limitations in this respect. For example, that from Community to Member States is conditioned by the principle of relative stability. Further, there seems to be a considerable range of such limitations. One particular form of divergence between Member States is how far transfer for economic value is permitted, either formally or informally, and thus amounts to a tradable right.</p>
<p class="contents">The central issue is, then, how fisheries management should engage in constituting the right to harvest in order best to obtain the objectives of the common fisheries policy. The Commission communication raises the question of the extent to which a single system might be introduced, either at Community level or by harmonising the practice of Member States. The report of the Fisheries Committee details a number of concerns about the adverse impacts that certain types of rights-based management might have, but also touches on the manner in which some of these might be prevented. It indicates too the way in which certain types of rights-based management can have positive effects, provided they are properly devised.</p>
<p class="contents">The report notes the variety of systems of rights-based management currently in place, the degree to which the forms of right concerned are hybrid ones and the complexity of the issues involved. It is consequently rightly cautious about the idea of moving to any single system. Over and above the need to protect artisanal fleets, we raise the question of whether, on a more general basis, the same system would be appropriate for both single species and multi-species fisheries. We finish by asking the Commission to address a number of different questions in its study and, in view of all that needs to be taken into consideration, to allow a longer time for debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to touch more deeply on one aspect of the report. Although rights-based management is essentially a juristic concept, I have the impression that much of the drive towards its discussion has come from economists.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that anyone here would doubt that fisheries management must take account of sound economic principles. Indeed the report indicates some of the positive outcomes to which economic efficiency may give rise.</p>
<p class="contents">But such efficiency has to be seen as an instrumental good. As the report states, it is valuable insofar as it promotes the objectives of the CFP. I have personal doubts that economic efficiency is sufficient, in itself, to promote all these objectives to the desired extent and suspect that there are ways in which it may prove counterproductive to some aspects of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I seek reassurance, therefore, that the Commission will take a genuinely rounded approach, both in relation to the content and to the outcome of the study. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report recognises the main advantage of rights-based management systems as being increased economic rationale in fisheries. This is a crucial issue in the present context, where poor economic performance is the rule rather than the exception. The quest for a higher degree of economic efficiency generally has very positive effects on overcapacity and hence on sustainability of fisheries activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, however, also accurately identifies the possible negative effects. In my opinion, such effects could be contained, if not eliminated, by introducing provisions intended to limit concentration of rights, to deal with allocation issues and, as proposed by the report, to protect artisanal fleets. These are being dealt with by various means in third countries where rights-based management systems in general, and individual transferable quotas in particular, have been in place for quite some time. As stated in the report, such systems are a complex matter, but difficulties associated with them are not insurmountable.</p>
<p class="contents">On balance, I think the possible benefits are larger than the possible negative effects. However, I would like to confirm once more that the Commission has no intention of proposing Community management systems. Nor is it the Commission’s intention to promote a given and universal rights-based management system. Different fisheries will require different systems. I am also fully aware of the sensitivity of this issue in relation to relative stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue working on this issue. In the short term, we are aiming at increasing the general knowledge on rights-based management and identifying best practices to be shared with Member States’ national or regional governments with fisheries competences. We will also consider issuing guidelines or similar supporting documents to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the consultation process – including, of course, the report of the European Parliament – and the outcome of the ongoing study on rights-based management systems in the Member States and experiences in third countries will be important inputs for this process.</p>
<p class="contents">In the medium term, rights-based management is going to be one of the topics in our reflection towards the next reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will keep you informed about these future developments and I look forward to further fruitful discussions with you on this important issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We can therefore only express our satisfaction at the Commission’s decision to finally examine the possibilities of this fisheries management tool, although in my opinion, in a too simplistic and superficial way, undoubtedly due to a fear of unleashing the fury of the Council regarding these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who are the most resistant to change and the least enterprising, both in the fisheries sector and in the Council, have always feared any change to management systems, even for the better. This does not mean that these sectors and Member States are in a better situation, or even in the same situation as they were 30 years ago, but rather they are dragging the more dynamic sectors towards a dead end.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that management through the allocation of fishing rights raises questions with regard to implementation, but it is just as true that countries in which fishing is an important sector for the future have been able to resolve them, demonstrating that, at least for parts of the fleet that are able to evolve towards more modern, efficient and sustainable approaches, it has advantages that are far from negligible.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore also welcome Mrs Attwooll’s report, which, alongside the concerns, has succeeded in reflecting the possible advantages, which could include improvements in control, a reduction in capacity, a decrease in discards and lower dependency on public aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mrs Attwooll that fishing is indeed an economic activity, and one that needs to be profitable, which is now ceasing to be the case, therefore perhaps we need more economists in fisheries than there are at present, to analyse these issues in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I wish the Commission great success in this debate and I hope that the management model, which has been a failure, can be changed in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a complex and controversial issue but it is extremely important for all who are concerned about the sustainability of resources, and this includes the sustainability of the most precious resource for all who make up Europe’s innumerable fishing communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the report strikes exactly the right balance between the different points of view. The results of the vote in the Committee on Fisheries – 21 in favour out of 24 – bears out what I have just said. It is important not to avoid this debate but equally important not to decide too hastily. As a Member elected for a Member State where the small-scale and multi-species fisheries which predominate in the south of Europe are very important, I am concerned about the introduction of management systems involving trade in fishing rights, which might bring benefits for shipowners with greater purchasing power to the detriment of smaller shipowners.</p>
<p class="contents">I also fear that the general adoption of such a system might be counter-productive, possibly even leading to higher catches to offset the cost of acquiring the fishing right. I therefore repeat that I support the overall conclusions of the report, to the effect that no decisions should be adopted until we have studies covering all Member States and the different types of fisheries plus a wide-ranging debate to assess all the variables involved in this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, although we appreciate paragraph 11, the report contains many points on which we totally disagree, for example, viewing this debate as an anticipation of the necessary modification of the existing management policy or including points that more or less explicitly argue for adopting fishing right management mechanisms at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, each Member State should be responsible for managing its marine resources, in particular as a way of safeguarding its food sovereignty. We therefore reject any step-by-step process that could, in future, lead to the setting up of a rights-based management system in Community fisheries, that is the marketing of fishing licences, days at sea or quotas, which would inevitably lead to the appropriation and concentration in private hands of a public good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Moreover, maintaining stability, I fear, could be severely jeopardised in the industry if unregulated transferable quotas were embraced, with particular threat to single and small-scale operators.

I therefore do not share the vision of marine ecosystems and the associated fishing communities as a market, where fishing rights may be freely traded, perhaps even on a kind of stock market, which would naturally lead to the industrialisation of fishing and pose a threat to the equilibrium of the ecosystems and fishing communities.

<p class="contents">I strongly agree with the report when it points out that the current fisheries management systems within the EU, specifically in the area of TACs and quotas, do not provide an answer to our problems, and that it is necessary to hold a wide-ranging debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In its green paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy, the Commission states that: ‘Alternative management mechanisms can play a significant complementary role in Community fisheries management.’ However, I would venture to suggest that alternative management measures should and must play a compulsory role in the future, as we need to take on board a range of factors, including climate change and up-to-date marine and fisheries research based on sound science.</p>
<p class="contents">As I pointed out in my now redundant opinion of the Committee on Fisheries for the report by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, I have no doubt that climate change will impact on EU fisheries regulations, as allocations of quotas based on historic catch patterns will need to be revised as a result of the shifting distribution of fish stocks.

<p class="contents">I agree with what the rapporteur said, namely that fisheries cannot be looked at purely in economic terms. I need to stress here that the subject is far from simple. I certainly agree that such systems are a complex matter. As I said before, we have to take into account in our reflections possible limitations on the concentration of rights, the resolution of allocation issues and measures for the protection of artisanal fisheries, and we have to approach this matter gradually.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, we need to learn more, we need to identify best practices and we need to study where rights-based managements systems have operated successfully in certain Member States and look at experiences in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">All this will clearly be an important issue for discussion in the context of the next reform. I certainly look forward to the input from the Committee on Fisheries on this issue. I have noted all the comments made by all the parliamentarians who have spoken on this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think we are all agreed that the common fisheries policy is in need of reform. A newspaper in my constituency that picked up the European Parliament press release on the report cites me as being cautious about the reform of the CFP. This is certainly not so if it is taken to mean that I have any doubts about the need for reform. I am cautious, as I think we all are, to the extent of wanting to be reassured that the reform is in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of writing the report, for example, it occurred to me to ask just how compatible with one another the different ways of defining the extent of the right to fish are. My feeling was that, whilst quota and effort limitations both combine readily with territorial restrictions, neither of the first two sits that comfortably with the other. This in turn made me realise that, technical though a report on rights-based management might, on the face of it, seem, the issue it raises goes to the very heart of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst generally applauding the direction of current reform, I hope that the discussion may trigger a more radical reappraisal of the tools we use, so as to achieve the best possible balance between improving the livelihood of those engaged in fisheries, having a sustainable marine ecology in which fish stocks are conserved and maintaining the viability of fisheries-dependent communities. I would not like to think that, in advance of a thorough study, some prior decision had been taken as to what might achieve the very best balance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first departure is that we are testing a new cooperation formula between Parliament’s administration and the Committee on Budgets; we are treating this as a pilot project, but this should comply with the generally binding principles for the budget procedure following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. Secondly, 2009 brings new challenges, which no-one is questioning. One such challenge is certainly the likely entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and with it a fundamental enhancement of powers of the European Parliament’s codecision, the paving of the way for Parliament’s activities as a genuine legislative body. Secondly, this is an election year, so there will be costs linked to the election campaign and certain costs – besides the obvious savings – linked to the end of the current parliamentary term. Thirdly, the Statute for Members will come into effect, which will increase the personal cost burden, the burden of our costs in the European Parliament budget.</p>
<p class="contents">In many of these matters we already have certain quantifications, certain calculations since, in parallel with the principles, we are getting to know the forecasts, the first budget preliminaries for 2009. In the most important area, however – in other words, in the area associated with the increase in the powers of the European Parliament following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon – we have got as far as a working group, which will establish the extra costs that may be associated with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Recognising the specific challenges that await us in 2009, we cannot at the same time exempt ourselves from the duty of frugal management of European taxpayers’ money, i.e. from certain self-imposed restrictions which we shall also expect from other European institutions. Proliferation of the administration in an election year is certainly not the message that the European electorate wants to hear – the electorate to whom we are turning for a renewal of the European Parliament’s mandate. A further essential aspect of the guidelines is internal obligations, to look for opportunities for what is referred to as the redeployment of existing human resources, not to increase staff numbers, and to concentrate on those functions that will mark out the future of the European Parliament, which we define using the term ‘correctivity’, and which are associated with legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we must also discuss, and we should discuss, an issue that has a certain media resonance and that clearly also has extra-budgetary dimensions. What we need are three new regulations in parallel. The first is the introduction of a Statute for Members, with a distinct budgetary dimension; the second is new pension fund principles; and the third is employment rules for assistants, which must be transparent enough not to arouse temptations, and not to arouse suspicions surrounding the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur I propose that this material be referred specifically to our Parliament’s resolution of 25 October 2007 and to the unanimous decisions of the Praesidium and the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament. I know that at present our curiosity is being stirred more by the calculations than by the guidelines, and so I am counting on this document being smoothly voted through tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, beyond the amounts and programmes, this year’s budgetary orientations bring to discussion an issue I consider very important: the legal situation of the European Parliament assistants. I would like to thank Mr Lewandowski for having approached this subject as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the time has come for the old system to become clearer and more transparent and to provide these young people with social and fiscal rights equal to the rights of the other members of the institution’s staff. For the latter, there are the Staff Regulations of the European Communities, a very comprehensive document, which provides the staff working in the European Union institutions with adequate social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the parliamentary assistants are also foreign citizens in relation to the country where they carry out their activity and, consequently, they should enjoy the protection provided to all workers in international organizations. I don’t think it is normal to have cases in which the Belgian state imposes additional tax liabilities on assistants, taking into account that they pay all due taxes and contributions to social insurances in their country of nationality.</p>
<p class="contents">Still, the Parliament needs clear regulations for assistants as regards situations such as disease or maternity as well. In several resolutions, the European Parliament has already requested the Secretary General and the working group on the Members’ Statute and Assistants and Pension Fund to draw up a new set of rules that would solve the problems the assistants are currently dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is our responsibility toward the European citizens to have only clear and transparent rules in this institution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty of Lisbon achieves what our predecessors were already calling for more than 50 years ago without obtaining it: not just advisory powers, not just assent procedures, but codecision and democratic control by this Parliament over nearly all of Brussels’s policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclination to call for more staff is therefore great. Codecision means a more difficult procedure in each committee, but it does not mean double the workload. This budget therefore remains cautious, and that is good. Where additional staff are needed, redeployment is attempted. Few new staff will be employed – indeed, that would be hard to justify with almost 6 000 employees.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of this Parliament must indeed be made more visible. Web-TV is to be launched after the summer and, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I hope that the editorial team enjoys a position of independence, with full freedom to show the debates held here. We owe our voters that openness. What we also owe our voters is full verifiability of our expenditure, and good management of human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Assistants must have a proper contract, with the social security and pension provision usual in each European institution. At least 1 in 10 members of staff are working here without any social protection. This has to change. A statute for employees must be brought in, preferably by the end of this year, and it is incredible that there are attempts to oppose this, to oppose the social spirit, the spirit of solidarity, of the European Union, from the ranks of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">Further work will have to be done on long-term strategies, regarding for example the purchase of buildings and technological innovation. The Statute for Members also has an impact on the budget. Subsidies to the Sakharov Foundation in Moscow must be no more than one-off cases, nor is it the primary role of this House to finance museums of European history; such expenditure must be borne by the European budget. Further debate is needed on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As several in this House have remarked, 2009 is a special year. Even though the Lisbon Treaty has not yet been ratified in all countries, we have to take account, in our budgeting, of its entry into force in 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s new powers – giving it, for example, influence over the agricultural budget and over legal policy – will mean adjusting some of its priorities to cope with the new responsibilities. Then there are the elections to the European Parliament and the Statute for Members, which also have an impact on the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is content with Parliament’s draft budget remaining within 20% of EU administrative expenditure. There is no guarantee that this will be feasible in the next few years, but it is important that we hold administrative expenditure in check.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to express the ALDE Group’s great satisfaction with the emergence of a new model for the remuneration of Members’ assistants. Our group has wanted to see a statute for Members’ assistants for a long time. It is the right solution for Parliament to take over the administration, and this is reflected in the 2009 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Considerable savings have been achieved from the sale of buildings over the last 10 years, but I agree that we have now reached a point at which this policy must be revised, and that the buildings policy in general should undergo a service. We have yet to see a proposal for the other institutions, but there is cause to keep a watchful eye on the growing buildings expenditure of those, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of the financing of the future EU Minister of Foreign Affairs and the President of the European Council remains important, but we shall come back to that later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will require all the talent of our rapporteur, the former chairman of the Committee on Budgets, to meet this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">A new Treaty that is going to double the scope of Parliament’s codecision. Imagine the effort that will be needed for this, particularly in budgetary terms. A new Statute for Members. Totally unknown at present: which countries are going to allow their future elected representatives to fall into this new system, and which elected representatives are going to want to do so? An election campaign, a new code of practice, particularly for assistants.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been asking the Bureau for this for nearly ten years and I am delighted to see that this dossier is finally ready. It is quite simple though, since we are all aware of the package that will not cost taxpayers a penny: putting assistants on a Community footing, for those working in Brussels, and those who pay them directly under Parliament’s control, for those working in the constituencies. There should be a constant budget for this because honesty does not cost a penny, just a little political effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also passionately in favour of new working methods, particularly on buildings issues, because like many of my fellow Members, I am always surprised after a call for tenders at how astonishingly high construction costs are when it comes to building work by the European institutions. If we really want to make savings, perhaps it is not necessary to translate everything I have just said into Maltese, Latvian and Hungarian, because in eight months’ time it will not be read by anybody and that would save EUR 17 million per year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Social Democrats and Greens have quite unnecessarily proposed amendments which would mean a less controlled way of spending money.</p>
<p class="contents">The view taken in the report on the ‘House of European History’ is along the right lines when the rapporteur states that it is not for Parliament to finance such a project, even though it is the idea of the current President.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also adopts a position on the Commission’s budget. The comment is made that its administrative expenditure does not extend to some 2 000 employees, who are outsourced for employment in its agencies. This expenditure is excluded from the total sum, from which 20% is deducted for Parliament’s use. Parliament cannot outsource its operations in the same way, and it also has to finance support for the pan-European political parties out of its own budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular, there is the European Parliament’s new role of sharing law-making equally with the Council of the European Union. Although the transition from the consultation procedure to the codecision procedure will not necessarily mean doubling the workload of the parliamentary committees, we have to remember that the increase in codecision powers will be unprecedented, and that Parliament will assume responsibilities for producing legislative acts. The European Parliament’s political priorities must therefore be properly funded. Of course we have to try to save money wherever possible but only under the condition that the budget continues to be adequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Improving communication to European citizens was one of Parliament’s priorities for 2009. For them to feel more involved in the forthcoming elections and to get the highest possible turnout, it is important for MEPs to be closely associated with a decentralised information campaign in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We also hope that local media will be fully integrated into this campaign because they play a key role in passing on information. Parliament’s communication budget and the actions planned for 2009 should therefore make sure that they interest and directly affect European citizens, who often feel that the European institutions are too detached.</p>
<p class="contents">Note that generally speaking these actions follow on from those begun and funded in 2008. We also hope that the new visitor centre and the web TV will soon be operational to provide better information on Parliament’s activities and to improve the relationship between citizens and the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would, however, like to endorse the approach taken by the rapporteur, namely that the European Parliament’s level of expenditure should be based on requirements that are justified following careful evaluation. Certainly, 2009 will bring significant changes to the European Parliament’s work. With the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the volume of legislative work will increase considerably, and the change in the system of remuneration for MEPs will give rise to additional costs, as will the publicity campaign in connection with the European Parliament elections.</p>
<p class="contents">By focusing on the main spheres of activity, however, and carefully analysing the budget requests, as well as evaluating the possibilities for re-allocating officials internally before creating new permanent posts, it is possible to keep the level of expenditure in the European Parliament’s budget within the 20% limit. All opportunities to reduce inappropriate paper and energy consumption at the European Parliament have not yet been exhausted. I am pleased with the support given last year to the proposal to reduce the circulation of paper versions of individual documents, stipulating that paper versions of these documents be accessible on request, instead of automatically being distributed to all Members and officials. Implementation of this proposal is making it possible to save over three million sheets of paper a year. This principle can be applied to many more types of document. Regarding the European Parliament’s budget for next year, the issue of expenditure on Members’ assistants cannot be overlooked, and I therefore call upon the working group set up by the European Parliament’s Bureau to come forward with proposals to make the payment of these costs more transparent and more easy to monitor. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the level of inflation in individual EU countries is rising sharply, and as a result the average level of inflation across the EU will be around 4% in 2008, so indexing expenditure at 2% annually actually means a fall in expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, one consequence of adopting the Treaty of Lisbon will be a marked increase in the powers of the European Parliament, the codecision procedure in all areas, and also the powers of the Member States’ parliaments, which will cause a sharp increase in the European Parliament’s functioning costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly and finally, 2009 is a year of European Parliament elections. So far the turnout for these elections has been exceptionally low, particularly in the new Member States. Additional expenditure is therefore needed for an information campaign aimed chiefly at regional and local media, through which the electorate can be most effectively reached. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have tabled another amendment; ours has the same wording as the decisions of the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, which all group chairs voted unanimously to support. I do not actually think it fair what is now being said about the Committee on Budgets living up to its reputation of doing its own thing again.

<p class="contents">I requested permission to speak here. I am speaking for the Commissioner’s sole benefit, as I think it is important to tell the Commission that we consider the amendments we have tabled, on which we shall also be voting tomorrow with a very large majority, to be important. I wish to tell him that we are only at the consultation stage with this dossier, and I should like to assure him on behalf of the whole Parliament that our amendments will help to bring greater order into the agency system. It is therefore very important to us all across the group divide that the Commission take them on board. I am obliged to the Commissioner for his assurances in this regard, and I shall also be monitoring the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to me that he also understand why we want this. We need better accountability in the agencies and greater transparency, particularly among staff members. This concerns our budgetary law most directly. The Commissioner will also be aware, of course, that if our wishes are not taken on board we shall find our own ways to fulfil them. We regard this essential to our budgetary law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission had originally intended the present reform of the Financial Regulation to consist of merely technical modifications. We talk of better regulation, yet I have noted with great sorrow that the latest joint decision on agencies by the Council and Parliament in July has not been incorporated. The Commission’s draft came somewhat earlier, but it would have been nice, of course, if it had been subsequently reworked. I should have also thought this fairer than leaving the work to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has introduced political changes with great unanimity right across the group divide. We want to bring internal operations, responsibilities, transfers of appropriations and accountability of agencies more into line with the operations and practice of the Commission Directorate-General by means of a declaration of assurance. We also want a better overview of the personnel and financial costs of the agencies. We want to be informed of all employees and not just those on the establishment plan. This is an absolute necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to give an example from a recent report by a decentralised agency on financial management in 2007. Thirty-nine posts are listed on this establishment plan, whereas 43 temporary staff and 11 contract staff appear in the text two pages before this. No two figures match, therefore. It is left to the reader’s imagination as to whether we now have 39 plus 11 posts or 43 plus 11 plus 39, or whether the 39 posts of 43 staff are listed and the 11 are then added. We just do not know. I shall clarify the issue, but clarifying this issue for the large number of agencies is no fun, of course, and reporting and the reporting system are more or less equally chaotic in all the agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The agency I have just quoted, ENISA, is interchangeable with any other, and I should indeed like to ask why the information we are given is so full of inconsistencies. We also want more information on the agencies’ revenue – which, thinking of Alicante, can indeed be sizeable – and we want to know what is happening to this revenue. I thank the Commissioner in advance for taking on board these amendments – as he has just announced his intention to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, we have 29 decentralised agencies with 3 914 employees on the establishment plan for 2007, with a budget of EUR 1.1 billion, EUR 559 million of which comes from the EU. The five executive agencies have 176 posts. The latest Commission communication on agencies was a very interesting one. The offer of a joint working group is very important. All three institutions must undertake to think through with each other the issue of the agencies’ future and area of work.</p>
<p class="contents">In Germany, the issue of agencies and the growth of agencies is in the public eye. The media resonance is always great. The reputation of the European Union is also at stake if we do not succeed in conveying to the outside world why we actually need these agencies and what role they play in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also be pleased if the Commission could prove why programme management is more efficient and better value when done by the executive agencies than by the Directorates-General. This is a request that those of us concerned with the budget have already put forward on a number of occasions, but has still not been backed up thus far in writing by the relevant facts and figures.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s amendments serve to maintain an overview of the European agencies, and our urgent request to the Commission is to help us to bring more order into the agency landscape. As the Commissioner should know, we in Parliament trust the Commission on this issue. We know that this institution is our last resort, as it were, when it comes to creating order and transparency and providing a better overview in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank my fellow Members from the other groups, and particularly Mrs Haug, the rapporteur on agencies from the Committee on Budgets, and the two rapporteurs Mr Mulder and Mrs Herczog from the Committee on Budgetary Control for their suggestions, all of which we have taken on board. I therefore believe that we have put forward the proposed and desired amendments by Parliament that are most pressing at the present time. I beg the Commissioner also to incorporate these amendments in the corresponding draft. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At a time when the European Parliament is set to see its prerogatives strongly reinforced within the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon, I think it is particularly important to remember what our institution’s competences are, obviously as co-decider of the budget. This Parliament, elected by direct universal suffrage by the citizens of the EU, must be able to do more and better to control the proper use of Community funds spent, this time by the executive agencies. I would like very briefly to highlight four points in this report, which seem essential to me if Parliament is to be able to play its role fully and make it as easy as possible for citizens to understand our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would also like to emphasise the need for better control over the use of assigned revenue. It seems important for the director of the agency to tell us about any transfers between titles exceeding the 10% threshold.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly I should also highlight the importance of the figures for the establishment plan, as our fellow Member has just mentioned, whether for temporary staff, contract workers, seconded national experts, etc., so that we as the budgetary authority have a clear picture of the development of the human resources budgets of the agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I think it is quite natural that we should be asking for a summary of the development of the agencies’ budgets to be sent to the European Parliament each year, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Court of Auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, the provisions in the report concerning the harmonisation of the deadlines for the discharge procedure should also give Parliament real control of the proper execution of the budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to highlight the very important provisions on the internal auditing of our agencies and suggest, following on from the comment by my fellow Member a moment ago, that we could work towards a consolidation, a sort of sub-consolidation in the EU’s accounts for all agencies, so that third parties and particularly MEPs, have a picture of the development of the accounting mass represented by all the agencies of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, there should be support for the rapporteur’s proposal that directors of agencies be obliged to notify the European Parliament if they have transferred funds from operational to administrative in an amount that exceeds 10% of the ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in view of the fact that executive agencies’ functioning costs are covered by the budgets for individual programmes, the almost ten percent level of these costs has an impact. The failure to specify these costs in the case of the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency in particular has an impact when linked to the information that there is a shortfall of more than EUR 40bn for the projects that this agency deals with.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate Mrs Gräßle on two very good reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This amendment, in line with Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure, was the joint work of the associated committee and the Committee on Budgets. I especially thank my fellow Members and Mrs Grässle and Mr Mulder for their close and excellent cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We proposed several amendments aimed at enabling these agencies to operate fluidly, enhancing accountability and expanding opportunities for closer democratic monitoring of the funds assigned to these bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to note that:</p>
<p class="contents">- as regards the discharge procedure for these agencies, standardisation of deadlines is urgently needed in future;</p>
<p class="contents">- the Court of Auditors has also pointed out that individuals involved in auditing and control work should not take part in budget implementation measures;</p>
<p class="contents">- taking due account of the protection of personal data, a list with the names of persons who have cooperated with the agency and the remuneration received by these experts should be attached to the relevant agency’s report on budgetary and financial management;</p>
<p class="contents">- monitoring of the use of external experts by the agencies must be enabled.</p>
