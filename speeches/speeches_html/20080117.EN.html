<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ilda Figueiredo, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. − <span class="italic">(PT)</span> I must start by thanking the members and staff of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their support and valuable contributions, particularly through their proposals on this report which enabled its unanimous approval. This work took several months and included a public hearing with valuable contributions being made by members of both parliamentary committees and external guests, particularly social organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">This report seeks to highlight the role of women in industry. On average, over 14% of women in employment in the European Union work in industry. In some countries this percentage exceeds 25%, such as in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, and in others it is around 20%, such as in Portugal, Greece and Hungary.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that in some industrial sectors women represent the majority of workers, such as in textiles, garments and footwear, areas of the food industry, cork, cabling, and electrical and electronic equipment, whereas their participation in cutting-edge technology sectors is limited. This means that we need different approaches, but with one common goal of promoting the women working in these sectors, guaranteeing non-discriminatory practices in access to employment and contracting, wage equality, creation of career opportunities, vocational training, good working conditions and better pay, and respecting maternity and paternity as fundamental social values.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to guarantee employment with rights for women working in industry and to keep facilitating their access to jobs in this important sector of production also requires more attention to be paid to the situation in various industries in the European Union, to the challenges facing them and to the appropriate responses which must be found, including in international trade and in monitoring the situation of imports of sensitive products such as those in the textile sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular attention must be paid to the restructuring and relocation of multinationals which significantly affect the employment of women and increase their unemployment, particularly in regions where there is no alternative employment. The fight against the wage discrimination which still exists and which affects female workers, in particular indirect discrimination, requires us to look into establishing a methodology for analysing exactly what jobs entail, which will guarantee the right to equal pay for women and men, give proper recognition to individuals and occupations and, at the same time, establish work as a structural factor, with a view to increasing the productivity, competitiveness and quality of undertakings and improving the lives of workers, both women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore encourage initiatives that contribute to the development in companies of positive measures and human resources policies promoting gender equality. We must also encourage information and training measures making it possible to promote, transfer and incorporate successful practices. I would highlight in this respect certain projects developed with the support of the EQUAL programme which I have had the opportunity to experience in Portugal. This programme deserves the European Commission’s full attention to ensure its continuation and expansion.</p>
<p class="contents">As underlined in the report, negotiations and collective bargaining are vitally important in the fight to abolish discrimination against women, in particular with regard to access to employment, wages, occupational health and safety conditions, career progression, and vocational training. However, the Member States and the Commission have a particular responsibility and an important role to play in promoting equality and fighting all kinds of discrimination, in guaranteeing employment with rights and in combating the precariousness of work which particularly affects women.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call on them to act, whether by defining high standards for health protection at work that take account of the gender dimension, notably maternity protection, or through working time and organisation that respect family life, or by creating effective inspection mechanisms ensuring respect for employment rights and trade union freedom, or by guaranteeing comprehensive access to good public social security and affordable social services, in particular crèches, nurseries and support for elderly people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Meglena Kuneva, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. −</span> Mr President, the Commission warmly welcomes the motion for a resolution on the role of women in industry. I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Figueiredo, on addressing this issue of the situation and role of women in industry, which is complex. One of the several reasons is that, as shown in the report, the gender equality challenges in industry are even more acute than in other sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">In industry, the problems of working conditions, the pay gap and the reconciliation of work and private life tend to be even more pronounced.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a complex issue because it goes beyond equality policy to relate to the general situation in industry in Europe and the way Community policies can support industry and workers – both men and women – in the difficult context of globalisation. As you know, the adoption of the Roadmap for Gender Equality in 2006 underlined the Union’s full commitment to do its utmost to make progress towards a situation of real equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">The six priorities of the roadmap are linked to improving the situation of women on the labour market. The first is economic independence for women and men, the second is reconciliation of private and professional life, the third is equal representation in decision-making and the fourth is the elimination of stereotypes. The Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament’s motion for a resolution highlights precisely these areas. Whilst the progress made in the area of gender equality is unquestionable, major challenges remain. The Commission shares the rapporteur’s view that we must continue our efforts and consolidate what has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as women’s participation in industry is concerned, two issues should be tackled. Firstly, there are still very few women in industry compared to the services sector. Secondly, those women who work in industry tend to be in typically female sectors which are very labour-intensive and characterised by poor working conditions and low wages. The Commission is conducting various policies to meet these challenges. Combating stereotypes in education will, in the long term, lead to there being more highly skilled women in technical and scientific occupations and will also help to meet the needs of certain industrial sectors for manpower or womanpower. It is also important to support the careers of female engineers via networking, mentoring and measures to balance work and private life.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to diversify women’s employment in industry, it is vital to provide every opportunity for training and retraining. The European Social Fund provides essential support in this area. It is also vital to improve the current situation of women working in industry. For example, there is still an unjustifiably large gap between women and men. In industry, this gap is as much as 30%.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, in July 2007 the Commission adopted a communication on tackling the pay gap between women and men. The communication examined all the resources that must be mobilised to achieve this aim. The involvement of enterprises is an important way of making progress in the areas of equality between men and women at work, the gender pay gap, training, work-life balance and career development. In addition to the laws on equal treatment, which all enterprises must obey, it is important to encourage them to adopt voluntary measures to promote equality, in particular in the context of corporate social responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission will shortly relaunch an awareness-raising campaign for enterprises about gender stereotypes. The report on women in industry underlines the vital role of work-life balance in order to achieve real gender equality and the Commission shares this analysis. This point was mentioned during the adoption by Parliament of the Kauppi report in September 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will report in 2008 on progress towards the Barcelona objectives in the area of childcare. The second phase of the consultation of social partners on work-life balance concluded in July. The Commission takes the view that this issue should be tackled using a combination of different instruments, including the amendment of current Community legislation in order to better take account of new challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stressed, the issue of women in industry also reflects the general situation of industry in Europe. The Commission will continue to pursue all the necessary policies to face up to globalisation, ensure a future for industry in the Member States and help workers of both sexes when the companies for which they work are restructured.</p>
<p class="contents">European laws on employee information and consultation, social dialogue and the European Social Fund are all instruments designed to achieve this. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, launched in 2007, will provide assistance of up to EUR 500 million per year and its rules provide specifically for gender equality to be taken into account. The Commission is, therefore, responding to all the challenges identified by the report on the role of women in industry by taking measures of various kinds: improving equality, working conditions and the role of women in industry, combating stereotypes, creating better conditions for reconciling work and family life and providing general support for companies and workers in industrial sectors in difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a personal statement: I sincerely support this way of tackling the difficulties in this specific area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The British Conservatives support it, as does the PPE-DE Group. If Europe is to play a leading part in a very competitive, a fiercely competitive, global world, we need all the resources available at the highest possible level.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I disagree that there should be quotas saying how many ladies there should be at various levels in companies – and I particularly disagree with any compulsion in that regard – what I do want to see is as many ladies as possible rise to the highest possible levels based on their ability. It often depends on what we define as ‘industry’, and industry is changing; everything is much more flexible nowadays, and I am delighted that ladies are playing their role in industry in their various positions.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree that there needs to be any handicap or under-representation in the new technologies, because ladies have the brains, the intelligence and the know-how to more than make their worth felt.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would endorse the view that we should always go for equal pay wherever possible. Regarding this report, I was extremely pleased that the rapporteur embraced the views of people from the various groups and that we reached unanimity. I wanted to see better facilities for pensions for ladies – for portability within pensions from one employer to another to make sure they get higher pensions as they get through their working lives, and more flexibility in terms of facilities so that ladies can balance their family lives with their working lives.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, I fully support this report. It is a step forward. We need ladies at all levels and I wish them well. I welcome in particular our new Commissioner, who is very capable indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report to some extent lists the problems facing women employed in various sectors of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the problems seem to be perennial problems, such as the gender pay gap, the inadequate representation of women on company boards of directors or the inadequate reconciliation of work and family life. The report also brings up issues that are less frequently discussed, such as the insufficient attention given to specific requirements for the protection of women in the work place or the social problems that arise as a result of transfers of production to areas with lower production costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the proposals in the report interfere with the principle of subsidiarity or lay down requirements that encroach on the competence of the social partners and the processes of collective bargaining. The PPE-DE Group will not support these proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that the report is more or less a summary of problems that are reasonably well known, it points at the fact that changes in these areas are slow, as can be seen, for example, in the development of differences between the salaries of men and women. The research clearly indicates that the turning point comes when children arrive: from that point the careers of men and women take different directions. Most difficult to break are the critical stereotypes, and this is the case even when we do not identify with them verbally any more. The report also highlights the issue of the transferability and flexibility of pension rights, which is becoming more and more sensitive with the progressive unification of the labour market, and with the requirement for higher mobility of the workforce. This, I think, is an issue that should be given appropriate attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We made the most of our opportunities to work together across political boundaries and I would like to express my warmest thanks for this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would begin by pointing out that we have already presented a large number of reports on this subject. The demand for equal pay for equal work goes back more than 30 years and we have still not been able to make it a reality. Of course we are taking small steps forward and we are producing paper after paper, but the situation of women in industry still remains a long way behind what we have been working towards all this time.</p>
<p class="contents">In the manufacturing industry, for example, 85% of the employees are women, and in the ICT sector the figure is 15%, and indeed women are very poorly represented in the high-technology industries. This does not imply that women are less educated, it only means – and this applies especially to rural areas – that there are simply no opportunities to take up other jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Women continue to work in the low-wage sector and even here there is differentiation between male and female workers. There is still inequality and discrimination, and not just in respect of wage levels but working conditions too. We are therefore also appealing to the trade unions to do more to prevent this type of wage discrimination when taking part in pay negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for professional and vocational training programmes is still lacking or is woefully inadequate. Education and training is needed in order to provide female employees with career prospects, even in low-skill sectors. We also call on companies to apply family and women-friendly policies in their workforce management plans, which will work to everyone’s advantage: when everyone has that feel-good feeling, business runs better and this also benefits the women who work in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Member of the Commission is, I am sure, personally committed to the issue, but when I was listening to your official reply in which you said that the Roadmap had been adopted, and that there was commitment to it, afterwards one might naturally have expected to hear an account of what had actually happened. Unfortunately, we have to say that hardly anything has happened in matters of equality during this Commission’s term. That is regrettable. It is perhaps not the sort of important issue the Commissioners or others could score points on; nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to encourage us all to do more because we are responsible for the status of women in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you one example. In Finland women got the right to vote when it was part of a very conservative Russia in 1905. That was amazing. Looking ahead now, I do not think it will be possible, now we are part of Europe, for women in the different Member States to earn the same pay and receive the same kind of treatment in the EU, even if the EU speaks of human rights and is progressive. I think the EU could take a look at the decisions that were taken in tsarist times and make bold decisions on equality of pay and equality in the workplace. The tsar had the courage to give women the vote, but the EU does not have the courage to do anything to bring about equality of pay in the Member States of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We used to see many huge billboards with pictures of smiling girls driving tractors. These were girls from the so-called Polish Service organisation. We saw them shouldering pickaxes and spades and marching joyfully off to work. There were also women tending looms and lathes. Times have changed. We now see women working in design offices, on computers, or on the new production lines for electronic equipment, mobile telephones and televisions. We also see the tired faces of women hurrying home after many hours of hard work to undertake other daily tasks. Those were the images that came to my mind as I read Mrs Figueiredo's report on the role of women in industry.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years now, efforts have been made to protect women, reduce their workload and treat them in the same way as men are treated. Unfortunately, differences persist to this day. The list of expectations is very appropriate, though perhaps not complete. Differences still persist in the way men and women are treated at work, both regarding pay and career development as well as assessment of their work and qualifications. The most unfortunate thing of all is that it has not proved possible to create the conditions for women's hopes and aspirations to be realised, so that they can be sure of job stability and opportunities for career development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need to make headway on overcoming such stereotypes and that is precisely why I feel the Figueiredo report is a fundamental and important concept and, similarly, why it enjoys the support of our group.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much evidence to justify this report and the submission of a number of proposals, which we trust will be welcomed not only by the Community institutions, but by business itself, which, after all, has to adopt them and implement them.</p>
<p class="contents">One such piece of evidence is the fact that the European Union average in terms of women employed in industry is a mere 14%. It must nevertheless also be borne in mind that, of this percentage, 21% accounts for part-time employees; indeed, women account for 65% of part-time employees in the industrial sector. I feel that this is one of the key aspects, and by no means a minor issue in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The second piece of evidence is the fact that it is precisely women with precarious employment conditions, women working part-time, carrying out temporary employment in atypical conditions, that are most frequently affected by wage discrimination or, when they wish to take maternity leave, have fewer possibilities in terms of basic, permanent and vocational training.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus the proposals in this report include the proposal for urgent measures to be adopted for full and effective application of Directive 75/117 EEC on the principle of equal pay for men and women as a means of opposing wage discrimination. We have been calling for this for some time now, and hope to see it implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want incentives to be provided for initiatives, positive courses of action and policies for human resources to promote equality. We want the Member States and the Commission to provide more and better tax breaks for companies in terms of compliance with codes of conduct and corporate social responsibility criteria in their day-to-day business. We want to see better working conditions, with particular emphasis on working hours, and maternity and paternity leave – here responsibility is shared on both sides by the couple or the family – thereby guaranteeing working men and women the opportunity to take up their posts again after such leave. Attention must also be paid to reconciling work and family life. Thus, for all this to be transformed into reality, the report calls for these rights to be implemented in legislation across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I beg to differ with Mr Dover on the subject of quotas. For some of us, female and male, these constitute a necessary instrument, and thus we feel the point must be made that the European Union ought to follow the Norwegian example of applying measures to increase the numbers of female board members of public utilities to at least 40%, and use regulations to impose a 40% quota of female representation on boards of private companies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that this is not the solution, but I must insist that this is a path and a means that is proving useful in other aspects, which we would like to see copied within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has documented facts that I myself consider fundamental, in particular the fact that working women account for the dominant share of employment in the processing industry, where the majority of jobs require fewer qualifications, are manual and are badly paid. The stereotype that it is a woman’s lot to do auxiliary work is well illustrated here. I had the opportunity to visit several production plants in the food industry in different countries. These plants are very similar, despite their geographical diversity. The men hold the managerial jobs and the unskilled work on the production line is done by women. They earn little, they work mechanically in a stupefying rhythm, without any motivation for professional growth, and they work under unfavourable conditions. This is, of course, wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal of work is still needed to put an end to gender inequality. We must realise that this area is still not sufficiently covered by statistics and that the gender issue is a relatively new statistical phenomenon. In the real world, the disadvantages experienced by women in industry, compared with men, are even more noticeable. However, it is necessary to focus on the issues that the rapporteur rightly designated as priorities: the disadvantages facing women in terms of pay and the fact that there are few women in technical fields that are, in comparison to the significant processing industry, technologically more demanding and better paid. Women need to be able to gain access to higher education; professional qualifications are of relevance here. They should also be given the opportunity to return from maternity leave to the labour market, but also to further studies. This right, of course, applies to men who look after children too.</p>
<p class="contents">Some regions of the European Union, particularly in the East, are undergoing changes in the structure of their industries. These changes are enforcing greater workforce mobility and retraining. I know about these trends from my own experience, because I come from the industrial part of the Czech Republic, which has been industrialised, and I am aware of their impact, especially on working women.</p>
<p class="contents">Another related problem is the transfer of factories to countries outside the European Union, where the workforce is cheaper. Women’s employment is also threatened by the influx of cheap goods from Asia, but also from other countries that produce high volumes of consumer goods for foreign markets, rather than supplying their own market, which does not have the purchasing power. All these factors have a noticeable influence on the employment of women in industry and their negative consequences should be gradually mitigated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This can be due to personal choice or to tradition, but is often the result of discrimination in the workplace. In addition, on average women earn less than men in every Member State of the European Union. It is therefore important to use legislative and regulatory means to remind entrepreneurs and employers of their duty to comply fully with the principle of equal treatment, and not just as regards pay.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the unequal participation of women in industry should be approached rationally, because the branches of industry defined as 'female' may involve less physical and mental effort. Women could be advised to consider them but that need not imply lower pay. It is difficult to imagine more men than women being employed in the embroidery industry or more women than men being employed in the smelting industry. Furthermore, the embroidery industry I referred to as an example may be better paid because of the artistic element involved than the food industry, for instance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to ensure that men and women receive equal pay across the different areas, and to eliminate exploitation and other unfair practices and conditions from the workplace. Opportunities for part-time work should be promoted, especially for women, alongside different types of flexibility facilitating retraining and learning.</p>
<p class="contents">In my speeches and in the amendments I have tabled I have repeatedly proposed not only that a return to one's job be guaranteed after maternity or parental leave, but also that such maternity or parental leave be classed as time at work, and the relevant monetary payment made in due course. This would pre-empt low retirement pensions and also help to reduce unemployment. Above all, it would ensure the proper upbringing and development of children, who are the future of every family and every nation and the future of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The panorama is always the same: the persistence of stereotypes in the choice of educational and professional guidelines, over-representation of women in certain sectors such as the textile industry, the pay gap, working conditions and career prospects. The recommendations never change, however: promoting equality between men and women in professional spheres in terms of pay, their presence on company boards, or developing structures for child care and employment flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">This is fine, but what then? What exactly is this umpteenth report on women’s rights going to change, within or outside the industrial sector? Despite coercive policies based on ‘positive action’ – a misleading formulation, since what it really means is compulsory quotas – gender mindsets have great difficulty moving forward.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not by imposing structures that may occasionally be unnatural, in the name of the principles of equality and non-discrimination, that women will more naturally take up their role within companies, whatever they may be. Women do not have such a severe handicap that they must be systematically imposed to be accepted. Incentive measures must not be coercion measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, when applying the Charter of Fundamental Rights we should not forget that we must also leave all entrepreneurs free to hire whomever they choose, as long as all employees are treated in the same manner, regardless of their sex. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If we want to preserve work opportunities for women specifically in these disadvantaged regions, where the textile and clothing industries have their own tradition, we must support these industries as a productive industrial sector through suitable measures: creating new programmes focusing, for example, on the presentation and advertising of new products at specialist and international fairs. The wider application of the Strategic Research Agenda of the European Technological Platform and the need to introduce innovative technology and new business models are, in my opinion, a contribution to the future of the textile and clothing industries.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that despite an increase in the number of females studying technical and scientific subjects, the obstacles they encounter in the workplace result in women abandoning scientific careers in industry. Given the importance of maintaining a certain standard in education and knowledge, scientific work must be continuous. In some scientific institutions no provision is made for women to work for part of their working time at home unless they absolutely have to be in the workplace. The mentality surrounding overtime may be one of the specific barriers. Those are the reasons why we are registering below average representation of women in high-tech sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Primary responsibility rests with the Member States. We would therefore ask the relevant national institutions to prepare and introduce policies aimed at reconciling work and private life, to facilitate greater flexibility in working time and to improve the general approach to childcare services. It is also important to encourage employers – especially of small and medium-sized companies – to make sure that they put these policies and procedures into practice , through effective technical measures and if possible financial support too.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ilda Figueiredo, for her work and our shadow rapporteur, Edit Bauer, through whom we were able to enrich the report by way of our opinions. I also value highly the opinion of my colleague Mr Dover from the ITRE Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Chairman, in conclusion I would like to bring up one technical issue. It is very cold in this House during the debates, including today’s debate. The coldness of this Chamber does not create a good working environment for our work as Members and has serious consequences for our health.

Still, one cannot avoid being disappointed, because documents like this have been produced since the 1950s and we still have very little change. This applies to women in industry, the health situation and health care for women, and to career opportunities, learning opportunities and opportunities to improve their skills, not to mention the situation of the work and family combination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, therefore, to spend half of my speaking time on questions to the Commission. Firstly, it is appalling that, after decades, we still have such a bad statistics situation. This is something where the Commission can really ask for an improvement when it comes to European statistics. I see that responsibility for this lies mainly with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was a university teacher 25 years ago, I taught my students about the rules on equal pay deriving from Brussels and from the European Member States at the time. The cases from the Court (Danfoss I and II) happened more than 25 years ago. Is it not time for a new regulation with more teeth? This is also the responsibility of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like a mid-term health check when it comes to the roadmap for gender equality, which contains a lot of nice words, but no regulation so far on the horizon.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the Spring Summit will work with the Lisbon resolution. These issues should be mentioned in March. And fifthly, when the Commission – and Parliament – arrange seminars with high-level groups, we should apply the same rules as Norway for industrial boards, i.e. the 40:60 percentage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore worth giving careful consideration to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Pole, a woman, and a physicist by training, I can state that in my country the average level of education of women is higher than that of men. Women are also more involved in business in the SME sector. I have not observed any gender-based discrimination in the scientific world. Nonetheless, women earn between 15% and 20% less than men do and women’s involvement at managerial level in companies is significantly lower than that of men. In addition, more women than men are in insecure employment. The result, therefore, is that although training and different ways of improving one’s qualifications are important, they are not enough to reduce discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Female poverty is due not only to low pay, but also to the way pension schemes are devised. Following the reform of the Polish pension scheme, a provision was introduced whereby pension contributions for persons taking maternity leave and parental leave were financed from the State budget. This was a great help to women, as pension systems tend to penalise them heavily for motherhood. The report has noted the need to deal with the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I also attach great importance to considering issues relating to health and safety from a gender-specific point of view, notably as regards burdening women with tasks causing musculoskeletal disorders.

Furthermore, to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, the participation of women in the labour market needs to be increased. As women represent 59% of graduates, it is difficult to understand why the majority of new jobs for women are part-time, sometimes insecure and precarious, poorly paid and with few prospects of career progression.</p>
<p class="contents">This report by Mrs Figueiredo, whom I congratulate, contains two proposals that I must highlight: the first is the promotion of female entrepreneurship. Given that 61% of women take account of family circumstances when considering setting up a business, compared with only 49% of men, measures are needed to help reconcile professional with family and private life.</p>
<p class="contents">The other proposal concerns long working hours. It is essential for the Commission to carry out a study into the negative consequences of long working hours, namely the family, personal and social consequences, such as children being left alone for many hours, which often leads to failure at school and crime. The Member States should also be urged to improve the monitoring of undertakings that force their employees to work beyond the statutory working hours and to impose harsher penalties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Over the past decades Europe has made considerable progress in promoting gender equality. The report on the role of women in industry summarizes some of these achievements, while insisting for a stricter application of the principle of equality.</p>
<p class="contents">It can regrettably be noted, however, that despite the existing relevant legal framework, a number of EU directives and resolutions remain without proper implementation. The role of women in industry ought to be based on the principles of equal pay and equal involvement in decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">The labour market situation in Member States shows that women are inconsistently represented in the various sectors. They account for a large percentage of those employed in the service sectors and are underrepresented in the high-tech area, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting decent jobs is an integral part of the European Union values and Member States need to take effective measures to ensure that standards are met and decent jobs are guaranteed in the various industry sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we are all faced with the serious challenge of applying a set of policies with a focus of combining work, personal and family life.

We need to make it compulsory to compile gender-differentiated statistics on both wage levels and the gender balance in the individual sectors.

The role of women in industry affects all facets of society and has wide-ranging implications for employment and welfare policy, family and child policy, not to mention economic policy. Yes, equality legislation ensures women get maternity leave, but all the evidence shows that they expose themselves to promotional and financial discrimination, albeit subtly (to comply with the law) but nonetheless pervasively in an inflexible business culture.</p>
<p class="contents">There was an outcry in Ireland in recent weeks when a media accountant made this very point and he was roundly handbagged. There is no point denying the blindly obvious. Perhaps this report before us should be subtitled, ‘Motherhood and misogyny’, as an editorial in the <span class="italic">Sunday Tribune</span> at home screamed last week.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament must endorse the proposal before us – with which I largely agree – because, on the one hand, industry needs women at all levels and, on the other hand, society needs children. We all – including employers and industrialists – must respect maternity and paternity leave as fundamental social values. While I still baulk at compulsory quotas for women’s participation, albeit in politics or business, my faith in a meritocracy is being sorely tested the older and, hopefully, the wiser I get.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.

<p class="contents">I feel that one of the courses of action mentioned to rectify this circumstance, the idea of a reward for companies encouraging reconciliation between professional life and family life, is quite interesting, and indeed the improvement of women’s career prospects ought to be encouraged by enhancing life-long learning.</p>

This is indeed one of its topics. However, what the report emphasises is the presence of women in industry: women have low-paid jobs in low-paid industry branches, they are in the majority where there are no trade unions, and consequently no guarantees under collective agreements; women work in vulnerable industry branches, and they are the first to be laid off in the event of mass redundancy. Women are present at the workplace, but they are nowhere to be seen in management. They only get to do the work; they don't get to decide. </p>
<p class="contents">This report talks about what is missing, but it also talks about the things that women have. Women have an education, but hold no qualifications; they suffer from occupational diseases which are not recognised as such; they are willing to learn after they've turned forty, but they have no opportunity to do so. They are mothers, but there are no nurseries available. Men become parents and have no nurseries either, but they have their wives. </p>
<p class="contents">What is to be done? Existing regulations, our reports, the Commission’s roadmap on gender mainstreaming, all these show that we know what should be done. What we and the Commission should remember, and most importantly what we should remind Member States of, is that citizens, especially women, do not judge our efficiency by the number of decisions we pass, but by our ability and will to enforce them.

<p class="contents">In reply to Ms Figueiredo, it is true that the Equal programme finishes in 2008, but the European Social Fund Regulation for 2007-2013 incorporates gender equality as a horizontal priority.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Ms Bauer, we had the first reading of the important legislation issue you mentioned – the transferability of pension rights – in June 2007, and the EPSCO Council dealt with it in December 2007. We hope to make quick progress during 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Ms Jäätteenmäki – I realise that she is not in the Chamber, but her question was very important, so I would like to answer it – the Commission adopted, in July 2007, the communication on ‘Tackling the pay gap between men and women’. In that communication, the Commission announced that in 2008 it would examine the relevance of current legislation from the point of view of the relevance of legal instruments with regard to the causes of the pay gap and, where necessary, propose amendments to the Community legal framework. Following this examination the Commission could propose any necessary changes to the current legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Ms Romeva i Rueda, anti-discrimination and gender equality legislation does not preclude Member States from developing and implementing positive actions. The Commission supports there being a higher proportion of women in decision-making. We will create a network of women in decision-making posts, probably during 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Ms Flasarová, we cannot prevent companies from delocalising, but we have instruments to tackle that issue. In 2007, the European Globalisation Fund was quite promptly set up for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Ms Ek, concerning statistics, the Commission continues to cooperate with Eurostat to develop specific statistics on equality. The Dublin Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions takes into account gender equality in its regular reports. In 2009, there will be a regular publication on the research statistics on women.</p>

<p class="contents">However, as others have already done, I must also of course call for further practical measures to be taken. These proposals that we have made must be felt on the ground, in the lives of undertakings, female workers and families, because it is not acceptable, as various people have said here today, that 30 years after a directive provided for equal pay, we still have this clear disparity of 30% between the average wages of men and women working in industry. This figure is double the average wage difference in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot therefore allow this situation to continue for a further 30 years and that is why I call on the Commission, and also the Member States, to take concrete measures. These could be legislative or they could involve better monitoring, but they must ensure increased promotion of equal rights and opportunities and increased promotion of this objective which must be put into practice through education and training. We must also fight stereotyping, as highlighted here today, and we must ensure that the organisation of working hours, working time and jobs better responds to women’s rights, and also to the right to maternity and paternity which are recognised as fundamental social values of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And chemicals are implicated in 86% of cancer-related occupational illnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">An important point here is that women, who generally live longer than men, are, as a group, more sensitive to chemicals and more vulnerable, as chemicals gradually build up in their adipose tissue and can be transferred to their unborn children.

Europe’s legal arsenal is currently one of the world’s most lavish in terms of women’s rights and gender equality. Therefore, it is up to the elected representatives and the citizens to ensure respect for the rights of women in the European Union. In consequence, the usefulness of an umpteenth declaration of intent is somewhat limited.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report contains one proposal that is, to say the least, curious indeed: suggesting that a quota of women on boards of private companies ought to be established by law points to a serious attack on individual liberties and does women little service.

<p class="contents">The Commission supports the Forum in this form. Two meetings have been held so far: in 2006 in Athens and 2007 in Rio. The Commission welcomes the forum in each form. The Commission also welcomes the participation of Parliament at the forum and is grateful for the excellent cooperation on both meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">As in the previous year, the meeting in Rio provided an excellent framework for enriching exchanges which allowed the gathering of a range of views on the relevant issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission sees value in upholding the main characteristics of the forum, notably the participation of the various stakeholders and its non-binding nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like also to thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to say something more concrete on the IGF (we have adopted this abbreviation) which took place in November in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly I would like to thank very much Ms Trautmann, Mr Harbour, Mr Badia i Cutchet and Mr Hökmark, who represented Parliament at this meeting, for their active participation and for the continuation of their excellent cooperation. This allowed us – this year again – together to highlight a number of European priorities such as freedom of speech, bridging the digital divide, security and child protection on-line.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for Europe to bring such issues to the forefront of the international agenda on a constant basis. The Commission supports the IGF. This concept, elaborated during the World Summit on the Information Society, is still very valuable, and all the issues which have been mentioned are very much in favour of what we are trying to step up as actions in this particular field.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, on a broad range of internet-relevant subjects, the number of participants – around 3 100 – clearly demonstrates that there is indeed interest in having such a place for discussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that there is no negotiated text as an outcome of the Forum should be seen as a strength rather than as a weakness of the process. The Forum allows for open exchange, without the pressure of defending a particular outcome in a binding document.</p>
<p class="contents">This can serve as a basis for improving understanding of each other’s concerns and can pave the way for finding common solutions. Dynamic coalitions stemming from the Forum are, in fact, one example that the IGF can work as a platform where people who share common interests can further cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the Rio Internet Governance Forum meeting again provided an excellent framework for enriching exchanges, which allowed a range of views on relevant issues to be gathered.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank once again Members and hope we will continue our excellent cooperation, because this is one of the most promising areas for our future work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In all sectors of societies, the impact of the internet has changed patterns and opportunities. This is important in order to keep a perspective for the future, because the strength of the internet has been its independent nature, its opportunities and its ability to adapt to different opportunities and demands in societies, based on a number of different actors and operators.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important because, when we look to the future, we must ensure that it can be used in order to bridge rifts between countries and people, and help to fight poverty and support development – it is of crucial importance for the Millennium Goals, for example. The emergence of new technology should also be used to ensure that it is easier for more people to use the internet, in more societies.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union have three important things to focus on. First of all, we should ensure we are committed to, and support, the IGF process and its independent and non-binding character. That is of deep importance, because it is a good process which is much more dynamic when it is independent and non-binding.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should contribute to the preparations for the next IGF in New Delhi, and ensure that we hold discussions with parliamentarians and civil society in order to underline its independence, but also the opportunities. Thirdly, we should ensure that the internet is guaranteed freedom and freedom of expression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The forum provides a favourable context in which to seek solutions to future ICT problems. Through a common culture and a partnership format, it provides the decisions to be taken at future world summits on the information society, in addition to those to be taken by our own states.</p>
<p class="contents">It also provides the opportunity to hold an open reflection on the complex nature of the Internet and make timely provision for its technical, ethical and legal limitations, since there are major concerns in addition to the issues close to EU hearts: reducing the digital divide, freedom of expression on the web, cultural diversity and child protection. I could also RFID, radio frequency identification, in short, the formation of an Internet of things, the risks of network overload by 2010-2012, digitalisation, particularly of cultural goods, the consequences arising in terms of the protection of intellectual property and, above all, improvement of access to ICT for less developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is certainly up to speed in terms of the legislative process. This is encouraging for us as Europeans, but we must not slacken off. Many of these legal or regulatory issues are likewise improved with the review of the Telecom Package.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would call for a new phase of targeted political and future-oriented work, notably through the creation of a European IGF involving the national parliaments and local authorities: a European forum implemented by 2009 and perhaps a world forum in Europe thanks to Lithuania’s application for 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">As delegation head, I wish to thank all Members, colleagues and officials for their work and their availability. The resolution we will be voting on constitutes a roadmap. I am pleased it enjoys the support of all of the groups in Parliament. More parliamentary committees are welcome to lend their weight to this course of action, and I would like to thank the Commission and ask its Members to lend their support to Mrs Reding. Finally, I would like to ask the Council to include in its agenda relations with India and preparations for the New Delhi forum, and I would urge all Member States to participate in enhanced cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nowadays, the most limited asset of European citizens is time, and it is vital for the governments of the Member States to introduce public services on the internet.</p>
<p class="contents">My home country, Estonia, has done much in this field: e-voting, e-tax declarations, e-government and e-registry office are only a few examples of successful ‘e’-projects that could be implemented across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that it is much easier to reform a small country, where approximately 66% of the inhabitants use the internet. However, moving public services to the internet is worth the effort.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the prerequisites for the functioning of democracy is participation. ‘E’-solutions provide the possibility of participation with minimal effort: there are no queues or officials exercising the right of discretion. The internet gives citizens more independence and ensures impartial administration of their affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is essential to start such education from an early stage in schools. On the other hand, computer literacy has succeeded where Esperanto failed – it has become the most universal language – and efforts should be made not only to bridge the digital gap at regional and global levels, but bearing in mind the different age groups and social strata.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the European Parliament often seems to occupy itself with producing immense volumes of paper. Why not upgrade our tools of democracy and implement paperless administration? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A knife may be used to slice our daily bread but it may also be used to kill. It is hard to imagine the contemporary world without the Internet, and our working lives without the Internet, but the Internet is also abused, for example by paedophiles.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union therefore acted wisely in setting child protection on the Internet as a priority for the last Internet Governance Forum held in Brazil two months ago. We should strive to combine openness and maximum access to the Internet with safety not only for children but anyone else who might be as risk as a result of Internet abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant that the next Internet Governance Forum will be held in Delhi, the capital of India. India is a country that has become a leader in information science, despite being relatively poor. It services global enterprises thus enabling hundreds of thousands of people to improve their standard of living.</p>
<p class="contents">Two proposals appear worthy of support: the first is for an Internet Governance Forum to be organised in two years’ time in one of the new Member States, Poland for example, or perhaps Lithuania; the second is to consider creating an Internet Governance Forum of our own, I mean our own European forum, not a world forum. The European Parliament has a vital role to play in this regard. Clearly, Internet access in the Member States of the Union varies considerably.

<p class="contents">This was a fact well noted by the many participants. We were the most active of all the political delegations there, and there were more European parliamentarians than any others. However, we are now seeing signs that other parliaments are looking at the Internet Governance Forum and realising they need to engage with it, because it addresses crucial public policy matters on which they need to be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The speeches given by my colleagues have covered a number of the issues. I would just like to make some broad observations about how I see the process evolving, particularly because I am the only Member of this Parliament to have attended both the world summits on the information society, and have also been through the process from the very beginning. There is a feeling that the forum in Rio is now starting to come up with much more practical ideas, and people are beginning to realise the value of exchanging information and best practice from around the globe.</p>
<p class="contents">That is based on an understanding that it is not actually going to be formal, international, legal structures that are going to deliver many of the benefits we are looking for. In fact, we are going to have to deal with many of these matters through intergovernmental cooperation, and in many cases through cooperation between voluntary or non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case, for example, of child protection, which the previous speaker referred to, the most successful initiatives have been those carried out by voluntary-based organisations – such as, in my country – the Internet Watch Foundation. It was very important to actually talk to people about such organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I will close by giving you a clear example, at a broader level, of the value of such interchanges. I participated in a workshop on consumer protection data breach notification, which is about to be discussed in Parliament as part of European legislation. I have a whole dossier on what has been done in other counties, and would say to the Commission that their proposal is currently extremely weak and would benefit greatly from its looking at that information. This is the sort of practical benefit we can derive from such forums, and I am sure we in this Parliament will be able to contribute to the development of the agenda for the next forum, to make it even more effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For this reason I feel we must congratulate ourselves on the commitment we are making in Europe. I also feel, however, that we ought to avail ourselves of the political opportunity at this time, as Mrs Trautmann said, to reflect on the new Telecommunications Package, and in that sense I think that both the Commission and Parliament must make every effort not just to offer the people of Europe access to the best digital services, but also to spearhead the extension of the information society as a social commodity to countries that are in need of European cooperation and leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, I feel that what has been said here is extremely important: we must work on common problems such as sensitivity, freedom of expression on the Internet and protection, priority issues in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time I think it is vital – and I will end here, Madam President – that we make global issues compatible with local issues. I believe that this is a priority, and so the posture set out in the resolution we will be adopting today is relevant: I trust it will be sufficient incentive for the Commission to continue to include these priorities in its political agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this forum stakeholders can explore together the limits that are very important and that will probably be applied in global relations later and also translated into EU regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some quite difficult issues behind this dialogue. I am thinking of the domain names, the icon and the American influence on this. The idea behind it is that we feel that it is extremely important that the world wide web should continue to have a genuinely global, unambiguous approach. That is why it is important to see that signals from this debate reappear again in the new approach to the icon and that the ideas of partners are taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would like to throw some light on one particular aspect today. I very much support a European forum, a European interpretation of the forum for internet governance for the future, ideally before the 2009 elections. What we have to do is to make sure that we also bring our national parliaments on board in the debates. From the initiatives in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, you can see that these are live issues; given their importance for the future, for employment and welfare, as well as for freedom of information and participation, it is essential that we bring the national parliaments on board with other stakeholders in a European approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I am appealing to the Commission: I read in the files that it does not have enough instruments or funds to support one thing and another, to choose a different line of approach. There is plenty of money. Look in i2010, look in the programmes for research, etc. I would really like to a very generous position to be adopted in order to establish the European view of these problems even more clearly before the 2009 elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the Rio meeting, consultations will be held in Geneva next month to collect views on the outcome of Rio and the preparation for the next meeting in New Delhi. The Commission participates in the advisory group which assists the UN Secretary-General in the preparation of the IGF. As has been our practice since the World Summit on the Information Society, we will of course inform Members of the outcome of this meeting. I would now like to answer some of the specific questions raised by MEPs, starting with Ms Trautmann.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that Ms Trautmann addressed, in her speech at the opening session, the issue of the ‘Internet of Things’ and the possibility of bringing this up at the IGF next year. With regard to the second part of Ms Trautmann’s speech, regional IGFs have emerged in a number of places, and this appears to be a useful way to focus on questions of internet governance that are of particular importance for a specific region. The Commission strongly supports this idea.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to Mr Savi, we could not agree more with his statement, and this is why the Commission is committed to the development of the e-application with the broad programmes and legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Czarnecki, the Commission is committed to all the initiatives on child protection. We promoted the item on the IGF agenda and we are about to propose a renewed programme on child protection on the internet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must recognise that this will have two consequences. First of all, funding will have to be provided from the Community budget, and EUROPOL staff will acquire the status of Community officials. The report also contains provisions for coordination, which we all welcome, and organisation and implementation of investigations and operational activities carried out in conjunction with the Member States’ relevant authorities or by joint investigation teams.</p>
<p class="contents">The Conservatives favour open cooperation between police forces across the EU and beyond in the fight against crime. But we really do not accept that the EU has any role in centralising such cooperation. Thus, EUROPOL is an agency which is not necessary since other organisations already exist to fulfil this function at a global level.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that I would like to add that the coming ratification of the European Constitution, despite its rejection in two referendums, is undemocratic, cowardly and illegitimate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have Interpol, we have the Hague Convention, we have extradition treaties, we recognise the time spent in another country’s prison as constituting part of a sentence, and so on.</p>

What utter nonsense! We have been fighting organised crime and terrorism quite effectively, through proper long-standing cooperation between police forces.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all about creating another aspect of the apparatus of EU statehood, so that it has an effective EU police force.

<p class="contents">The European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia was transformed into an Agency tasked with safeguarding and promoting human rights, the Agency being officially established on 1 March 2007. Ever since then, we must acknowledge, it has been wholly non-operational owing to the lack of a director and a multiannual framework.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to this sluggishness and bureaucratic inefficiency, the rapporteur proposes amending the multiannual framework in a minimum number of areas. He urges the Commission and Council to speed up the process of selecting candidates for the post of director so as to facilitate a rapid agreement among the EU institutions, thereby reactivating this vital tool to safeguard citizens’ human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call upon my fellow Members to support this report, since it represents an initial step towards making the Agency operational.</p>

We are today debating broadening Europol’s competences and streamlining its operations, 12 years after it was established.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has made an accurate assessment of Europol’s current legal and factual situation. He rightly criticises the overly complicated and lengthy procedure envisaged to change Europol’s status and include it in the Union’s organisational structure. The corrective measures proposed in the report are also worthy of consideration and support.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier attempts to change Europol’s competences show how difficult it is for countries to reach agreement when they are bound by the principle of unanimity. I therefore believe that only when the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified and comes into force in all 27 Member States will we be able to introduce procedural changes and improve this situation, as the Treaty will also reform the decision-making process within the EU.</p>

<p class="contents">The transformation of Europol into an EU agency must not place an additional financial burden on Member States; above all, it must not consume any of the already insufficient state resources earmarked for national police forces. On the contrary, the investigative authorities and those responsible for law and order must be better looked after and reinforced. Indeed, Europol's activities must consist of supporting and coordinating the fundamental, irreplaceable work of the various Member States' police forces.

It is therefore hard not to recognise its strategic importance for the development of all Member States of the European Union and their citizens, regardless of gender.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of women employed in European industry and the opportunities available to them depend not only on a country’s level of economic development, but also on traditions regarding acceptance of equal opportunities and respect for human rights regulations. There is large-scale participation of women in industry and they make a substantial contribution in almost all sectors. Nonetheless, one has to agree with the rapporteur that the role of women in industries involving cutting-edge technologies, such as the aeronautical industry or the chemical industry, is very inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is entirely appropriate, therefore, that the report highlights this aspect and focuses quite rightly on gender issues. The report also emphasises that women’s involvement in industry cannot be limited to work in sectors that do not require qualifications, where women are the first to suffer when restructuring takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur calls for support, especially for SMEs, to enable the relatively high level of female employment to be retained, particularly in the case of women who find themselves in an unfortunate professional situation. This suggestion is worthy of support, as is the entire report, if only for this reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These rights include the very important principle of equality between women and men, allowing of course for the circumstances arising out of the biological differences between them. One aspect of this issue concerns the employment and role of women in industry. It is simply impossible to apply an arithmetical division into equal halves.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, what we are concerned with is equality of opportunity, which is conditional on access to education and professional training in technical and economic subjects. Another very important issue is providing assistance to mothers bringing up children and ensuring they are not discriminated against in the workplace. It is essential to introduce flexible provisions regarding pensions for women bringing up children. The period of so-called parental leave must be credited in full and added to the period considered as time in employment under pension rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In many of our countries women are still being paid significantly less than men for work of equal quality and quantity. There can be no justification for creating obstacles impeding women from undertaking managerial and supervisory roles on company boards of directors or boards of trustees.

<p class="contents">My second comment concerns the balanced division of time between work and family. This affects women as well as men. I do not think that the solution lies in resolutions. It lies in the implementation of the European concept of flexicurity. Holland is one example where an excellent legislative framework has been developed for part-time work. The result has been reduced unemployment, as well as giving men and women more time for family life. An effective use of shorter working hours also shows that it does not have to lead to a reduction in income. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Swedish Liberal Party has over the years taken the view that the best way to proceed in these matters is on a voluntary basis but we also realise that this is not always enough. Sweden’s positive engagement in this field has made us known as one of the world’s most equal countries. So do we not want to disseminate our successes across the EU?</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we do! The question is merely by what methods. In the report in question I felt obliged to vote against a number of paragraphs whose spirit I support but whose scope and approach seem dubious. I think that both equality plans and measurable targets may be important tools for enterprises. On the other hand, I do not believe it is something that the EU should concern itself with as a primary issue. The same applies to the establishment of an EU-sponsored ‘methodology for analysing exactly what jobs entail’ that will ‘guarantee’ equal pay. The Global Adjustment Fund, about which I had severe misgivings from the beginning, also should not take special account of gender – that would be to perpetrate a double injustice.</p>

Because the couple are under house arrest they used a webcam link to take part in a hearing of the European Parliament on the human rights situation in China. The renewed arrest of Hu Jia has only served to demonstrate something that he himself warned of. Does China by its action wish to show its contempt for the opinion of the European Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights must be firmly enshrined as an issue that cuts across all the relations that exist between the EU and China. We too must act in a coherent and consistent way and should not simply sacrifice our values on the altar of good economic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore calling on the Council and the Commission not just to take up a position for Hu Jia but also to use the next EU-China summit to call for a commitment to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">China has to put a stop to the systematic intimidation of human rights activists. If China does not change its conduct we will again need to raise the issue of our participation in the Olympic Games. Moreover, Russia is set to host the next Winter Olympics and that country also has a poor record when it comes to human rights.</p>

China’s economic growth and increased international standing have still not resulted in any real difference in the approach to civil liberties, abuse of power by the authorities, room for opposition and independence of the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">Harsh penalties are still being imposed, including frequent use of the death penalty. China is not the only country that sentences people to death and executes them, but it is the champion in this. The only progress that we have seen is that more care is now taken to be certain of the perpetrator’s guilt before the death penalty is carried out, so fewer people are being put to death who later turn out to be innocent.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the international focus on the three great dramas in China has to a large extent disappeared. The bloodbath in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the persecution of the supporters of the Falun Gong movement and the changing of the composition of the populations of Tibet and East Turkestan are being given less and less attention.</p>
<p class="contents">All the attention is now going to economic growth, export opportunities to China, opportunities for cheap imports from China, the growing role of China in Africa and the coming Olympic Games in China. Under these circumstances the pressure to improve the human rights situation in China is dwindling. The Olympic Games have become an argument for pulling down residential areas and driving the residents away. Chinese ambassadors say that their national honour is violated when this is criticised from abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">The coming Olympic Games could have been an occasion for improvement. As things look at the moment, they will be good for tourism and good for the completion of major public works, but not good for improving human rights. In the Netherlands, meanwhile, a debate has started about the possibility of boycotting these Olympic Games.</p>
<p class="contents">A resolution about a single arrested human rights activist, Hu Jia, is necessary but it is not enough. The most important factor in the relations between Europe and China should not be economic self-interest but our concern about human rights in China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, it is not only the Chinese who are constantly being persecuted in that country. The persecution of the Tibetan people and other national minorities has often been raised in this House. We are today referring to the illegal detention and persecution of an activist in the cause of freedom, a person who is fighting for freedom in China, namely the politician Hu Jia. His wife and family have shared his fate.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I can remember when the Olympic Games hosted by the Soviet Union were boycotted several decades ago. That action contributed to the fall of the Communist regime. We cannot now allow ourselves to be dazzled by China's economic success. Congratulations are due to China on the latter, but we must not turn a blind eye to the persecution of so many people and the violation of their fundamental rights. As I mentioned earlier, it is not only the Chinese who are affected, but also other residents of what is known as China. After all, Tibet, whose cause has repeatedly been raised in this House, is not China. I appeal for a boycott of the Olympic Games. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The hope that the IOC decision would help improve things in the Middle Kingdom has been an illusion.</p>
<p class="contents">In October and November 2007 the State Security Services abducted and maltreated the attorneys Gao Zhisheng and Li Heping. At the end of December they imprisoned the human rights activist and cyber dissident Hu Jia on the charge that he had used the Internet to incite subversion of State power.</p>
<p class="contents">On 10 October Hu Jia took part in a press conference on human rights, which was held at the European Parliament in Brussels. He was linked to us live from China by telephone. We must thank him for this courageous act. Last year he and his wife Zeng Jinyan were nominated by the European Parliament for the Sakharov Prize. In his Internet blog he reports on political prisoners and on the victims of land confiscations for the forthcoming Olympics.</p>
<p class="contents">In a letter he thanked Chancellor Angela Merkel for having received the Dalai Lama. This clearly was too much for official China. In an open letter some 57 Chinese intellectuals called for the release of Hu Jia. Our President, Hans-Gert Pöttering, endorsed this. It is a slap in the face when human rights activists are arrested, especially because of their contact with the European Parliament. We have to use all diplomatic means at our disposal to ensure that he is released from prison immediately.</p>

We felt that the host country would be moved to put an end to widespread violations of human rights and increase the scope of fundamental freedoms on its territory. I agree with Mr Mann that with 7 months to go before the Games open, all those hopes have proved in vain. The opposite is actually the case: the rule of terror in China has intensified.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights defenders like Hu Jia and his wife are imprisoned and held illegally without trial in unknown locations, harassed, terrorised and denied the right of defence. The Chinese authorities are sending out a different signal to the world, indicating that there is no democracy or openness in their country. At the same time, the Chinese Olympic Committee has determined that the Games' main slogan will be 'One world, one dream'. They maintain that this dream consists of a common aspiration to flourish and live in peace. One is left wondering what kind of peace the Chinese have in mind and whether they really understand what the Olympic Games are all about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In recent months, however, the Chinese authorities have been allowing themselves to violate freedom of expression more frequently than usual. They have also repressed journalists and activists. The arrest of Hu Jia, a leading human rights activist who was nominated for the Sakharov Prize in 2007 sent shock waves through society. Hu Jia was arrested on the pretext that he had been inciting others to overthrow the national government. He is still being denied the right to a lawyer and to medical care.</p>
<p class="contents">China must be forced to comply with international standards in human rights and to respect those rights. It must also put an end to exploitation of the Games as an excuse for the illegal detention of journalists and dissidents. We should remind the Chinese authorities of the idea inspiring the Olympic movement, namely linking sport with a vision of a peaceful society and the preservation of human dignity. At the same time we should call for the immediate release of Hu Jia and of all the other activists detained without trial, so that they can return to their families and access essential medical care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If so, I wished to state briefly that when in China one cannot detect any obvious signs of how the control system operates, but it does. The citizens feel strongly bound up in the oppressive regime imposed by the system. We believe we are called to make the rest of the world aware of the situation, as other Members have already stated. That is the only weapon at our disposal. We can respect the economic development achieved in China, but hardly anywhere else in the world have people become so permeated by fear and self-censorship. I am therefore full of admiration for those courageous individuals in China who are brave enough to risk their careers, their freedom and their very lives to draw attention to the situation. It is our moral duty to stand shoulder to shoulder with them. There is no other solution, no other way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission was, therefore, all the more concerned to learn about Mr Hu Jia’s arbitrary detention and recalls that he has been subjected to repeated acts of harassment in the past due to human rights activities.</p>
<p class="contents">We also express our concern for Mr Hu Jia’s health. He suffers from hepatitis B and must take daily medication. It is not clear whether daily access to the medical treatment he needs is guaranteed and whether he can count on doctors’ assistance during his detention in the Beijing Municipal Detention Centre in Dougezhuang.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission’s view, the detention of Mr Hu Jia places an obligation on the EU to act in a firm manner because of the clear inference that he was arrested as a consequence of speaking freely and honestly about the repression of human rights defenders via a telephone link to a meeting of the European Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights in November 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">As such, it has echoes of the case of Cao Dong, a Falun Gong petitioner, who was arrested and is still in prison after meeting the Vice-President of the European Parliament in Beijing in May 2006. The detention of Mr Hu Jia also calls for a reaction from the EU as an international actor for the protection of human rights defenders. Yesterday the EU troika carried out a firm démarche to the Chinese authorities asking for his immediate release. We sincerely hope that the Chinese authorities will understand that the issue of human rights defenders has an important impact on China’s standing with the European public and will act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reassure this Chamber that the EU will monitor very closely the evolution of Mr Hu Jia’s case.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to use this opportunity to urge again the Chinese Government to permit expressions of all forms of opinion. This is an important factor in how the international public views China, especially this year, when the eyes of the world will be on China in the build-up to the Olympic Games. We are convinced that a far more stable society can be achieved by allowing freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by saying that the Commission will intensify its efforts to seek an improvement of the overall human rights situation in China. In this respect, we will continue to play an instrumental role within the troika in preparing the EU-China human rights dialogue and seminar so that discussions continue to become more target-focussed.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the slow progress in the human rights situation in China, we firmly believe that the EU-China human rights dialogue remains one of the most effective ways of engaging China in frank and detailed discussions with a view to achieving human rights reforms on the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is no minor issue that Articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provide that rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation or any other form of sexual violence are to be treated as crimes against humanity and war crimes, and will equal, in terms of treatment and persecution, torture or serious war crimes, whether or not they are committed during an armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo shows to what extent this issue merits much more attention than has been paid to date. There have been tens of thousands of reports of rape or sexual assault annually in the region. Many of these incidents, moreover, take place at camps for displaced persons or refugees, and are frequently perpetrated by government troops, rebel groups or other forces.</p>
<p class="contents">I thus consider it extremely important that this Parliament not only condemn these practices, but that it urge the authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to put an immediate stop to these practices, investigate, bring them to trial and secure convictions, and guarantee protection for the victims, witnesses and family members.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remind our own institutions that United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 emphasises the responsibility of Member States to put an end to impunity, and pursue those responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes, including crimes relating to sexual violence or other kinds of specific violence against women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Democratic Republic of Congo, an enormous territory with a multitude of racial groups, was not given the opportunity to grow into independence by gradually building up self-rule during the Belgian colonisation before 1960. There was no preparation for decolonisation: it suddenly became inevitable after England and France had granted independence to their smaller neighbouring colonies at the end of the 1950s, partly as a consequence of the wars of liberation in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Kenya.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then the Congo has been a permanent war zone. The early years were dominated by the conflict between Kasavubu from the west, Lumumba from the north-east and Tshombe in the south-east. They each represented different ideologies and interests but, more importantly, they were popular with limited sections of the Congolese population.</p>
<p class="contents">The harsh military dictatorship of the profiteer Mobutu kept the country united for years in apparent peace, but the differences were never bridged. The most recent elections also failed to produce unity or good cooperation. The country remains a conflict zone with flexible borders, where, just as in the 1960s, it is about the demarcation of ethnic territories and control of mining areas. Foreign companies have benefited from this. The conflict now seems to be about which group among this multitude of tribal groups will dominate the others. As things are now, the future of the Congo seems to be without prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">The atrocities to which the resolution refers, including the general lawlessness and frequent rape of women are all connected with this chaos. The 2006 law against sexual violence will not solve that problem, as long as the conflict continues and there are so many people without a permanent place to live.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution rightly makes reference to the role of government representatives, peace forces, aid organisations; their people should do everything they can to prevent such atrocities without becoming drawn into them themselves. Recognition of rape, forced pregnancy, sexual exploitation and other forms of sexual violence as war crimes by the European Union and the United Nations is a prerequisite, but removing the breeding ground for this violence will have to happen on the ground. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Over 650 000 people are constantly moving around the country. In just one province, Kivu, 80% of families have been displaced during the last five years, about 1 000 women a month are the victims of rape, and tens of thousands of children have become soldiers. In the Democratic Republic of Congo the passage of the armies is accompanied by all possible kinds of crime against the civilian population, such as rape, murder and pillage. Sexual violence is used to terrorise and punish the inhabitants of the Democratic Republic of Congo who supported the wrong side in the conflict. It is so widespread that, according to <span class="italic">Médecins sans Frontières</span>, 75% of all rapes in the world take place in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Rape is accompanied by barbaric torture such as beating with clubs and mutilation with knives. Many young women have been forced into sexual slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">We should recall that the largest UN peacekeeping force in the world, consisting of over 17 000 soldiers, is currently deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo. What is the main method of preventing sexual violence? It is slogans on walls stating that rape is inhuman. The most alarming fact is that the UN soldiers themselves have become involved in this scandal. On more than one occasion, UN investigators have discovered that UN soldiers themselves have forced Congolese girls into prostitution. It has proved simply impossible to punish the soldiers concerned, however, because their unit leaders did all they could to impede the prosecution. The soldiers have perpetrated violence instead of protecting against it on more than one occasion, and these occasions are becoming more numerous. This can only be defined as a scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to appeal to the international community to support immediate determined action aimed at identifying and punishing those responsible for crimes of a sexual nature. I should also like to emphasise that the countries sending military units into the field under the auspices of the UN are responsible for carrying out a proper investigation of any allegations of criminal behaviour by personnel involved in peacekeeping missions.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that the European Union's options regarding the resolution of conflicts of this type are limited. Nonetheless, I call for funds to be made available for the organisation of a peace conference in Kivu. European Union aid should also be channelled towards the provision of medical, legal and social assistance to all victims of sexual crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust the European Union and the UN will formally recognise that all types of crime of a sexual nature are crimes against humanity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our fellow Members have described what is going on there, and I do not intend to repeat it. We must not merely agree to condemn it, since this could make us a voice crying in the wilderness: we have to do something to stop it, and what we can do is put pressure on the Congolese Government, because it is not just the rebels, but also its armed forces, who are carrying out these kinds of atrocities, aimed at humiliating women and undermining the moral foundations of the society in which they live.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make the United Nations and the European Union declare sexual violence a crime against humanity. We must ask the Commission to allocate development assistance funds to the Congo, fundamentally and as a priority as assistance for the victims: legal assistance, social assistance and medical assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make United Nations personnel on the ground consider defence of the victims and the search for those responsible priority tasks, and to do so we must extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to constitute a more direct link to the prevention of such occurrences.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to tell the House the story of Lumo. She was the victim of a mass rape in 1994. The attack was so brutal that this young woman sustained permanent internal injures. After years of treatment and four operations she has still not regained her health and will probably never fully recover. She has been rejected by her fiancé, by most of her family and by society. Her mother and the African charitable organisation HEAL Africa have been her only support. HEAL Africa runs a hospital in Goma, which is the rape capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The hospital specialises in treating the victims of brutal cases of sexual violence. The surgeons have been very successful, and so-called mothers provide psychological support for the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The House should commend these people on their work, but commendation alone is not enough. We need to consider how we can provide them with practical assistance. We owe it to Lumo and to the thousands of her Congolese sisters to help.</p>

We are also calling for pressure to be put on the Congolese Government to bring an end to the situation in which these crimes are being committed with impunity. These measures are needed to improve the appalling situation in which hundreds of thousands of women find themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The violence being suffered by women in the Democratic Republic of Congo is unimaginable. In the province of Kivu more than one third of all women have been subjected to rape, and many have been violated repeatedly over long periods. This has been going on for many years. Most of the perpetrators are soldiers from both sides, members of the Congolese security forces and the police. The UN special rapporteur on violence against women submitted her report last September.</p>
<p class="contents">The atrocities being committed by armed troops are of unimaginable brutality and are designed to ensure the complete physical and psychological destruction of women. The trauma of rape is aggravated by the fact that many of the victims then suffer social discrimination and ostracism by their families and communities. This is one of the reasons why only a fraction of the rapes actually committed are being reported.</p>
<p class="contents">Echoing what my colleague Mr Fontelles has just said, we therefore want to see the UN mandate extended to include the protection of civilians against sexual violence. Reports of sexual misconduct by members of the UN peacekeeping mission must be looked into in greater depth and those responsible must be brought before a court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Goma Conference on peace, security and development opened a few days ago. We urgently call on all the participants to tackle the problem of sexual violence against women and girls, to undertake to bring those responsible before a court and to end the current situation in which these acts can be committed with impunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The brutal rapes are now being used by each of the warring factions in eastern Congo, whether they are local tribal militia or national army soldiers, as a symbol or power and as a means of intimidation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely the weakest in society, namely women, children and even babies, who are being barbarously abused, deliberately injured, mutilated, infected with HIV and other infectious diseases and even killed. We know, and have heard, that the level of brutality exceeds the powers of human imagination and we now urgently need to see rape being condemned at long last as a crime against humanity, as a war crime and as a form of torture. Moreover, when the rape victims return traumatised and alone to their villages after painful operations – with many of the women losing all their genital organs – they find little or no shelter there.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore only support the remarks made by Mr Borrell and Mrs Scheele: we must also use European money to set up women’s dormitories that can serve as a kind of refuge for those returning from their stay in hospital, and where they can then try to build a new life. Indeed, in addition to the physical violence endured, the psychological violence that the victims have suffered is terrible beyond measure.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that most of these attacks have been carried out by rebels, but almost one fifth of the recorded incidents can be attributed to government troops and police, and it is indeed shameful that not a single culprit has yet been arrested or even charged. The time for empty talk is therefore past. We need political action from the UN and the European Union, for if we …</p>

I therefore support Mr Borrell’s statement that the funds and resources we have available should be directed to re-educating these young people, amongst other purposes. If these youngsters become set in their present ways, the only future they can look forward to is a life in gangs, committing rape and murder. Something has to be done with them.

<p class="contents">In the prevailing climate of violence and insecurity all the armed groups present in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, including elements of the national armed forces, are to some extent involved in the dramatic rise of these types of acts. In this context, it is important to promote the fight against impunity, but also to address the root causes of the problem. It ought to be noted that sexual violence in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo is embedded within the context of persistent conflict and violence in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace is needed for sustained security and stability, the two key elements linked to the prevalence of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This is why the Commission, together with the EU Member States, has been continuously promoting a political solution for the crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">The ongoing conference on peace, security and development in the Kivus, coupled with the recent agreement reached between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda in Nairobi in November 2007, could indeed represent a significant step forward in the process, while acknowledging that there are still many challenges ahead before a sustainable peace in the Kivus can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these efforts are not enough and have to be complemented with active support to strengthen the capacity of the state in providing protection to its people. In this regard, the Commission works together with the Member States in strengthening the rule of law and the fight against impunity by supporting the security sector reform comprising the army, the police and the justice sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reflect on some of the questions from Members and try to answer them. The Commission addresses, in particular, the problem of sexual violence and criminality through a multi-donor justice and rehabilitation project in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, focusing <span class="italic">inter alia</span> on building the capacity of judicial actors and reinforcing the provision of legal assistance to the victims of sexual violence.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Commission provides significant humanitarian assistance – roughly EUR 40 million per year – to the Democratic Republic of Congo, especially to Uturi and the Kivus. Our humanitarian and health programmes take into consideration the gender violence they mentioned, both from a creative and awareness-raising perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must take into account the fact that we had the opportunity to observe the willingness of Egypt’s Foreign Minister who came on purpose to the European Parliament, to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and who was ready to answer all the questions on human rights’ infringements that were put to him. I was there and I put these questions to him and obtained some answers from the Minister.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to certain negative factors, this motion for a resolution also highlights certain positive factors that I feel are important to stress, such as the undertaking to lift the state of emergency this year, in fact within the next few months, and the cooperation in the fight to end the arms smuggling in Gaza. However, in my opinion, the fundamental point is that we should take advantage of the willingness of the Egyptian authorities and encourage them to rectify certain serious infringements. I must highlight in this respect the continued imprisonment of the former candidate for the Presidency of the Republic of Egypt. I would repeat the call for this situation to be brought to an end as this would be coherent with the basic principles of a country that defends human rights, as Egypt has repeatedly advocated and to which it is committed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The young military men Nasser and Naguib, who overthrew the poorly performing regime of King Farouk over 50 years ago, brought hope for change and progress. Nasser gave his people pride and inspiration for the future; he was to put an end to their status as a backward and humiliated country. His successor, Sadat, gave them hope of permanent peace with their neighbour Israel, after a series of terrible wars.</p>
<p class="contents">The current president, Mr Mubarak, does not offer any hope at all. He has become the symbol of the stagnation. His only service has been to organise stability with a hard hand, so that he can be seen in the outside world as an ally against terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism. However, he has no progress and no democratisation to offer. Oppositions are permitted selectively, but they do not have the normal latitude that is customary in a parliamentary democracy. Consequently, he is cultivating a breeding ground for internal conflict from both fundamentalists and democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">Intolerance of religious minorities, including the large Coptic Christian minority who have been present in Egypt for centuries, is also on the increase. Long-term stability cannot be built on these foundations, where problems are not solved but covered up with violence. There is every reason for this critical resolution therefore.</p>
<p class="contents">Sabotage of non-governmental organisations, intimidation of opponents, discrimination against minorities, arrests and torture and all the other failings on record lead us to fear the worst for what will follow the Mubarak regime. Egypt seems in many respects to have stepped back into the backwardness of the reign of King Farouk, 60 years ago. European relations with Egypt ought to contribute to bringing this situation to an end as far as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Repression on the grounds of religious belief, arrests and prolonged detention without proper trial are being resorted to ever more frequently.</p>
<p class="contents">Organisations like Amnesty International, which monitor respect for human rights, have drawn attention to the international community’s indifference towards the situation.

It is the cradle of ancient civilisation and it is the most important Arab state. Nobody in the European Union or in this Parliament doubts that Egypt is not only a key partner of the European Union, but also a dynamic partner, prepared and strong. These are the reasons why we consider a dialogue with this country very important and significant. New negotiations are starting next week on an action plan between the European Union and the Arab Republic of Egypt. It is good that our Parliament is unanimously and clearly expressing its support of these negotiations and that it is thus a player in international politics. We are stating clearly that a country that allows severe interference in the independence of an old democratic institution, i.e. the courts, that permits torture in prison and the killing of immigrants, that violates freedom of speech, blocks the Internet and sends members of parliament, such as the nephew of President Sadat, to a court martial, cannot be a partner of the European Union. Egypt is a key ally in the fight against terrorism, and it must remain a key ally notably in our struggle against the causes of terrorism and Islamic radicalisation. For that very reason, Egypt cannot act the way it did when it prohibited the registration of non-governmental organisations, it must not destroy freedom of speech and it must in particular defend the long-standing rule of law that has always existed in Egypt. We believe that Egypt can succeed in doing this and we believe, in particular, that our resolution will help the European Commission to establish a high-quality action plan with Egypt. Thank you for your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This speech could be taken as a policy document for the Year of Intercultural Dialogue that has just begun. It was one of the greatest speeches ever made here in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Down through the years President Mubarak too has been an important and reliable partner for the European Union, and this is of course in spite of the many failings and mistakes that we have seen in Egypt. I therefore simply cannot understand the speech that the President of the Egyptian Parliament made in reaction to this motion. We are simply saying in a reasonable and restrained way that we consider Egypt to be one of the most important partners in the Mediterranean area, but we are criticising by way of a number of specific points and using categorical facts that some things still have to change as Egypt moves forward towards democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This is our commitment towards our own citizens and towards the people of Egypt. I certainly believe that breaking off relations, which is now being threatened, would be completely the wrong move. We need to keep talking to one another and for this reason I support this motion for a resolution, which has been drafted in reasonable language, and call on the Egyptians not to see this as a breakdown in the dialogue but as a clear signal for a more intensive dialogue to start: that is what we are trying to achieve with Egypt by way of this motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Whilst I believe that our relations with Egypt should be maintained and developed, and that Egypt should indeed become our main partner in that part of the world, I would like to begin by pointing out that Coptic Christians are second-class citizens in that country. This is true both of those who follow the Orthodox rite and those who follow the Catholic one, and should be borne in mind when making contact with Egypt. In addition, as I have already said on repeated occasions, we should study the situation of the religious minorities in that part of the world and prepare a report on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there can be no talk of lasting peace, democracy and respect for human rights in the area in question until a solution is found to the conflict between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East.

In general, during the debates on human rights on Thursday afternoons, when I usually take the floor, we find ourselves discussing extremely serious and dangerous cases indeed. They tend to be cases of violation of human rights, murder and rape. Today, however, we can feel a certain satisfaction because in comparison to so many other cases, we are intervening in Egypt at a stage when crimes have not yet taken place, although fundamental freedoms are being infringed. There is a chance that this timely intervention will therefore be more effective and will pre-empt more serious consequences. The usual pattern is for the first stage to be restrictions on the media – in this case we are referring to the arrest of journalists – and restrictions on the right of association. We also have in mind the trade unions and persecution of religious minorities. The next stage is the criminal one.

It is following developments very closely through our delegation in Cairo, and in partnership with the Member States. It is also in regular contact with local and international NGOs dealing with human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares your concern at the apparent deterioration of the human rights situation in Egypt, and at the number of reported cases of human rights violations, particularly in relation to freedom of expression, torture and ill treatment, as well as respect for religious minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">It has called for greater political reform, and respect for human rights is an intrinsic part of the EU partnership with Egypt. The Commission is, therefore, using all the means at its disposal to encourage the Egyptian authorities to progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the UN Human Rights Council, Egypt has committed itself to upholding ‘the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights’. The EU consistently raises the importance of respecting human rights – notably on the basis of Article 2 of the Association Agreement – in its bilateral contacts with Egypt, including those at the highest level.</p>
<p class="contents">With the adoption of the joint EU-Egypt action plan, under the European neighbourhood policy, in March 2007, we now have another political tool to foster respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Egypt, based on what we understand to be shared values. The action plan provides for the establishment of a formal and regular dialogue on human rights and democracy in the context of the Subcommittee on Political Matters: Human Rights and Democracy, International and Regional Issues. That subcommittee aims to facilitate dialogue within a context of mutual understanding, and respect for the positions of both parties, on all aspects of human rights and democracy, international and regional issues, in a comprehensive and non-exclusive way. It will convene for the first time next week – 23 and 24 January 2007 – in Cairo, and will be a constructive way for Egypt to demonstrate commitment to shared values.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission firmly believes that the dialogue with Egypt within the framework of the political arrangements set out in the Association Agreement and in the ENP action plan is the most effective way to impress upon the Egyptian Government the EU’s concerns regarding respect for human rights and international law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission remains committed to contributing to Egypt’s reform process through financial and technical assistance, and support for political reform, human rights and democracy remains a priority in the national indicative programme 2007-2010, and under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.</p>

<p>As has already been said in the answer to question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0806_EN.html">H-0806/07</a> of 14 November 2007, the EU is implementing the economic policies defined by the Lisbon Strategy in order to boost employment in the EU and strengthen economic efficiency.</p>
<p>It has been shown that domestic demand in the EU, which should compensate for slow growth in some other important economic areas, has actually increased in the last few months. This was helped by significant success in employment, which should facilitate strong domestic demand in the future too.</p>
<p>In the spring the Council, within the framework of the integrated guidelines, will update the Broader Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG) for the Community and the Member States and, in accordance with Article 99(2) of the Treaty, will inform the European Parliament about its recommendation regarding BEPG. This recommendation will very clearly define measures for supporting the realisation of the Lisbon Strategy targets at Member States and EU level, including measures for stimulating consumer demand and promoting investment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0993"></a>

<p>In an attempt to reduce its dependence on the monopolistic supply of gas from Russia, the European Union has launched the Nabucco project. The project plans to connect the Caspian region, the Middle East and Europe. A pipeline would run from Iran, via Turkey, to Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary. One branch would be routed towards Austria, and another, via Slovakia to Poland. Joining Poland up to the EU’s gas networks would help solve the problem of connecting the EU gas ‘island’ of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland to the EU networks.</p>
<p>In the context of the Nabucco project, what is the Council’s view of the agreement between the Italian company Eni and the Russian company Gazprom to set up a gas export company, South Stream, that would own a gas pipeline to southern Europe, with a branch to central Europe?

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 January I part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Honourable Member, to start with I must mention that, in the guidelines for all-European energy networks, the Nabucco pipeline was granted the status of a project of European interest. It reflects the importance given to the Nabucco project by the Council and Parliament. However, the Council cannot comment on the actual agreement between Eni and Gazprom because of its private nature. It can, however, comment on the South Stream project, as can be seen in publicly available information, because, if it is realised according to plan, it will contribute to securing the diversity of energy supply lines in the European Union. In this regard the Council draws attention to the fact that the action plan Energy Policy for Europe, adopted by the European Council at the spring 2007 session, ‘underlines the need to enhance security of supply for the EU as a whole, as well as for each Member State, by means of effective diversification of energy sources and transfer routes, which will also contribute to a more competitive internal energy market’.</p>

<p>At the European Council meeting on 14 December 2007, the heads of state or government of the EU Member States agreed with the UN Secretary-General that the current situation in Kosovo was not acceptable, and they stressed that an agreement should be reached which would be of fundamental significance for the stability of the region.</p>
<p>The European Council also stressed the willingness of the EU:</p>
<p>to take over a leading role in strengthening regional stability and implementing an agreement on the future status of Kosovo;</p>
<p>to help Kosovo achieve lasting stability, including an ESDP mission (in respect of the above, the General Affairs and External Relations Council should determine the methods and the date the mission will start operating);</p>
<p>to help establish an International Civilian Office within the framework of international mediation.</p>
<p>To facilitate this, the EU sent two preparatory units to the area last year with the task of preparing the ground for a possible cooperation to resolve the Kosovo problem. The preparations are going well.</p>
<p>The unit for preparing the International Civilian Office (ICO/EUSR PT) began its operation in October 2006. Its task is to plan the next International Civilian Office, including the PPEU Office, and to prepare for the implementation of a possible agreement on the status of this region.</p>
<p>The unit for planning a possible mission in the area of a legal state (EUPT Kosovo) has been operating in Kosovo since May 2006. The planned mission within ESDP should provide mentoring, supervision and counselling in the wider area of a legal state. It should also have executive competences in some areas of police work, including the securing of public order and peace, and the judiciary and customs. The mission should employ about 1 800 international members.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1003"></a>

<p>A political dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians was established last year and culminated in meetings between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas. The EU Council praised both parties’ efforts, which resulted in the Annapolis Conference on 26 and 27 November 2007. At the meeting on 14 December 2007, the European Council stated that it fully supported the negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel which started at the Annapolis Conference and continued at the Donor Conference in Paris. The EU welcomed the participation of many Arab partners at both conferences and called on them to continue their constructive cooperation.</p>
<p>Regarding the role of the EU, especially the role of the Council, in the matter mentioned in the question by Mr Ó Neachtain, the Secretary-General/High Representative, working closely with the Commission, has prepared the ‘EU Action Strategy’, which aims to study all EU activities in order to find additional support for both parties in the current negotiations and in the implementation period to follow. At the Paris Donor Conference on 17 December 2007, the EU expressed its support for the Palestinian reform and development plan presented by President Fayyad. It has committed itself to continuing to offer the Palestinian government considerable support in the peace process initiated by the Annapolis Conference. At the meeting of the Quartet on 17 December 2007, the EU reiterated its commitment to continuing its close cooperation with, and support for, both parties in their efforts to reach a peace agreement before the end of 2008. The Quartet decided to meet regularly in 2008 in order to review progress and support both parties’ efforts. On 17 December 2007 the leaders of the Quartet also met the Arab Foreign Ministers and discussed the way forward. In cooperation with the representative of the Quartet, Tony Blair, the EU intends to reinforce its programmes that support the shaping of the institutions, good governance, contributions by civilian society and development of the Palestinian economy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1032"></a>

<p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has recently warned of the disastrous consequences of the blockade imposed by Israel for several months on the Gaza Strip, a measure compounded by tactical armed incursions.

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 January I part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>For the sake of greater clarity in this field, it is advisable to differentiate between full economic partnership agreements (EPAs) and interim agreements that are followed by an EPA decision.</p>
<p>Economic partnership agreements remain the aim of the negotiations and will have a wide regional and sectorial coverage. In view of the arrangements among the signatories, in addition to provisions on goods trading and provisions for developmental cooperation, these agreements should include services and trade-related provisions. In the opinion of the EU, such full agreements should be the most effective means of implementing the Cotonou Agreement and should guarantee maximum effectiveness in the development of EPAs. In May 2007, at the last meeting of the ACP-EC Council, both parties confirmed their commitment to EPAs. At the end of 2007 a full EPA with the CARIFORUM region was initialled, but other regions will need more time to fully and successfully complete this complex process.</p>
<p>After 31 December 2007 it was necessary to look for a solution which was compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in order to avoid obstructing trade with ACP countries which are not classified as least developed countries. In other words, the preferential trade regime of the Cotonou Agreement, approved by the WTO in accordance with the waiver, ceased to be in force after that date. Interim agreements are one such solution because they are compatible with the WTO rules. These agreements include goods trading and all other aspects on which the signatories have reached an accord, and are a interim phase that will be followed by the conclusion of full EPAs. Interim agreements that will be followed by the conclusion of EPAs were initialled by all interested ACP partners, including the majority of African countries which are not classified as least developed countries, as well as many African countries from the group of least developed countries. Such agreements, that is to say their effect on the regulations on goods trading between EU and ACP countries, have been incorporated into EU legislation through the regulation on market access.</p>
<p>Interim agreements, which do not yet have the developmental potential of full EPAs, are already an improvement on the Cotonou system and bring direct benefits to our ACP partners. Firstly, all ACP signatory countries are guaranteed full access to the EU market free of customs and quotas (transitional periods are envisaged for sugar and rice markets). Pursuant to the ‘Everything But Arms’ regulation, access is currently available only to least developed countries. Secondly, interim agreements also include more favourable rules of origin. They will enable ACP countries to take full advantage of access to the EU market. These new rules of origin are more beneficial than those offered by the ‘Everything But Arms’ system, which is why interim agreements are of interest to least developed countries as well.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1025"></a>

<p>In May 2007 the European Parliament called upon the Council and Commission to investigate Somaliland's request for independence. This northern part of Somalia already declared itself independent in 1991. Somaliland is making an effort to pursue good governance and stability. The parliamentary elections in 2005 were relatively orderly and transparent, and the region presents itself as a young and active democracy. However, there are still a few human rights problems, and the Government of Somaliland also recently blotted its copybook with regard to the protection of refugees from Somalia.</p>
<p>Has the Council considered this matter?</p>
<p>It was recently reported in the press that growing numbers of members of the Bush administration are in favour of independence for Somaliland.

Recognition of an independent Somaliland is essential for this purpose.</p>

<p>Concerning Iran’s nuclear programme, a recent report has come to public attention in which the 16 American intelligence agencies admit that, since as long ago as 2003 at least, Iran has not been seeking to develop nuclear weapons and does not pose a threat. This comes in addition to a statement made a short time previously by the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr El Baradei, to the effect that Iran had cooperated to the full with its investigations.

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 January I part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The latest assessment by US intelligence agencies does not contextually change the EU assessment of the situation. The report states that until 2003 Iran had been involved in a build-up of armaments. That in itself is a violation of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty (NPT). If Iran decides to give up and not merely temporarily suspend its efforts, it will have to disclose all its activities in this area and invite the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to confirm that development of this programme has been completely halted. There are still two other reasons for concern – uranium enrichment and the ballistic missile programme – and Iran is not complying with the IAEA Committee or the United Nations Security Council requirements.</p>
<p>Therefore, on 14 December 2007 the European Council repeated its apprehension regarding the Iranian nuclear programme and emphasised that it would be unacceptable for Iran to obtain a nuclear military capability. In that respect it expressed its regret that Iran had not fulfilled its international obligations, laid down in United Nations Security Council resolutions Nos 1696, 1737 and 1747, to stop all activities connected with uranium enrichment and uranium processing, this being a condition for establishing confidence in the fact that the development of the programme is solely for peaceful purposes. The European Council therefore invited Iran to respond fully, clearly and convincingly to all questions asked by the IAEA regarding past and present nuclear activities. The Council fully supported the work of the United Nations Security Council in adopting further measures within the framework of Chapter 7, Article 41, of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>The EU has always maintained that Iran has the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy. Iran must cease sensitive activities involving the nuclear fuel cycle until international confidence has been restored. Let me remind you that the offer made in June 2006 by the EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Affairs still stands and should enable Iran to develop a civilian nuclear programme to satisfy its needs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In Brazil the Government is planning to set up an SWF to offset the appreciation of the real, thus directly intervening in the financial market.</p>
<p>I urge the Council to defend the openness of the financial system, but at the same time demand transparency from state-controlled funds, to ensure that any investment strategies are carried out with economic and not strategic goals in mind.</p>
<p>How does the Council plan to act on the issue of SWF? There have been a number of proposals from the Commission concerning SWFs, such as European golden shares, guidelines, and transparency initiatives. Which route would the Council like to see?</p>
<p>And finally, does the Council have any plans to monitor the development of the sovereign wealth funds on the European markets?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2008 January I part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In the decisions of March 2007, the European Council agreed that one of the priority tasks of the energy policy was ‘the internal electricity and natural gas market’. The European Council adopted a number of guideline policies in this field aimed at boosting competitiveness, securing effective legal regulations and encouraging investments of benefit to consumers.</p>
<p>In September 2007 the Commission, in response to a decision by the Council, submitted five proposals for legislation. Detailed debates of these proposals led to a progress report, which received the support of the TTE Council on 3 December 2007. Principles and provisions which have wide support have been reviewed within the framework of this debate, together with issues, areas and possibilities which, in the opinion of some Member States, are in need of further discussion and additional guidance on ‘principles’.</p>
<p>The TTE Council is planning two meetings in the first half of 2008 with the aim of reaching political agreement on the total package or just part of the package. Therefore it is essential that the European Parliament submit its opinion on the package in good time before the June meeting of the TTE Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1027"></a>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>On 30 October 2007, I submitted to the Commission a question on irregularities and false advertising on websites selling airline tickets online (<a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2007-5538_EN.html">E-5538/07</a>), in which I respectfully asked whether any specific measures would be taken to prevent online advertising fraud and to protect the rights of European consumers.</p>
<p>One week later, I read in the press that the Commission was to publish the names of airline companies that practiced deception on the internet, and that it would close down their websites unless, within four months, they had resolved those irregularities, which basically relate to the failure to include airport taxes or credit card payment charges, the advertising of offers that are not actually available and unfair contractual conditions – such as the text of the contract not being available in the language of the user.</p>
<p>In this respect, can the Commission state what steps it will take, besides publishing the names of the airlines and closing down their websites, if those companies fail to conform to the law within the set time limit? Bearing in mind that it is the national or – in the case of Spain – regional governments that have competence for imposing penalties, is the Commission in a position to require that compensation be paid to any consumers affected?</p>

<p>The Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation provides a framework for a wide cooperation enabling national authorities to combine efforts, for instance in joint market surveillance and enforcement exercises and to share experience as well as best practices.</p>
<p>The Commission promotes these cooperative actions by providing EU-funding and through the coordination of joint market surveillance and enforcement activities.</p>
<p>Concerning the specific follow up of the 'sweep' on air ticket on-line sales of September 2007, the competent authorities of the Member States are at present investigating the sites and in cases of confirmed irregularities, taking appropriate follow-up actions. These may vary according to the legal framework of each Member State. The Commission's role was to coordinate Member States' 'sweep' actions and the monitoring of the follow-up.</p>

<p>The EC Treaty prohibits any discrimination by Member States based on nationality grounds (e.g. Articles 12, 43 and 49). Accordingly, the Member States may not introduce or maintain unjustified restrictions to intra-Community economic activities.</p>
<p>The practice of double pricing by traders may sometimes have valid economic justifications: e.g. in order to enter new markets or establish their position where they are already present.</p>
<p>However, unjustified double pricing such as charging tourists and locals different prices can deprive consumers of the benefits of the internal market and as such cannot be accepted.</p>
<p>In that respect, discrimination based on nationality applying to access to cultural monuments has been explicitly recognised by the Court as being prohibited under Articles 12 and 49 of the EC Treaty<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The freedom to provide services set out in Article 49 of the EC Treaty also covers the freedom for recipients of services, including tourists, to go to another Member State in order to enjoy those services under the same conditions as nationals of that Member State. The Court has confirmed that, since visiting museums is one of the determining reasons for which tourists, as recipients of services, decide to go to another Member State, there is a close link between the freedom of movement which they enjoy under the EC Treaty and museum admission conditions. The discrimination with regard to admission to museums may have an effect on the conditions under which services are provided, including the price thereof, and may therefore influence the decision of some persons to visit the country.</p>
<p>However, in the absence of any specific indication of constant practices contrary to these principles in Member States, the Commission has not had the necessity to go further into this question.</p>
<p>In the future, it will be possible to tackle discrimination against recipients of services also on the basis of the Services Directive<a href="#defann_20_2" name="refann_20_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and, in particular of its Article 20 which prohibits discrimination based on the nationality or the place of residence of recipients of services. The Services Directive will have to be implemented by Member States by end of 2009 at the latest.</p>
<p>Unjustified price discrimination may be also assessed under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which must be applicable in the Member States by 12 December 2007.</p>
<p>This Directive contains a general clause prohibiting unfair commercial practices. It can not be excluded that , at a certain moment, national courts, and ultimately the European Court of Justice, will have to evaluate whether charging higher prices from tourists in restaurants and shops on nationality grounds is in conformity with professional diligence. For the moment, the Commission would be tempted to think that this is the case.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>After the "summer of recalls" many people in Europe are asking this simple question: "what measures are in place or will be in place to ensure the highest safety standards for toys"?</p>
<p>Most of the answers can be found in the stocktaking exercise on product safety, whose results were released in November 2007.</p>
<p>The stocktaking exercise highlights the 3 key "E's" to toys and product safety in general: "Engagement", "Enforcement" and "Engineering":</p>
<p>- Engagement: Economic operators must take the full responsibilities for the products they produce and make available to consumers. Reputable businesses are making significant efforts to ensure the safety of their products. But all the actors involved must raise their game, because there is still a significant stream of unsafe toys circulating in Europe. Industry has agreed to work with the Commission over the next months on a number of measures to rebuild the confidence of consumers, including a "Safety Pact" and a thorough evaluation of measures adopted by business in the toys supply chain. This evaluation will be completed in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
<p>- Enforcement: Market surveillance authorities in the Member States have dug deep over the last months, but the stocktaking exercise has identified that there is still scope for improvement. The Commission is assisting the Member States' market surveillance authorities to identify and share best practices towards more targeted and risk-based controls. Traceability of products will be reinforced: the Commission has already included in the proposed Package on the Internal Market for Goods a provision requiring economic operators to have available the identity of their supplier and thus ensure the transparency and continuity of the supply chain. Peer pressure will be put on the national authorities, since the Commission intends to publish comparative enforcement capacity data in the Consumer Scoreboard in 2008. The market surveillance capacity of the Member States will be also strengthened, since the Commission will continue financing well-designed joint market surveillance projects (in 2007, €1,3 million Community funding). In addition to these actions to improve protection within the EU, various actions are underway to strengthen protection at borders. Recent major changes to the EU Customs legislation will assist in identifying high risk consignments for controls. Secure Customs exchange mechanisms will also enable rapid action to be taken when information becomes available on new types of dangerous products. These mechanisms are used to distribute relevant information available in the Rapid Exchange System for dangerous goods (RAPEX) system in order to alert the competent Customs authorities of specific, potentially dangerous cargo. On the international scene, co-operation with our major trading partners, the US and China, will be deepened and expanded. With China, in particular, the existing co-operation has already yielded tangible results in terms of controls and measures taken against unsafe products of Chinese origin found in Europe. Next to this, the Commission is assisting the Chinese authorities in setting up a domestic alarm system, similar to the European RAPEX, to better track substandard and dangerous products, especially toys.</p>
<p>- Engineering: Toys must be born safe. Safety is not an "add-on" or an optional, but should be built in the toy, since the very early stages of its production process. For this we need clear rules of law that set stringent safety requirements. In this respect, the forthcoming Commission's proposal for revising the Toys Directive contains reinforced safety prescriptions to address physical, mechanical and chemical risks in toys. The Commission is also preparing a temporary measure to require warnings on magnetic toys, pending the revision of the relevant standard to address the risks that these toys could pose.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0992"></a>

<p>The European Court of Justice has issued its judgments in the Viking Line and Laval cases. Commissioner McCreevy strongly supported the view of the employers’ side, particularly in the Viking Line case.</p>

<p>In the Viking Line case, a British Court referred several questions to the European Court of Justice about the impact of Article 43 of the EC Treaty, on freedom of establishment, on trade union actions while the Laval case was about the interpretation of the Posting of Workers' Directive and also Article 49 of the EC Treaty on the freedom to provide services.</p>
<p>Although the cases are different, the European Court of Justice has provided, in both cases, some clarifications on the issue referred to by the Honourable Member. Most importantly, the Court has ruled that the right to take industrial action must be recognised as a fundamental right which forms an integral part of the general principles of Community law.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Court has clearly stated that this does not mean that this right to take industrial action falls outside the scope of Community law, or in other words, that it renders Community law inapplicable. The exercise of this right may be subject to certain limitations. This very much reflects the situation in national legal orders: both in Finland and in Sweden, as in other Member States, where this right enjoys constitutional protection, it may not be exercised without any limitation.</p>
<p>Taking into account the Court's rulings, workers and employers will continue to have the right to take action to defend their interests, including sympathetic strike actions on the workers' side. However, when taking action against undertakings established in another Member State which post workers on their territory, or against an undertaking wanting to establish in another Member State, they will have to respect Community law.</p>
<p>In other words, when collective action restricts the freedom of establishment or the free movement of services, it needs to be justified by a legitimate aim, compatible with the Treaty; furthermore it has to be appropriate to attain such an aim and be proportionate. The Court has provided useful guidance and the Commission is convinced that the social partners will continue to be able to defend their rights and will do so in a fully responsible manner.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1023"></a>

<p>The Commission would like to thank the Parliament for the interest it takes in the ongoing efforts at reforming private copying levies.</p>
<p>The current levy systems are, as we all know, both complex and controversial. Not alone are there huge differences in rates applying to the same or similar equipment used for private copying – there is no uniformity among Member States in setting levies for identical digital equipment. The result is a huge array of different levies imposed on the same products across Europe – with differences in levies of up to 1500% applied to identical products.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Commission is studying how private copying levies affect both the Internal Market and the livelihood of authors and performers. Culture and cultural diversity are, as you know, the core objectives behind all initiatives the Commission pursues in the field of copyright. The policy follows the double objective of making sure that levy-based schemes have little or no negative effect on the Internal Market for digital equipment and blank media carriers while ensuring that creators suffer no economic harm from the widespread practice of private home copying.</p>
<p>Consumers do not like restrictions on how and when they consume copyright-protected material. As a poll published by the Spanish newspaper El País on 20 December 2007 indicates 94% of the respondents support the elimination of private copying levies.</p>
<p>A reasonable compromise between consumers liberty and artists compensation for private copying has to be found. Any reform of this sensitive issue has to be approached with diligence and the utmost care.</p>
<p>Until we see the issues clearer, it is not productive to speculate as to the form of future action.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1031"></a>

<p>I would like to draw attention to a problem that has arisen following the adoption of Directive 2005/36/EC<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In the Directive, legislators did not distinguish between the work of tour leaders in charge of tourist groups on trips and that of guides. A guide’s duties involve not only the successful organisation of trips but also the provision of factual information about the history, traditions and value of works of art or historical buildings. For this reason, guides also take specialised courses, at the end of which they are assessed by examination, prior to entering the occupation. The high level of courses and examinations ensures that a good quality of service is provided. It should be noted that in many European Union Member States, including Poland, the profession of guide is regulated. Documents attesting to the completion of courses and training are required to obtain qualifications. Equating tour leaders with guides will reduce the quality of the services provided for tourists. In order to prevent this from happening, an examination system should be introduced throughout Europe that will certify guides’ proficiency.</p>
<p>Does the Commission envisage developing a system of courses and examinations for guides throughout Europe, the substance and organisation of which would be adapted accordingly by the individual Member States?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission does not envisage developing an EU wide system of courses and examinations for tourist guides.</p>
<p>Within the limits set by the EC Treaty, Member States are free to regulate the access to and the exercise of professions, therefore also for the tourist guide and the tour escort profession. Any proposal for a legislative instrument at EU level by which education and training requirements for either of the professions would be harmonised requires under the current Treaty a vote of unanimity by all EU Member States. Until today the Commission has not received convincing evidence of problems in relation to the cross-border provision of tourist guide services which would justify the adoption of a proposal for a Directive harmonising this profession.</p>
<p>The Commission is informed and in favour of non-legislative initiatives at European level such as the works for a CEN<a href="#defann_25_2" name="refann_25_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> standard introducing basic requirements on qualification schemes for tourist guides (EN 15565) which was carried out by the European committee for standardization and has been approved on 1<span class="sup">st</span> January 2008.

<p>Sovereign wealth funds (SWF) are a new type of investment vehicle, with the very significant difference that they are owned by states, and often by undemocratic ones. New, more active investment strategies have caused concern in some Member States, especially when investing in companies seen as being of national strategic importance.</p>

<p>The Commission is fully committed to defending the openness of the financial system in Europe. Besides, the Commission fully concurs with the principle that investment should take place on the basis of economic rather than political or other strategic criteria. The Commission notes the concerns that have been expressed about sovereign wealth fund recently but also wishes to stress that a number of such funds have been operating for decades providing the EU economy with valuable investment. The Commission also urges third countries to offer proportionate level of openness to EU investors.</p>
<p>The Commission holds the question under close review. At this stage, it does not favour the option of producing new legislative instruments, but there are good reasons to develop a common approach within the EU to present a coordinated position in the Single Market with regards to the activities of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs). Some guidelines to increase the transparency and governance of SWFs might be required. Last October 2007, the G7 asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to study the possibility of transparency guidelines or a code of conduct for Sovereign Wealth Funds and recipient countries. In the Transatlantic Economic Council last 9<span class="sup">th</span> November 2007, the Commission had the opportunity to exchange views on these matters with the United States (US) administration and concurred with it on the utility of having these rules developed at an international level.</p>
<p>In summary, the Commission is working internally and in international fora to develop suitable and effective instruments that can dispel the concerns that the activities of these investors may raise. It intends to develop a common EU position on this that preserves the fundamental freedoms set out in the Treaty. Member State initiatives in the area of Sovereign Wealth Funds must also be assessed in this context. It is in this context that monitoring the activities of SWFs becomes particularly important. The Commission monitors developments closely and in cooperation with international organisations (OECD, IMF). Separately, the US-EU Investment dialogue and the Financial Services Regulatory dialogue offer the Commission an opportunity to review SWFs matters in close cooperation with the US Treasury and other US departments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1038"></a>

<p>Significant progress has been made in delivering a Single Market for retail financial services. However, retail financial services integration has not yet reached its full potential and competition in some markets is insufficient, particularly in areas like payments and retail banking. This leaves EU consumers unable to take full advantage of the benefits of the Single Market. Against this background and in the context of the Single Market Review, the Commission adopted a Green Paper on Retail Financial Services in the Single Market<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Green Paper built on the Commission's White Paper on Financial Services 2005–2010<a href="#defann_27_2" name="refann_27_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the results of the Commission's sector inquiry into retail banking<a href="#defann_27_3" name="refann_27_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and the interim report on business insurance<a href="#defann_27_4" name="refann_27_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. It also set out the Commission's overarching objective to develop integration in EU retail financial services markets by: ensuring that properly regulated open markets and strong competition deliver products that meet consumers' needs; enhancing consumer confidence by ensuring that consumers are properly protected and that providers are financially sound and trustworthy; empowering consumers to make the right decisions for their financial circumstances through improved financial literacy, clear, appropriate and timely information and high-quality advice. The publication of the Green Paper launched a public consultation on the Commission's retail financial services strategy which received almost 190 responses. The public hearing held on 19 September 2007 was also well attended with over 300 participants.</p>
<p>On 20 November 2007, alongside the Commission Communication on a Single Market for 21<span class="sup">st</span> Century Europe<a href="#defann_27_5" name="refann_27_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, a Staff Working Paper on Initiatives in the area of retail financial services<a href="#defann_27_6" name="refann_27_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> was published. It proposes a number of targeted initiatives designed to: improve customer choice and mobility, in particular for bank accounts, a financial product used by the vast majority of European citizens; help retail insurance markets work better, for instance by designing a "scoreboard " for car insurance premiums in Europe; investigate the need for a more coherent approach to product disclosures and distribution requirements for retail investment products (such as investment funds, unit-linked life insurance, etc.); and promote financial education, financial inclusion (e.g. access for all to a basic bank account) and adequate redress for consumers.</p>
<p>The Commission seeks to bring concrete benefits to European consumers in terms of lower prices and wider choice by improving the competitiveness and efficiency of retail financial services markets. For these reasons, the Commission strongly supports the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project, a banking industry initiative to create an integrated and more competitive market for euro payments which is planned to become fully operational by the end of 2010. The Payment Services Directive, which must be implemented into national law by November 2009, should also generate more competition in the provision of payments services and thus lead to lower prices. It also includes provisions improving transparency and enabling the free termination of framework contracts after a period of 12 months which will facilitate customer mobility and promote competition.</p>
<p>Referring to the specific issue of bank accounts, as part of the Single Market Review package, the Commission announced its policy plans to facilitate customer mobility in relation to bank accounts thereby also promoting competition and efficiency. The Commission will encourage the development by industry, by mid-2008, of a Code of Conduct, which would contain a switching service, to be made available to customers within each EU Member State, which should make the switching process from one bank account to another easier. The Commission has also made clear to industry that there should be no discrimination against customers on the basis of nationality or residence when opening bank accounts cross-border. It should be easy for customers to open bank accounts in other Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Following the second reading by the Budgetary Committee, an amendment was voted by the Parliament whereby an additional €30 million were added to the budget of the Frontex Agency in 2008. Most of the amount will be for operational expenditure of the Agency.</p>
<p>This amendment represents an increase of 79% when compared to the original Preliminary Draft Budget. This increase results in a total EC subsidy of €68 million, therefore considerably strengthening the Agency's financial resources and thereby contributing to enhancing its capacity to implement its tasks in relation to illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Frontex has adapted its work programme for 2008 on the basis of the increased budget. The revised work programme foresees a substantial increase in the duration of joint operations at those sections of the external borders most exposed to irregular migratory pressure.</p>
<p>On this basis the Commission is confident that the impact of operations coordinated by Frontex will be substantially enhanced compared to 2007.</p>

<p>Small and medium sized firms (SMEs) indeed play a significant role in the European economy providing two-thirds of total private employment. Consequently they are key players to achieve the targets set in the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs.</p>
<p>The Commission has been active for many years promoting entrepreneurship and improving the business environment for SMEs, in particular for small enterprises which constitute 90 % of SMEs. In 2000 the European Council has endorsed the Charter for Small Enterprises, aiming at improving their business environment. The Charter is today the reference frame for 44 countries and several regions.</p>
<p>Since the adoption of the Modern Small and Medum Enterprise (SME) policy in November 2005 the Commission follows closely actions in five key areas: promoting entrepreneurship, reducing administrative burdens, supporting SMEs’ access to markets, supporting SMEs’ growth and reinforcing the dialogue with SME stakeholders. The Mid-term review, adopted in October 2007, has shown that the SME dimension is increasingly taken into account in the community programmes and policies. However, this does not go far enough yet, and the Commission has decided to put SMEs even higher on the political agenda when, based on its assessment of the first 3-year cycle of the reviewed growth &amp; jobs strategy, it announced the adoption of the “Small Business Act” for Europe for 2008. Preparation of this new initiative is ongoing and an extensive consultation will take place in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Some of the measures undertaken by the Commission specifically aim at helping SMEs to benefit from the possibilities offered by the internal market. Improving their access to the public procurement market is one example. The Commission is currently conducting an impact assessment to prepare the proposal for a European Private Company Statute (2008) to facilitate cross-border operations for SMEs. The Commission has also been helping small enterprises since 20 years via a support network, which will be strengthened in 2008 to further raise awareness on EU policies and programmes and to advise, mentor and listen to SMEs.</p>
<p>Concerning the costs for SMEs to apply European legislation, small enterprises spend relatively up to 10 times more to meet the administrative requirements than large enterprises<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. For this reason the Commission is committed to simplifying the administrative burdens and considers the better regulation process one of its key priorities. It envisages cutting administrative burdens of Community origin by 25% by 2012 and also encourages Member States to actively contribute to this process. Through the “Think Small First” principle SME specific provisions are introduced in new proposals whenever appropriate, for instance in simplified reporting requirements, for instance for smaller food companies in the field of hygiene.</p>
<p>The application of standards and EU legislation is another difficulty for SMEs. That is why the Commission will substantially increase its support to better involve SMEs in the European and national standardisation processes, to facilitate their access to standards and further offers assistance to SMEs a community assistance programme in the field of EU environmental legislation.</p>
<p>As far as family businesses are concerned, most small firms are family businesses and are targeted by the initiatives in favour of small businesses. However, the Commission is currently analysing potential specific difficulties they may be confronted with.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

If aid to ACP countries were incorporated into the EU budget, this would enhance the legitimacy of this aid. It would also make it possible to ensure genuine transparency and greater efficiency, which is a major concern in development cooperation.</p>

<p>For a considerable time now the Commission has been calling for the incorporation of the financing of geographical cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific states (ACP) into the Community budget. This request is based on the grounds of efficiency and harmonisation of Community development assistance instruments, and on the coherence and political visibility of our external activities in the field of development.</p>
<p>During the preparations for the period after the 9<span class="sup">th</span> European Development Fund (EDF), the Commission had drawn up a detailed outline of its position in the communication entitled ‘Towards the full integration of cooperation with ACP countries in the EU budget’<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The meeting of the European Council on 15-16 December 2005 finally opted (para. 70) to keep the financing of geographical cooperation with ACP countries within the EDF intergovernmental framework. It also established the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF period, aligning it with the timescale of the financial perspective (2013), and the level of contribution of each Member State to the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF. These contributions are generally midway between the contributions to the 9<span class="sup">th</span> EDF and the Member States’ contributions to the Community budget.</p>
<p>The Commission firmly intends to raise the matter of EDF budgeting again whenever appropriate:</p>
<p>at the December 2005 European Council the Commission was invited to submit a review of the budget in 2008-2009. The Commission hopes to resume the debate on incorporation of the EDF into the budget within this context, particularly in the light of the reform of the Treaty adopted by the European Council in December 2007, which, in the area of external activities, extends the codecision procedure to the entire Community budget and strengthens the role of Parliament;</p>
<p>Article 1(10) of the Internal Agreement on the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> stipulates that in 2010 the Commission will prepare a performance review, which will contribute to a decision on the amount of financial cooperation after 2013. A parallel discussion shall run within the framework of the debate arising from the Green Paper on relations between the European Union and the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) and the review of the Association Agreement with the OCTs required for 2011.</p>
<p>The Commission feels that much progress has already been made in terms of facilitating a decision on the incorporation of the EDF into the budget and will continue to pursue this objective within the framework of the period following the 10<span class="sup">th</span> EDF.

<p>The Commission has received letters from several British nationals residing in France who have been informed by the relevant French authorities that they will not be able to continue benefiting from the universal sickness coverage (couverture maladie universelle, CMU) on the basis of the corresponding contribution.</p>
<p>According to the information available to the Commission, the CMU introduced by Law 99-641 of 27 July 1999, guarantees membership of the general sickness insurance scheme for all stable and regular residents who do not have sickness insurance cover under a basic scheme. Consequently, under the law all persons residing in France in a stable and regular manner, whatever their nationality, must join the CMU if they are not covered by any other legal sickness insurance regime in France or another country.</p>
<p>Directive 2004/38/CE provides that the right of residence of non active Union citizens is subject to the condition that they have sufficient resources not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State during their period of residence and have comprehensive sickness insurance cover. The Directive also provides that once the Union citizen has acquired the right of permanent residence normally after five years of legal and continuous residence, this right is no longer submitted to the abovementioned conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, Article 24 of the Directive provides that subject to such specific provisions as are expressly provided in the Treaty and secondary law, all Union citizens residing on the basis of the Directive in the territory of the host Member State shall enjoy equal treatment with the nationals of that Member State within the scope of the Treaty. In the framework of the Directive, equal treatment is subject to compliance with the conditions of residence.</p>
<p>Community law in the field of social security, contained in Regulation (EC) No 1408/71<a href="#defann_32_2" name="refann_32_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> aims at coordinating the social security schemes of the Member States so that the application of the different national legislations does not adversely affect persons exercising their right to free movement within the European Union. Each Member State is therefore free to determine the details of its own social security systems, including which benefits shall be provided, the conditions of eligibility and how many contributions should be paid. Nevertheless, the Member States must comply with Community law when exercising that power. Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 establishes common rules and principles which must be observed by all national authorities when applying national law.</p>
<p>Under this Regulation, workers and pensioners, as well as the members of their family, residing in a Member State other than the one in which they work or which pays their pension, are entitled to sickness benefits in the Member State of residence under the same conditions as a national of this Member State, but on behalf of the Member State where they work or which pays their pension.

<p>The Commission's internal energy market package of 19 September 2007 proposes ownership unbundling of the transmission systems and transmission system operators or, alternatively, the establishment of independent system operators (ISOs) responsible for the management and development of the transmission system. With respect to the distribution systems, the third package does not alter the current legal requirements which consist in the legal and functional unbundling of large distribution system owners and which entered into force only on 1 July 2007. The third country clause (Article 7a in the proposed Gas Directive) applies also only to transmission system operators.</p>
<p>Annex VIII of the impact assessment of the third package proposals<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>gives details about the non-EU ownership in transmission systems. With respect to the three Baltic States, for example, Gazprom holds shares of about one third in each of the national gas transmission and distribution companies, which in all three Member States operate and own both the transmission and distribution networks. With respect to the share of EU companies in Russian gas distribution networks, such information is unfortunately not available to the Commission as the underlying agreements are usually treated as business secrets.</p>
<p>As regards the proposed provisions on unbundling, the effect on Gazprom is identical to the effect on any other EU or non-EU company: Any supply or production company active anywhere in the EU must separate the operator of its transmission system in any Member State of the EU in the manner proposed by the Commission. The package contains safeguards to ensure that in the event that companies from third countries wish to acquire a significant interest or even control over an EU network, they will have to demonstrably and unequivocally comply with the same unbundling requirements as EU companies. Moreover, the Commission has proposed a requirement that third country individuals and countries cannot acquire control over a Community transmission system or transmission system operator unless this is permitted by an agreement between the EU and the third country. The aim is to guarantee that companies from third countries respect the same rules that apply to EU based undertakings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1244 adopted in the aftermath of the Kosovo conflict of 1999 envisaged a UN-led interim civilian administration to ensure the development of provisional institutions for democratic and autonomous self-government pending a political settlement.</p>
<p>The UN Secretary General launched the process for defining Kosovo's final status with the appointment of a Special Envoy, former President Athisaari, in November 2005. After 14 months of engagement of both parties, Mr Athisaari tabled a Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement in March 2007 that was discussed in the UN Security Council during several months without agreement.</p>
<p>In this context, the UN Secretary General agreed to a 120-day process of further engagement under the auspices of a troika composed of the EU, Russia and US to give another further opportunity to both parties to come to an understanding.</p>
<p>The European Union has done everything possible to achieve a negotiated solution. We deeply regret that no such solution was reached between Belgrade and Pristina in the process led by the international Troika.</p>
<p>The European Union has consistently underlined the special character of the Kosovo issue without any precedent function for other regions in the world. Most recently, the 2007 December European Council has underlined its conviction that resolving the pending status of Kosovo constitutes a sui generis case that does not set any precedent.</p>
<p>It is in the European Union and the western Balkans region best interest that Kosovo's status is urgently resolved to secure peace and stability. This is also the ultimate objective of the UNSCR1244.

<p>On 7 December 2007 the Commission gave its opinion on the establishment of a new nuclear power plant at Belene in the form of Point of View and communicated it to the Bulgarian authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission took the view, that in the light of the assessment under the Euratom Treaty and discussion with the nuclear operator, Natsionalna Elekrticheska Kompania (NEK), all the aspects of the investment in question are in line with the objectives of the Euratom Treaty. It has to be noted, that the assessment has been carried out under the provisions of the Euratom Treaty, without prejudice to any additional assessments to be carried out, the case being, under the EC Treaty and the obligations stemming from it and from secondary legislation, such as the provisions on competition or on environment, including the environmental impact assessment.</p>
<p>The Commission, in its opinion, took into account the information from the investor that the chosen design at Belene includes various passive safety systems as well as improved protection against external hazards, such as earthquakes and air crashes.</p>
<p>Seismic risks and emergency planning will be furthermore assessed by the Commission in the framework of radiation protection according to Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty. It includes also the assessment of the possible consequences of unplanned discharges on other Member States, and bilateral or multilateral arrangements to facilitate emergency response.</p>

<p>The Commission is fully committed to facilitating public understanding and debate on European issues by adapting communication on Europe to the national, regional and local environment. The Commission Representation in Austria promotes communication on the European agenda and priorities with Austrian citizens, the media, politicians and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Dialogue with citizens is top priority for the Commission. In the framework of Plan D, the Commission Representation organizes events to stimulate debate on EU policies, including in cooperation with the Information Office of the Parliament in Vienna. Cooperation of the Commission Representation with stakeholders at national, regional and local levels is also a crucial element of our approach. The work of the Representation in the regions is complemented by 11 Europe Direct information relays in the Länder as well as 9 European Documentation Centres and 27 members of Team Europe, a highly qualified panel of speakers on EU issues.</p>
<p>Improving knowledge about the EU is key to encouraging citizens' participation in the EU integration process. Therefore, focusing particularly on younger students, the Commission Representation in Austria regularly organises "Open Days" for schools on its premises. In 2007, the Representation hosted 46 such events with approximately 1000 participants overall.</p>
<p>Secondly, in its media work, the Commission Representation continues its pro-active approach to set national issues in a broader European context. In order to ensure high visibility of EU topics as well as wide media coverage, the Representation works closely with the media, including on Commissioners' visits to Austria, where they are frequently involved in public debates (20 in 2007). 11 information visits to Brussels for journalists and multipliers were carried out in 2007, offering them the opportunity to receive first hand information and to discuss EU issues with experts and policy decision-makers. To allow better access to the broader public, the Commission develops its activity on the web, including by using innovative tools such as web-streaming.</p>

This partnership, co-financed by the Commission, would enable both partners to better liaise and coordinate their communication strategies and plan common activities, thus improving public perception on the EU.

By making legislative provision to incorporate the workers' fund of the former Credit Bank into the Single Insurance Fund for Bank Employees (ETAT), the New Democracy government is furthering a policy previously introduced by the PASOK government when it gifted the Alpha Bank 600 million euro by incorporating the Personnel Insurance Fund of the Ionian and Popular Bank of Greece into the Social Insurance Institute (IKA).

<p>Within hours of the cyclone striking, the Commission released € 1.5 million to address the most urgent needs of the victims, thus being among the first donors to commit funds to this humanitarian crisis. The four Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) partners in this initial operation started their distributions of food and basic non-food items within a week of the cyclone striking. Early warning and evacuations programs (about 3,200,000 people evacuated) were triggered 24 hours before the cyclone hit, which greatly limited the number of casualties compared to other cyclones that had hit Bangladesh in the past decades.</p>
<p>Based on further information from the field describing considerable emergency humanitarian needs, the Commission approved a further emergency decision of € 5 million on 3 December 2007. This will be completed by a new emergency decision of € 1,925,000 under the 2007 budget, bringing the total allocation to the cyclone victims to more than € 8.4 million. The new funds are meeting vital needs for water, food, shelter, basic household items, emergency health care, improvement of water and sanitation conditions to avoid the spreading of water-born diseases, and to support livelihoods and early rehabilitation. Activities will be as usual implemented by the Commission's Humanitarian Aid Department's partners: NGOs, United Nations (UN) agencies and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.</p>
<p>The 4 NGOs contracted under the primary Emergency Decision of € 1.5 million have completed their operations. They have reached 278 000 persons with food, non-food items and improvement of water supplies. This aid had a tremendous impact on the local population.</p>
<p>However, the devastation brought by Cyclone Sidr is considerable with more than 8.5 million people affected including more than 2.6 million still needing emergency assistance; more than half a million houses have been destroyed as well as public infrastructure; crops and livestock destruction are also twice as large as initially estimated.</p>
<p>On 3 December 2007, at a meeting of the Head of Government of Bangladesh with the International Community, the longer-term reconstruction needs were confirmed at around USD<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> 1 billion, mainly for infrastructure: coastal embankments, additional cyclone shelters, schools, roads and bridges as well as reforestation in the Sunderbans mangrove forest World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>The Commission remains fully mobilised through its Delegation in Dhaka working in a coordinated manner with the Government, and other aid agencies. A joint EC-World Bank-UN post-disaster damage and needs assessment, is to be undertaken by the end of 2007 or the beginning of 2008.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Commission is looking into the possibility of allocating additional assistance to Bangladesh including additional humanitarian assistance. The Commission is also considering the use of the Instrument for Stability to support early recovery efforts. Another option may be to redirect or intensify ongoing activities in the 9 districts most affected by the cyclone in particular from current EC funded programmes in education, health and food security.</p>
<p>It is clear that Bangladesh – the most densely populated and one of the poorest countries in the world – will require sustained support for several years in order to address effectively the impact of Sidr and to further enhance preparedness for natural disasters in the context of the threat posed by climate change.</p>
<p>The Commission is the main donor in disaster preparedness in Bangladesh. € 5.9 million have been committed since 1994 in community-based projects in the framework of Disaster preparedness interventions (DIPECHO programme), which aim at strengthening the response capacities of the populations at risk. The Commission is contributing (€ 9 million) to the Government of Bangladesh's Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme.</p>
<p>This should soon be complemented by another contribution on climate change and disaster preparedness.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In accordance with the Negotiating Directives approved by the Council in April 2007, the Commission is currently negotiating an Association Agreement (AA) with the Andean Community of Nations (CAN), which will cover political dialogue, cooperation and trade relations. The latter part should aim to progressive and reciprocal liberalization, by means of an ambitious, comprehensive and balanced Free Trade Area, fully compliant with the rules and obligations of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) while going beyond the WTO's basic rules.</p>
<p>As a general principle, the Commission and the CAN have agreed that the AA, and particularly its trade part, will include asymmetries and special and differential treatment (SDT), both on a region to region basis where necessary and inside the CAN although limiting to a minimum differentiation of commitments between its countries. The precise content of this principle in each chapter of the future agreement is part of the negotiation, and has not yet been specified, but the Commission does not necessarily limit its scope to the calendar for trade in goods liberalization. The Commission is ready to examine any further suggestions from the CAN on the asymmetries and SDT which are compatible with the general objectives of trade liberalization and with WTO rules and obligations.</p>
<p>The Commission can confirm that trade in services and the so-called Singapore issues (trade facilitation, investment, government procurement and competition) are included in the negotiations, in accordance with the Council Directives and in full agreement with the CAN. The Commission is convinced that these issues are of utmost importance for the EU but also for the CAN regional integration process and the sustainable development of its members.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the EU-Chile and EU-Mexico Agreements have been implemented successfully by its partners in all areas covered, and does not see any reason a priori why this should not be possible for the member countries of the CAN in a future Association Agreement.

<p>The Commission wishes to reassure the Honourable Member of its strong commitment to the full implementation of its Better Regulation strategy. Transparency and high quality analysis are key components of the Commission's impact assessment system which constitutes a fundamental instrument for developing sound legislative proposals. Its aim is to ensure that only such proposals that bring added value and comply with the subsidiarity principle are put forward and tailored to meet the policy objective most effectively. If those criteria are met, further checks and balances exist to ensure that all proposals are proportionate and effective in addressing the identified problem. For example, since March 2006 the Impact Assessment Guidelines request the use of the Standard Cost Model for identifying any impacts related to possible administrative burdens.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to produce, in principle, impact assessments for every initiative on its Legislative and Work Programme. Moreover, an increasing number of other initiatives are accompanied by an analysis proportionate to their impacts. Impact assessment allows the Commission to carefully assess different policy options by drawing on the results of stakeholder input. Public consultations are always compliant with the Commission's Minimum Standards for Consultation which include a proactive approach to ensuring that stakeholders are given the opportunity to share their expert opinions. Furthermore, the newly established Impact Assessment Board provides independent quality support and control for impact assessments prepared by the Commission. In some cases, the impact assessment has lead to a decision not to put forward an EU policy initiative.</p>
<p>It is important to underline that the aim of an impact assessment is to provide political decision-makers with a full and objective picture of all potential impacts and to highlight any trade-offs and synergies. The final decision remains of course a political one and is taken in the normal inter-institutional process. As part of this process, the Commission, the Parliament and the Council agreed an inter-institutional Common Approach to Impact Assessment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-1017"></a>

<p>The European Council in October 2002 set a ceiling, which ensured a financial resource perspective for the Common Agricultural Policy’s (CAP) First Pillar (market measures and direct aids expenditure) for the period 2007-2013. The 2003 CAP Reform was adopted by the Agriculture Council in June 2003 in full respect of that financial framework. At the European Council in December 2005 that agreed ceiling for First Pillar remained untouched, with the exception of the integration of expenditure for Bulgaria and Romania (phasing in) under the ceiling, while the net effect on Second Pillar funding was a reduction.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the new challenges stemming from the issues identified in the Communication "Preparing for the Health Check of the CAP Reform"<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> make a further strengthening of the Second Pillar (rural development measures) necessary within the current financial perspectives, in particular in the light of the current constraints that Member State are facing. Reinforcement is also necessary in order to respond to the need for increased efforts in innovation to address those new competitive and environmental challenges. With the CAP budget now fixed until 2013, a strengthening of Pillar II funds could only be achieved through increased compulsory modulation.</p>
<p>During 2008 the Commission will further develop its approach to the budgetary review 2008/2009 as set in the Communication "Reforming the budget, changing Europe"<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The "Health Check" of the CAP contributes to the discussion on future priorities in the field of agriculture and aims to prepare EU agriculture to adapt better to a rapidly changing environment. It therefore does not represent a re-opening of the financial commitments regarding the CAP and does not prejudge the outcome of the budget review.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Water research has been a major component of successive EU environmental research programmes for over three decades. Research activities with a strong international co-operation component have been funded under the 6th Research and Technological Development (RTD) Framework Programme (FP6) to support the objectives of the EU Water Initiative and the water related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) targets. They address, through integrated research approaches, the multi-dimensionality of water governance (participatory approaches, socio-economic and gender aspects, institutional frameworks….), promote capacity building through on-the-job training and awareness and better knowledge and innovation management in developing countries. Furthermore, regarding impact of climate change, some FP6 research projects analyse, quantify and predict the components of current and future global water cycle, evaluating uncertainties and clarifying the overall vulnerability for water resources. Stakeholders and public at large are part of research planning and implementation right from the start in most of these projects to ensure applicability and uptake of the research results.</p>
<p>For instance, the NEWATER project<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> addresses the transition from currently prevailing regimes of river basin water management into more integrated and adaptive regimes to global changes in the future. NEWATER is focussing its work in seven international transboundary catchments (two of them being in Africa) giving special attention to the EU Water Initiative. The ANTINOMOS project<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> devotes attention to link state-of-the-art technological advancement in water supply and sanitation with local resources and grassroots innovations. The NETSSAF project<a href="#defann_47_3" name="refann_47_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> aims to develop a participative multi-stakeholder sanitation management support tool aimed for the end-users to be able to apply large scale sanitation concepts and technologies adapted to the different conditions prevailing in Africa. Through the TECHNEAU project<a href="#defann_47_4" name="refann_47_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, the development and application of innovative and cost effective European strategies and technologies for safe drinking water supply is going to be stimulated. Based on experiences and trends in different representative European regions and in sub-saharan Africa, TECHNEAU addresses the tremendous challenges that face the water supply sector worldwide (climate change, new emerging contaminants, aging infrastructures, shortage of good quality and readily treatable resources and more demanding regulators and consumers needs) with emphasis on adaptive strategies, novel technologies and operational practices. The SWITCH project<a href="#defann_47_5" name="refann_47_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> addresses the problems that increasing global change pressures, escalating costs and other risks inherent to conventional urban water management, are causing to major cities in the world (two of them situated in Africa). The SWITCH program is centred around the concept of city based learning alliances and demand driven research and demonstrations. Learning alliances aims to link up stakeholders at city and global level to interact productively and to create win-win solutions along the water chain, foster a new form of “demand-driven” research through close collaboration with local stakeholders, improve the communication between water sector institutions in the demonstration cities, increase the transparency and scientific basis for decision making processes, help to break down the political barriers to solving global urban and water issues, allow better representation of all stakeholders in the decision making processes and show to other sectors (public health management, agriculture, spatial planning, etc.) that using the learning alliance approach is feasible and results in more rapid adoption. Finally, the ROSA project<a href="#defann_47_6" name="refann_47_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> promotes resource-oriented sanitation concepts as a route to sustainable and ecologically sound sanitation in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals. These concepts are applied in four cities in East-Africa.</p>
<p>The Research Component of the EU Water Initiative provides a platform for pooling together research activities interlinked both at EU level, through continued support by the Directorate General Research Framework Programme, and at the Member States level, through the European Research Area Network (ERA-NET) scheme. The AFRICAN WATER project<a href="#defann_47_7" name="refann_47_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> helped several EU Member States to establish a framework for the long term improvement in the involvement of African researchers in water research and fulfil their political commitments to strengthen African water research capacity. This leads to a successful ERA-NET project (SPLASH)<a href="#defann_47_8" name="refann_47_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> which was funded under FP6. The ERA-NET consortium comprises 15 research programme owners/managers from 11 countries and aims to improve communication, collaboration and coordination of national research programmes in order to increase their reduce duplication and repetition and enhance synergies between EU-funded RTD and national research programmes by Member States.</p>
<p>Efforts continue under the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme (FP7). In this process, FP7 places important emphasis progressing on the analysis of impacts of global change on water resources and its availability in quantitative and qualitative terms. Moreover, actions addressing water security are contemplated in different aspects.</p>
<p>As example, in the 1<span class="sup">st</span> call of FP7 research projects are already under negotiation in this field. Some of these are; i) assessing climatic change and impacts on the quantity and quality of water specifically in vulnerable mountain regions, ii) bridging the gap between adaptation strategies of climate change impacts and European water polices, and iii) assessing research needs and policy choices in areas of drought.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for the coming years there are planned activities exploring changes in extreme hydrological events in Europe and associated impacts on the water cycle (including related global threats on regional/ global water security).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

What is the Commission's definitive opinion on the use of drinking water containing 1-50 mg/l of hexavalent chromium? The Commission also states that the results of several studies carried out in the USA into the ingestion of hexavalent chromium are pending. However, the document 'Toxicological Profile for Chromium '(US Department of Health and Human Services, September 2000, p. 329) quotes the figure of 0.05 mg/l of hexavalent chromium as the European standard for drinking water with reference to WHO publications (1970, 2nd ed. Geneva 33, 'European Standard for Drinking Water' and 1988, ed. Geneva 197, 'Environmental Health Criteria: Chromium 6'). In Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006<a href="#defann_49_3" name="refann_49_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> (REACH), hexavalent chromium and its compounds are classified as PBTs in Annex XVII.</p>
<p>In the light of this additional data, does the Commission persist in refusing to recognise the limit of 0.05 mg/l for hexavalent chromium in drinking water? Does it consider it necessary to take exceptional measures with regard to the distribution and consumption of drinking water containing 8-15 or 50 mg/l of hexavalent chromium, as in the case of the River Asopos?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission does recognise the maximum concentration of 0.05 mg/l of chromium in drinking water. The Drinking Water Directive<a href="#defann_49_4" name="refann_49_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> specifies that the limit value for chromium (all valences confounded) in drinking water is 50µg/l, which is identical to 0.05 mg/l. The current Drinking Water Directive parameter value for chromium is based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines of 1992, and the WHO 2004 Guidelines did not introduce changes in relation to chromium.</p>
<p>The Drinking Water Directive's limit value applies to drinking water as it is delivered to the consumers (at the tap) and not to river water.</p>
<p>As regards the presumed pollution of the Asopos River, the Commission launched an own initiative investigation with the purpose of verifying whether Greece complies with its obligations under EC environmental law. The Commission has addressed a letter to the Greek authorities requesting to be informed in detail on the actions taken. The Commission is assessing all information available and will take all necessary measures, including, if appropriate, the initiation of an infringement procedure, to ensure that EC environmental legislation is complied with.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>National legislation implementing the Directive in Spain was adopted on 16 November 2007 and will enter into force on 17 January 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission would first like to underline the main objectives of the public sector information Directive. The Directive aims at making public sector information widely available for re-use in the information economy. This is the case for example in mapping and car navigation services. Key aspects are facilitating cross-border re-use of public sector information and limiting distortions of competition. The Directive’s core provisions regulate in particular non-discrimination, upper limits for charging, transparency and practical tools to easily find and re-use public documents.</p>
<p>The first part of the question concerns essentially the implementation into national law of Article 10 (2) of the Directive. This Article precludes cross-subsidies in situations where public sector bodies exercise, in addition to their public tasks, purely commercial activities. As an example one could mention a public sector body that produces basic data and that also sells added-value products in competition with other economic operators. This is the case in several Member States in sectors such as geographic or meteorological information. To avoid a distortion of fair competition, the competitors should be able to re-use the basic data under the same conditions as the commercial branch of the public sector body.</p>
<p>The Spanish implementation law addresses the above described cross-subsidy issue regulated by Article 10 (2) of the Directive in terms close to those of the Directive.</p>
<p>The second part of the question refers to the possibility that Member States apply the Directive in a way that renders services that so far have been free of charge subject to payment. The Commission is not aware of concrete situations where this would have happened and it is certainly not intended by the Directive. Indeed, the Directive calls upon Member States to promote a wide re-use of public sector documents. In its Preamble it encourages Member States to make documents available at marginal costs or at no charges at all. For situations where charges are made, the Directive fixes conditions and an upper ceiling to admissible charges.</p>
<p>The Commission services are carefully following the implementation and application of the Directive in the Member States. There are encouraging examples where re-use of public sector information has increased and new innovative services have been created, for the benefit of European businesses and citizens alike. The Commission will carry out, in accordance with article 13 of the Directive, a review of its application in 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 14 December 2007, the Commission signed a one year service contract (renewable 4 times) with a consortium of 16 European radios (and 7 associated members).</p>
<p>In the first year, the amount allocated to the consortium will permit the 16 radios to broadcast 45 minutes of EU information per day. This put the hourly broadcasting cost to €1,377, probably the lowest cost on the radio market. The consortium will produce and broadcast 4,200 hours of programmes on EU affairs in 10 EU languages. Full editorial independence is guaranteed in the contract.</p>
<p>The estimated daily outreach of these programmes will be 19 million Europeans and 50 million people in the rest of the world. The radio broadcasting will be complemented by a multilingual Internet portal, with sound, pod-casting and other technical facilities and information services to the auditors available on demand. The webpages are expected to be viewed approximately 60-80 million times a month.</p>
<p>The consortium will have an open character, with new members accepted, if fulfilling the admission criteria defined by contract. The aim is to attract at least one radio operator by EU Member State and as many associated members as possible. Thus the number of languages covered will increase each year to cover all the 23 EU official languages in 2012.

<p>The 4th Report on Economic and Social Cohesion<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>– adopted by the Commission on 30 May 2007 – confirms the importance the Commission attaches to achieving greater territorial cohesion in Europe and to the particular difficulties certain territories are facing. Among other things, the report draws attention to the challenges and opportunities arising in the territories with specific natural handicaps.</p>
<p>Already, the Cohesion Report has raised a series of questions as a basis on which to launch the discussion on the future of the policy. Among the questions, the Commission asks "How can cohesion policy better promote harmonious, balanced and sustainable development taking into account the diversity of EU territories, such as least favoured areas, islands, rural and coastal areas but also cities, declining industrial regions, other areas with particular geographic characteristics?". The Commission is looking forward to receiving many responses to this important question and will report on the results in the context of the 5th Progress Report on Cohesion due for spring 2008.</p>
<p>The new regulations for 2007-2013 and the Community Strategic Guidelines contain explicit provisions for areas with geographical and natural handicaps; they thus provide the basis for progress in addressing territorial specificities in programming documents. During the informal ministerial meeting which took place in Leipzig at the end of May 2007, the Commissioner in charge of Regional Policy presented a document which assesses the way in which national strategies for 2007-2013 propose to tackle territorial issues. One of her observations was that only a few Member States set clear and explicit interventions for specific types of territories (i.e. mountainous, coastal, insular, sparsely populated areas). The Ministers present at the meeting requested the Commission to develop this analysis and to present a report on territorial cohesion in 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission thus will present in September 2008 a Green Paper on territorial cohesion will seek to provide an overall and coherent view of territorial challenges, including those specific to mountains, islands and other areas facing geographical difficulties. In that context, the Commission intends to look at how different sector policies such as transport address the issue of territorial cohesion. A comprehensive approach is needed in order to offer a sound basis for Community policies, and cohesion policy in particular, and to provide the appropriate answers to the need for harmonious and balanced development of the Union. This common vision is essential for avoiding the fragmentation of European policies while taking into account the specificities of the concerned areas.</p>
<p>The Green Paper will firstly provide an updated analysis on disparities in the European territory and on specific territorial features. It will discuss the definition and use of concept at the European and the Member States level (legal matters, implementation issues as linked to a survey sent to the Member States, as well as the territorial dimension of the National Strategic Reference Framework Operational Programmes). It will finally propose some questions for debate. Islands and mountain areas will have an appropriate place in this work.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The requirements set for co-incineration plants ensure that an equivalent level of environmental protection is achieved as for dedicated waste incinerators.</p>
<p>In addition to the requirements of the Waste Incineration Directive, all cement kilns with a production capacity exceeding 500 tonnes per day are also subject to Directive 96/61/EC<a href="#defann_54_2" name="refann_54_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC).</p>
<p>The ΑΓΕΤ-LAFARGE installation falls within the scope of the IPPC Directive and must therefore comply with all of its requirements. It should be stressed that the installation disposes of an environmental permit issued on the basis of the national legislation transposing the IPPC Directive and Directive 85/337/EEC on the environmental impact assessment<a href="#defann_54_3" name="refann_54_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. In addition, it should be mentionned that the Decision approving environmental conditions<a href="#defann_54_4" name="refann_54_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> for the operation of the waste water treatment plant of Psitalleia <a href="#defann_54_5" name="refann_54_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>provides for possible ways of dealing with the dried sludge produced, including incineration.</p>
<p>The competent authorities have to ensure that these installations are operated in such a way that all the appropriate preventive measures are taken against pollution, in particular through the application of the Best Available Techniques (BAT).</p>
<p>The permits for IPPC installations should include emission limit values for all relevant polluting substances, based on the BAT. These limit values may be more stringent than those required under the Waste Incineration Directive and may be set for further polluting substances. The BAT are determined at EU level through an information exchange between experts, leading to the adoption by the Commission of the BAT reference documents, better known as the BREFs. The 31 BREF documents are publicly available on the website of the European IPPC Bureau.</p>
<p>The BREF on the manufacture of cement was the first one to be adopted in 2001. This BREF document is currently under revision and the updated version will in particular contain new information on the use of waste in cement kilns. It will also include new conclusions on the BAT for this activity.</p>
<p>The co-incineration of waste in cement kilns, when operated in compliance with EU environmental legislation, will not lead to an overall increase of greenhouse gas emissions. The use of waste derived fuels reduces the need to burn conventional fossil fuels in these installations, which, in the case of biomass waste, will also reduce the CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>The Commission has not been asked to co-finance the programme for co-incineration of RDF<a href="#defann_54_6" name="refann_54_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> at the ΑΓΕΤ-LAFARGE installation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 4 April 2007 the Commission published a progress report (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2007&amp;nu_doc=0168">COM(2007)0168</a>) on the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the rights of air travellers. It is clear from the report that implementation of the Regulation in the Member States leaves a lot to be desired. The Commission announced in the report that it would be taking measures to reinforce compliance with the rules. In the meantime, figures from various quarters have been published on the number of complaints by passengers. According to answer <a href="/doceo/document/P-6-2006-1880_EN.html">P-1880/06</a> to a written question by myself, there was a total of 3 488 complaints to the Commission in 2005. The Commission’s progress report (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2007&amp;nu_doc=0168">COM(2007)0168</a>) reported 18 288 complaints collected by the Member States.</p>
<p>In a report of 6 December 2007, the European Consumer Centre Network noted an increase from 1 521 to 2 979 complaints, i.e. almost a doubling of the number. I therefore wish to ask the Commission how far it has come with the measures to strengthen compliance with Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 announced in the progress report. Does it plan legislative initiatives in this connection? What is the number, and the nature, of the complaints received by the Commission and the Member States? Has the Commission collated the fragmentary information currently held about complaints? What measures does the Commission intend to take in the short term to enforce better compliance with Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 by the Member States?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On the complaints received by the Member States, Regulation 261/2004 does not require Member States to give data on complaint handling to the Commission. The Commission therefore has no information on the number of complaints received by National Enforcement Bodies in 2007.</p>
<p>On the complaints received by the Commission, the Directorate General for Energy and Transport received 3819 in 2006, and in 2007 had received 2180 until the end of November.</p>
<p>On 4 April 2007<a href="#defann_56_2" name="refann_56_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission concluded in its Communication that improvement of the level of application by airlines and enforcement by the National Enforcement Bodies is necessary. Difficulties are due to a lack of harmonised procedures for enforcement and some unclear parts of the Regulation, such as on delays and cancellation, departures from non-EU countries, downgrading and information provision to volunteers for denied boarding.</p>
<p>To rectify these weaknesses, the Commission organised six meetings with the National Enforcement Bodies and airline industry in 2007. These resulted in:</p>
<p>agreement on who is responsible for what when it comes to complaint handling and exchanging information,</p>
<p>clarification of parts of the relevant legislation where possibilities for different interpretations exist.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission is analysing national measures introduced to enforce Community law on air passenger rights to check that appropriate measures are in place.</p>
<p>At the same time in cooperation with National Enforcement Bodies and the airline industry a standard EU Air Passenger Complaint Form has been created. This will be available to the public in early 2008. Information material for passengers on their rights has been redesigned, allowing further clarification.</p>
<p>The outcome of cases concerning the definition of long delays and cancellation currently before the European Court of Justice should also help to give a clear interpretation of the relevant texts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
