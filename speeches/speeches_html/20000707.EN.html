We are therefore currently producing the remaining versions. I hope that all the groups will bear in mind how much requests for roll-call votes cost Parliament’s budget.

A fruit and vegetable wholesaler had his premises raided by police and trading standards officers, who seized the weighing equipment which he used to dispense his produce in the traditional British units of pounds and ounces. Apparently this is now in contravention of an EU directive, although there is a legal doubt about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the President will join with me in condemning this extremely heavy-handed reaction and write to my constituent offering the full support of the House in his fight against this nonsense.

At the beginning of the topical and urgent debate, we had a discussion on the application of Rule 146 of the Rules of Procedure, that is to say adjournment of a debate. The President declared this not applicable to the topical debate. I wonder how it is possible for a rule of the Rules of Procedure not to apply to a situation without it being further mentioned in the Rules of Procedure. Rule 146 was clearly cancelled out in that instance.  I would therefore ask whether the Committee on the Rules of Procedure or the President could explain in what instances Rule 146 would apply. Yesterday’s incident caused a great deal of confusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as the Commission report and the report of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism point out, short sea shipping is suffering from a poor public image in terms of its cost, slowness and inefficiency. Nevertheless, this image no longer corresponds to the real situation and this mode of transport can provide solutions to global problems which are prevalent in this area in Europe. I am thinking about traffic congestion problems, and high infrastructure and environmental costs.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last few years, progress has also been made and there has been a real increase in short sea shipping: from 1990 to 1997, a 17% increase in the tonnage transported and a 23% increase in the number of tonnes per kilometre.</p>
<p class="contents">While there is no doubt about its success, this mode of transport has not yet reached its full potential and maximised its hidden advantages: advantages in terms of cost since it is the most economical mode of transport; advantages in terms of the amount of energy consumed per tonne/kilometre; advantages in terms of efficiency since it is the most efficient mode of transport from the point of view of the amount of investment required in relation to transport capacity; advantages in terms of regional cohesion since it is the most suitable mode for servicing the peripheral regions of Europe; advantages in terms of the environment since it causes less pollution than mainland traffic; and advantages in terms of intermodal transport since it is an ideal way of developing multimodal transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore act quickly in order to contribute to its development. In particular, we will have to develop joint investment programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the priorities will have to be to increase the efficiency of port operations and reduce waiting times in ports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress the fact that the public authorities have a major role to play at regional level, as well as national and European level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, two points in my fellow Member’s report pose a problem for me.</p>
<p class="contents">They concern the proposal which seeks to draw up a list of ports which are particularly suitable for short sea shipping. Drawing up such a list seems unnecessary to me and, in particular, runs the risk of penalising those ports which are not yet entirely suitable, but which are being converted for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, a ‘one­stop­shop’ approach to the transport logistics services offered to end users is proposed. While I am in favour of the idea that we need to find the means to set up an information system, I am against the service being centralised by a large port, which is already in a dominant market position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would have liked the report to have included the proposal made by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, according to which short sea shipping must be considered neither as an alternative to road transport nor as a competitive system. The European Commission should therefore develop an intermodal strategy to achieve complementarity between the modes of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context and with this in mind, the Member States should harmonise current legislation in order to prevent it from representing an obstacle to continuity between short sea shipping and mainland traffic, particularly as regards the total weight of rolling stock.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal which is being put forward to us today therefore represents an important step in the right direction in the area of short sea shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we still have a long way to go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title3"></a><a name="creitem3"></a>

The sole purpose of this proposal for a framework decision is to speed things up, at least with regard to the 15 Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">In almost every country environmental laws are based almost entirely on very small fines, and this encourages those who are destroying the environment to maximise their profits by trying to avoid using all the modern techniques available to protect the environment. And so, in recent years we have witnessed major disasters such as that of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, which was a rust bucket<span class="italic"> </span>used to transport crude oil by sea, or the pollution of the Danube with cyanide from Romanian mines. And all this because, as I was saying, these big companies are guaranteed impunity, with the aim of maximising profits. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, this framework decision allows European countries to raise fines to make this offence – environmental crime – unprofitable. Indeed, until such time as environmental crime is paid for by the community and not by individuals, there is no hope of protecting the environment. </p>
<p class="contents">Another area where this framework decision impacts is that of encouraging European countries to adopt sanctions, or at least a system making environmental crime a punishable offence for legal persons. Few European countries provide for the liability of legal persons in their criminal law, but others are taking steps towards this. Italy too, in revising the new penal code, intends to make legal persons punishable, because today serious environmental crime is not committed by individuals but by large multinationals, which cause huge disasters simply because they do not invest in prevention. </p>
<p class="contents">European countries should agree on fairly general regulations soon and, in any case, raise fines so that these offences are not paid for out of the community’s pocket. </p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect is the cooperation that this framework decision will bring about between countries: an information network enabling a rapid exchange of information and an agreement which requires environmental crime to be considered as a crime that may lead to extradition or for example the confiscation of property and profits, and which, in any case, makes these offences unprofitable. I would just like to point out that the committee approved this report almost unanimously, with only one abstention, and all the political groups, from the PPE to the PSE to the Greens, contributed to improving it. </p>
<p class="contents">This report therefore expresses the point of view of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms, and, we hope, expresses the point of view of the European Parliament, which must ensure that the European countries at last adopt effective legislation on the protection of the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We consider that this initiative will be a useful instrument for combating those environmental crimes and their ever more common cross-border consequences which are, of course, a direct threat to the environment and also, therefore, to human beings, animals and plant life. </p>
<p class="contents">Serious environmental crimes are a common problem for the Member States because their effects are not confined to individual countries. Therefore, we also ought to be able to take common measures to protect the environment as effectively as possible using the provisions of criminal law. I would point out that this Framework Decision is to be made unanimously in the Council, and it has been agreed that it will be binding upon the Member States. At the same time, it should be remembered that it is the Member States which decide <span class="italic">how</span> the results are to be achieved, that is to say which method is to be applied and which course of action adopted. </p>
<p class="contents">How is this to happen? Perhaps, for example, through efficient investigations promptly carried out, by sharing the information obtained in this way and by ensuring that these investigations are carried out by staff knowledgeable about the environment. That is extremely important. By means of administrative cooperation between the Member States, it is also possible to obtain such information as can be of use in enabling us to combat environmental crime. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also, however, point out something which we also emphasised in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, namely that we must also go in for preventive measures, that is to say measures to be taken before environmental damage has been caused and environmental crimes committed. It is therefore also important for legislation to deal with environmental liability, that is to say the issue of who is liable, and for there to be effective legislation of this kind in the various Member States. More knowledge, pure and simple, about the environment and details of relevant techniques are also, of course, required, as well as information on how to detect environmental crime, on the consequences of this and on the penalties that can be imposed. It is important to try to cooperate as much as possible in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">Serious environmental crime is defined in this Framework Decision as ‘acts or omissions which, under aggravating circumstances and in breach of the legislation, result in substantial damage to the environment’. It is, of course, open to discussion how the definition in terms of the words ‘serious environmental crime’ and ‘substantial damage’ is to be interpreted, but that is no doubt as far as the definition goes, even if it is not recognisable in legislation outside the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">We have looked at this definition of serious environmental crime in the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Because the definition is so vague, we consider it important to obtain as wide an area of application as possible in the proposed Framework Decision. Moreover, combating serious environmental crime cannot only apply to private companies but must also apply to administrative crime, that is to say cases where the administrative regimes in the various countries, or in fact the governments, have brought about serious environmental damage either through negligence or irresponsibility. We have tried to include such circumstances by means of Amendment 16.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect is what is regarded as ‘aggravating circumstances’ if the organisation which has caused serious environmental damage has been inadequately insured and has been so, too, in connection with the risks entailed in the particular business. What is at stake here is the issue of liability and the polluter pays principle, as well as the principle that the burden, consequences and risks should not be imposed upon others. This may be found in Amendment 25.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to say that we are on the way to taking joint action to protect the environment. This Framework Decision is <span class="italic">one</span> step, like the Council of Europe’s Convention on the Protection of the Environment through criminal law. The Framework Decision also states that this convention must be ratified as quickly as possible because it is significantly more detailed. These steps are absolutely necessary, I believe, to deter environmental crooks and prevent irresponsible actions which cause serious environmental damage. I am in favour of the Framework Decision and of the amendments which have been tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to praise this initiative by Denmark, which seeks to ensure that a Framework Decision on combating serious environmental crime is approved. We are all aware of the increasing scale and the frequent cross-border effects of this type of crime. I must also mention one of the recent surveys by Eurobarometer, which confirms that the environment, together with security, health and unemployment, is one of the concerns closest to the hearts of the European citizens. We therefore have an obligation to respond to these concerns, in a way that will guarantee the protection of the environment and public health, with a view to improving the quality of our citizens’ lives. </p>
<p class="contents">The truth requires us to recognise that the European Union has made considerable progress in the area of the environment over the last five years. Today, even from the point of view of the Treaties, we have already seen a balanced and sustained form of development taking place. Under the terms of the Tampere conclusions, environmental crime is one of the areas specifically mentioned, on which efforts must be concentrated in order to establish common definitions, charges and sanctions between the various national criminal laws. </p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a crucial need for joint action by the Member States in order to protect the environment under criminal law. We in the Member States are facing a common problem, which, more and more, is having effects which go beyond the borders of the State in which the crimes are committed. This makes it crucial that we implement concerted measures for protecting the environment under criminal law, which are in force right across the territory of the European Union. Either through criminal laws or through severe sanctions – and I stress the adjective severe – which are commensurate with the offence and which act as an effective deterrent. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, as Mrs Schörling pointed out, there must also be a global course of preventive action, under which Member States can guarantee that companies whose activities involve a greater risk to the environment and which might have harmful effects on public health are properly informed about the environmental consequences of their activities and that they adopt the appropriate safety measures and precautions. It is therefore imperative that the methods for combating serious environmental crimes are strengthened and coordinated between Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to call on the Member States that have not yet signed up to the Council of Europe’s 1998 Convention on the protection of the environment, to adopt, under their national legislation, the necessary measures to do so as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore like to congratulate both the Danish Government on the initiative it has undertaken and the honourable members, Mr Di Lello Finuoli and Mrs Schörling, who have used their texts to broaden and specify the scope of the initiative. Despite the Danish initiative being a positive step in the right direction, it does in fact have its weak points in comparison, for example, with the 1998 Council of Europe Convention. This is because it focuses solely on criminal law and disregards questions of prevention, health, protection of cultural heritage and so forth. </p>
<p class="contents">However, despite its weak points and contradictions, the initiative is a positive one because it promotes the creation of a legislative framework which will allow for more coordinated joint action through a stronger Europol, mainly in tackling cross-border environmental crime. It lays down minimum sanctions, particularly for cases in which the environment is sacrificed at the altar of profit. I fully endorse this approach because, as we all know, the punishments laid down for environmental crime are grossly out of proportion with the effect which these crimes have on society as a whole. </p>
<p class="contents">However, we feel that the Danish initiative has not properly examined the Member States’ legislation and will probably be difficult to implement because of the major discrepancies between them. But I do agree with the reference to the liability of legal persons given that, by definition and by nature, the majority of environmental crimes are committed by corporations and industries. I also feel that the reference to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is essential as I think that every proposal ought to take account of the prospect of enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I must stress the need for educating and training the personnel who will be responsible for investigating and prosecuting environmental crimes, the need to highlight preventative measures and the need for all the Member States to ratify the 1998 Convention of the Council of Europe. To date, not one Member State has ratified it. I should also like to stress that the Member States will have to pledge to work together on this extremely important issue.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a logical continuation of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Council of Ministers’ summit in Tampere. It is a classic area requiring cooperation. When we look at the Danish text, as well as at Mr Di Lello Finuoli’s report and Mrs Schörling’s opinion, which are both excellent, we see, however, that it is an extremely complicated area. We must have good coordination between the assistance agreement, which has recently been debated here in the Chamber, and the rules concerning money laundering. I am not completely certain that the instrument is ready in every respect, but I am pleased that the attempt is being made to avoid duplicating the work of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We see that there are really three parts to the Danish initiative, plus the demand for ratification of the Council of Europe’s Convention. It is important to have regulations in criminal law so that we can prevent environmental crime. I personally believe that confiscation rules are more important than the demand for strict penalties and severe fines. Experience shows that a very great deal can, in fact, be achieved by means of strict confiscation rules. We have the old saw, ‘Crime must not pay’. As Mrs Schörling also pointed out, we must have close cooperation, including when it comes to the rules relating to environmental liability which we are to draw up and which are mentioned in Article 2 (a).</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that, in the opinion she has drafted, Mrs Schörling also takes up the question of animals, which does not surprise me at all. I think that we in this Chamber should say loudly and clearly that this must be an instrument with which we tackle the disgraceful ways in which animals are transported. We are quite surprised that the Commission, for example, has not set to and wanted to apply the existing rules. Why is the Commission so passive – much more passive than in many other areas – when it comes to being the Guardian of the Treaties on the issue of protecting animals in transit? </p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 16 and 19 introduce interesting matters which I doubt would be a part of many other countries’ criminal legislation. They concern misleading information provided by local or national authorities, at the same time as the latter, in their turn, have been misled. I think this is something we should study in the future. I see this as a clear illustration of the current questions in Baia Mare and of the investigation which is under way there concerning who is really liable. Who has misled whom? These are very complicated, very interesting and very important questions. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that specific vessels have been cited and that there is also a readiness to apply measures outside the territory of the EU. We should nonetheless be aware that, if we do this, we must also define what constitutes the type of serious environmental crime we are talking about combating. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is accepted by most people that the existing laws are much too lenient and it is important that some sort of provision is put in place to ensure that criminal law cases are possible. In the present situation there is no incentive whatsoever either for companies to clean up their act, to take responsibility to ensure that negligence does not occur. This has a knock-on effect on other companies as well.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to taking legal action it is up to individual citizens themselves to take up these cases and that can be extremely difficult and expensive. Of course, people can be up against big companies with huge amounts of power and resources at their disposal which makes it very very difficult in many cases for them to pursue these cases to the end and ensure that the companies pay the price. They really are criminals who through negligence or through deliberate action are destroying the environment, affecting human health, affecting our flora and fauna and causing in many other ways long-term damage, all in the interest of profit.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies that manage land and sea transport, for example, have in many cases absolutely no sense of responsibility and it is essential for some sort of sanctions to be put in place to ensure that they are forced to act responsibly. Governments should provide more information and make clear to the public the scale and effects of environmental crime because many sections of our society are unaware of this. For example in relation to water, soil, our health, flora, fauna and indeed climate, it is extremely important that proper information is made available.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover it is not just companies. Sometimes it is national authorities who are actually flouting the law and behaving in an utterly negligent way. I do not have to go any further than my own country to see that in many cases local authorities and so on are actually responsible themselves for environmental damage. And, when it comes to enforcing the law in relation to companies that are operating in their area, they are negligent in that respect as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems that profit comes before the interests of the public and the environment. That should not be allowed to continue and authorities who fail to enforce the law should themselves be held liable for the environmental damage caused as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether it is deliberate or through negligence, at the end of the day it makes very little difference because the damage is done. In many cases companies use the argument of negligence rather than saying it is deliberate but in fact negligence in its way is deliberate. These firms knew the consequences and they should be held accountable for the complete and total cost of cleaning up the damage that they have caused wherever possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing I would like to point out is that there are companies, such as British Nuclear Fuels, who have absolutely no sense of public responsibility or environmental awareness. They have been causing pollution for such a long, long time the length of our coast by polluting the Irish Sea and putting the public in Ireland, and indeed on the west coast of the United Kingdom, at serious risk. You only have to look at what happened in Chernobyl which again was due to a negligent attitude. How long is that going to take to rectify? These situations can no longer be allowed in a world where we should be fully aware of the environmental problems that we are causing. We have the technology, the know-how and the resources to ensure that these things do not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">Erika</span> is another example of negligence. I would also like to support the last speaker who talked about animal transport. This is deliberate exploitation and ill-treatment of animals and should be taken into account as well. On an international level we have seen many many disasters in the past, just to take Bhopal as an example. Cost-cutting and cutting corners caused the biggest environmental disaster in history. That company still has not been held properly and legally responsible. It was taken to court in India. The head of the company was supposed to be arrested and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He absconded to the United States where he has decided to stay and has not come back to face the consequences of his action, even despite warrants from Interpol.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are the issues of forestry and fishing. The malpractice of many fishing activities should be taken into account because it is also an environmental crime which has long-term consequences. It is about time that we all faced up to our responsibilities because we have not only ourselves and our environment to think of but future generations as well. The only way we are going to do that is to ensure that environmental damage is considered one of the most serious crimes in our society.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The effects of environmental crime spread into the territory of many countries. The importation and exportation of crimes does not recognise the EU’s external borders. The crimes are often committed by a corporate body. The crimes are often perpetrated in a spirit of profit-making. The perpetrator makes the profit; external costs are left for others to pay. You analysed the situation quite correctly: the environment must be broadly interpreted as people’s health, biodiversity and artistic and cultural heritage. It is not hard to support a policy that makes it easier to combat environmental crime. These crimes must be made unprofitable; they cannot be allowed to have merely financial consequences. They have to be prevented. Publicity is also one way of combating environmental criminality. Why do we not start by publicising, or demanding publicity for, the fact that the Belgian Government allows unclean waste water to run into the river in the city of Brussels?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in addition to repeating the positive things that have already been said, it is important to stress some of the limitations of Denmark’s initiative, precisely to help us to take more effective action in the future. </p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Karamanou has already made an important point: in reality, the Council is not telling us what the current state of the Member States’ laws is. Now, my reaction may well be over-cautious, but I am very suspicious of those who say: let us raise fines, let us increase the sanctions, without, however, telling us what these fines and sanctions are. </p>
<p class="contents">I think it would have been appropriate for Denmark and the Council to have also given us a framework of sanctions, so that we could have seen what really are the most serious gaps that need to be filled and the most serious limitations of the European situation. The part on criminal sanctions is, of course, important, and the European legal framework must surely be made consistent. Nevertheless, this is not the only question concerning respect for the environment and environmental disasters: we need to take a more comprehensive view of the matter. </p>
<p class="contents">We know, for example, that the levels of pollutant emissions are decreasing in the European Union, and they are decreasing because of the structure underpinning the way the economy operates. Clearly, we also need to intervene with the criminal framework where real crimes are committed, but it is important for the criminal framework to be consistent with the rest of the legislation, administrative sanctions and provisions regulating the economy in order to make the overall framework consistent. Indeed, administrative sanctions, which affect the effective costs of businesses, are often sanctions which have an even stronger preventive effect than criminal sanctions: the person in charge of a business or a company is unlikely to consider the risk of being arrested or of facing criminal sanctions when a tragedy occurs, while on the other hand, it is preferable if he or she is obliged, on a daily basis, to consider the higher expense that polluting processes entail. </p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, if, as many of the Members have said, the Council of Europe Convention is more comprehensive and more consistent, perhaps in these cases we should also ask ourselves how the European Union might be able to consider the Council of Europe texts directly in order to make legislation more homogeneous, both within and outside the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final remark about the sensitive matter of the relationship between the State and pollution. We speak of individuals and companies, whereas the state-owned companies or the State itself are often partly responsible for major environmental disasters. This is something which should be taken into account, and I think that the initiative of Denmark and the Council does not do this directly enough.</p>

In the Council of Europe – and this has already been echoed by others – a convention was concluded in 1998 to fight international environmental crime. However, most Member States have yet to sign and ratify this “Convention of the Council of Europe on the Protection of the Environment”. </p>
<p class="contents">Denmark has proposed that more far-reaching measures be taken at EU level to fight environmental crime. Within the Council of Ministers, the only item which survived in the framework decision was that of criminalisation, and all Denmark’s other ideas have been taken out. As such, the added value of such a framework decision has been nullified, since penalisation was already included in the Council of Europe’s Convention. In more concrete terms, fewer countries have signed up to the framework decision than the Council of Europe’s Convention. Hence it is preferable for various Member States to sign and ratify the Council of Europe’s Convention. Needless to say, I welcome further steps at EU level, such as the Danish proposal.  My question to the Council of Ministers is whether it would be prepared to go this extra mile.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, however, is now caught in a dilemma. Should it issue a recommendation with regard to the Danish proposal or with regard to the Council of Ministers’ amended proposal? Since we only have the Danish proposal at our disposal, we will use it as our basis, although we wonder whether this is at all useful, because if the Council enforces the watered-down proposal, I for one will argue against laying down any EU framework decision at all.  </p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the Danish proposal, I would firstly point out that this framework decision should mainly be considered as a supplement to the national approach to environmental crime. This supplement must have a legal framework for an international approach, such as coordination, information exchange, reporting of crimes, central registration and criminal prosecution in international environmental crime. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to make clear what does and does not fall within the scope of the framework decision, a sound definition of environmental crime is vital. I principally assent to the formulations proposed by Denmark, although I wonder whether the illegal trade in threatened flora and fauna could be added to the definition. </p>
<p class="contents">Even if we can agree on a sound definition, the application will be difficult in practice. Was the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster an example of environmental crime? And what about the cyanide pollution in Romania? It was a clear case of extensive environmental damage, but do the other criteria apply too? It is important that liability for these acts eventually falls to those responsible. It would be useful if this issue could be included in the White Paper on environmental liability. </p>
<p class="contents">Many of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs concern editorial changes, some of which are redundant. In my opinion, it is better to give the Danish proposal to the Council our full backing than to propose minor changes of no real consequence. I do, however, support additional ideas, such as providing information on the effects of environmental crime and court rulings. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, naturally I am interested in the European Commission’s view. Could Commissioner Schreyer clarify this rather odd procedure which we have ended up with? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I certainly recognise that the greatest environmental disasters occur as a consequence either of irresponsibility or the actions of those who are driven by the profit motive, irrespective of the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably such disasters affect many countries at the same time. We know only too well that major environmental disasters respect no international frontiers. In more recent times we experienced the problems caused by the pollution of the Danube with cyanide from Romanian mines, the <span class="italic">Erika</span> tanker break-up off the French Atlantic coastline and, from an Irish point of view, the continuing problems caused by Sellafield. And of course in the not-so-distant past there was Chernobyl, the memory of which still haunts us. Events such as this will continue to recur unless and until we establish the “polluter pays” principle in the fullest sense of these words.</p>
<p class="contents">Multinational firms will only change their behaviour when they are forced to pay heavily for their misdeeds. They will continue to inflict damage on the environment when the rewards far exceed the punishment. Their attitude is based on the simple belief that implementing restrictive environmental protection either harms their business activities or increases their financial overheads significantly. Furthermore, any meagre fine they will be obliged to pay pales into insignificance when compared to the huge profits that they make.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome this initiative that acknowledges the international nature of environmental damage. It recognises the need for strong punitive sanctions. In particular the criminalisation of environmental damage will send a clear warning to those responsible for it.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Danish proposals were to be implemented, those who put unsafe vessels on our seas would think twice. Others, such as the management at Sellafield, who deliberately conceal information and involve themselves in bad practices, be held accountable for their deeds. And the chief executives and managers of the multinationals who make the important decisions displaying the callous disregard for the consequences would face the proposal of not only seeing their businesses maybe in some cases closed down because of heavy fines and seizure of assets and so on, but they themselves could face imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a direction in which we must go but I would also like to make one additional point. Proposals and actions in this field should not simply be confined to the territory of the European Union. We have a responsibility to ensure that multinational firms are unable to transport their damage and their behaviour to the developing world because of restrictions that we may place upon them within the European Union. We must also impose standards on European firms that operate in the developing world and seek international cooperation to have tough standards and sanctions applied on a worldwide basis.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Di Lello Finuoli, who, throughout the negotiation of this initiative, has acted with great clarity and strength in relation to our shared principles and values, but also with prudence and flexibility, which led him to adopt several amendments incorporating various adjustments. We are therefore arriving at a final proposal that we consider to be both reasonable and ambitious.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that, by means of this framework decision, the European Union is supporting the Convention on the Protection of the Environment through criminal law that was approved in the Council of Europe in 1998 and which has so far not been ratified by enough States to enter into force. In the European Union, only nine Member States have signed it, and only one has so far ratified it, which is still quite scandalous.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague and compatriot Carmen Cerdeira contributed ideas and amendments that are now part of the text on which we are going to vote. I agree with these and would like to highlight four aspects in which I feel that we have succeeded in improving the initial proposal during the parliamentary process.</p>
<p class="contents">The first aspect is that it is recognised that a country may act against criminals when the crime against the environment has been committed on its own territory, but also when it has been committed in another country, if the consequences of that crime affect the former.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is that this ability to act has been extended and will affect not only crimes that have been committed, but also attempted crimes which, for one reason or another, do not have any effect, but could have had effects.</p>
<p class="contents">A third element is that it is applied to legal persons, when they are responsible, as it is they, rather than individuals, that commit the vast majority of serious environmental crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth element that I wish to highlight is that the financial and other penalties imposed for such crimes will always have to be greater than the benefit that the perpetrators would gain from them. This will put an end to a situation in which, in many cases, it is not only cheap but actually profitable for them to commit a crime.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a good document, which we hope will be effective, but we also need to be committed to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased with this initiative from the Danish Government, which is based on the new procedure established in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in order to deal with the matter of ensuring better and greater protection for the environment in the European Union, something which should obviously not be limited by borders within the Union. My colleague, Mrs Thors, has already expressed our favourable position with regard both to the report and to the amendments tabled by the respective committees, and I will therefore focus on three points.</p>
<p class="contents">For some time, I have been trying to ensure that the Commission deals appropriately with European forests, and I have seen the problems that have arisen as a result of the need to deal in a variety of ways with this issue which has a clear environmental dimension. The first difficulty that I see in truly applying this proposal is in categorising environmental crimes, given the diversity within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The second matter is the need to consider the international dimension of the crime. We have seen how difficult it is to find out who is ultimately responsible for many large-scale environmental crimes, but, furthermore, the set of legal responsibilities of the entities who, ultimately, appear to be responsible, really makes it very difficult to actually deal with these crimes from a criminal point of view. I think that this will be an important task for the Commission. We have to prevent criminal responsibilities from being blurred.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mr President, I just want to say that it is essential that the field of justice and home affairs be communitised in the European Union, and this proposal demonstrates that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, there are quite a lot of Member States which have problems imposing effective penalties for this type of crime. </p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Sweden, a great many reports of environmental crimes are now being made. It is remarkable, however, how small a proportion of the reports subsequently lead to guilty verdicts. When one looks at the consequences of these judgements, it has to be said that they are fairly light in many cases. I do not think that this is in any way unique to Sweden. These problems certainly exist in a number of Member States, and there are certainly many different reasons for this. One reason may be a lack of knowledge and of resources for investigating environmental crimes through the legal system. At the same time, there is also still an outmoded view that environmental crimes are not as serious as other crimes and that environmental laws are not as binding as other laws. If that is the case, then that is, of course, quite unacceptable. Major financial interests are often at stake. </p>
<p class="contents">At present, it pays to commit environmental crimes because the risk of having a penalty imposed is so small. What is perhaps most remarkable about this is that there are so few countries which can sue legal persons and hold companies liable. Altering this state of affairs is perhaps the most important change which can be made. </p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, this is, in the first place, a responsibility of the Member States, and there should be international cooperation in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">Coordination as a result of this initiative is, of course, also necessary. In addition to the fact that coordination reinforces the work done by the Member States, I would emphasise three other reasons for engaging in this. The first is that many environmental crimes have international consequences, something which many people have emphasised in the course of the debate. The second reason is that, if this Danish initiative is implemented, it will facilitate pan-European environmental cooperation in the Council of Europe and perhaps enable this convention to be complied with. The third reason is that we all know that environmental law is that area of EC law which is least complied with. An initiative like this might also lead to EC law being better observed in the environmental area which is absolutely necessary if we consider how certain directives are followed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sustainability is a really important concept, particularly in times like these. We should try to set an example because the environment is a really important criterion for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should particularly like to come back to Amendment No 3, which concerns the profit motive. The profit motive is also something completely natural and sensible. Companies in the red or countries which get into debt cannot pay the salaries which are desirable for employees and civil servants. We are in favour of high salaries, so we also need to make profits.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, I also support small and medium-sized enterprises. There are 18 million of them in the European Union, on which jobs directly depend. Whether profits or long-term losses are made threatens the company’s existence and in particular, also the jobs it creates.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to come to Amendment No 8 and point out that criminal law is obviously not like occupational practice legislation. I would have liked us to have obtained at least an opinion on this from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market because such issues are, after all, extremely important in principle and in my view, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy cannot deal with them conclusively on its own.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to make it clear that the company’s obligation to gain trust must be defined or interpreted in such a way that it must of course relate to the rules concerning the extent of the authorisation for the plant. The individual company must, of course, be aware of the rules, so that it can then also comply with them.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 19, I should like to say that it can obviously only be taken to mean deliberately providing misleading information, and Amendment No 20 obviously only deals with financial gain. On Amendment No 25, I should like to say that within the insurance industry it is in fact still not possible to calculate or insure pure environmental damage. We would need it to be defined precisely.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, nevertheless, that this proposal is by and large very sensible, especially when we think of enlargement with Central and Eastern European countries. If we create a legal framework for the future now, it could be very useful to our thinking on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am of the opinion that the criminal sanctions should first and foremost only be applied in the case of criminal intent or persistent gross negligence. The threat of imprisonment is an approach that really threatens a person’s livelihood! I should not like to put a worker behind bars and threaten his livelihood because on one occasion, he acts with gross negligence by not turning off a tap. I would therefore suggest that we are extremely cautious with these criteria because this is obviously a very sensitive area.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also think very carefully how to optimise the best practice method in this instance, that is to say, best practice and benchmarking and offering incentives are an important basis particularly for environmental protection. The European Union, in particular, has shown that a great deal can be achieved in this respect with numerous incentives, research and development, and consultation. However, training and certification are obviously necessary too. We have already spoken about EMAS this week. If we follow this positive route via incentives, then we will really be protecting our planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Environmental crime, whether it be the illegal trade in endangered species of flora and fauna or their products, or whether it be the illegal export and dumping of toxic waste in other countries, either inside or outside the European Union, is a growing and increasingly a cross-border problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Those engaged in these crimes in the search for profit hide within the interstices of European law. This cannot be allowed to continue. It is important that we have legislation in place to protect us against serious environmental crime before we see further enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, we have nothing to combat these crimes but derisory financial penalties. We must impose prison sentences as well as serious financial penalties and orders for restitution when people are found guilty of environmental crimes. We must identify as culprits not the victims who drive the lorries full of toxic waste, or hawk the products which threaten species, but those who make the decisions and who supply the goods, the big men and women rather than the little men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">As usual, of course, the devil is in the detail. The Danes want harmonisation in criminal law, increased European cooperation, a register of expertise and know-how and the use of Europol. Some difficulties exist in resolving all of these to the satisfaction of the 15 Member States of the Union. All can be resolved, but some will have to wait. It is probably too early at this stage, for example, to widen Europol’s remit without overloading the work of this important organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal suffers from the same problems we have too often in the European Union. Without increased resources, Europol’s capabilities are limited, but I congratulate Mr Di Lello Finuoli on his report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year that Committee has dealt with a thousand complaints from citizens. Forty percent of those one thousand complaints are associated with violations of Community environmental law. Given these complaints we can appreciate the need for the proposal that we are examining, a Council proposal at the request of the Kingdom of Denmark, and also the need to approve the reports by Mr Di Lello Finuoli and by Mrs Schörling, from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this report covers three important aspects. Firstly, the request that the Council of Europe Convention on the Environment should not only be signed, but also that it should be ratified. No state has ratified the convention so far, but that is not contradictory with adopting this report here today. The report gives a quite correct definition of the parameters that are useful for defining the crime: repeated violations of Community law, the seriousness of the damage and, in some cases, putting profits before any other consideration. We believe that the crimes are often clearly premeditated. Of course they are, Mr President, even in the case of some environmental crimes that appear to be accidental. I well remember the case of Doñana in Spain or of the Danube. It was obvious that a reservoir containing such a large quantity of dangerous products near to a natural park such as Doñana could cause an accident at any time.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr President, I feel that penalties are essential. I am in no doubt about this. Some of the Members here today shed doubt on the need for penalties. I do not. I think that even the ‘polluter pays’ principle is a partial one. Sometimes there are those who prefer to pollute and pay a small amount, which is much less than the profits that they will gain from committing the crime. Penalties are therefore essential, and they need to be designed to act as a deterrent and to be proportional to the damage to citizens’ quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the natural environment should be regenerated. Mr President, is it not acceptable that, in the case of Doñana, public money should be being used to regenerate the area, while the company that caused the major damage has only contributed a small proportion? It is therefore essential to regenerate the damaged environment, and also for legal persons to be liable. Only in the United Kingdom, Finland, and Denmark are there rules that enable legal persons to be held liable.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I would like to mention cooperation between states, which is essential. In the Committee on Petitions, we are aware of the terrible frustration felt by those citizens who take the trouble to report environmental crimes and see that, in Europe, we are incapable of coming to their aid in order to improve the natural environment in which they live and to prevent these crimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is definitely so that when the fines are small, environmental crime becomes lucrative. But we have to remember that this branch of criminality also affects people, people within and outside the workplace. The framework decision would prevent this sort of crime from being profitable. In my opinion, however, the multinational giants are the big problem, and co-operation between the authorities is needed in this area, also so that these regulations might enter into force before enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst environmental crimes are those perpetrated by companies, for which it is just part of their business. Some of these are repeatedly found guilty of these crimes. It is just this repeated, intentional, environmentally criminal activity that is what we should be looking into. I hope that the Commission will make a public register of such companies, as for them it has become just a part of their business. Consumers and people in general could then bring public opinion to bear on the situation. I come from a country where we can initiate criminal proceedings against a corporate body, and that has had an impact and preventive effect there. It is obvious that the director of a company will take a more serious view of the environment, as it is possible that he will end up isolated from it as a result of having gone to prison for criminally abusing it. I therefore think that when people start having to face the consequences, progress will be made in the matter both within the Union and in other respects.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It goes to show that there can be aggressive and progressive action in the Council when it comes specifically to environmental questions. As we know, conscious and intentional misconduct by companies and individuals in environmental matters not only puts our countryside at risk but also endangers people’s lives. </p>
<p class="contents">I am quite convinced that if anyone says the word Teckomatorp in my country, Sweden, then everyone – or at any rate the majority of people – knows what the word signifies, even though it is an environmental crime which was committed more than 20 years ago. It concerned a company which did not manage to deal with its poisonous waste but chose instead to bury it in the ground and in that way put a whole district at risk. Unfortunately, Teckomatorp is not the only event of this kind, and many representatives here in Parliament have also witnessed other events which have occurred since then, not to mention the situation – akin to that in the Wild West – which prevails on our high seas. </p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, we must regard environmental crimes as seriously as we regard all other criminal acts. Common definitions of environmental crime are therefore also needed. I agreed with the draftsperson of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Mrs Schörling, that, in order to prevent environmental crime, we also need effective legislation governing environmental liability. Preventive measures are the best way of guarding against further crimes against our environment. </p>
<p class="contents">If we are to be able to investigate suspected environmental crimes efficiently and well, special knowledge is also required on the part of both police and prosecutors. Otherwise, there is a danger of these crimes’ not being properly investigated. If these crimes are not detected quickly, they can remain unsolved or perhaps not have anything done about them at all. </p>
<p class="contents">In the few seconds I have left, I want to address the Commission directly with the request which, among others, Mrs Thors and Mrs McKenna mentioned in connection with the transport of livestock, instances of which occur every day within the Union and which are perhaps the most obvious environmental crimes we face today. I should like the Commissioner to take this issue seriously on board and ensure that we get something done about the current situation. I really believe we have the citizens of the entire Union behind us when it comes to doing something about the dreadful ways in which livestock are transported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, honourable Members, I think I can say with regard to your last request that I would be happy to accept it along these lines. The Commission takes the view that the initiative of the Kingdom of Denmark for a Council Framework Decision basically consists of two parts. The first part should lead to any serious culpable breach of environmental legislation within the Community being punishable with criminal sanctions which are effective and act as a deterrent. It puts forward a minimum standard with regard to criminal acts. The initiative mainly focuses on this part, which in essence corresponds to the provisions of a convention which was adopted by the Council of Europe in November 1998. Unfortunately, none of the Member States – and this has also been pointed out several times here – has ratified this convention yet. I can therefore understand Denmark’s initiative, which now seeks to deal with this issue afresh within the framework of the Community powers.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part, on the other hand, contains provisions on improving cooperation and the exchange of information between the law enforcement authorities and the courts of law of the Member States. There is a lot to be said for an all­embracing approach to such issues of legal assistance and improved cooperation within the judicial field that is not limited just to environmental law. In accordance with this, a Council working group – one speaker has gone into it already – is currently working just on the first part of the initiative, that is, on substantive criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already several initiatives and proposals on improving cooperation in criminal law matters, which are not limited to environmental criminal law. A primary aim of the Treaty of Amsterdam and one of the Communities’ general objectives is to improve mutual legal assistance, the exchange of information and other forms of cooperation between the courts and the public prosecution authorities of the Member States, in order to create a genuine area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need for this are very clear and transparent provisions, which are easy to deal with, and to which the individual authorities can quickly refer when applying the law. The Commission takes the view that in order to achieve this and counteract fragmentation within the field of justice, the rules on legal assistance should have as much general applicability as possible. Special provisions, such as in environmental law, should only be made when required and as an exception. With this in mind, the European Judicial Network was established in 1998 through a joint action. It has started its work and is developing many activities to make legal assistance and the exchange of information easier. Of course, the Commission takes the view that this must be developed further.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as the international convention already in existence on legal assistance and mutual recognition of judgements, further Community actions are planned in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission very much welcomes the first part of Denmark’s initiative. Until now, the environment has certainly not been protected as legal property by criminal law in all Member States. While some Member States have specified particular environmental offences in their criminal law, this is not the case with others. A serious breach of environmental law is therefore not necessarily punishable in every Member State. This is then naturally to some extent an incentive for cross­border environmental crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">The overall lack of enforcement in environmental protection cannot, of course, be corrected by criminal law measures alone, but here too, this framework decision would certainly provide new impetus. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the question has already been raised as to whether the existing Community law of the first pillar already contains adequate obligations for the Member States. On this subject, it must be said that the instruments of the first pillar frequently provide for sanctions, but these do not necessarily need to be in the form of criminal law. Under the first pillar, it is in principle up to the Member States whether they regard sanctions of administrative law as adequate or whether they take up the sharper sword of criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention one point, which still appears problematic from the Commission’s point of view, and which has also been mentioned in different speeches here, and that is the question of the punishability of legal persons. The Danish initiative provides that legal persons must be made responsible under criminal law for serious environmental offences. In the Commission’s view, however, account must be taken of the mature legislation of some Member States, which generally rules out punishing legal persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Comparable provisions of Community law merely provide that sanctions should be imposed on legal persons, which may then be entirely in the form of administrative law, and – as has rightly been said repeatedly – that the material damage caused is then punished by financial penalties. This is also included. On the question of financial penalties, I should once again like to point out the significance of the Green Paper – which the Commission published a few months ago – on environmental liability, which ultimately aims to include the environmental damage caused.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interest of the initiative’s chances of implementation, it may well be advisable to proceed in this case by talking about responsibility of legal persons without using the words “under criminal law”. Irrespective of this, however, the persons responsible for serious environmental offences should, of course, also be subject to criminal law. There was in fact unanimous agreement on this in this very interesting debate.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, may I say, on behalf of the Commission, that, unfortunately, we are repeatedly having to instigate infringement proceedings against Member States in matters of environmental law, and there is a large number of infringement proceedings pending in this self-same sector. Unfortunately, this gives the overall impression that perhaps many Member States do not take the area of environmental protection and environmental law so seriously after all. Against this background, the Danish initiative is very noteworthy and significant from the Commission’s point of view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>Relations between the European Union and Morocco are based on the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement, signed on 26 February 1999, which came into force on 1 March 2000, and on the Barcelona Process which establishes the framework for relations between the EU and the countries of the southern Mediterranean. This agreement, the same type as those proposed to other Mediterranean partners under the Barcelona Process, should make it possible to strengthen the already privileged links that exist between the European Union and Morocco by establishing relations based on reciprocity, codevelopment and dialogue.</p>
<p>This agreement forms part of an overall cooperation strategy intended to establish, in a spirit of partnership, an area of political stability and economic prosperity throughout the entire Euro-Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>Respect for democratic principles and human rights forms an important part of the agreement. The bodies created under the agreement, the Association Council of ministers and the Association Committee of civil servants, meet once a year, providing a forum for dialogue on all the aspects covered by the agreement, including the political aspects.</p>
<p>The agreement provides for the development of trade with a view to implementing a Euro-Mediterranean free exchange area by 2010. To this end, it contributes to cooperation in economical and financial, human, social and cultural fields. The implementation of this agreement is broadly supported by the European Union under a financial cooperation arrangement. This has been in place since 1996, particularly through the MEDA regulation. Between 1996 and 1999, MEDA allocated EUR 581 million to Morocco. Between 1996 and 1998 the MEDA-Democracy programme allocated financial support of around EUR 2.4 million to projects in the field of democracy and human rights. In addition, since 1996, the EIB has granted Morocco EUR 392 million in loans to contribute mainly to funding major infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>In the area of agriculture, the agreement includes a periodic review clause providing for negotiations, as of this year, on the conditions for the gradual liberalisation of agricultural trade. These negotiations will cover a number of sensitive products, as shown recently by the dispute arising after the quota for Moroccan tomato exports allowed into the Community market duty free was exceeded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission will be looking into appropriate proposals to open negotiations with Morocco as soon as possible in order to pursue mutually advantageous cooperation in the fisheries sector. These new arrangements will have to be obtained in the spirit of partnership.</p>
<p>On 11 October 1999, the Council adopted an Action Plan for Morocco, as the country of origin of many asylum seekers and immigrants, with a view to investigating solutions to the deep-seated causes of emigration from this country as part of an overall approach. Two investigative teams have already visited Morocco in order to establish an ongoing dialogue with the relevant authorities regarding emigration. The Council meeting on 29 May 2000 welcomed the progress achieved in implementing this Action Plan.</p>
<p>The Council considers that the various instruments set in place in this way, the establishment of regular political dialogue under the Association Agreement, and the prospects for future cooperation justify looking forward with confidence to deepening relations between the European Union and this extremely important partner.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0580"></a>

<p>Liberia continues to suffer from the effects of the seven years of civil war (1989-96). GDP per capita remains at around US$ 200, or roughly one third of the pre-war level. Government capacity is very poor, and there is still hardly any electricity.</p>
<p>The United States have significantly reduced their aid programme to Liberia compared to pre-war levels. As of today, the Community is probably the most important donor in the country. The Commission re-opened an office in the capital Monrovia in 1999. Since the end of the civil conflict in Liberia in 1996, the Community has gradually phased out its humanitarian emergency assistance programmes and switched towards multi-sector rehabilitation programmes. A first programme of EUR 25 m has been implemented from 1994 to 1998. A second programme of EUR 27 m is presently under implementation. It concentrates on providing vital services to the population such as water and drug supplies, resettlement of returnees, rehabilitation of basic rural infrastructures. These programmes are widely seen as having played an important role in stabilising Liberia after the civil war.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully committed to continue providing essential services to the Liberian population.

<p>In the EU Member States there are numerous NGOs working for the development of the areas bordering the EU. These associations carry out really valuable grass-roots work in towns, villages and the countryside.</p>
<p>Fund-raising for these associations is carried out on a voluntary basis, often through neighbourly mutual-aid events.

Some form of action would be in the general interest of the whole EU.</p>
<p>In the areas neighbouring the EU what is needed is in many cases to give a boost to fundamental activities, such as creating an entrepreneurial culture, familiarisation with harvesting and storage procedures for agricultural products, etc. In these areas working on one’s own initiative has to be relearned.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the role of non-governmental organisations in the development of areas bordering the European Union, particularly on the Finland-Russia border. It will continue to encourage their participation in European Union programmes in two forms:</p>
<p>- Interreg does not stipulate any maximum or minimum scale for the selection of a project, or any restrictions on the participation of a partner. Any non-governmental organisation may therefore take part in an Interreg programme.</p>

<p>In this connection, the Commission would like to mention the existence, for example, of the LIEN (Link Inter-European NGOs) programme which calls for the participation of non-governmental organisations in small-scale projects (maximum EUR 200 000) intended to boost the social aspects of civil society in the countries concerned.</p>
<p>Moreover, under the TACIS CBC (Cross Border Cooperation) programme, the Commission has always encouraged NGOs to participate in the Small Project Facility in order to improve the economic and social situation of border regions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0584"></a>

<p>In an answer to a previous question<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>1 the Commission welcomed the discussions which took place during the hearing on radio, held on 24 May 2000, which confirmed the support from the public that radio enjoys. The meeting also helped to indicate, on the basis of the opinion of the experts who participated in the hearing, that in their view there is a possible market failure which may manifest itself in the period 2010-2015. It is precisely this timescale which makes the approach of "technological neutrality" adopted by the Commission, most appropriate, given the rate at which technologies develop. It has, however, to be borne in mind that local radio lacks a trans-national -European- dimension, which as a result renders the notion of circulation of radio content void of any meaning; nonetheless the Commission is very vigilant on the respect from national authorities of the principle of non-discrimination and freedom of establishment in delivering radio licences to Community operators. Moreover, on the basis of recent studies, radio is one of the most dynamic and flourishing sectors in the audiovisual.</p>
<p>The Commission is interested in a rapid take up of digital services in Europe, including radio, as demonstrated by the recently launched eEurope initiative. The Commission, however, cannot interfere with the preferences of consumers and considers that digital radio can best be administered by existing legislation. The speed of introduction of new radio services only depends on the added value of those services. It should, therefore, be left to the market, broadcasters, consumers and industry to decide which services are to be chosen. Maximising the benefits of digital radio will require a balance in the interest of consumers, broadcasters and the manufacturing industry.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Seventy-seven project proposals were submitted in response to the Call for Proposals for the Obnova 2000 Integrated Return Programme for Bosnia and Herzegovina. These were submitted by thirty-three NGOs from Member States, one NGO from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the United Nations Development Programme. The proposals received were evaluated strictly in accordance with the criteria and methodology specified in the documentation provided to the organisations which had expressed an interest to participate in the programme. The Commission had, in particular, integrated into the selection process recommendations made by the Court of Auditors.</p>
<p>As a result of the evaluation, it was recommended that projects proposed by the following organisations be selected for implementation under the programme:</p>
<p>International Rescue Committee Spain, Active in BiH for 5 years</p>
<p>Dorcas-Dutch, Active in BiH for 6 years</p>
<p>Arbeiter Samariter Bund-German, Active in BiH for 4 years</p>
<p>Danish Refugee Council-Danish, Active in BiH for 7 years</p>
<p>Mercy Corps Europe/Scottish European Aid-British, Active in BiH for 5 years</p>
<p>Hilfswerk-Austrian, Active in BiH for 4 years</p>
<p>World Vision- German, Active in BiH 3 years</p>
<p>Nuova Frontiera-Italian, Active in BiH for 3 years</p>
<p>UNDP-International, Active in BiH for 3 years</p>
<p>Many of these organisations have been active in the Western Balkans region for considerably longer periods than they have been active in BiH. Thirteen contracts have now been signed and the remainder should be signed in the coming days. This will allow substantial implementation of this year’s programme to take place in the current construction season and will further encourage the positive developments in return which have occurred this year.</p>
<p>Since 1996 nearly EUR 527 million has been committed under the Obnova programme and more than EUR 287 million under the Phare programme for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Numerous contracts have been awarded under both programmes. Information on the Obnova and Phare programmes in Bosnia and Herzegovina is available on the following internet site:</p>
<p>http://www.seerecon.org/Bosnia/Bosnia-DonorPrograms/Bosnia-Donors-EC/Bosnia-Donors-EC.htm</p>
<p>The contracts awarded under each programme, the selected contractor, the value of the contract and its status (finished or ongoing) are listed. This site will be updated following signature of all the Integrated Return Programme contracts.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently engaged in collating extensive information on all contracts awarded following tendering in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1 January 1999. It is intended to publish the following matters in relation to each tender: the number of companies expressing an interest in the tender, the identity of the short listed companies, the number of tenders received, the final score of the winning tenderer, the date of award of the contract and the contract value.

<p>The Commission does not have full information, and it has not for the moment been possible to completely verify the information at its disposal. Greece will shortly be asked to submit its observations.</p>
<p>Subject to the above reservations, this tax has all the appearance of a charge having equivalent effect to a customs duty on imports, in contravention of Articles 23 and 25 (ex Articles 9 and 12) of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The chargeable event appears to constitute the entry into Greek waters of a pleasure boat more than 7 metres in length, which does not reside permanently in Greece. This tax appears, therefore, to represent a pecuniary charge imposed unilaterally on Community goods (in this instance, pleasure boats) by virtue of crossing a frontier. If that is the case, it meets the definition of a charge having equivalent effect to a customs duty on imports.</p>
<p>It also does not appear to be covered by one of the three exceptions which permit a charge not to be characterised as a charge having equivalent effect (namely charges forming part of a general system of internal dues; consideration for a service actually determined and individually rendered to the person liable for payment of the charge, of an amount proportionate to the said service; charges imposed by reason of checks carried out in order to fulfil obligations under Community law).</p>
<p>As there are doubts concerning the compatibility of the taxes on entry examined with Community law, the Commission will be contacting Greece in order to clarify the situation.

<p>The Commission is aware of the rumours concerning the alleged ban by the Chinese authorities of a Sprite commercial, made by the Coca-Cola Company, featuring the Taiwanese pop star Sherry Chang Huei-mei. The Commission is also aware of the alleged warning to PRC and Hong Kong companies about trading with certain Taiwanese firms. However, it is not clear whether the alleged ban and the alleged warning were carried out by the order, or with the knowledge, of the central Chinese Government.</p>
<p>It is difficult in instances of this kind to obtain clear evidence of exactly what has taken place. Recent information, however, seems to indicate that new commercials featuring Sherry Chang Huei-mei will encounter no problems. Furthermore, the Chinese authorities have issued statements to the effect that they refrained from interfering in Hong Kong's internal affairs. The Hong Kong Government has also issued a statement stating that investors and businessmen operating in Hong Kong are free to chose their business partners.</p>
<p>However, the Commission shares the concerns expressed by the Honourable Member. From the moment China enters the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the terms of accession become legally binding, the Commission will be paying close attention to the implementation and enforcement of those commitments by the Chinese authorities. Other WTO members will do likewise.</p>
<p>In addition, the operation of a new, multilateral mechanism to review annually China's adherence to WTO obligations is currently under discussion as part of the protocol of accession. The Commission itself will also focus efforts on assisting China, through targeted aid programmes, in adapting to the demands of full participation in the world trading system.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0533"></a>

<p>Last year, the government of the Madrid Autonomous Community, with the support of all the parliamentary groups represented in the Regional Assembly and MEPs including myself, signed an agreement on employment with the Comisiones Obreras and UGT trade union organisations, with the goal of encouraging the creation of stable jobs and finding employment for particularly disadvantaged groups such as the physically and mentally handicapped, by establishing specific clauses to this effect in contracts between the Autonomous Community’s administration and companies putting in for public tenders. The agreement was warmly welcomed by the public, but was contested, however, by certain employers’ organisations, which asked for the matter to be considered by the Commission.</p>

<p>After several ad hoc meetings with the Spanish authorities, the Commission sent a letter on 12 April 2000 to the Spanish Government in order to inform it of its views on Decree No 213/1998 of 17 December, by means of which the Madrid Autonomous Community intended to implement the framework agreement in order to support the stability and quality of employment, and offered it an opportunity to present its comments on these views. This decree appears to infringe Community directives coordinating procedures for the award of public procurement contracts, insofar as it obliges the public authorities concerned to introduce the creation or preservation of sustainable jobs by the tendering firms as a criterion for the award of such contracts. The fact is, however, that in the context of completing the internal market, the directives stipulate, firstly, that observance of the principles of non-discrimination and equal treatment, among others, must be guaranteed and, secondly, that public procurement contracts must be justified on the basis of the lowest acceptable offer. Under such circumstances, a contract may not be awarded on the basis of a firm’s structure but only on the basis of the details of the tender submitted.</p>
<p>In view of the priority given to employment in Community policy, the Member States have undertaken to implement measures to promote employment or to pay special attention to disadvantaged persons or groups of people (the disabled, ethnic minorities, etc) within the labour market. Both sides of industry have been encouraged to participate actively – with the support of the national authorities – in implementing the guidelines for employment adopted by the Council for the year 2000, within the framework established by and in accordance with Community law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0534"></a>

<p>The only situations likely to justify authorising measures to compensate fishermen for temporary cessation of fishing activities, for reasons relating to the state of resources, are those provided for in Article 12(6) and Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 (1), laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector. According to the first of these provisions, the “Member States may introduce nationally financed accompanying social measures for fishermen in order to facilitate temporary cessation of fishing activities in the framework of plans for the protection of aquatic resources”. The second provision stipulates that Member States may grant compensation in the circumstances that are subsequently defined in Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) 2792/1999.</p>

<p>Trade promotion and cooperation is one of the core elements in Union policy towards the Western Balkans, embodied both with the EU Stabilisation and Association process and the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe. To this end and following a request made by the Lisbon European Council of 23/24 March, the Commission has proposed (on 7 June 2000) an extension of the existing Community autonomous trade preferences for these countries in the form of a single new Council Regulation.</p>
<p>It is proposed to abolish the remaining tariff ceilings for certain industrial products from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia and to improve substantially the market access for agricultural products from these countries. Furthermore, the extension of these preferences to Kosovo (as defined by UNSC Resolution) and the granting of tariff quotas for Montenegrin aluminium products are envisaged.</p>
<p>These exceptional trade measures providing for almost completely duty-free treatment of imports from these countries have only a small impact on the Community market but can make a big difference in efforts to stimulate economic activity and trade in the region. They are proposed in response to the specific situation in the Western Balkans and will not constitute a precedent for Community trade policy with other countries.</p>
<p>In addition to trade issues, the Commission is carrying out other actions which can strengthen the export capacity of the Western Balkans, within the Stability Pact. It is actively contributing to the « Investment Compact », a comprehensive strategy including revision of banking legislation and privatisation of public enterprises and utilities; Capital Markets; Foreign Direct Investment conditions; Commercial Law; Accounting. The Commission supports other initiatives involving the direct participation of the private sector, such as the Business Advisory Council. The Commission is providing specific assistance to strengthen the custom administration, especially in countries such as Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>Infrastructure is also important to improve export capacity in the region. Since the Regional Funding Conference on 29 – 30 March) considerable progress has been made by the Commission/World Bank and European Investment Bank to complete the financing plans of the 35 Quick Start projects in infrastructure. The Overall picture is satisfactory. The Commission has pledged EUR 330 million to support 17 infrastructures projects. Out of 35 projects, financing agreements have been signed in 9 cases and donors have expressed sufficient interest to cover the total costs in 16 cases.

<p>This matter was indeed discussed in the Council’s preparatory meetings before the deadline of 31 December 1998. The conclusion was that the opportune moment had not yet arrived for the Community to opt for a procedure other than the one which is currently applicable, i.e. the arbitration procedure. In other words, at this stage, the Council did not opt for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea as an alternative to arbitration.</p>
<p>The opinion of the Commission and the Member States is that the International Tribunal has not yet issued enough significant rulings to afford a clear insight into the legal attitude of this new international court and that, consequently, it is not certain that referring cases to the Tribunal would provide the Community with a dispute settlement procedure that would be an improvement on arbitration.</p>

<p>In the accession negotiations with all candidate countries, environment has a high priority. In its general position for the accession conferences related to the opening of the negotiations with each candidate country, the Community explicitly underlined the need to ensure a high level of environmental protection, which includes giving priority to the transposition and implementation of industry-related legislation, and legislation against trans-boundary pollution.</p>
<p>This applies particularly to Romania, whose legal framework and administrative capacity with respect to the environment are still weak. In this respect, the Commission is currently proposing to increase the Phare assistance to Romania devoted to environment. To that end, it included an EUR 8 million project to further harmonise Romania’s legal framework with the ‘Acquis Communautaire’, and to strengthen its administrative capacity at both central and local level in the Phare 2000 National Programme. Moreover, several projects for reducing the trans-boundary pollution were also included in the Phare 2000 cross-border cooperation programmes with Hungary and with Bulgaria. All of these programmes will soon be formally adopted.</p>
<p>In parallel to the assistance necessary to improve both the legal framework and administrative capacity in this sector, there is also a huge need for investment in Romania. Under Agenda 2000, pre-accession aid to assist candidate countries in bearing the costs of accession has been substantially increased. In particular, the new Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-accession (ISPA) will provide around EUR 800 million over seven years to environmental infrastructure investments in Romania. In this framework, the process of project identification and preparation is ongoing, priority being given to the improvement of wastewater treatment and waste management.</p>
<p>Finally, on the specific issue of safeguarding ecological hotspots, the Commission is of the opinion that they should first be precisely identified and risks assessed. To that end, the international task force set up by the Commission following the Baia Mare cyanide spill into the River Tisza will shortly (this summer) issue a report “The Inventory of the Potentially Polluting Sources in the Somes-Tisa Hydrographic Basin”, listing 'high risk sites' in the mining and extractive industries covering Romania, Hungary, Ukraine and Slovakia.

<p>The assessments and analyses at the recent New York 'Women 2000' meeting, the 'Beijing plus five' review held from 5 to 9 June 2000, show that policies based on microcredit for women who lack resources are producing excellent results. The modest financial support that they receive helps to empower many women economically, enabling them to take up an occupation, surmount crises, or set up their own businesses. The EU, however, offers no such ways out to those unable to contribute even a little capital. Would the Commission be willing to explore the opportunities at regional or local level for microcredit and experimental projects along similar lines? Would it be possible to work together to that end with national, regional, or local bodies, and with the European Investment Bank?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is very much aware that access to capital is a primary barrier encountered by women entrepreneurs. At the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly on Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the twenty-first Century, the Community supported the promotion of women's entrepreneurship. As a follow-up of the Outcome Document agreed at the Special Session, the European Commission will continue to encourage the development of micro-finance instruments.</p>
<p>In the proposal for a Council Decision on a Multiannual Programme for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship (2001 – 2005), the Commission, in response to the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council, has proposed that future guarantee policy will focus on venture capital, micro-credits and small and medium sized enterprises (SME) loans. These actions will be managed by the European Investment Fund (EIF) and implemented through the different schemes existing in each Member State.</p>
<p>The Community Action Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men (1996-2000) has cofunded transnational projects involving women, non governmental organisations (NGOs) and banks aimed at exchanging information and experience on good practice on the issue of difficulties which women encounter in accessing finance.</p>
<p>The Structural Funds, especially the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, from 1994-99, have supported women starting their own company by providing financial assistance, training and support services. The "New Opportunities for Women" (NOW) strand of the EMPLOYMENT Community Initiative which funded innovative transnational projects testing new approaches largely has contributed to strengthening women's entrepreneurship and to develop women-friendly finance. The new Structural Funds regulations (2000-2006) will continue to provide financial support for women who would like to become entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, it is for the Member States and Regional Authorities responsible for the implementation of the Structural Funds Programmes to ensure that this takes place.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0551"></a>

<p>On 1 May 1999, Professor Anton Pelinka commented on the Italian television channel RAI on previous statements made by the Freedom Party's Jörg Haider in connection with national socialism. On 11 May 2000, a court in Vienna (Landesgericht für Strafsachen) found Professor Pelinka guilty of slandering Jörg Haider during the broadcast and ordered him to pay a fine of ATS 60 000. Mr Haider was represented by his lawyer, Dieter Böhmdorfer, who is now Austria's Justice Minister.</p>
<p>Are Professor Pelinka's remarks not completely within the bounds of acceptability in a democracy? The question is whether the Austrian court is guilty of serious encroachment on freedom of expression in general and academic freedom in particular, given that Austria is a member of the Council of Europe and of the EU, the founding Treaty of which lays down, in Article 6(2), that the Union shall, as general principles, respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>

<p>Regulation 443/92 provides the legal basis for Budget lines B7-300 and B7-311 to which the honourable Member refers. The priority activities for this spending, as established in the regulation, cover, in the case of B7-300, assistance to Asian developing countries, to be targeted primarily on the poorest section of the population and the poorest countries, in particular for the development of the rural sector and improving food security. In the case of B7-311 (economic cooperation with Latin America), the main areas of activity financed aim to establish relations between European and Latin American enterprises, training and institution building, and to promote investment as a source of jobs and income for developing countries. The Commission is following these policy orientations in its implementation of these budget lines.</p>
<p>In addition to cooperation under the Asia/Latin America Regulation, the Commission also seeks to promote civil society initiatives relating to democratisation and human rights through Chapter B7-7 of the budget and the human rights Regulation 975/99. However, the Commission has not received requests from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), trade unions or other local initiatives for support for monitoring the impact of European investments, either from this or from the budget lines mentioned above.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the promotion of social justice and the protection of labour and human rights are best achieved through support for good governance and the rule of law. This is a central objective of the Community's cooperation in Asian and Latin American developing countries. Community action should seek to improve the legal environment for all workers, and not only those employed by Community enterprises, who form a minority of the working population.</p>
<p>The Commission also believes that the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises (MNE) are a very useful instrument to promote responsible corporate behaviour, given that they are endorsed by countries representing the source of most foreign direct investment, which recommend their application wherever in the world an MNE operates. On 27 June 2000, OECD Members (and Argentina, Brazil and Chile) endorsed at Ministerial level a revision of the Guidelines, including provisions for their promotion and implementation by adhering governments. Both the Commission and the Member States were particularly active in this revision. The new Guidelines include recommendations to MNEs on human rights, consumer protection and the principle of precaution, and update the recommendations on employment relations to reflect recent International Labour Organisation (ILO) developments on core labour standards, abolition of child labour and forced labour. Adhering governments will actively promote the Guidelines among their MNEs and will adapt or set up ex novo National Contact Points to deal with all matter related to the Guidelines that could be raised by any interested party. The Commission will now reflect on what it could or should do to promote observance of the Guidelines by European MNEs in addition to what Member States will do.</p>
<p>No service of the Commission has been allocated responsibility for the setting of standards for Community enterprises operating in developing countries, as this is not an area in which the Commission has plans for action. However, responsibility for the OECD guidelines lies with the Unit of Directorate General (DG) Trade dealing with Investment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0559"></a>

<p>In the rural development programmes, as provided for under Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999, the Member States can propose the cofinancing of measures to combat erosion and desertification, for the afforestation of agricultural or other land, and other schemes intended to protect the environment and limit the effects of desertification. In the case of the afforestation of agricultural land, the aid serves to provide compensation for – in addition to the costs of planting and maintenance for a period of five years – the loss of revenue due to afforestation up to a maximum period of twenty years. In the case of agro-environmental measures, aid is intended to provide compensation for the additional costs resulting from the commitments given and the loss of revenue suffered. The sums allocated also take account of the need to provide some financial incentive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0566"></a>

<p>Restructuring aid is the most distortive type of aid the Commission may authorise. Therefore the Commission has set out very strict criteria for approving such aid in its "Community Guidelines on rescue and restructuring aid to firms in difficulties".</p>
<p>As regards SKL-Motoren- und Systemtechnik GmbH (SKL-M), the Commission did not cause the long duration of the investigation procedure. The key reason has been that the potential investor in the second restructuring of SKL-M was not prepared to make a real commitment to take over the company. Without such a commitment the restructuring concept was not credible and aid granted to SKL-M could not be approved. Another main problem influencing the length of the procedure of SKL-M lies in the privatisation and failed first restructuring of the company as part of the LINTRA group. The delay of providing information on the first restructuring also held up the procedure on SKL-M.</p>
<p>As concerns Kranbau Köthen GmbH, the information submitted at the time of the notification in December 1997 was very incomplete. There were also sufficiently clear indications of the incompatibility of the aid measures with the Guidelines to raise doubts as to the acceptability of the aid. A formal investigation was opened in February 1998. Germany started to reply in August 1998. Only by the end of 1998, the Commission had sufficient information to reach a reasoned decision in this case.</p>
<p>However, Germany submitted thereafter a stream of information amending and correcting previous information. In November 1999 the Commission received again information, which substantially revised earlier information and which could have already been supplied in December 1997. This meant that at a late stage in the investigation the Commission was obliged to begin its analysis again on basic aspects of the case.</p>
<p>It is clear that such problems in obtaining information must have serious consequences for rapid and effective decision-making by the Commission. As in the case of SKL-M the Commission has demonstrated its readiness to await the information from the Member State.</p>
<p>The Commission must balance the benefits of restructuring aid to the recipient against the harm done to other firms. The Community Guidelines set out factors to be taken into account when assessing such aid. They include economic, social and regional aspects.</p>
<p>In the case of restructuring aid in eastern Germany, important concessions have been made in the application of this framework to cope with the transition process there as a response to an unprecedented politico-economic challenge. Special aid regimes were in place until the end of 1995 and other concessions continued thereafter. The last formal concession concerning an exception to the so-called ‘one time, last time’ principle.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0576"></a>

<p>On the pretext of tackling the enormous range of illnesses and on the grounds that the cloning of embryos for research purposes is not the same as the cloning of humans, the British Government has launched a process to amend the current legal framework in order to permit the cloning of human embryos to be used as ‘spare parts warehouses’ for tissues and living organs, prompting serious concerns. </p>
<p>In view of the fact that many extremely important medical, ethical and social questions remain unanswered, that there are no safeguards to prevent ‘therapeutic’ cloning escaping from checks of any kind and resulting in the production of children ‘to order’, that the hazy boundaries between scientific motives and the profit mania of the pharmaceutical multinationals and monopolies have not been fixed and that there has been no decision on who is to have social and political responsibility for questions which concern human existence itself, namely life and death, can the Commission state the exact content of the planned legal framework for the cloning of embryos and say what measures it intends to take to prevent developments which might be a sort of Trojan horse for the renewal of attempts to clone humans, with unforeseen and possibly dramatic consequences for humankind?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Recent advances in the isolation and culture of human stem cells have opened up new prospects of hope for medical treatment possibilities but have also started (or resurrected) a debate on the ethical issues related to this type of research and to its potential future applications.</p>
<p>The ethical aspects concerned are related, among other things, to:</p>
<p>1) the source of these cells, which may be obtained from foetal tissue or human embryos;</p>
<p>2) the potential use of cloning techniques, with a view to obtaining, for transplant purposes, cell lines that are perfectly immuno-compatible with a potential transplant recipient;</p>
<p>While these are all complex ethical issues, they are nonetheless not completely new ones. The potential impact of this research in the field of public health, however, is far in excess of the impact of embryological research undertaken until now, which was mainly concerned with the area of reproduction and the study of embryo development. We can now combine the possibilities afforded by progress in genetics and in cell biology. </p>
<p>We must therefore intensify the debate on the balance between the potential benefits for health and public welfare, on the one hand, and the ethical costs of this type of research, on the other.</p>
<p>The European Group on Ethics in Sciences and New Technologies has therefore taken up the issue and plans to issue an opinion by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In its previous opinions, the European Group on Ethics (EGE) has already defined a number of fundamental ethical principles.</p>
<p>For example, in May 1997, it issued an opinion, at the Commission’s request, on the ethical aspects of cloning technology.</p>
<p>“A clear distinction must be drawn between reproductive cloning aimed at the birth of identical individuals ... and non-reproductive cloning, limited to the ‘in vitro’ phase.”</p>
<p>Reproductive cloning has been unequivocally and unanimously condemned not only at Community level but also, more generally, at international level. The EGE opinion recommends that this type of cloning be prohibited. At Community level, research into reproductive cloning is explicitly excluded from the Research Programmes funded by the EU, and Directive 98/44/CE (Article 6) on patenting of the living organism excludes procedures for the cloning of human beings. </p>
<p>The use of cloning technology to enable the creation of specific cell lines may have considerable implications for medical treatment. When such research involves the use of stem cells obtained from human embryos or when it leads to the development of embryos, complex ethical questions are raised relating to embryological research.</p>
<p>In its opinion of 23 November 1998 on ethical aspects of research involving the use of human embryo, the EGE specified the following:</p>
<p>- “The human embryo, whatever the moral or legal status conferred upon it in the different European cultures and ethical approaches, deserves legal protection”. “It is crucial to place human embryo research, in the countries where it is permitted, under strict public control”.</p>
<p>- “At Community level”, “taking into account the moral and philosophical differences” between the Member states, “it would be inappropriate to impose one exclusive moral code”. However, “the respect of pluralism does not justify a laissez-faire attitude”. Community funding for human embryo research should “only be granted under very strict conditions”.</p>
<p>- “Maximum transparency” must apply “whether the research in question is carried out by either the public or private sector. Indeed, such transparency ... provides the best guarantee against major risks of arbitrary experimentation”.</p>
<p>- “European citizens have a right to be clearly informed about the conflicting values that research is currently facing, as well as to be put in a position to evaluate the responsibilities implied for society as a whole”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0578"></a>

<p>The main instrument for the Commission to monitor the overall progress of the candidate countries in their preparation is the Regular Report presented to the European Council. Such annual reports have been prepared since 1998, and work has been initiated with subsequent reports to be presented in November, taking into account all progress achieved so far and identifying additional efforts still needed in order to meet all the obligations of Union membership. The importance and impact of these reports have been enhanced, since they are public documents available to the broad public. Therefore, these reports are also available to non-governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
<p>Under PHARE, a new project called “Access” will be launched this year, the aim being to give financial support to NGOs in Poland dealing with environment, economic and social issues related to enlargement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a recent Communication, the Commission outlined a new communication strategy on enlargement, the principal goal being to communicate to the public in the Member States and the applicant countries the reasons for enlargement, its likely impact and the challenges it poses. The aim is to facilitate preparations for enlargement in the Member States and the candidate countries by improving public understanding of the process. This strategy will involve political institutions, civil society, business and industry and foresees shared responsibilities between the Commission, which has a duty to provide information in an objective and transparent way, and opinion leaders, who are engaged in delivering messages suited to their own political context. Moreover, Commission representations in the member states and Commission delegations in the candidate countries will develop their communications activities in conjunction with relevant governmental and non-governmental bodies.</p>
<p>The Member of the Commission responsible for environment policy has taken the initiative of organising a regular dialogue with environmental NGOs from candidate countries.

<p>It is true that the level of effective cooperation between government bodies and representatives of labour and management varies from one Member State to the other. The weakness of such cooperation or effective dialogue in some countries is particularly regrettable in the field of employment and with regard to the necessary modernisation of the European social model.</p>
<p>In both fields, strong social partner involvement can improve the quality and legitimacy of the decisions to be taken and help to their successful implementation.</p>
<p>On the level of the Community, social partners are fully involved in the legislative process in the social policy field. They are formally consulted on every legal initiative in this field and can themselves conclude agreements which, through the procedure laid down in art. 138/139 of the EC Treaty, can become Community law. They are also consulted on other policies with strong social implications.</p>
<p>Furthermore in the context of the macro-economic dialogue and their participation in Community bodies such as the standing Committee for Employment, social partners are directly associated to economic and social policy making.</p>
<p>Social partner involvement in employment matters on a national level is one of the issues annually examined when monitoring the measures taken to implement the employment guidelines and some progress seems obvious since the launch of the Luxembourg process.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission, in its Communication on the Social Policy Agenda, has announced that it will invite the social partners to launch, at European level, the development of common objectives to serve as a reference for social partners' actions at national level on the basis of the employment guidelines.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to work for further progress and is ready to assist social partner action through the relevant budget lines.</p>

<p>The Commission has presented its proposal for a regulation establishing technical measures to correct the situation of certain populations of highly migratory species.</p>
<p>Amongst other things the regulation incorporates the 1998 and 1999 ICCAT (International Council for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna) recommendations on restricting fishing capacity or activities in respect of white tuna by limiting the number of vessels which will in future be allowed to fish to the average recorded during the 1993-1995 period. In view of the fact that European white tuna fishing in the North Atlantic involves vessels from various Member States using a variety of fishing techniques (troll lining, live bait, pelagic trawl and drift netting) and with a wide range of individual fishing capacity, and given that the ICCAT regards it as essential that fishing effort should be converted and weighted according to the technique used, would the Commission answer the following questions?</p>
<p>Has it checked and validated the information supplied by the Member States as regards the number of vessels authorised in the 1993-1995 period with a view to establishing the average number thereof as a reference? How does it envisage compliance with the ICCAT recommendation at Member State or joint Community level? For the purpose of protecting the species, does it consider merely quantifying and restricting the number of vessels to be adequate, with no account taken of the technique used by each vessel in pursuit of its white tuna fishing activities?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In order to implement the ICCAT (International commission for the conservation of Atlantic tunas) recommendation concerning the limitation in the number of vessels participating in the fishery for Northern Albacore, the Commission has requested Member States to submit all relevant data and supporting evidence to establish the reference level of the average number of vessels during the period 1993-95. Member States have sent the information and, on this basis, the Commission is establishing the total number of vessels that constitute the limit for the Community.</p>
<p>This limit is applicable to the whole of the Community, since the relevant ICCAT recommendation applies to ICCAT parties, and the Community as such is a contracting party to ICCAT. Therefore, the Community has a responsibility to respect the total limit of Community vessels participating in the fishery, but is free to decide on a possible allocation of these vessels among Member States. However, the Commission has taken the view that a possible allocation would only be necessary in case that the total number of vessels that Member States wish to authorise to participate in the fishery would be higher than the average number of these vessels in 1993-95.</p>
<p>As regards the adequacy of this measure for the management of Northern Albacore, the Commission considers that this measure corresponds to the recommendation, by ICCAT scientists, to freeze the total effort in the fishery. In this regard, this measure can be considered adequate. Whether or not different or additional measures are necessary, will be mainly a function of future evaluations of the state of the stock.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0586"></a>

<p>1. When importing prawns into the Community, European importers have the opportunity to claim the tariff preference provided for under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).</p>
<p>Given that claiming the preference is optional, importers must ensure that the prawns meet the origin criteria required by the customs regulations, in other words, that the prawns have been bred and raised in the beneficiary country, in this case Honduras.</p>
<p>If these criteria are met, the importers then present the certificate of origin issued by the authorities of the country in question to the customs authorities.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice continues to consider that questioning the validity of such certificates is a normal commercial risk borne by the importer.</p>
<p>2. In the event of fraud or incorrect details in terms of the regulations on the origin of goods, the customs administrations of the European Community are justified in demanding the customs duties from the Common Customs Tariff.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware, however, of the need to be able to guarantee the interests of importers acting in good faith, and is looking into the possibility, in future, of systematically publishing in the Official Journal of the European Communities any information warning the importers of the risks they may be running, particularly in the case of justifiable doubt.</p>

<p>The Community is keen to support the Colombian Government's efforts to advance the peace process.</p>
<p>A lasting peace in Colombia cannot be achieved unless there is an engagement of all parties to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. Peace can only emerge from a negotiated solution to the conflict.</p>
<p>The Commission has concerns on certain aspects of Plan Colombia. It has raised the insufficiencies of the Plan with the Colombian authorities. Notably, the insufficient focus on economic, social and political reform as well as its large military component.</p>
<p>But while the benefits of some aspects of Plan Colombia are open to debate, international inaction would be the worst option.</p>
<p>A meeting of the Support Group for the Colombian Peace Process will take place on 6-7 July in Madrid. The Commission will continue to offer its help to the Colombian authorities to improve the Plan in the run-up to this meeting. Its support to Plan Colombia would naturally depend on the results of this meeting.</p>
<p>As regards the drug issue, the Community's policy continues to be based on the principle of ‘shared responsibility’ between producers and consumers. Colombia benefits from the Generalised System of Preferences (SPG). Since 1990 it benefits from the "SPG Drugs", which enables up to 80% of the Andean and Central American exports to the EU to access markets free of charge. Furthermore, a Precursor Chemical Agreement was signed in 1995 between the Community and the Andean countries, and is currently in force.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
