<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hedkvist Petersen (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span>  <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, every year, 42 000 people die on the EU’s roads. This is a very big political issue for people within the EU. In the White Paper on Transport, the Commission writes that we must halve the number of people killed by 2010. In that case, we must be active, not passive. We must take all kinds of measures at all levels. Everyone must help, especially industry, because we know that this is what consumers are demanding. The case for safety is self-evident.</p>
<p class="contents">How, then, must cars be designed so that they cause as little harm as possible to unprotected road users? The proposal for a voluntary agreement which we have obtained from the Commission and which the automobile industry has negotiated is inadequate. It is amazing that the Commission has seen fit to accept it in its current form. It is not always clear how it is to be implemented, and the EEVC tests are not taken seriously, in spite of the fact that they have been developed over a period of more than 22 years.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned here with survival on the roads and life in our society, and we must therefore be careful. The subject has been difficult to deal with, and I wish to thank all the shadow rapporteurs in the committee for a very successful piece of work which has demanded a great deal from us all. There have been many different opinions on the subject, many lobbyists and many points of view from the committees. It is now important to proceed on the basis of road safety and consumer demands.</p>
<p class="contents">We had three alternative responses to the Commission. The first was to accept the voluntary agreement. The second was to recommend a detailed directive, stating exactly how cars are to be designed. The third was to recommend a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee does not believe that the voluntary agreement is sufficient. It is not provide enough certainty and does not offer scope for any grassroots parliamentary supervision of how the automobile industry assumes its responsibility. It is insufficiently binding, and its processes insufficiently transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee therefore proposes a framework directive, as mentioned by the Commission too in its communication. It means that we in the political assemblies establish the objectives, whereupon experts oversee the implementation under the supervision, and with the participation, of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework directive we are now proposing and calling for has a number of components. The objective is that, by 2010, all models of car should meet the requirements of the four EEVC documents. This process must be initiated now. The EEVC is the institution that has made the most progress in researching road safety throughout the world, especially in the area of pedestrian protection. We are, however, able to envisage other methods of testing which provide at least the same level of protection for pedestrians. There must of course be effective tests that influence car design.</p>
<p class="contents">We also want the process to be assessed regularly, with annual reports sent to the European Parliament. In that way, we shall be part of the process and be able to check that the goals we have set are really being met. We want the Member States, through their type approval authorities, to help assess how the framework directive is being implemented. We also believe that the EEVC has made the most progress when it comes to methods of testing and that it can make further progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the demands made by the committee. We await confirmation from the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen that the latter will be tabling a proposal for a framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Group of the Party of European Socialists, we should like to have gone still further in certain sections by, for example, placing significantly sharper emphasis upon the exclusive merits of the tests developed by the EEVC and by setting a clear subsidiary objective with a view to obtaining a straight line of development in pedestrian protection between now and 2010. The Group of the Party of European Socialists also wants the Commission to table its framework directive immediately, and preferably before the end of the year. That is important if the Commission wants to show that it is serious about the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, this is a very controversial matter. We have now reached a compromise and shall therefore support this in order to obtain as much backing as possible for the demand for a framework directive as the best solution where the issue of road safety is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will therefore only support the committee’s proposal in the report, and I would urge other MEPs to do the same. We approve the compromise which, for the sake of road users, I am pleased that we were able to negotiate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Speaking as the rapporteur for my own committee – the Legal Affairs Committee – I can say that we were in favour of the Commission's proposal for a voluntary agreement and felt that the overall package achieved what Mrs Hedkvist Petersen wanted. It will save lives earlier than any other proposal. It also takes very seriously the need to improve design standards for cars. But – and this is a crucial issue she did not mention – it allows the industry, and everyone else involved, to tackle the issue on a broad front because we know that simply making the front end of cars more resilient in the event of a crash is a second option. We want to avoid collisions with vulnerable road users altogether through accident avoidance measures within the vehicle itself. Remember that anti-lock braking systems fitted as standard will be part of this package. We also have to look at road design, user education and many other things. This has to be a concerted effort.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to talk about design standards because this is important. I am an automotive engineer by background; I have seen the test laboratories; I have talked to the engineers about the problems of achieving more pedestrian-friendly cars. This is not a simple issue. Some groups have been guilty of gross over-simplification about the problems involved. Mrs Hedkvist Petersen implied that the industry was not taking it very seriously, but I know from my visits that it is.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving forward, she is right to say that we must look at a broad range of test measures. I call upon the industry this morning to join with the Commission to put together a team of all the best talents in engineering and design, together with all other interested persons, to come up with the best tests possible, given today's technology and not the 1998 technology on which the current EEVC tests are based. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all aware that, when problems crop up, the simplest way to deal with them is by means of incentives and assistance. The Sixth Framework Programme for Research, which we have adopted, contains many incentives to achieve improvements by the use of scientific methods. My second point is that we have standards, whether national or European, which give pride of place to the principle of mutual recognition and thereby make competition in the market possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The next stage, which is new and in fact sensational, is a voluntary commitment, whereby very strong pressure is brought to bear by both parties. An amicable settlement has to be reached, and additional criteria can be introduced in order to actually enforce such settlements. On the one hand, we have a simple contract, as originally planned, which of course involves risks and obligations for all parties to the contract and creates a number of problems, and on the other, we have the very slimline directive we are working on now, which we will use to do nothing more than draw up a timetable and lay down methods of supervision and assessment so that Parliament and the Commission can keep an eye on the progress made.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would like, and I believe that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would like it as well, is for this directive to amount to no more than one page. That would serve as an example of how we are constantly up to date in laying down principles and demonstrating how our work in lawmaking can also be slimline and forward-looking. Thank you, Commissioner; you have done an excellent piece of work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission has had the courage to present self-regulatory measures in order to get industry and governments to commit to greater pedestrian safety, which is also necessary, in fact. I come from a culture where self-regulation is very common. I am very much in favour of it, because self-regulation invariably entails the latest state of the art technology on which industry too can agree. Moreover, it can be a very quick process. The legislative process is always much more protracted. There is always one condition, namely that these self-regulatory agreements are monitored effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">If you ask me for my personal opinion – and this is also what Mrs Petersen said –I would have been satisfied with sound self-regulatory measures, and legislation would not have been by definition necessary. However, this is what Parliament has decided and I will have to reconcile myself to this decision. A skeletal directive is what we will end up with, one that leaves open plenty of opportunities to repeatedly lay down further regulations according to the latest state of the art technology. I am such a staunch supporter of self-regulation because in my view, a number of processes in the European Commission are too slow.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I have stated in the recommendation by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that something needs to be done about whiplash, although this is not at all related to this issue, but rather to a safety issue which also robs a huge number of people of their health. Moreover, it incurs a high level of costs in our society. Not for nothing have I included this as my final point. I know, after all, that far too little is happening in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also asked questions in writing, upon which I receive the response that something will indeed be done. We have already discussed it in the context of the Fourth Framework Programme. Why does the handling of all these issues that are related to preventing accidents and preventing extra expenses in this area take up so much time? This has been going on since the Fourth Action Programme; we are meanwhile looking at the Sixth Research and Development Action Programme. Surely, something else should replace it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commissioner not only to enter into consultation with industry very promptly in order to do something about this pedestrian protection, possibly by means of self-regulation, I would also ask him to tackle these other problems too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of doing so, the Commission presented a communication on an agreement negotiated with the automobile industry, which, however, incorporates not only passive safety measures, but active ones as well. As substantial parts of it can become effective at once, it is very much to be considered as a useful means of realising the policy objective of reducing by 50% the annual total of those killed or gravely injured in accidents by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I expect all the parties concerned to regard the agreement thus negotiated as a contract by which they must abide. No doubt the Commission is able to confirm to us that it is not the case that – as we have been informed – motor manufacturers are already questioning their obligations on one point. The motion for a resolution before us now will motivate the automobile industry to step up its research into passive and active safety for pedestrians, rather than – as individual lobbyists fear – contributing to the crippling of development. The protection of pedestrians is at last becoming a matter of public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The two-phase improvement of pedestrian safety envisaged is acceptably close to the aim of the White Paper on European Transport Policy. Phase A, which commences at once and will end in 2005, will already contain essential measures, including, among others, the equipping of all new vehicles with ABS anti-skid equipment with effect from 2003, the immediate installation of daytime running lights on new vehicles, the requirement that new vehicles should cease to be supplied with bullbars, and the carrying out of modified tests by the European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee (EEVC) to examine impacts on pedestrians.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst reference is made to the importance of the EEVC's research and development programme, we call for the quality of the four systematic tests in phase B to be further developed. In order to truly guarantee phase B's legal certainty, we call on the Commission to draft a framework directive, primarily to stipulate a clear timeframe for further measures and details of the monitoring process. We furthermore expect such a directive to prescribe coherent and practicable test methods, dealing with more aspects than do the EEVC's testing areas and take the interplay of the tested objects into account. The result of this is a challenge across the board to the automobile industry's capacity for innovation and research.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers are coming of age and will increasingly value the cars of the future in terms of their safety for their occupants and for pedestrians, and will choose which to buy on that basis. Safety is being used more and more in marketing and sales, which brings advantages for consumers and advances in road safety. I recommend the adoption of the text as voted on by the Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has to do, on the one hand, with their subject matter – traffic safety, which is an important issue to the European public. It  also, of course, has to do with this report's role in the overall discussion - of which there has been a great deal - of the documents on European democratic governments and<span class="italic"> </span>better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most grateful to the rapporteur for taking an actual example to show how things could go and what roles are played by Parliament, the Commission and the interest groups – which some would call ‘lobbies’ – by industry and consumer protection groups, and so on. Surely it is right for MEPs to be suspicious of agreements such as these, as we are never quite certain how far the industry will go, and to what extent it will keep to what it has supposedly committed itself to? It is also understandable that industry is sometimes suspicious of MEPs, whose wisdom and expertise in these different fields is called into question. So I believe it to be right that we should try to go down the road of compromise – the way pointed, thankfully, by the rapporteur – not an empty compromise but one that really shows the way things can go.</p>
<p class="contents">Being members of this House, we are naturally torn between the obligations and tasks imposed on us by a parliamentary democracy and the knowledge that there are many details we really cannot get to grips with unless we are experts in a specific area. We are torn between trust and mistrust of industry's knowledge and also its willingness to be decisive in making things happen that may only be burdens to it and do not do anything for industry's profits. We are also torn between our responsibility in matters of principle and, at the end of the day, the responsibility many people see us as having for many of the details. I therefore think it right to call for a framework directive in this case in particular. I am all in favour of it being slimline, and we will certainly not argue about whether it should take up one page or one-and-a-half.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rübig was so fulsome in his praise of the Commissioner that I do not know how to add to it, but I find it perfectly understandable that the Commissioner should use a commitment to perhaps get us MEPs to take the middle way that he, as a democrat, believes to be the right one, and to get this House to pass a framework directive. I will conclude by emphasising that this is all the more the case as we are dealing here with the area of traffic safety, and, whilst there may well be a technical issue at the bottom of it, it is a technical issue that has an effect on human lives. Any technical issue capable of making people's lives better or saving them is, after all, one on which we MEPs should at least lay down some principles. I support the rapporteur's motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I found it interesting to take part as a shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Liberals. We succeeded in establishing fruitful cooperation with the other groups, and particularly the rapporteur, and reached a balanced report with sufficient support from Parliament and in which, therefore, a very clear signal is being given to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Under normal circumstances, my line of approach would have been to try to persuade the various parties in the field to reach a covenant, a workable cooperation, with agreements and obligations, but in this case, it is right and proper, in my view, that Parliament should take the responsibility to fight the corner of the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget the past when we draft the report. I therefore think it important to apply past efforts as a basis for a framework directive. It would be excellent if we asked the Commissioner if he thought he would be able to draft a proposal for a framework directive in the shorter term after all. Indeed, the framework directive has 22 years of research behind it. Also, there have been so many dialogues between the partners in society, between the automobile industry and the consumer organisations in the past. It would, in itself, be a nice gesture to us to indicate that you on your part are also committed to a straightforward implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, every person who becomes a victim of a road accident is one too many. This effort is therefore a welcome one. The report has managed to strike the right balance in the descriptions of test methods and such like, and I am therefore pleased that the point of departure for the ETSC method is sound, but there should be scope for possible developments in the future. It is, after all, a dynamic process. Particularly in the technical and hi-tech industry, there are a whole host of options with which we may not be all that familiar yet. This is why it is to be welcomed that the report offers scope for possible, even better, methods than we have at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to note that it is not only the European Parliament that prevents road victims. The behaviour of road users is particularly important. This also means, therefore, that it is an integral process in which others in society will also need to play a role, and this is why I am pleased with this contribution to establishing a safer and integral traffic policy to which consumers too can make a contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is a common denominator: we all agree that the number of accidents, injuries and deaths on European roads is absolutely unacceptable; and we also agree that we need to find viable methods of considerably reducing this number of victims.</p>
<p class="contents">This report talks mainly about the most vulnerable road users; I would therefore have liked motorcyclists to have been explicitly mentioned as well as pedestrians and cyclists, since they are just as vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Vehicles need to be designed and built to be safer both for their occupants and for those around them, such as pedestrians. The problem is finding a legal, quick, effective and transparent way of doing it. Front designs that are capable of absorbing the impact of a pedestrian who is hit are vital in quantifying how much harm accidents would cause if they happened.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, however, forget that we need to take care of other aspects, such as promoting safer driving, maximum dissemination of road safety information and, essentially, as has rightly been said, designing and building road infrastructures that are safer for all users.</p>
<p class="contents">The black spots on European roads are also black spots for this group of most vulnerable users. Metal barriers, inappropriate vertical signs and kerbs are among the causes behind an enormous number of victims.</p>
<p class="contents">From the start of the debate our Group has rejected the so-called “voluntary agreements” with the automobile industry proposed by the Commission in order to improve the protection of the most vulnerable groups, as it is a system that could leave the way open for other extra-legislative agreements associated with transport and the environment, which concerns us given the lack of an interinstitutional agreement in that respect. This would not happen with a legislative process, because, although it would take longer, it would maintain stricter parliamentary control. It is true, ladies and gentlemen, that a voluntary agreement with industry would enable us to start sooner. But it is also true that, according to all the data, it would save fewer lives.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled a series of amendments rejecting this voluntary agreement. Amendment No 4 refers to the need for consumer and user organisations to continue to express their opinions, whatever the form of regulation; Amendment No 6 expresses our concern regarding the requirement to use Daytime Running Lights across the Union, as their current use by the most vulnerable users, motorcyclists and cyclists, would lose its value. In any case, we ask that this should not be obligatory until the matter has been studied in detail, or that Member States who ban Daytime Running Lights should be allowed to have positive discrimination for cyclists and motorcyclists.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have tabled a series of amendments in this respect and we ask for them to be looked at or at least to be voted on. By accepting the Commission’s proposal, Parliament is explicitly accepting a loss of power over this important aspect, which concerns the safety and the lives of hundreds of European citizens, and we will be losing independence, judgment, transparency and control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all the more the case in view of the dramatic incidence of serious traffic accidents which make it impossible to regard as appropriate the deadlines envisaged for implementing the recommendations regarding impacts involving the lower leg and head with the front or windscreen of the vehicle: 1 July 2005 for all new vehicle types, 1 July 2010 for 80% of new vehicles and 2012 for all new vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not, as a matter of principle, opposed to commitments in general, but in this specific case I see it as necessary to produce a binding framework directive. That would be a preferable way of going about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Hedkvist Petersen's report reflects this problem. Attempts have been made at negotiating a compromise, but, unfortunately and apart from any compromise, a whole array of shortcomings remain. You, Mr Koch, looked only at the positive side of that; I am now considering it from another angle. Excessive delays prior to the commitment's implementation, the reduction of tests from four to two, the commitment to equip vehicles with daytime running lights, the provision that the implementation of phase 2 should be subject to technical feasibility, which gives no guarantee that the objectives will actually be achieved, the failure to adopt a ban on fitting front and rear bullbars after a vehicle is purchased. We of course support the equipping of all vehicles with ABS, as we do the introduction of a range of electronic active safety devices.</p>
<p class="contents">Making the first move is always better than doing nothing. This one can help cut down on accidents. So, despite all my reservations, I will vote for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Measures that relate to both vehicles and to road user behaviour. Everyone has his or her own responsibility to take. In my opinion, the Community should not be able to shirk its responsibility too easily. It has the task of protecting its people from the risks of public life, including the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the Community is prescribing requirements for the design of cars, which is good, in my view. This power must not be relinquished. This is why voluntary agreements with industry have to be treated with great care. Industry is only secondary, and never able to adopt the role of legislator, simply because it always wants a compromise of criteria without any of the sharp edges.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement with the automobile industry which we are discussing here is partly illustrating why that is. Let me start by saying that the agreement offers more certainties than are currently laid down formally. That is to say, provided that all parties provide their cooperation to the letter and spirit of the agreement. This does depend on the basic premise that is opted for: either an existing situation or a desirable one. I would opt for the latter, namely the need for considerable improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">In this light, there are a few observations to be made about the agreement. One point that deserves attention is the existence of two different test methods. One is related to industry and one is independent. It goes without saying that the first one will not be as far-reaching as the second one, or at least not be as critical. There is also a clear difference in the set-up of the test. The EEVC goes considerably further and can ultimately guarantee a higher level of protection than the NCAP. The timeframe plays an important role too. Industry suggests that technical adjustments to models require more time. This is also reflected in the voluntary agreement on the basis of which requirements for all new cars only start to apply after a very long time. Practice has shown, however, that adjustments can be implemented remarkably faster, not in years but even in weeks, as long as the right incentives are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the specific content of this resolution is concerned, there is only one conclusion possible, in my view. We believe that Community legislation is the only way in which the criteria for the safety tests can be established. Accordingly, we warmly welcome the proposed legislative instrument, namely a framework directive. As for its content, the four EEVC tests will need to occupy centre stage, because they prescribe higher requirements and, in so doing, offer a higher level of protection for weaker participants. On the basis of information available to us, it is very feasible for the automobile industry to meet these standards. There does not seem to be a problem there either. The inclusion of alternative test methods is, in our view, superfluous. It is claimed that this would be necessary in order to be able to incorporate progress in the test methods. However, the EEVC tests too are updated regularly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the plea for the ban on bullbars both during and after production receives our support. In short, with the exception of a few minor changes, we can endorse this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So you can see that we are talking numbers which are not easily disregarded.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, the Commission communication we are examining today is about a commitment by the European automobile industry designed to increase the chances of survival of pedestrians and cyclists involved in collisions with motor vehicles. This particular commitment comes in two stages, one by 2005 and one with even more stringent measures by 2010. The important thing is that, first, the industry itself is anxious to make a voluntary commitment, meaning that no direct legislative intervention is required in the first stage and, secondly, this commitment covers all the important manufacturers, European, Japanese and Korean alike.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on this report in the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had what I consider to be a very satisfactory outcome, thanks to the efforts of the rapporteur, Mrs Petersen. Of course, with it being a compromise, we are not overly excited about the result but, when all is said and done, it takes account of our group's concerns, which is why we voted for it in committee and shall do so in Plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental elements in this agreement are paragraphs 6 and 14, so I shall just reiterate them if I may. First, we consider that the voluntary commitment being negotiated with the automobile industry represents a first step towards improving road safety and, secondly, we are asking the Commission to come forward with a framework directive in which a clear, realistic time schedule is established for the intermediate and final goals to be reached, as well as methods for monitoring assessment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clearly so important to reduce the number of road accident victims that the question of which instrument would be best to achieve it – a voluntary agreement or a legislative measure – is secondary.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, we are not opposed to voluntary agreements in principle. However, they can only be usefully allowed within an agreed legal framework that gives Parliament the right to participate, particularly where the objectives to be set, the results to be achieved and monitoring are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We only hope that this condition, which remains binding in environmental matters, will, at last, be fulfilled by the ‘Better regulation’ initiatives launched by the Commission in recent days. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks also go to Commissioner Liikanen for his unbiased and fruitful endeavours. The compromise that has been achieved represents the new decision-making culture and is a step forward for dealing with matters faster and more flexibly. The voluntary agreement will allow us to adopt simple solutions to increase pedestrian safety more quickly. However, Parliament must ensure that the car industry keeps its promises. For this reason a loose framework directive is appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time it has to be remembered that this commitment is just a start. As has been said here in several speeches, the targets for action might have been a lot more ambitious. New technology makes it possible to improve road safety in general and hence also pedestrian safety. Solutions already exist and more are on the way. They must be speedily adopted. It is now essential to monitor closely the implementation of the commitment and its results. The experience gained will allow us to evaluate the benefits of a wider application of an equivalent procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the sound work she has done. In the final analysis, the background to what we are discussing here is the fact that public roads claim forty thousand victims annually, including a number of vulnerable road users – as they are referred to – cyclists, pedestrians and also, of course, moped riders and motorbike riders to a certain extent. These are the people around which everything ultimately revolves.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement that is being discussed here is in the first instance voluntary. To a certain degree, I can go along with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and others who would ideally like to see voluntary agreements concluded with industry. However, this has already taken some time. These tests have taken 22 to 24 years, although some adjustments are taking place. I do, in fact, share the view of Mr Van Dam who claims that these adjustments can be made a great deal faster. These days, consumer adjustments can be made very quickly thanks to technological connections between both the requesting parties and, ultimately, the implementing operative activities in industry itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Phase one is, in itself, a step forward in this procedure where, for example, the application of ABS is concerned. We have some misgivings about daytime running lights, because it is, after all, the weak vulnerable users who end up being portrayed in a bad light. We have tabled a few amendments on this score. Ultimately, it is also about the front of the cars and what goes on around these.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome phase one's implementation on a voluntary basis. As for phase two, I go along with these four tests where it is clear which ones are the best, but this is, at the end of the day, about a framework directive. This is what we should focus our attention on now. I fully agree with the rapporteur on the scope and intention of this framework directive. I also agree with her – this is also why we have tabled an amendment on this – to implement this framework directive, which should not be formulated in a technically complex manner, as soon as possible. This is why we state in our amendment that we would ideally like to see this before the end of this year. In the light of 24 years of history, this is certainly not asking too much.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I should like to ask a number of groups – for a number of those are agreed – to consider Amendment No 9, particularly part one, which is about submitting this relatively simple framework directive to us before the end of the year, and this according to the criteria that have been laid down in the low-key consultation between all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Industry would like measures on a voluntary basis that only partly meet the public’s expectations and that can easily be avoided by companies that stand to benefit from doing so. It is sad that the European Commission wanted to meet this wish and that some of the Right-wingers in this Parliament were prepared to endorse this. The argument in favour, namely faster results and more flexible adjustments, is largely cancelled out by the fact that the interested parties themselves have a huge bearing on the outcome. They want to leave room for effects which may be harmful to others but beneficial to themselves. Insofar as additional agreements with industry are meaningful, these can at most relate to the speeding up of the introduction of new rules and ways with a view to a prompt and goal-specific application.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a remark about the content of the covenant itself. Compulsory daytime use of headlights is only safe in sparsely populated countries with a low sun position, few cyclists and without the need to make motorbike riders more visible, and there is a problem in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, this new instrument presumes twofold legitimate expectations. For a start, we are trusting the Commission, as, before the directive reaches us and is adopted by us, we have to expect that you will check to see that the Commission really will fulfil its obligation for the next two or three years from the word go, as it were.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, secondly, presupposed that you must, in theory at least, join us in trusting the industry to actually do what it has declared itself willing to do. In so far, I call on the industry and the Commission to prove to us and to the citizens whom we represent, that legal undertakings are a good way of achieving rapid improvements, particularly in technical fields.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, though, we Members of this House are, as I see it, obliged to check up on the Commission and on the industry to see whether they actually merit our trust and whether they really are promptly and effectively putting their promises into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, Commissioner, to make another point. I take the view that, should this directive and this system come to pass, we in this House must also be free not to insist on all the old technical standards. That, Mr Bouwman, is why I cannot vote for your Amendment No 9, as item 14 of our motion for a resolution states that we expect the directive to take as standards either the four EEVC tests or other methods offering at least equal or possibly better safeguards. This Parliament should not behave in 2002 as if it already knew what testing methods will be right in 2005 and 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Mr President, as regards the question of which are the right tests for the framework directive, I ask the Commissioner to submit proposals founded on objective criteria and modern knowledge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cars remain excessively and unnecessarily dangerous. Safer car fronts could save 2 000 lives a year at a cost of only EUR 30 or GBP 20 a car.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree it should be possible to turn off daytime running lights. Indeed, I would want them banned in the United Kingdom because I think they reduce the visibility of motorbikes and make motorists feel superior and invulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted at the ban on bullbars, not only when cars are sold, but also an as after-sales purchase. May I congratulate not only the rapporteur, but also my own colleague, Hermann Vermeer, for his excellent work in leading the search for a compromise and breaking the early deadlock between the two sides of the House, one insisting that voluntary agreements should never have a role, and the other saying that legislation should never have a role.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the attempt by the car industry lobby to discredit the EEVC tests. The report properly reminds us that EEVC is the institution which is at the forefront of research in road safety, with wide experience in the field of pedestrian protection in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">While the EEVC and other test methods should continue to develop with new technologies, currently there are no equivalent tests, so those tests are for the moment standard. Just as I do not think that it is useful to be theological about voluntary agreements or legislation, nor do I think that it is useful to be theological about a particular kind of test, but there are no different standards at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is also a good example of a non-legislative approach which can benefit the citizens quickly and strengthen the framework of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures proposed by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association – introducing more pedestrian-friendly car fronts, fitting all new vehicles with ABS, installing daytime running lights in countries where this is permitted, and vehicle crash tests – should indeed make it possible to reduce the unacceptable number of people and pedestrians who, each year, lose their lives or are seriously or irreparably injured. A negotiated agreement would therefore be an initial positive step towards improving road safety, and the commitment could still be improved in time and monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it would appear fundamentally important for the European Parliament to call upon the Commission to guarantee the independence in both form and substance of the technical services certifying the conformity with the tests laid down of all new vehicle models that manufacturers intend to place on the market. In this regard, the motion for a resolution to be put to the vote today quite rightly calls for the conformity inspection procedures to be set on the basis of guidelines established jointly with<span class="bold"> </span>the Joint Research Centre<span class="bold"> </span>and under its supervision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But we are calling for EU legislation to take its place. We welcome manufacturers' development of pedestrian-friendly car fronts, automatic braking systems and the use of daylight running lights, although obviously there is controversy on that particular topic.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome this because we are assured that these measures can be implemented relatively quickly. However, the motion for a resolution recognises that this agreement is not the best way to protect pedestrians in the long run. What if one of the partners fails to act? It is not as binding or as transparent as legislation, and there is a real lack of confidence expressed by the pedestrian protection bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">The car industry itself admits – and none of us can be happy about this – that it has not been proactive in the past 22 years. Phase I will take five years to implement, with phase II in 2010 and a review in 2004. We are taking only a first step.</p>
<p class="contents">The car industry states that the framework allows it to move forward more quickly, that a directive will slow down implementation. But we ask the Commission to come forward with a framework directive that will lay down a clear timeframe and detailed monitoring methods because at the end of the day we must protect the most vulnerable and pedestrian safety in our communities is of the utmost importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking about human life. For that reason I was happy to come and speak here at such very short notice.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a pity that the Committee headed off in the wrong direction right at the start. We politicians wanted to leave our mark only because we were elected to this Parliament. The issue is a lot more serious than that. This is about saving human lives and finding the means of doing so as quickly as possible.

When considering which approach to take to this issue, the choice has been between a voluntary commitment from industry on the basis of agreed objectives and the traditional route of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">After talks with the European Commission, European motor vehicle manufacturers, represented by ACEA, committed themselves in June last year to introducing a range of measures starting this year, actually in January 2002, leading to a high level of pedestrian protection. Identical commitments have been entered into since then by the Japanese and Korean automobile manufacturers.</p>
<p class="contents">In a communication adopted in July last year, the Commission presented to the European Parliament and the Council the main elements of the industry’s commitment and invited both institutions to express their views on it. The Commission would decide thereafter whether to accept the industry commitment or to propose legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The commitment constitutes an innovative package that combines passive and active safety. On the passive safety side, manufacturers have agreed to design cars according to a series of tests introduced in two phases, starting in 2005, aimed at verifying that the car design will minimise injuries to pedestrians involved in an accident. Another important passive safety element of the commitment is the ban of rigid bullbars from new cars as from this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding active safety, industry has taken three additional initiatives: firstly, to equip new vehicles with ABS from 2003 onwards, secondly, to introduce daytime running lights on all vehicles from 2002 (it should be noted that this refers only to the technical prescription of DRL, but it does not supersede national laws on the use of DRL), and, last but not least, industry is committed to progress and report systematically on the introduction of additional active safety devices to improve pedestrian protection, such as adaptive speed limiting devices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would monitor the implementation of the commitment, on the basis of tests conducted by independent laboratories and possibly with the involvement of national type-approval authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, an intensive debate has taken place in the European Parliament and the Council in the past few months on the options presented by the Commission in its communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Last November the Council of Ministers approved the idea of an industry commitment in this area and its fundamental elements, subject to certain conditions on particular points.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is the turn of the European Parliament to express its views. I am grateful to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and in particular to the rapporteur, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, for her impressive work, and also to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, Mr Harbour and Mr Rübig for their opinions. I appreciate the efforts invested in this matter, which have shown exceptional commitment, professionalism and openmindedness. The aim has been to seek a balance between a high level of protection, flexibility and efficiency in law-making on the one hand, and the preservation of legal certainty and transparency on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission welcomes the support expressed by the Transport Committee for the objectives and timeframe proposed in the Commission communication for the introduction of pedestrian protection measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission welcomes the views expressed in the report regarding the legislative approach, suggesting the use of framework legislation in this area to ensure legal certainty on the fundamental goals.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been asked what the Commission will do if the report is accepted. If a majority of the European Parliament agrees to this approach, the Commission is willing to put forward a proposal for framework legislation, based on the relevant measures of the commitment. I believe that we can do this by the end of the year, this coming autumn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I thought that it would also be helpful for the report to cover the implementation of the European Charter for small enterprises. I wanted to present a simple and specific report to you based on the work done by the Commission and the Member States over the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the Commission’s concern about the slow pace of progress and about the downturn in the economic situation, which is not necessarily favourable to long-term reforms. However, it is these structural reforms which we are being slow to implement, particularly as regards opening markets and reducing the tax burden. One of the reasons for the slow pace of reform is the failure to comply with the method decided in Lisbon, which presupposes cooperation between the Member States and coordination by the Commission, with exchanges of information and an assessment of the measures adopted. This is still lacking, and that is detracting from the coherence of enterprise policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am suggesting that the Commission should publish an enterprise policy scoreboard, just as it has done for employment policy, which should both prioritise actions to be taken and set out a timetable. I am also calling on the Commission to provide us with better information on progress with structural reforms in the Member States. Furthermore, I am asking the Commission to assess the effectiveness of initiatives taken by the Member States and effectively to disseminate best practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Small enterprises are a pillar of Europe's economy and a breeding ground for jobs that we should support and develop. The regulatory and administrative environment in which our companies have to operate also has an impact on their competitiveness. We need to bear in mind that small enterprises employing fewer than 50 people provide jobs for 65 million people in the European Union. They account for 99% of all businesses and provide 53% of jobs. In other words, it is better to legislate, taking account of small enterprises, which means serving 65 million people more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am calling on the Commission to step up consultation with bodies representing small enterprises and to help them to set themselves up as a network. It is also the reason why I am stressing the need to differentiate more clearly between different types of company in legislative proposals. And it is also why we should not make life difficult for our entrepreneurs by overburdening them with legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the measures I am proposing is to support initiatives taken by the Commission and the Member States in favour of companies. I wanted to emphasise the methodological problems that are impeding the Lisbon strategy while advancing some specific proposals likely to meet the expectations of entrepreneurs and applicable in the context of small enterprise. I hope that this House will support this approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Lisbon agenda is an important one for the economy and future of Europe and the European Union. A great deal of promise was held out at that time and there is a lot of very positive rhetoric about the process and the things that we want to do. But there is a lot of talk and spin, rather than substance. Many of the projects of substance in the process are a continuation of those schemes, such as liberalising the energy markets, which were in hand before. I note with keen interest comments such as in paragraph 14, which calls on the Member States to reduce the tax burden on employment. I wish that my own Member State had followed that advice instead of putting up the tax on employment in the last budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I support warmly the comments about stressing the importance for small businesses of a genuine opening of the markets in telecommunications, energy, postal services and transport. This is a worthy aspiration. We are working hard to do it but we are not making fast enough or satisfactory enough progress. I also welcome the call from the Commission for a study on the impact on various kinds of enterprises for each legislative proposal. The Commissioner knows well of my concern about business impact costs and the proposals. That is why I am also concerned about Parliament and our propensity to put down amendments which add costs. That is why my amendment is about examining the costs of our amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ford (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I add my congratulations to Mrs Vlasto for her report, which was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. It deals with the issue of the Lisbon European Council which had the objective of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world and link that to the Feira Council which endorsed a European charter for small enterprises. Clearly, as Mrs Vlasto said, small enterprises are one of the keys to success in the European economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make three points. Firstly, the report details the very low levels of investment in research and development – 1.19% of GDP inside the European Union. This is particularly acute in industrial sectors dominated by SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like us to look at the idea, at a European level, of research institutes paid for by a levy on the relevant industries, which the Japanese have used so successfully in getting innovation in research and development in such industrial sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to look at the issue of better regulation to simplify and streamline our regulations. I have no problem with imposing burdens on business to improve, for example, the environment, but we need value for money. One of the recent studies in the United Kingdom suggested that the end of vehicle life directive, for example, cost GBP 400 million a year and benefits the environment only to the tune of GBP 100 million a year. If that is correct, that is something that should not have been adopted into law in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So we need to be aware of the impact of our legislation on business and jobs. Therefore we support the Chichester amendment in principle and will be voting in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must look more widely at whether SMEs that serve local markets only should have the same burdens imposed on them as large companies exporting around the European Union and outside. In many cases local knowledge can suffice to protect consumers. Regulations are needed when the goods and services from anonymous companies are remote from the consumer both geographically and in terms of local knowledge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Lisbon method was the opening up of markets and only one way to act was proposed. It is the coordination of economic and social policy by placing special emphasis on the role of the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We might agree with the rapporteur that only an inadequate analysis of whether the same method suits all has been carried out. Different countries have different public services and operate on different principles regarding social welfare. In the Nordic welfare states public services are understood broadly to include pensions, healthcare, schools and childcare. The Catholic countries, with their traditions of care within the family, should not come and tell us in the Nordic countries that our taxes are too high. The privatisation method expounded at Lisbon is not going to provide better services in our part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">EU declarations do not create socially secure life. For that reason in the eyes of the rightist hegemony the free Member States might lack the desire – and, in fact, it is only right that they do – to act on declarations that would pulverise people’s basic social security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that, instead of imposing and proposing grand objectives, it would be better to try to do some of the necessary, useful things that need doing, and this report rightly specifies some of the issues that need to be tackled such as market liberalisation, achieving a more integrated securities market and opening up the export markets for European businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that more could have been said, rapporteur, Mr President, Commissioner, about the tax and administrative burdens imposed as a result of employment regulation, which particularly affect small and medium-sized businesses in Europe and which are one of the reasons why a substantial part of European enterprise and microenterprise – and this is especially true of Italy although not confined to that country alone – is effectively a submerged economy, an economy which evades regulation, which evades legal constraints because of the excessive burdens imposed on it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that it is right that we should concern ourselves with small and medium-sized businesses in Europe: in Italy, small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of the economy. However, alongside this, we must bear two things in mind: firstly, Europe needs large competitive internationalised businesses; secondly, it needs small and medium-sized businesses to grow, to grow and expand continuously, first and foremost in Europe but then, if possible, to internationalise their operations. Therefore, the phrase ‘small is beautiful’ is all very well, but we must not create the conditions for small-scale enterprise which we do not need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certainly clear that we all need to be aware that SMEs and SMIs play an important role not only in the economy, but also in society, by promoting economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the scope for modernising an economy and stabilising a society is very much dependent on institutional conditions and on having a clear, accessible and above all appropriate legal framework. The single market and the total achievement of economic and monetary union, the enlargement of the European Union and the forthcoming establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean area will increase the size of this market and thus change the rules. This globalisation of markets has a marked impact on the competitiveness of Europe’s companies, which need to adapt their strategy by incorporating into their analytical data the strategic advances made by their competitors in third countries and competition from markets in third countries which they want access.</p>
<p class="contents">We have found that Europe’s companies are not sufficiently internationalised, neither within the single market nor outside the European Union. That is why companies need more favourable and above all more appropriate regulatory conditions to be put in place as soon as possible. In particular, these conditions need to improve market access and provide for additional measures for enterprise partnerships at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">SMEs also need to come up with new forms of work organisation, but these changes should in no case be at the expense of workers’ needs in terms of security. It is essential to encourage workers to adapt their skills to the needs of the company and to consider training as an investment for companies and an added value for employees.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, SMEs make a contribution to Europe’s cultural values and to increasing skill levels. They are the section of our economy that we need to promote, as stated at the Lisbon Summit, but we need to act quickly, because our slowness is suffocating them. When confronted with economic reality, our companies need deeds more than words. We need to be as efficient as they are. This is already clear in the Sixth Framework Programme on Research. We now need to pursue that coherence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the Commission on its proposals, particularly its recommendations on economic impact assessments. The Commission's proposals will only be effective if the other two institutions – the Council and Parliament – follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Chichester's amendment seeks to alter paragraph 25, which was my original amendment in committee, calling upon Parliament in essence to carry out its own economic impact assessments. I believe that we should do this at second reading, once we have received the common position from the Council and we know what Parliament's amendments were at first reading. We should have an independent unit seeking to assess exactly what the impact of the legislation is, with a rigorous cost-benefit analysis, as Mr Ford has said, albeit not to substitute for decision-making, but to ensure that all decisions taken by Parliament are informed.</p>
<p class="contents">It may well be that even if we recognise there are costs involved, we feel the legislation is very important. But Parliament has to follow the example of the Commission on that, otherwise it will not work. Indeed, so should the Council. The Council is very good at adding amendments to legislation without actually working out how much they are going to cost. That is a vital challenge to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Lisbon agenda will only work if we focus on the skills issue. Lifelong learning has to be meaningful, not just a slogan. We have to make sure our workforce has the proper skills to be able to develop our economy, because our competitive advantage is largely skills-based and that is where the future of the European economy lies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Entrepreneurship can help to exploit economic opportunities, so creating a prosperity that makes it possible to achieve social objectives. One result of the Lisbon meeting was that the European Charter for Small Enterprises was born. The basic principle at work here was that small enterprises are an important source of dynamism, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="contents">We were worried last winter that the major importance that entrepreneurship had would be forgotten about. It was not, however. In March the European Council at Barcelona said again how important entrepreneurship was, reconfirmed the special status it had been accorded, and urged Member States to expedite the implementation of the charter on small enterprises. At the same time the Commission published its report on competitiveness for 2002. It shows what a long way EU productivity is from that in the United States of America. For this reason, per capita GNP in the EU is only 65% of that in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are various reasons for Europe’s poor levels of competitiveness, but the report highlights the poor levels of investment in information technology and communications technology and poor levels of utilisation of investment. The results of this are visible in industry, but also in services. Utilisation of investment in information and communications technology furthermore helps prevent a situation where there is a shortage of skilled labour in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The worrying conclusion of the report on competitiveness for 2002 is also that, unless the EU removes all the barriers, it will not be able to achieve the Lisbon objectives. Dominique Vlasto draws attention in her report to various courses of action to improve EU performance and avoid any such eventual situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to lay emphasis on five matters. Firstly, the Internal Market is the basis of competitiveness for EU companies. There is still much to be done to establish the internal market in services. Liberalisation of the finance markets would help to make funding available to business. Secondly, the Charter for Small Enterprises must be implemented with a measure of determination. There are signs of progress, but Member States should not waste time. Thirdly, better regulation means that the effects of every legislative proposal must be examined. Last week the Commission submitted a proposal on this and I am very pleased with the speeches the honourable Members Mr Chichester and Mr Titley have made here on this issue. Fourthly, we must do everything possible to exploit information and communications technology properly. It is not enough that information or communications technology is showing signs of speeding up the US economy; the necessary action has to be taken also. Finally, we must first and foremost create a favourable climate for entrepreneurship. We have to take risks and society must be encouraged to do so. We shall return to this in the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all political measures. We must concentrate on getting political action on the right track. That way the EU will be able to achieve the right kind of operational environment for companies – not so much by attaching too much importance to small-scale projects, as lucrative as they too may be in themselves. As significant levels of funding are needed at EU level we already have the necessary tools at our disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mrs Dominique Vlasto for having indicated the very important areas of policy in which progress is needed. In the final analysis we have to improve political action. That way we can bring the Lisbon objectives within achievable range. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It concerns the accessibility of government websites, especially to citizens with disabilities and to elderly people. In this connection, our meetings with the European Commission have also been very fruitful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication aims to draw attention to the web accessibility section of the Lisbon strategy. In order to make websites accessible to the equipment of people with disabilities, these websites need to be of a correct technical design. For this purpose, the Worldwide W3C Consortium has drafted guidelines. The Member States have committed themselves to applying these guidelines for government websites and the European Commission is monitoring the progress of this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Since all citizens need access to government information, the accessibility of public websites is clearly important. Moreover, governments have a special responsibility towards the weaker members of society. The European Parliament can, therefore, give its full support to this process. It calls for greater efforts in the area of implementation. Otherwise it will not be possible to realise the objective which the Commission mentions, namely to achieve accessibility of public websites by 2003, in time.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the user, for example a disabled worker in government service, will gain access to government sites without any problems within the foreseeable future. In addition, it is essential for this official himself or herself to be able to place information on a website. Consequently, the software required to place information on the web must also be accessible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a final end goal is not conceivable. Internet technology is developing fast. I would therefore call for the guidelines to be developed hand in hand with this technical dynamic. Governments will thus need to follow developments very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings us to the question what these guidelines actually mean for government institutions. First of all, accessibility for all will need to be accommodated in the draft process right from the outset. Secondly, for the sake of accessibility for all, it is necessary for governments to offer their information in a technologically neutral format. This means not exclusively via the Internet. Subsequently, it is, of course, the question whether the guidelines will be formally complied with in an effective and practical format. The report therefore asks Member States to set up information points where users can lodge their findings and complaints. These signals from society will need to lead to improvements to the websites.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been discussion about the question of whether a more binding character of the guidelines would yield a better result. This would not, however, get to the root of the current problem. The root of the problem lies in the lack of familiarity with the guidelines, and not in any potential unwillingness on the part of the web designers. In my opinion, there is certainly no reason to draft legislation at European level at <span class="italic">this</span> stage. The Commission does also want private sites, however, alongside government sites, to become accessible as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, one of the points of discussion was which type of websites was most urgent. Since the field is making different noises, it would be useful to grant priority to websites with most relevance for user groups. This could be either commercial websites or websites of social importance. Furthermore, these websites of social importance also encompass websites that are commercial in nature. Shops, banks and public transport companies spring to mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also pays attention to the candidate countries. The extent of the objective yet to be realised means that in those countries too, accessibility is worth a great effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, improvements in the field will also need to be measurable. The report therefore supports further research into measurable criteria for compliance with the guidelines. We have received encouraging signals from the field. The Dutch Institute for the Blind, Bartiméus, which has given us excellent advice, has developed an initiative along these lines. It hopes to be launching a website next week, on which it will be possible to register for a regular check of the website. In this way, a seal of accessibility can be obtained. Although the site will start off in Dutch, the institute does not rule out the introduction of an English version, thus allowing non-Dutch-speakers to have their sites tested too.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, I look forward to a situation in which people with a disability, just like people without a disability, can have access to the medium of the Internet without any problems. I hope that this report can make a contribution to this. After all, the Internet is a source of information and, do not forget, a means of communicating which is playing an ever greater role in society as a whole. Technological development should not exclude any groups, but rather help them in their social participation. Indeed, effective technology is at the service of mankind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an extremely comprehensive document that involved a lot of research. The task of the shadow rapporteurs has been relatively easy because we have agreed with a lot of the content and we have been looking for ways to further improve the direction of his text.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pick up a few specific points in relation to issues that he has kindly incorporated in the final report. Firstly, it is correct to emphasise, as he has done, the remarkable opportunities offered to disabled people in society. The digital revolution will improve the quality of their lives and access to services. That is something we need to try to exploit together in the most effective way possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us who have sat with someone who is partially sighted and seen them use a website realise that there should be better design, and it would not cost anything. It is a question of education, training and best practice. That is something the Commission is working on, but we need to emphasise it. It is something where public authorities can demonstrate best practice and set a lead for others. As an integral part of that, it is crucial to ensure that we have the instruments in place to benchmark and give access ratings to websites, because public comparison and encouragement of best practice will stimulate everybody to move forward. That is something the Commission is also working on, but we are right to emphasise that in our report.</p>
<p class="contents">That, of course, links in to the question of commercial services. The users' groups I have talked to – in the United Kingdom in particular – have emphasised the importance of encouraging commercial operators and commercial providers of services to make their websites user-friendly for disabled people. Those crucial commercial services – such as banks, home-shopping services, access to transport – being able to order transport and look at timetables – need to be made accessible to disabled users. They will really help them engage with this new revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Having those benchmarks and star ratings will encourage commercial firms to pick them up and to make their websites more accessible which will really deliver the sorts of benefits we are looking for.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to encourage both of those aspects, but overall this report is extremely worthwhile. We will not support all the amendments on this side, but that is more an aspect of detail. The overall thrust of this report is very commendable and I encourage the House to give it its full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He really has worked not only very hard, but also in a very open, intelligent and approachable way. I think we are seeing the fruits of that method of working in this report. It has been a great privilege to be part of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, access at its best is the great equaliser, the great force for democracy. That is why this report is so important: it is providing a mechanism in terms of active citizenship, which is becoming more and more important, for instance electronic democracy. We are moving towards electronic voting; methods of being engaged as an active citizen more and more depend on access. But the reason why I wanted to be shadow rapporteur on this report, and to support Mr Belder, was that, for disabled people, access to work depends more and more on access to the web.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour is quite right that much of this does not depend on money, or at least not on huge sums of money, and Mr Belder has been absolutely correct to enter into wide consultation with disabled people themselves. They already are in a position over and over again to explain to us what is needed, what will work and what will help them.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to draw attention particularly to paragraph 4 of the motion for a resolution, and I shall quote from it, because it says that disabled people not only should be able to read web pages, but also should be enabled to manage the content of web pages. In other words, they are not only passive receivers of information, but also serious contributors. That is absolutely important.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is that this is all part of the Lisbon agenda, making Europe e-friendly and e-workable, and it is going to mean that if this principle is carried through into other areas of work, disabled European Union citizens will be able to participate on much more equal terms in this respect than we have seen to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s aim to bring the information society within everyone’s reach is democracy. There is no information without learning how to produce and use it oneself. A connection to the Internet and other tools for accessing information are not enough. People have to be able to and want to use them.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur draws attention to the availability and compatibility of special hardware and software. As a separate issue, I wish to stress the importance of language. Machine language should be translated into human languages. We need links between people and not just to machines. In the shadow of privatisation we must not destroy the social institutions that democratise information.

This is why we will always support organisations dedicated not only to fighting ‘info-exclusion’, but also and principally, in a positive and pro-active way, to enabling the extraordinary resources offered by information technologies to best respond to the needs and aspirations of vulnerable and traditionally marginalised social groups, such as the disabled and the elderly. We must consequently give this boost all the support we can. It was during the last European presidency, held by my country, in June 2000, at the summit held in Santa Maria da Feira, that the ‘<span class="italic">e</span>Europe 2002’, action plan was officially adopted. One of its aims was to make the information society accessible to all the citizens of the European Union, focusing in particular on the disabled and on combating ‘info-exclusion’ in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We have kept extremely busy in this field. The EIB and the Member States’ adoption, in 2001, of the guidelines for Web sites was an extremely important development. Against this background, we welcome the Commission communication and the extraordinary work carried out by the rapporteur. Although we have doubts about the charitably generous view that the guidelines will be fully implemented by the end of 2003, we feel we must insist on this aim and make particular demands with regard to those public Web sites which, having a specific social function or being of particular importance for the disabled and the elderly, must be the first to fully meet this objective. There is no logical reason why there should be a delay in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the priority of the accessibility of the content of sites, particularly for the elderly and people with disabilities, I feel that we must focus our attention on civil and political rights, on the accessibility of these rights through the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is the priority as far as content is concerned. There is an urgent need for on-line publishing of all the formally public parts of institutional life – not just the political process but the judicial and administrative processes too – if we are to recapture one of the basic principles of liberal democracy. In this regard, I and another 62 Members – and I would point this out to Commissioner Liikanen too – have tabled a motion for a resolution on <span class="italic">e</span>-democracy, calling for European citizens to be able to fully enjoy the rights of citizenship guaranteed by the European Union Treaties through the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that this applies to all levels of public administration: in other words, our priority must be precisely to make it possible for everybody, including, that is, those who have most difficulty, the most trouble in gaining access to the Internet, to be able to fully exercise their civil rights through the Internet, the civil rights of the publishing of information on the work of the institutions, of access to democratic rights, in other words, the civil rights which can be exercised through the Web. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On-line services for all is the European principle on which we compete with the Americans. Unless everyone is involved our society will flag. Numerous special groups, such as the disabled, the elderly, single parents, the poor, the unemployed, and so on, are in this position. The number of old people is increasing. Even we in the European Union may shortly be going around in blinkers. Technical barriers must be removed. That can be dealt with by the engineers, just as long as there is the political will. Finances are not a barrier. There exist different solutions, for example, in Sweden and Finland, but everyone, ourselves included, must aspire to the Liikanen objective.</p>

The extent to which our democracy has developed and matured will be measured by how democratic we are on the web. Then it will not be a question of accessibility but whether we are included, whether we can participate actively, and whether we are able to bring our own input to the web. Democracy is not a one-way process, as it can easily be on the web. The elderly, the disabled and all our citizens, the special groups in particular, all must be able to participate and bring their own input to the web. We therefore have to aspire to that. If that does not happen democracy will be distorted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is about the Internet, that is to say the alternative to the performance laid on for you here, and about direct access for you to something that can constitute the democratic opinion-forming process. We are talking about eEurope; have you tried it out yet? Have you yet visited Parliament's website, or the Council's, or the Commission's? If you did, did you feel the way I did? You feel as if you are facing a wall full of binder files. Some people get aroused by the binder files, but most do not. It is children and young people who are looking for something different, seeking information and debate. That is possible; Europe has the chance to make it so, but we – by which I mean also we in this House – have to work like crazy on the design of our websites and also on their subject matter. The most important information is not there. That having been said, the Internet is of real importance to democracy.

Mr Belder was able to use much richer language here, but I share the same conclusion. These groups risk severe social exclusion due to a range of technical barriers they face when using the Internet. The Commission is fully committed to taking action to identify and remove these barriers at European level, in order to secure an inclusive society providing equal opportunities for all.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission Communication on web accessibility is an integral part of the eEurope 2002 Action Plan adopted at the European Council of Feira in June 2000. One of its specific aims is to ensure that people with disabilities benefit fully from new technologies and the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Representative organisations of disabled people such as the European Disability Forum have been widely consulted and we will pursue this consultation on issues such as eInclusion and eAccessibility when implementing the eEurope 2005 Action Plan to be adopted by the European Council in Seville next week. All the areas where we propose new actions must be available to anyone with a disability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed in particular to promoting the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines, which provide a voluntary mechanism for public information providers and website builders to conform to a set of informal rules on designing and structuring websites. Many of the Member States have already taken steps towards this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore welcomes the overall level of interest and satisfaction that this communication has received from the European Parliament. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belder, who drew up a very balanced and complete report on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As regard specific issues raised in his report, the Commission agrees with the encouragement to Member States to ensure that the underlying objectives of improved web accessibility are achieved, to raise awareness and speed up implementation of the Guidelines and to organise follow-up of the achievements in this field. Most of these objectives are also set out in the Council of Telecommunications Ministers resolution on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already taken steps systematically to monitor progress in adopting and implementing the guidelines at European level as part of the eEurope benchmarking effort.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the requirement that web sites developed by the Commission and other European institutions should follow these guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">During the European Year of People with Disabilities 2003, the Commission will promote awareness of web accessibility and training initiatives for website builders and content providers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue its fruitful dialogue with organisations representing people with special needs, including the disabled and the elderly, to have their experience and guidance in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the European Parliament resolution on this subject will be a significant milestone in understanding the role and importance of accessibility in the inclusive information society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission supports the Council common position because it is fully consistent with the essential objectives pursued in the Commission proposal. It also takes account of the most important amendments at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to confirm that it accepts Amendments Nos 1, 3 to 8, 10, 11, 12, 15 and 16.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 17, the Commission can accept it, although it considers that a minor redrafting is needed to avoid any legal misinterpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendments Nos 2, 9, 13, 14 and 18, for the following reasons: Amendment No 2 excludes from the proposal a large number of insurance intermediaries, which minimises the scope of the directive. It cannot therefore be accepted. Amendment No 9 introduces transitional provisions to safeguard the acquired rights of existing insurance intermediaries. The Commission has already accepted Amendment No 15, which expresses the same objective in better terms and, in addition, meets all the concerns of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 13, which introduces the principle of best possible advice. It creates great legal uncertainty and would in practice be a source of legal conflict. Amendment No 16, which the Commission accepts, goes in the same direction as the common position and improves it.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 14 and 18 put in jeopardy the key objective of high consumer protection, something that the Commission cannot accept. Indeed, if they were accepted they would deprive the customer of the basic information requirements. Amendment No 18 in particular would leave the customer in a position of uncertainty, as he would not be provided with the written advice on the appropriate insurer's product recommended by the intermediary. The objective of achieving a true single market with a high level of consumer protection would not be achieved. The Commission strongly opposes this amendment.</p>

Amendment No 88 contains the word ‘prostitution, and the fight against prostitution’. In No 91, the word is deleted from the English translation. All other translations are incorrect. Amendment No 91 therefore states that opposition is being expressed in respect of human trafficking and prostitution of minors, but not to prostitution itself.

<p class="contents">In fact, whether rich or poor, consumers pay an identical amount of tax on products they buy – nearly 20% of the price of most products in France. This tax is therefore heavier in relative terms for those with more modest incomes. The predominant role of VAT in the budget income of a country like France, and more generally in Europe, reflects the fact that it is the working class that finances the majority of state expenditure. Only by abolishing indirect taxation can we serve the interests of the majority of the population. State expenditure should by financed by heavy taxation of company profits and by direct income tax based on a single and highly progressive scale weighted chiefly towards higher tax brackets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report in fact supports the Commission’s position in this field and is very much in the spirit of the Euratom Treaty, an outdated treaty with the very much official objective of promoting the use of nuclear energy, which is in itself highly questionable.

<p class="contents">It goes without saying that funds will have to continue to be committed to research on radioactive waste, given that such large quantities of this waste have been generated in such an irresponsible way. However, they will not be managed in the same way given the political approach that has been adopted. By emphasising deep geological disposal, the programme before us seeks to make nuclear generation socially acceptable by evading the most contentious aspect. If we are really to tackle the problem we are faced with, the first step we need to take, as a matter of urgency, is to stop producing such waste, and then to steer research towards <span class="italic">in situ</span> waste management as part of a strategy of abandoning nuclear power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am in favour of adopting special measures for the peripheral regions under Article 299 of the Treaty. However, the tricks that the Spanish authorities are getting up to for certain products, in terms of incongruity, discrimination and distortion of competition, have nothing to do with protecting local production, although they would certainly ensure full employment for lawyers, because the victims, such as producers of rum, gin and vodka in Spain itself, will not take this lying down.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, it really is extraordinary that the Commissioner, who, when it comes to other dossiers, is so resolute about safeguarding the free movement of products within the single market, is willing to present a proposal as discriminatory as this, which is to apply retroactively and for a period of ten years, up to December 2011. I think that this is over the top. Moreover, this is all without any reference to the economic and social development of the Islands or to the promotion of local activities. I would like to warn the Commission and the Member States, who in the Council have given way to real blackmail by the presidency, against the dangerous precedent that they are in the process of setting.

<p class="contents">We can, therefore, accept the Commission’s concern to reduce fishing efforts, but under no circumstances can we accept that this reduction should be undertaken by reducing vessel numbers, entailing the definitive loss of fishing licences. There are other, equally effective means of managing fisheries so as to ensure appropriate fishing levels, such as, for example, reducing the amount of days per year on which fishing can take place until stocks recover to acceptable numbers. This would significantly reduce the socio-economic problems of businesses currently holding fishing rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Where cod is concerned, the stock situation appears to be more serious, requiring rather more severe measures than those proposed for hake, although they could vary according to the species. In any event, these measures must also be temporary and must never involve vessel reductions or the definitive loss of fishing licences.

<p class="contents">The misdiagnosis is this: it is true that in certain fishing areas stocks of cod are in a perilous state, but this cannot simply be attributed to overfishing: there are also many other factors that come into play here. As for hake, the situation is specific and quite different: the biological cycles are much shorter and recovery has already started, so that the measures proposed by the Commission will come totally at the wrong point in the cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">As for poor decisions, managing the total allowable catch on a multiannual basis is a good measure, and one for which we have been calling for years, but it should be implemented by means of annual variations limited to rates which the professions involved can cope with.</p>

The Seville Summit, like those of Genoa, Nice and Brussels, is a new and sad illustration of the democratic bankruptcy that characterises the construction of Europe. This summit will be marked politically and ideologically by the liberal right and the extreme right. The latter, buoyed up by its recent electoral successes in France and the Netherlands, has been able to impose its populism and xenophobic demagoguery upon the Fifteen, notably on issues of immigration and the right to asylum. All that will be at stake is strengthening Fortress Europe, whereas it is urgently necessary to combat trafficking, mafias and secrecy through a policy of opening up frontiers, normalising the status of those without papers and giving nationals and foreigners equal civic and social rights. Immigrants and asylum seekers easily serve as scapegoats for societies that have become the victims of economic liberalism and capitalist globalisation. The anti-immigrant hysteria organised by the heads of government ends up by disguising the real agendas of the Seville Summit, the anti-social Barcelona Summit and the neo-colonial Madrid Summit. The joint resolution is part and parcel of this trend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is factually incorrect to suggest that ratification of the Treaty of Nice facilitates the enlargement process. During the Nice summit, our governments’ leaders chose to make Europe slightly less democratic and less efficient.

It is a classic example of imperialist expansionism which has found fertile ground following the collapse of the Socialist system in Europe and the break up of the USSR. The aim is to bring small, weak countries under the umbrella of the western European wing of the international imperialist system. As the European Parliament's resolution reveals, enlargement goes hand in glove with the eastward expansion of NATO.</p>

Germany and Austria are making demands on behalf of the German speakers who were driven away from the Czech Republic and Poland, and are taking measures against the influx of migrants from the east. Poland, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria want to use EU money to build motorways right across areas of outstanding natural beauty. Rumour has it that an election victory for the former Prime Minister, Mr Meciar, in Slovakia will exclude that country from the first wave of accession countries. Dangerous nuclear plants in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria will only close if this is paid for by the EU. The East remains poor because it exports cheap agricultural products and mining products, and has to import expensive technology. In the existing EU area, political parties that are not so keen on solidarity with economically weaker states and that associate the enlargement to include new Member States mainly with higher costs and the influx of migrants, receive the support of a large proportion of the electorate. A large accession wave in 2004 is therefore becoming increasingly less likely. On account of a few positive points, I would nevertheless have been able to vote for this report, but the added plea for enlargement of NATO made it ultimately unacceptable to me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, this common platitude is actually a perversion of the truth: there are only 15 of us in the EU; Europe has many more States, peoples and nations than only we 15. We are mentioning this in order to get across our basic viewpoint in this debate: enlargement is essential and is a political development of enormous significance, from which we cannot shy away. Enlargement does, admittedly, pose challenges and difficulties, but we shall have to face them and overcome them, because this is our fate and in order for the European project, of which the Union is a part, to have real meaning. We feel that that most important thing is for Europeans to be united, and that this should take precedence over all other political agendas. For this reason we also reject the stubborn institutional fantasies of those Members who have turned the federalist credo into a religion and who worship the power of Brussels, believing it to be divine and interfere in everything and wish to regulate everything – future events and even those in the past. By acting in this way, they are only creating unnecessary resistance and dangerous tensions. The Union – it is time this were pointed out – was not established so that we could interfere in each other’s business, but so that we could cooperate in mutual respect and gain as much as possible from pooling our common energies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the Brok report incorrectly states that the applicant countries continue to fulfil the political criteria set in Copenhagen in 1993. That is incorrect. If Parliament took the Commission's country reports seriously, we could not ignore the numerous examples of corruption, discrimination against minorities, lack of human rights protection and weak judicial systems in some applicant countries. I believe that human rights and the rule of law need to be the top priority for Parliament in the enlargement debate. Therefore I regard the report, which explicitly denies the problems that still exist in this area, as unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that amendments underlining the absolute priority of the political criteria have been adopted along the lines of my own amendments adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to its opinion. Parliament must now take its own words seriously and look in detail at the human rights situation in the applicant countries.</p>

This victory was to be crowned with the annexation of the East. Many people in the East were amenable to this, in the expectation of receiving great financial support and imminent wealth. Now that 2004 is on the horizon, it becomes apparent how difficult the accession of new Member States is. Many of these difficulties are money-related. Our agricultural policy, which promotes the economy of scale and keeps food prices artificially low in order to curb pay claims by the workers, will become unaffordable if the small farmers in Poland are allowed to take part. The lion’s share of our regional funds, which, to a large degree, pump money from the rich Member States via the bureaucracy in Brussels back to the same rich Member States, would, on the basis of the current criteria, be intended for the new Member States, mainly at the expense of areas in Spain, Portugal and Greece which are currently still the poorest countries. The monies reserved for accession are being distributed over far more candidate countries than was originally planned. There will soon not be any money left for circulating around the rich Member States for propaganda purposes. Like the rapporteur, I am quite happy to protect poor Member States from a role as net payers, but simply to exempt newcomers from payments in order to entice them, is taking things too far in my view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A goal which no effort is made to disguise is served by the observation, realistic as it unfortunately is, to the effect that there is “a prosperity gap with a ratio of as much as ten to one” between regions situated at the external borders of the EU and adjacent regions in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already agreed broadly to subsidise these regions and, in particular, the undertakings that operate there, explaining that, following enlargement, the regions at the present external borders of the EU will certainly attract less than prosperous labour from newly admitted countries. As for the rapporteur, she adds that, in terms of the needs of the wealthy regions and their undertakings – and most certainly not in terms of the needs of the impoverished populations of Central and Eastern Europe – the subsidy “is no more than a drop in the ocean”. For that reason, she proposes increasing the subsidies that are to be paid to the wealthy regions and their undertakings, while approving what are termed transitional measures which, even after enlargement, will hinder the free movement within the EU of workers from the newly admitted countries. Indeed, these new countries are only being integrated into the EU accompanied by restrictions which make second-class citizens of their inhabitants.

We are also glad that a range of proposals submitted by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have been incorporated into the report, for example the emphasis on the need to provide more funds to promote SMEs, and the call for an increase in the EU share in co-finance in order to take account of the calamitous gaps in terms of development.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the rapporteur's fundamental conviction that the EUR 195 million in funding allocated by the Commission are far from adequate, and we support to the utmost the demand for additional financial resources. This is all the more the case as the funds currently available are being found by means of reallocations, whilst at the same time the finance ministers of various countries can look forward to billions from the resources of the Structural and Regional Funds not being utilised and therefore being refunded.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret the fact that it has not been possible to bring about the acceptance of a legal basis specifically for the promotion of border regions, without which the longer-term funding of measures will be impossible.

On the contrary, these enterprises should see enlargement as a positive challenge.</p>

The Structural and Cohesion Funds are European Union instruments of extreme importance for bringing the EU's less-favoured regions up to the level of development of the prosperous ones. We take the view that these instruments of European incentive policy enable EU policy to have the greatest direct and visible effects on people's quality of life and must therefore at all costs remain part of future policy after enlargement. Support given by stronger regions to the weaker ones, in a spirit of solidarity and without reference to national boundaries, is symbolic of European unity. We therefore oppose any discussion of even the partial renationalisation of regional and structural policy, as this would undermine the principle of solidarity and it is not foreseeable where such a policy might lead.</p>
<p class="contents">We are of course aware of the serious problems involved in realising structural and regional policy, and see the Commission and the Member States as sharing responsibility. The poor implementation rates and constantly increasing backlogs, totalling – incredibly – EUR 112 billion in 2000, give grave cause to consider the possibility of a radical re-examination of the procedures and structures that have been in place to date.</p>

There will be no single CAP in practice and the policy applied to the new Member States will be even worse than the policy applied to the current Member States. Enlargement is being used as a springboard by the strong countries in the north to abolish direct income support by reclassifying it as "<span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>".

<p class="contents">The Communist Party of Greece is against the accession of any country to the ΕU because accession has nothing to offer small and medium-sized farmers or the working classes. However, as and when these countries join the European Union, they must have the same rights and receive the same subsidies from the first year of their accession and quotas must be determined on the basis of the real capacities and food requirements of their people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should also concentrate on the issue of direct payments and the proposal for the phasing in of direct payments. This must not be a stumbling block for enlargement.

Public opinion is right to be indignant about the many vulnerable road users who are the victim of road traffic that kills. The Petersen report helps to do something about this. Cars should be safer not only for car drivers; they should also be safer for the vulnerable road users. I emphatically endorse the wish in the Petersen report that the European Parliament be involved in legislation in this area. Road safety cannot simply be the concern of the executive and car manufacturers. As long as increased car speeds are used as a sales argument, I shall remain suspicious of the industry. After all, it is impossible to cut down significantly the number of victims of road accidents if the speed on the roads is not reduced, if car drivers do not adapt their driving behaviour and if the infrastructure is not conducive to caution and safety.

This approach goes some way towards safeguarding the Commission’s line, which has the merit of speeding up a process which might otherwise drag on indefinitely and only achieve its objective after an extremely lengthy consultation process.

<p class="contents">The report is not interested in the users of services, who are in danger of seeing the complete deterioration of public services if these forms of privatisation end up being imposed. What the report is interested in is the ‘dynamic climate of investment and entrepreneurship’ which it intends to favour through a reduction in the “tax burden” and through “access to funding”, in particular for what are termed small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">It argues, in fact, for the European Union to give more attention, and more aid, to such enterprises, and although its ‘explanatory statement’ is eloquent about the situation of “small enterprises” in Europe, it conceals the fact that the vast majority of these enterprises belong to large groups whose subsidiaries they are. In practice, this means that these forms of aid on the part of the European Union will mainly add muscle to the largest companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Those elected by universal suffrage are therefore being asked to vote in such a way as to provide their democratic support for the private interests of the small minority of people who possess capital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we actively promote the issue of a constitution for the European Union in which the division of responsibilities is clear to everyone. It must be perfectly clear to everyone that the EU should only concern itself with those issues it is best placed to deal with, namely the cross-border issues. All other issues should be dealt with at local, regional or national levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also hope that the European Union can give its stamp of approval, for it is up to Europe to put an end to this phenomenon. I do not want to discuss child labour in general, as we are all against this. Despite all previous agreements, conventions and codes of conduct, during this Football World Cup too, use was once again made of products which had been manufactured – under licence – by children, in an unacceptable manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to the World Cup that, in 2006, will take place in Germany. I cannot imagine that the Commission and the Council would accept that children would once again be used for manufacturing products for this World Cup which will take place on European soil. I therefore expect from FIFA – the customer of industry – and from the European Commission not only a commitment in terms of effort but also a commitment in terms of result in the run-up to the World Cup in 2006. In this way, we can be certain that, in future, children only touch a football to play and to have fun with. This is also why we need to call for alternatives for these children who now have to work, not least in the interest of the developing countries. They too must fight these practices. They need to ensure that these children can learn and work – work at school, that is – and that they receive education. Why? Because these children are the economic future of the developing countries. This is why I think, and hope, that this resolution will find widespread support, certainly with a view to the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in the shadow of this event, thousands of children use their valuable time every day making the balls used in football matches. These children are deprived of any chance to acquire a better education at school or play with other children their own age. Child labour and the inhumane working conditions which adults making footballs also work under are, unfortunately, still standard practice, despite the agreements concluded by the International Football Federation with companies which make sporting goods.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the report by the India Committee of the Netherlands tellingly entitled "The Dark Side of Football", Pakistan is the biggest producer of footballs in the world, followed by India. In just one area of India, the Punjab, about 10 000 children aged between 6 and 12 sit stitching footballs, while about 15 000 children work in the area of Sialkot in Pakistan. These balls, which are hand stitched by children for a few cents, are the same designer and FIFA endorsed footballs which are sold in sports shops in the west for tens of dollars.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the efforts of both international organisations and the sports companies themselves to introduce programmes and control systems to combat this awful practice, production has shifted to small villages where either there is no policing or the children work at home rather than in factories. Similarly, according to the London Times, numerous children have been found making footballs for famous multinational companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on international organisations, sports companies and governments to use the World Cup, which has been dedicated to children, as an opportunity to work together and adopt a reliable system for checking if labour regulations are being complied with. Because child labour is neither a hobby nor a game, I hope both FIFA and the industry will take the lead and make football a truly fair game for everyone. We need to send out a message today that adults should be given work and children should be sent to school. Adults at work, children in school. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Three reports were presented at the press conference of Global March Against Child Labour in New Delhi last month. They furnish the proof that child labour is still the order of the day in the production of sports equipment. For example, according to a report from the Dutch National India Working Group, the number of children working in the Indian production of sports equipment full-time has hardly fallen over the past four years. This despite an inspection scheme introduced by FIFA. Other reports of a similar kind denounce the situation in Pakistan and China. Admittedly, FIFA demonstrated its good will in 1996 by concluding an agreement with the international trade union on the code of conduct to banish child labour and poor working conditions. However, this code has not been implemented to date, and the reports I mentioned earlier show that we are still a long way off the set goal. Hence the express appeal to FIFA to speed up the implementation of this code.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that child labour is a complex matter. Our campaign should not only be confined to calling FIFA and the manufacturers to task over this in an overbearing manner. The production of sports equipment is certainly not the only, and not even the most important, sector in which children work. In order to tackle the problem at the roots, cooperation is required between industry, civil society, as well as the governments and international organisations involved. After all, we need to look for alternatives where labour, education, income and education are concerned. The countries involved must be reminded of their duty to monitor existing rules effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to underline that this resolution should not be considered as a targeted attack on one specific form of child abuse, or aimed at one specific sector in industry and one product. However, the World Cup is an illustration of the extreme contrasts in our world. Between the fit and healthy children who copy the World Cup on the streets in the richer world and the children on the Indian Subcontinent who stitch together leather footballs in sweatshops all day long. In this way, the World Cup 2002 forms a starting point to remind everyone – manufacturers, governments, international organisation and the public – of their own responsibilities. This is why I warmly support this urgent procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The truth is that there are agreements, there are declarations, there is the FIFA Code, there are mechanisms banning child labour. But child labour among children as young as 10 years old, as my colleagues have said, is increasing every year. Child labour has other serious connotations: for example, it decreases salaries in the regions in which thousands of children work, takes work away from adults, causes poverty in families and, above all, deprives children of the right to education, which they should have from birth.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent data indicates that there are thousands of children in India and Pakistan, aged 10 or under, who are working to produce balls, and we believe that in the European Union’s talks in the World Trade Organization and in bilateral talks with each of the countries mentioned, one of our fundamental requirements should be that child labour should end. But, as one of my colleagues has already said, it is not enough just to demand that child labour be ended, but alternatives have to be offered to the families in order for them to survive. And of course monitoring and surveillance systems have to be put in place in order to ensure that it no longer happens, and it would be good if, as the World Cup is now being played, giving rise to so much passion, including in this House, we could say at the next World Cup in 2006 that child labour no longer existed, if not across the world, at least in part of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two hundred and fifty million children are regarded by their parents as an investment in their whole family's survival. They are exposed to the heaviest physical burdens from an early age, thus being robbed of a carefree childhood. Not only are they put to work as cheap labour in plantations, quarries and mines, but they are also exploited by the manufacturers of sports goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Now of all times, when the World Cup is on in Japan and South Korea, it should not be forgotten that many footballs are made by children. As long ago as 1998, FIFA undertook to outlaw the use of child labour in the production of officially licensed products, but the world's richest and most important football association has now had to admit that it cannot guarantee this. The PPE-DE group, like all the other groups, condemns every form of child labour. FIFA and the sports goods manufacturers must at last introduce a code of conduct and then monitor the way it is implemented, if this deplorable state of affairs is to be brought to an end. Industry and organisations should work together with governments, as Mrs Martens and others of our fellow-Members have just emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the ILO must check that these working guidelines are consistently adhered to. One step in the right direction is the ‘Red Card for Child Labour’ campaign started during the African championships in January this year. We call on FIFA, national teams and the sports goods manufacturers to do everything possible to make the 2004 European Championships in Portugal the first international football tournament free of child labour. Over and above that, I agree with the ladies who spoke before me that the fight against the causes of child labour – poverty, poor education and inadequate training – has to be stepped up.</p>

Pictures of malnourished third world children forced to work day in day out occasionally make the headlines. In today's world, this sort of situation is unforgivable. </p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to ask if and to what extent we contribute towards it. According to World Labour Organisation sources, some 211 million children aged between 5 and 14 work instead of attending school. In Asia, Africa and South America, western multinationals use small children for various types of hard work, such as picking tobacco, bananas and cotton, making rugs or stitching footballs and sports clothing in intolerable conditions, often working for more than twelve hours at a time. </p>
<p class="contents">Despite all the action taken by international organisations to combat child labour, the results are most discouraging, which is why, Mr President, we have to use all our power and influence to put an end to this shameful practice. We need to find a way to stop companies from moving their operations to countries where cheap labour means child labour. I propose that the relevant parliamentary committees draft an own initiative report on this issue and that more funds be made available to the international programmes of the ILO to combat child labour. </p>
<p class="contents">Children, Mr President, are the most important members of society and they need special protection because the future belongs to them. I only hope that today's debate and the resolution which follow it will be effective this time.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It condemns all forms of child exploitation, as well as the worst forms of child labour. It supports the calls on FIFA and the sporting goods companies to make sure that no children are employed in the production of FIFA licensed sportswear and footballs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has not had any contact so far with FIFA on this issue. It is ready to support NGOs which work with local partners for the elimination of child labour. It has already financed several initiatives to combat child labour, especially in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that assistance for and protection of vulnerable children should be seen in the wider context of poverty eradication and therefore in the framework of the Community framework development cooperation. Children are an important focal group in the Community's external aid, particularly in sectoral policies such as education and health.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community is committed to applying the ILO core labour standards and has agreed to implement those standards in the framework of bilateral and multilateral agreements with developing countries. A good example is Article 50 of the Cotonou Convention. In that article the Community and the ACP countries have reaffirmed their commitment to ILO core labour standards, including the fight against the worst forms of child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community is increasing its support to universal and compulsory primary education in all developing countries as part of its commitments to the "education for all" framework and the millennium development goals for education and gender equality. It sees this as one of the most efficient means currently at its disposal for rescuing children from the vicious circle of exploitation.</p>
<p class="contents">Assistance for, and protection of, children is channelled through a number of Commission programmes, including the European initiative for human rights and democracy. The promotion of children's rights was one of the priorities for funding in 2001 and will be mainstreamed in funding for the period 2002 to 2004. Furthermore, the Commission has also made children a cross-cutting priority for humanitarian assistance. In its communication on the promotion of core labour standards and social governance, the Commission presented a comprehensive strategy proposing actions at European and international level. This should, in the medium term, ensure better implementation of the ILO core labour standards through institutional support and capacity building and trading in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards trade, in December 2001 the Council adopted a revised GSP scheme by which additional trade preferences are granted to countries that respect core labour standards. This includes an improved social incentive scheme and extends the base for withdrawal of GSPs to cover serious infringements of all ILO core conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission played an active role in the UN General Assembly special session on children. In this context, the EU considers a rights-based approach as fundamental to the promotion of the interest of children, given that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most ratified international treaty in the world and provides an already agreed normative framework. The plan of action agreed at this special session contains strong elements aimed at combating child labour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two-thirds of the territory is still being occupied. Recently, international opinion was once again startled by the report of a massacre of 200 people in Kisangani. This massacre occurred two years after 1 200 people were killed in the same town as a result of the fight between two rivalling military factions. The civilian population is naturally the victim, but those responsible have never been punished. Amnesty International is therefore linking the events of then to now. The war in Congo still receives far too little attention from international opinion. During the Belgian Presidency, the European Union made greater efforts than before to get the dialogue off the ground. But I am left with questions. Why is MONUC not being given any reinforcement? MONUC is even being humiliated, officials are being expelled by DRC-Goma. Why has Kisangani, despite resolutions by the Security Council, still not been demilitarised? What are we actually doing in order to help this peace process succeed, since the major parties are still not at the negotiating table? What are we actually doing in order to open up the Congo River? The population inland is denied any food or medicine. Nobody can reach these people because the Congo River is probably the only route to access them. In these circumstances, preparing for Congo’s reconstruction is wishful thinking. Such reconstruction will not take place. Quite the reverse, in fact: demilitarisation is not being maintained. Only Namibia has done something. I can understand that Rwanda wants to be safe, but why does international opinion not protect Rwanda and demand for everyone to leave the country, because they are, after all, only there to plunder the crops from the land. They do not fight each other, but they rob the civilian population of the little it has left. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its false closure in Sun City (South Africa) with a partial agreement means that clashes and, in the extreme, massacres such as that in Kisangani, are continuing.</p>
<p class="contents">The human tragedy is currently in Kisangani, Kivu and Bunia, but the fundamental political problem has lain for 40 years in the illegitimacy of the governments and institutions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as Mrs Maes said. Only an honest democratic transition process, involving all of the opposition parties, will lead to peace and national sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group condemns the Kisangani massacre and the presence of various foreign troops in the DRC, and supports the efforts for peace by Masire, Ajello and Monuc in order, respectively, to re-open integrated dialogue and to demilitarise the areas of the Congo occupied by armed groups and regular troops from the neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, we propose the following oral amendments to the compromise text:</p>
<p class="contents">1. Adding the following paragraph to recital H, which is in line with the declaration of the Council of the European Union on Sun City. "Whereas the European Parliament nonetheless regrets that some participants have not agreed to join this agreement and invites all the Congolese parties to take responsibility and to respect the framework established in the Lusaka agreements and the United Nations resolutions". This addition covers everything that the European Union said about Sun City. Only quoting the first part would give a biased idea of the European Union’s positions, which we do, of course, support.</p>
<p class="contents">2. Adding the following paragraph to paragraph 5 of the resolution, after “civil society”: “Regrets that the opposition parties (UDPS, FONUS, PALU and MNC/L), and other parties and platforms representing civil society, have not signed the agreement of 19 April”. Paragraph 5 would therefore read as follows: “Welcomes the political agreement on the consensus for transition in the DRC signed on 19 April 2002 by the Government of the DRC, the MLC of Jean Pierre Bemba, the RDC-ML, the RDC-N and other delegates of the unarmed opposition and civil society; regrets that the opposition parties (UDPS, FONUS, PALU and MNCL), and other parties and platforms representing civil society have not signed the Agreement of 19 April and supports the efforts of the special representative of the European Union to move forward the Alliance for the Protection of the Inter-Congolese dialogue, which includes the RCD-Goma and five unarmed opposition parties to this agreement”.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group will vote against recital E, because we do not believe that, in the current political conditions in the DRC, it can be said that the population of Kisangani, or of any other province, has democratically expressed itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The date of the Sun City Agreement also needs to be corrected in the text, as it took place on 19 April and not on 19 May, as incorrectly featured in the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">In a conflict as complex as that in the Congo, in which there are so many spurious interests in play, the role of the European Parliament should be one of conciliation and integration, of ensuring, as far as possible, that real democracy is established rather than mock democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is actually a sort of continent within a continent, and so this cannot, alas, be considered as a normal internal problem; the extent of this war is comparable to something like the Thirty Years' War in Europe. Just as, in Europe's Thirty Years' War, religious motivations were exploited by tough political and economic interests, the ethnicity of people in the Congo region and in the Democratic Republic of Congo is being misused as a tool in the interests and for the sake of corporations, raw materials and the major powers. As in the age of the Thirty Years' War, the troops of neighbouring states have become caught up in this civil war, never returning to their countries of origin and themselves joining the marauding bands in this gigantic country.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this is, lamentably, a problem whose solution will take a great deal of time. We have to start, in the first place, by constructing a State structure for this gigantic land that the decolonisation process carved out. This can only be done step by step in a gradual process that must build on what was agreed in Sun City, but we must be clear in our own minds that it cannot be done overnight, that many, many small steps will be needed and that we will only be able to talk in terms of democracy when we have ensured that the State is able to perform its most basic functions. That will involve, above all, a minimum of administration and communications and the reinstatement of shipping on the Congo, which is this great country's lifeline, and without which it cannot be reconstructed.</p>

<p class="contents">We recall, as did the declaration made on behalf of the European Union, the obligations stemming from the UN resolutions for demilitarisation of Kisangani, as well as the commitments made by the parties under the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement. The Commission would like to reiterate that the Lusaka Agreement is at present the only commitment to a negotiated solution and the international community has stressed on many occasions the absolute need to respect it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has welcomed the power-sharing agreement reached by the Government and the MLC. However, the Commission stresses the need for all the parties to subscribe to a consensus-driven and inclusive agreement for the transition in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Commission believes that a political settlement of the crisis should be pursued by all parties and by the international community. We fully support the recent initiative of the UN Secretary-General to further support the inter-Congolese dialogue by nominating a Special Envoy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in favour of an international investigation into the alleged massacre in Kisangani, but we believe that MONUC and other UN agencies present in the field can provide sufficient elements and evidence. At this critical moment, the Commission considers that priority should be given to the international attempts to continue the peace talks and negotiations among the parties, including the foreign countries involved in the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on all parties to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement to respect the end to hostilities and to refrain from any act which might hinder the search for an inclusive solution to the conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Dozens of opponents of the regime of President Teodoro Obiang have been arbitrarily arrested and brought before the courts accused of conspiracy, incitement to rebellion and attempted murder of the president.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, the only purpose of the trial, which began on 23 May, is to put the opposition leaders out of the running. Along with their families, the latter are being held in inhuman conditions and are the victims of brutal torture. Freedom of expression and of the press is systematically flouted, and independent journalists are subject to insidious daily pressure. A repressive and brutal policy is being conducted against everyone with an ideology opposed to that of the regime. The 68 opposition leaders have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment in the course of an unfair trial, which has made a mockery of people’s most basic rights to a defence. A number have even been in danger of receiving the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital that Equatorial Guinea respect its commitments to the international community and the European Union and engage in a genuine process of democratisation including the holding of free elections and complete respect for human rights. A dialogue must be instituted between the opposition forces with a view to guaranteeing political rights, democracy and pluralism. With this in mind, the trial must be annulled and the political prisoners freed immediately. As for the press, it must be free to cover the events and to do so in safety. In order for that to happen, it is essential that the problem of Equatorial Guinea be raised as a matter of urgency within the Joint ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly and that the Council and the Commission be very firm indeed in their relations with the government of this country.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to guarantee the rapid re-establishment of the rule of law and respect for human rights, a consultation procedure between the government of Guinea and the European Union needs to be put in place as quickly as possible, and this in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. As Europeans, we cannot now remain indifferent to what is happening in Equatorial Guinea and to the human rights violations there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is happening in Equatorial Guinea, which since its independence has had two extraordinary presidents and is now experiencing a highly unusual political situation, if we look at the latest United Nations report and the international press, sets a contradictory scene: while the international community is supporting Equatorial Guinea both technically and financially, perhaps because it is interested in its oil wealth, the authorities in the country are not respecting the most basic human rights. This resolution is therefore appropriate in condemning those violations of human rights in this African republic, which for many years was associated with my region, the Canary Islands, the bridge between Africa and Europe. This explains my political interest in supporting and defending the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group wishes to express our agreement with the Council’s position in expressing a grave concern for the political deterioration, procedural anomalies and lack of respect for human rights on the part of the Guinean authorities. The European Union should therefore review its political relations with this African republic and call on President Obiang to establish the rule of law that has been lost and to begin to open up democracy for the good of his country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martínez Martínez (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the trial conducted against 140 citizens in Equatorial Guinea is a sham that the European Union cannot keep quiet about. The totalitarian regime in Malabo has tried to get rid of those who could represent a democratic alternative. It is true that a few years ago the process would have meant that the opponents would have been physically eliminated and it is also true that the fact that the country has joined the ACP Community as a signatory of the Cotonou Agreement has led the regime to act with more respect for the standards of the rule of law, holding a trial and allowing international observers to attend it.</p>
<p class="contents">This revealed a grotesque set-up in terms of its lack of legal legitimacy. There was talk of a plot to overthrow the regime and even to assassinate the Head of State, without putting forward the slightest bit of evidence, with brutally tortured witnesses and defendants, a public prosecution service that raised its initial petition of eight death sentences to eighteen, and a final verdict which, although not so extreme, punished the main people accused with long prison sentences, thus removing them as potential adversaries in any electoral battle.</p>
<p class="contents">We were struck by the contrast between the incompetence of the officials of the dictatorship, judges, public prosecution, police, etc. and the admirable dignity of the defendants and defence lawyers. It is extraordinary that, despite the ill treatment inflicted on them, there was not a single witness or defendant who confirmed in the trial the statements that had been extracted from them in police stations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to express our repulsion at such a corrupt and anachronistic regime and our solidarity and confidence in the democratic future of Equatorial Guinea. In that country there are people of unquestionable bravery and convictions who undoubtedly represent a better future for their people. This future is what the European Union needs to support, without, of course, falling into judgements that betray our own values. For now, there are clauses in the Cotonou Agreement that we should activate in order to make it known in Malabo that practices such as the trial I mentioned are simply incompatible with its association with the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since March this year, opponents of President Obiang's regime have been arbitrarily detained and tried under deplorable and unacceptable conditions. Detainees have been subjected to brutal and inhumane torture and often prevented from contacting their families and lawyers. In some cases, detainees' family members have been arrested merely because of their connection to the accused. Independent journalists reporting on political trials have come under extreme pressure, while several human rights organisations report that deaths have occurred from injuries sustained from torture while in detention.</p>
<p class="contents">The nature and timing of the arrests lead me to detect a cynical attempt by the authorities to spread fear in advance of the elections due to be held next year. I believe the Red Cross should be given immediate access to detainees, international monitors should be introduced and arbitrary detention must be brought to an end. Equatorial Guinea is in clear breach of every human rights convention it has signed. It is undermining its own commitment to the Union on democratisation and the full implementation of human rights. This Union must take a firm stand with the authorities in Equatorial Guinea and demand that prior commitments be honoured.</p>
<p class="contents">To speak of justice in that country is to speak the language of torture and of systematic brutality. This betrayal of core human values serves to remind us of the often-tragic gap between words and action and human rights in many parts of the world. This House must meet the challenge of bridging that gap with vigour and authority. We demand that the EU as a whole makes its concerns known to the authorities in Equatorial Guinea and call for an end to the current abuse of human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The recent trial, which was a sham, and which was also, according to all of the observers and as confirmed by Amnesty International, riddled with evidence of torture, is an insult to the values that we defend in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to express our solidarity with all those detained, with all the democratic parties that are doing an incredible job under those conditions in order to move forward in solving these problems through democratic values, and I say incredible because desperation is also appearing among the youth of Equatorial Guinea, and the seeds are appearing of what could be a violent response to so much brutality and dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that we have to make an extraordinary effort to promote the path of democracy in Equatorial Guinea and not only condemn the dictatorship, but also those Western countries who, either by action or by omission, are in practice supporting the continuance of the dictator. I therefore think that the work of people such as Onbam Ndong and Plácido Mikó should be highlighted, as they are doing important work, the latter as the secretary of the Convergence for Social Democracy party.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the other parties, we support this resolution demanding that this trial be repealed and voided, that all those detained be freed and that the democratic future of the country be set in motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Freeing those convicted and the members of their families and restoring the bar association should be demands from the European Parliament. With this legal sham, the regime in Equatorial Guinea has surpassed all the limits that can be allowed for a signatory of the Cotonou Agreement, as Miguel Angel Martínez said, which is not only an agreement for economic cooperation, but also for political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Equatorial Guinea has already committed itself internally with the European Union and with the whole of the international community, as a signatory of the Convention against Torture, to begin the transition to democracy, in other words, to hold free elections in a context of respect for human rights. Failing to comply with that international obligation gives rise to sanctions that we request from the Commission and the EU-ACP Council of Ministers as part of the Cotonou Agreement. In this sense, democratic conditionality, used in a constructive manner, is a key tool in the European Union’s development policy.</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission fears that the financial leverage of development cooperation risks being ineffective when compared to the level of resources coming from oil. Therefore it considers it more appropriate at this time to maintain a robust dialogue with the Government as well as constant international and public pressure.</p>

Parliamentary and presidential elections served only to prop up his autocratic regime and give it the outward appearance of legitimacy. After he abrogated the democratic constitution in 1996, the OSCE sent a mission of observers to the country with the aim of re-establishing dialogue and helping to restore the foundations of a democratic order. Its task was an unambitious one, but even that was too much for President Lukashenko.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, the Commission and the Council worked closely together with the OSCE mission, and the experience increased our regard for its achievements, as repeated attempts were made, in a situation with few – if any – prospects, to set up dialogue, even if only a tenuous one, to at least work towards the minimum criteria we had established, and to find a way to restore normal relations. Yet even that was too much for Mr Lukashenko, who made it unmistakably clear, in a major speech last month, that he wants no more OSCE missions in the country once the presidential elections are over.</p>
<p class="contents">It is simply not as if we are dealing here with a country that is not a member of the OSCE and has not acknowledged its rules; on the contrary, he himself subscribed to the OSCE rules and democratic standards. This has not stopped him putting the media out of action, meaning that any dissident is at his mercy. I believe that we must protest vigorously about this, and it is clear that normal relations with the European Union will not be possible if dialogue on the basis of the OSCE mission is not begun. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears that the brutality of the regime in Minsk knows no bounds, and the way in which they are now managing to close down the OSCE office in that city by no longer issuing visas to diplomats who work there, is in itself a disgrace which once again illustrates how poor the quality of democracy in that country is.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a rather personal matter to us because many in this House know the people who are now being ousted out of the country, if they have not been ousted already. Over the course of two elections, we have joined forces with the OSCE team in Minsk in a very pleasant and effective partnership. On two occasions, we, along with the OSCE, have had to conclude that the outcome of the elections was not legitimate, and this is the problem we are essentially faced with. Also, we have always said that the European Union and the OSCE should be pro-active in supporting civil society and the opposition. This is what Mr Lukashenko considers unacceptable and what he tries to avoid at all cost. This is also why we are calling on the European Union too to find out when the office will actually be closing down and whether we should also consider ceasing the TACIS activities because these have probably become ineffective, since they share the same objective as the work of the OSCE. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, the closure is not an act of strength on the part of Belarus. The event is, rather, an expression of weakness. Secondly, Belarus is actually signalling, albeit in a desperate way, that it is seeking contact with the EU. Thirdly, Belarus is seeking a bargaining counter, or something to play off against the European Union. Fourthly, Belarus is trying in this way to give prominence to its basic need also to join the European Union in addressing the border issues and the refugee situation within Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this analysis, we can openly enter into talks with Belarus, taking of course as our starting point our vigorous and fundamental criticism of the unacceptable incident at the OSCE office in Minsk.</p>
<p class="contents">I would appeal to the Commission and to Commissioner Liikanen, whom I would call upon to approach Commissioner Patten, to step up all their contacts with Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened in Minsk in connection with the OSCE office is a sign that Belarus is ultimately appealing for some form of contact. They are doing so in an unacceptable way. We cannot, however, allow neighbours of an enlarged European Union to behave as they have in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for the European Union to state clearly that, within the framework of the union between Belarus and Russia, President Putin of Russia has a major and special responsibility for putting pressure on Belarus to act in an internationally credible way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The present joint draft resolution is right to express its deep respect for this mission. What is exactly the merit of the Advisory and Monitoring Group? Its former head of mission and great driving force, Mr Hans-Georg Wieck, has given a thumbnail description of this commitment: observation of the human rights situation and administration of justice in Belarus, legal assistance for the affected families, reporting of processes and interventions in cases of violations of the law, humanitarian aid to victims of state persecution on political grounds and by administrative and criminal penalties, development of the range of action and cooperation of political parties, the forming of a coalition of parties and social forces, observation of elections, also involving the local population, and finally, projects reinforcing civil society. Needless to say, all these activities have been a thorn in the side of the authoritarian President of Belarus, Mr Alexander Lukashenko, from the very outset. He has therefore done everything in his power to ignore or undermine the work of the OSCE mission, or what is worse, gave it a bad name in public. This has certainly not done anything for the popularity ratings of the recognised ballot director Lukashenko. Quite the reverse, in fact. While in the opinion polls, his popularity is consistently declining, that of the OSCE mission so detested by him is on the increase. It is therefore hardly surprising that the Belarussian Head of State is now trying to force the OSCE mission in Minsk to resign by refusing the necessary visa to be issued. It is up to the Council and the Commission to stop him, in close cooperation, if at all possible, with the Russian Federation, since we cannot afford to abandon civil society in Belarus, which is finally regaining political and social consciousness, at this crucial time. I therefore agree with Hans-Georg Wieck that nothing less than the credibility of the European institutions is in the balance here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The visits that we have made with Mr Wiersma, Mr Sacrédeus, Mrs Schröder and other Members to gauge the situation have shown that in Belarus society there is a vast majority and wide range of social, political, cultural and professional forces in favour of democracy and the values of Western Europe, with strong desires to move their position towards the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that we have a twofold commitment or challenge with Belarus: on the one hand, to strengthen relations and help the democratic transition to take place quickly and urgently, and on the other hand, to make the necessary diplomatic efforts so that this position of transition towards democracy can also be brought to the fore in Russia and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said, what happened with the OSCE mission is unacceptable. The work done by the former Head of the Mission, Ambassador Hans-Georg Wieck, and by the subsequent heads, has been commendable, and we should therefore continue to exert considerable pressure so that work continues along those lines.</p>

Byelorussia, or Belarus, will, in a very short time, be one of the European Union's neighbours. What was termed Poland in the Middle Ages was in actual fact a federation consisting of Poland, Lithuania and Byelorussia, each part having equal rights. Lithuania and Poland will, next year or the year thereafter, be able to become members of the European Union, whereas Belarus seems today to be further away than the Democratic Republic of Congo, about which we were speaking earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a tragedy, responsibility for which lies principally at Mr Lukashenko's door. The people of Belarus played a part in the democracy movement that led to the fall of Communism and helped to bring about the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It is for that reason that we have to give forthright support to the movement for democracy and human rights in that country, a movement that is supported not only by us but by former human rights campaigners in Prague, Warsaw and elsewhere; we have to send a signal to the people there that we know that they are Europeans, and that they really belong to us. We must, of course, use all democratic and diplomatic means to work towards the OSCE becoming genuinely operational there, to ensure the failure of the attempts at doing away with monitoring and concealing this oppression behind a veil of authoritarian measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, be very wary of involving Moscow in this process, as Moscow, being the former colonial power, of course bears some responsibility for what is happening in Belarus today. We have to work together with everyone, including Russia, but I see the European Union as having a special responsibility to make it clear that this European people too will have a place among us, but that the OSCE, and then the Council of Europe, must do their work, and, above all and most crucially, human rights must be made to prevail. That all this should be, as it were, obscured and befogged by one regime, is something we cannot permit.</p>

<p class="contents">The EU and its Member States have supported all OSCE moves to keep the OSCE assistance mission in Belarus open and running. The EU has issued a number of statements, either in the OSCE in Vienna or from the Presidency in Madrid, strongly condemning the action by the Belarus authorities to suppress the activities of the OSCE office in Minsk. Via its delegation in Vienna or during the Council working group meetings, the Commission has been very active in the discussions on the OSCE position vis-à-vis Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">The closure of the OSCE mission in Minsk would put in jeopardy many of the mission's activities, notably the observance of Belarus' commitments under OSCE human rights rules. If the mission is closed, this reporting will no longer be possible. The case of Mr Andrew Carpenter is just one illustration of the methods used by the Belarus authorities to gag OSCE observers working in their country in full compliance with OSCE and diplomatic rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has made it clear, in its contacts with the Belarus authorities, that it regards the OSCE Assistance and Monitoring Group as a significant test case for the authorities' approach to the development of democracy, civil society and human rights in Belarus. If Belarus intends to join the democratic family of European nations and to establish fully-fledged relations with the EU at all levels, it should demonstrate this by accepting the mandate and the services of the AMG.</p>

<p class="contents">Following the arrest of Mr Riad al-Turk, a 72 year-old lawyer and secretary-general of the banned Communist Party, there are suggestions that Syria might be about to enter a new phase of repression, following a gradual thawing of relations with the West and a desirable but limited opening-up of the Syrian economy to market forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Although no expert, I would certainly support the calls for all prisoners of conscience to be freed, in Syria and elsewhere. It is vital that the Syrian Government understands the need to distinguish between those who advocate violence or rebellion and those who simply advocate political change. I also fully support the paragraphs in the motion calling for the Syrian authorities to ensure that detainees are not tortured in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights cannot be detached from wider political developments in the region. Only yesterday I was privileged to hear the very fine speech by the King of neighbouring Jordan, an exemplary role model of moderation and wisdom.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years Syria sponsored terrorism in both Israel and Turkey and was the main state to reject any compromise solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute based on land for peace. There are signs that the end of the Cold War and the new geopolitical realities of the region have forced the adoption of a more reasonable and even pragmatic foreign policy by Damascus. Syrian leaders need to recognise the importance of the recent shift in international opinion and, in particular, the widespread support for a viable democratic Palestinian state and to work with – not against – the international community for a comprehensive regional settlement, including the return of the Golan Heights. Only then, I believe, will Syria be able to fully develop its potential as a nation and to offer its people the peace and prosperity which they truly deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After spending 18 years in prison for crimes of opinion, the lawyer, Riad al-Turk, was released in 1998. In recent months, he has been imprisoned anew, also for crimes of opinion. The trial is in progress and the defendant is in danger of being sentenced to 15 years. All this is happening in Syria, where, despite the hopes of renewal raised by the new president, Bashir al-Assad, I regret to say that there has been absolutely no increase in consideration for freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you about Riad al-Turk, a political opposition leader who has paid an extremely high price for defending his ideals. The lawyer, now an elderly man in poor health – and we can imagine what it means to spend 20 years in prison in that country – has suffered a deterioration of his health in recent months, since he was arrested again. He is not a familiar face in the West, for he has never tried to claim that his is a special case. He has displayed great dignity throughout his life and he was not even allowed books in prison. In order not to lose all sense of time and reality, he tried to survive and to preserve his concentration by drawing with small stones that he found in his cell. Among those in prison with him are two members of the Syrian parliament, who are being detained on the same charge. These are their crimes: taking part in political meetings not authorised by the regime.</p>
<p class="contents">We are scrutinising a key country in the region with interest and we hope that the association agreement being negotiated by the Commission will be concluded. Clearly, however, respect for human rights is an essential condition of these agreements. We therefore expect the European Commission’s negotiators to take a firm stand on the case of the elderly lawyer, Riad al-Turk, as well. It is impossible to put this matter down to cultural diversity: these are basic conditions which a State founded on the rule of law must respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our aim is to establish a constructive dialogue with the Syrian authorities on human rights issues on the basis of the principles expressed in the Barcelona Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Troika demarches were made after the arrests of opposition personalities, including Mr al-Turk, in August/September last year, and after the convictions of the two MPs, Mr al-Homsi and Mr Riad Seif in March/April this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the EC Delegation in Damascus, the Commission also participates in the EU observation of trials. We regret that recently EU observers have on some occasions been excluded from the trial against Mr al-Turk. While we welcome the opportunity to observe trials in Syria, we also realise that the mere presence of observers at trials must not become a substitute for the fairness of court procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, the Commission, through its Delegation in Syria, will continue, together with Member States' Embassies, to follow as closely as possible the trial against Mr al-Turk. The Commission will also continue to raise its concerns, regarding both the general human rights situation and individual cases, with the Syrian authorities and will call upon Syria to respect freedom of expression and of association in line with the Barcelona Declaration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under the pretext of combating terrorism, Malaysia’s prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has made much use of the Internal Security Act, which authorises the detention without trial of anyone suspected of undermining national security, to muzzle all political opposition and to intensify the repressive measures contravening individual freedoms, notably freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">In a few months, we have moved from the image of a country on the up and up, run by civilised people, to that of a country whose leaders are destroying with their own hands what they have built up. That is why Parliament is duty-bound to condemn these abuses and call upon the Malaysian Government not only to guarantee respect for individual freedoms but also to abolish that notorious Internal Security Act and to ratify without delay the International Convention on Human Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention Against Torture.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also vital that the European Parliament send a mission to Malaysia in order to investigate the conditions under which the political prisoners are being detained and the violations of their basic rights. Finally, the European Union should place this issue on the agendas of the forthcoming meetings between the European Union and the ANASE. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It increasingly resorts to the use of the Internal Security Act, which allows it to detain people indefinitely without trial if, in the Government's view, they are suspected of threatening national security.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights groups have consistently criticised the abuse of this draconian legislation. The High Court of Malaysia has also called for the Parliament to review its use. This resolution quite correctly calls for the abolition of the Internal Security Act and any other laws that permit detention without trial.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that the Government is using the pretext of the crackdown on terrorism as a means of suppressing Government opponents and critics. The repeated use of the Internal Security Act has often been politically motivated and politically selective. It has been used to arrest and detain without trial various members of Malaysian civil society, including opposition leaders, academics, trade unionists and students, frequently without charging them and often denying them access to a lawyer.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution highlights the fact that some 40 political activists have been arrested since 2001 under the Act. The resolution rightly calls for either the release or charging of all political prisoners of conscience, including the six political prisoners specifically named in the resolution, who have been imprisoned for exercising the right to legitimate political organisation and dissent. We want to see them either released or for them to be formally charged and receive an immediate and fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would urge that all future political cooperation with Malaysia be conditional upon the Malaysian Government's abolition of the Internal Security Act and also the release of all political prisoners, so that all Malaysians may be assured that their basic human rights as enshrined in their constitution are respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title9"></a><a name="creitem9"></a>

When one considers the constitution created by the nation's wise founder, Tunku Abdurahman, under which the various states are in a federation, with the nine sultans electing a common Head of State every five years, and diverse races and religions living together without violence and largely without conflict, one might say that Malaysia had what it takes to be a model state, and, in economic terms as well, decades in succession saw repeated and outstanding development, despite the setbacks in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, then, all the more dramatic a development that Mr Mahathir's regime is beginning to take on the characteristics of an autocracy. First he attempts to act against dissent in the name of politicised Islam. Then again, he misuses the fight against terrorism, and its Islamic variety in particular, to take further action against dissidents, albeit under another label. At one moment he tries to win worldwide acclaim as the representative of democracy; the next he is a brutal autocrat, withholding even the minimum rule of law. That is what is at stake with this Internal Security Act – that appropriate judicial review should have to take place; that proper evidence should have to be produced; that detention should be under proper conditions; and that the law should provide proper means of appealing against detention. Political detainees in Malaysia enjoy none of these things.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that we have to make use of both the next EU-ASEAN summit and the next EU-ASIA summit to push energetically for a partner as important as Malaysia to respect human rights, return to its roots, renew the peaceful coexistence of the various religions and ethnic groups, and, at the end of the day, for the disappearance of the repressive measures that have been constantly stepped up in recent years, have resulted in a growing number of political prisoners, and are incompatible with Malaysia's status as one of the European Union's key partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, these are mainly former countries of the Soviet Union and surrounding areas. In Europe too, important steps are being taken towards the abolition of capital punishment, even in times of war. This has been rubberstamped by more than 36 European countries. In Asia too, there is a trend in this direction, on the part of both governments and human rights organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, and despite the positive steps being taken in the Japanese parliament, the situation in Japan is still very distressing. The number of executions that take place every year is fewer than in many other countries. Between 1993 and 2000, 39 prisoners were executed. The attendant system, however, is very different from what one would expect from a civilised and leading industrial nation. The executions take place by hanging. It takes 15 to 20 minutes before the condemned person finally dies. There have also been cases where the lawyers were not even able to collect the bodies in due course, but only the cremated remains of the prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome with open arms the announcement of the Taiwanese Ministry of Justice that capital punishment will be abolished in Taiwan in 2004. Executions were still taking place in Taiwan until 1998. This has now stopped, and in January of this year, the Mandatory Death Penalty Act of 1944 was repealed. In South Korea too, we see very hopeful movements in the direction of abolishing capital punishment. This too is to be welcomed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today we are talking about three countries in particular: South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, in which some measures have been taken which at least give us hope.</p>
<p class="contents">In Japan there has been a bill, and the Japanese Diet has created a league against the death penalty. In South Korea there has been a bill, which was signed by 155 of the 273 representatives. In Taiwan the number of crimes punishable by the death penalty has been reduced. I think that these three facts can lead us to believe that in these three countries, in the not too distant future, the death penalty could be abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">We should think not only about the harsh conditions under which prisoners condemned to death live, but also that there are 70 prisoners in South Korea and more than 50 prisoners in Taiwan who are still awaiting the death penalty. In the European Union we have concluded that the death penalty is barbaric. We therefore support the proposal from the European Council that universal abolition of the death penalty should be achieved without too much delay, so that we can look to the future with greater hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The abolition of the death penalty also expresses that view of the equal, unique and inviolable dignity of mankind which has its deepest roots in the Judaeo-Christian ethic of our Western civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s opposition to the death penalty therefore has a conscious and deeply entrenched ethical and moral basis that provides the foundation for our civilisation’s view of human beings. Enlargement of the EU will also mean abolition of the death penalty’s being a principle that will be extended to new countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We Christian Democrats and liberal conservatives in the group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regret the fact that, in the present resolution, this unifying principle of the abolition of the death penalty, which we fully support, is only affirmed in relation to free and democratic states such as Japan and South Korea, where football’s World Cup is being organised right now, together with Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">For some reason, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, together with the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the left-wing socialists and former Communist parties here in the European Parliament have chosen not to say anything at all about the abolition of the death penalty in neighbouring countries such as China and North Korea. We find that extremely one-sided and difficult to understand and therefore choose to abstain from voting in the impending vote at 5.30 p.m.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fight for the abolition of the death penalty, we must take our stance on a shared moral basis. Singling out free and democratic states gives a one-sided impression. That is deeply regrettable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am opposed to the death penalty. It needs to be abolished throughout the world, save possibly in time of war. I myself in this House appealed to President Fontaine last year to write to the US federal authorities to protest against the death penalty for the right-wing terrorist Timothy McVeigh. Yet I confess I voted against placing this issue on the agenda. I am not convinced of its urgency in the light of the fact that in South Korea the government of Kim Dae-jung has not allowed any death sentences to be carried out since he took office in February 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">In Taiwan, as the resolution itself states, there has been a recent reform in the penal code abolishing the mandatory death penalty for various violent crimes, while the Minister of Justice has stated that this is the first step towards abolishing capital punishment within the next three years.</p>
<p class="contents">In Japan there has been a Diet Members' League for the Abolition of the Death Penalty since 1993. In one sense I am almost amused that the resolution welcomes its creation nine years on. It almost warrants an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as one of the most belated welcomes in history, and I confidently expect in the future to hear in one of our resolutions that Mafeking has been relieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The League for the Abolition of the Death Penalty has 113 members from all parties in both Houses in Japan, representing almost one sixth of MPs. Last year, only two death sentences were carried out and the government has announced that it will promote a new law that will create the possibility for judges to substitute life without parole for the death penalty for capital crimes. Nevertheless, now that the matter is on the agenda, we will vote in favour of the resolution, of course, but maybe in future we can focus on those countries around the world where the carrying out of death sentences is virtually or actually a daily event. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think we had to salute this remarkable Council of Europe initiative, which is aimed not at all countries but at specific ones, namely the countries with observer status within the Council of Europe and, in particular, the United States and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">A delegation from the Council of Europe recently visited Japan to participate in a seminar organised by the Japanese Diet and, in spite of what Mr Ford says, the Parliamentary League, which has actually been in existence for nine years, had been somewhat in abeyance and has only resumed its work very recently.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I think that the issue of the death penalty in democratic countries is one thing, while the death penalty in non-democratic dictatorships is another. I freely admit that the vast majority of cases – the figure is 98% – involve dictatorships but, where dictatorships are concerned, I think that the priority is not perhaps the abolition of the death penalty but a return to democracy and the rule of law. The battle is quite different, as are the forces deployed, but I believe that this initiative, aimed at three democratic Asian countries, is important, and important for one essential reason.</p>
<p class="contents">When we meet the top leaders of the People’s Republic of China, we see them basically arguing in favour of a certain relativism in human rights whereby there is apparently a distinctively Asian approach to the issue. What, then, we have to state is that there is no such Asian approach to human rights. There is a universal approach to human rights and democracy and, that being said, enlisting countries as important as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in the ranks of the abolitionist countries is crucial to affirming this universal nature of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore obvious – and I hope, by saying this, to reassure Mr Sacrédeus – that we are not giving up the battle for the abolition of the death penalty in dictatorships. It is just that, in such countries, the problem is just one among so many others. What matters now is to affirm this idea of universality, and I think we also need to start thinking about transforming the Council of Europe. With the forthcoming enlargement, there is now an overlap between the European Union and the Council of Europe, and I think we need to think about transforming the Council of Europe into a Universal Council of Democracies into which we could integrate countries like Canada, the United States, Japan and South Korea and have them genuinely spearhead a campaign to affirm democracy throughout the world, beginning with the battles for the abolition of the death penalty and for the International Criminal Court. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU works towards the universal abolition of the death penalty, which is one of the pillars of its human rights policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the process of attaining this objective and in accordance with the EU guidelines on the abolition of the death penalty, where the death penalty still exists the EU calls for its use to be progressively restricted and insists that it be carried out according to minimum standards. The EU also presses, where relevant, for the introduction of moratoria.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU reaffirmed its commitment to the abolition of the death penalty by tabling a resolution at the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva this year. Many activities which aim to contribute to the abolition of the death penalty have been supported under the European initiative for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Funding such projects has recently been reaffirmed as a priority in the Commission's communication, or policy paper of 8 May 2001 on the Union's role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes some of the recent positive steps taken by the three countries concerned, and, firstly, the frank exchange of views at a seminar in Tokyo in May 2002 on "Justice and Human Rights in Council of Europe Observer States: the Abolition of the Death Penalty" and the establishment of a Japanese Diet members' league for the abolition of the death penalty; secondly, the bill tabled to abolish the death penalty in the Republic of Korea which was supported by a majority of the National Assembly last year; thirdly, the amendment to the penal code of Taiwan which reduces the list of crimes for which the death penalty is mandatory.</p>
<p class="contents">However, conscious that a great deal remains to be done to abolish the death penalty in the Asian region as a whole, the EU decided in 2001 to enhance its strategy for abolishing the death penalty in that part of the world on the basis of the 1998 guidelines on the death penalty. The forthcoming EU Annual Report on Human Rights for 2001/2002 will provide an overview of the action taken in the region.</p>

Captain Zidane definitely had not. In fact, the team of the candidate Member State Slovenia has been eliminated too. The homecoming of Zidane and his French team constitutes a risk to millions of animals in Europe. South Korea is currently suffering with foot and mouth disease. The virus can travel with returning players and fans in food and on their footwear.</p>
<p class="contents">Control at European airports and outposts is minimal and should be stepped up drastically, preferably along American lines. Disinfection and completing a questionnaire by travellers who arrive back from FMD-sensitive areas should become standard procedure.

It is estimated that there are currently between 650 000 and 700 000 people from the European Union who are going to return to their countries of origin, and there was foot and mouth disease in Korea very recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Council Directive 72/462 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, ovine and caprine animals and swine, fresh meat or meat products from third countries, does not apply to meat that forms part of the personal luggage of those tourists, insofar as it does not exceed 1 kg., belongs to the bovine or swine species, is fresh meat and is for personal consumption. Therefore, if we know that the foot and mouth virus can be transmitted by food carried by tourists that has been made with contaminated meat, and that it can be carried by the human body, which can be a vector even if it is not affected, as Mr van Dam also said, there is currently a degree of laxity in the inspections being conducted in the Member States, at the borders of the European Union, both external and internal, and even more so at the airports. These shortcomings have been highlighted in the report by the Commission’s Food and Veterinary Office, which points out these serious defects in the inspections of imported food and animals.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament therefore asks the Commission to urge the Member States to conduct more rigorous inspections at airports, to conduct a major information campaign among all tourists who have been to that part of the world regarding the risks that exist on their return, based on the International Animal Health Code; and for there to be a signed acceptance of responsibility in order to authorise entry to the European Union if they are coming from a country that has not been clear of the disease for at least three months.</p>
<p class="contents">As the matches are finishing on 30 June and people are returning, the Commission should, as a matter of urgency, put forward a suitable administrative and legislative process containing the strictest possible standards to be applied to inspections at borders, similar to those that are being applied in other third countries, to ensure that foot and mouth disease is not reintroduced into the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation is that this dangerous animal disease spreads in an explosive manner if it is introduced in unvaccinated stocks. We saw that happen recently, when foot and mouth disease broke out in Great Britain. We also know what damage then ensues.</p>
<p class="contents">It is irrelevant whether foot and mouth disease has broken out or is present in South Korea or in another country of the world. The mobility of people and goods, which can be transferred from one place to another in the shortest conceivable time, means that the risk is always present. So I ask the Commission whether the prophylactic resources are sufficient to avert this danger in the long term. We know that the European strategy for combating animal diseases still has its flaws. The state of knowledge, which must normally increase over time, is unchanged as regards what happens in the absence of vaccination. I ask the Commission whether the attempt should not be made to alter the animal diseases strategy in future, with particular reference to foot and mouth disease, in such a way that prophylaxis is monitored far better. As Mrs Redondo and her predecessors on the floor said, prophylaxis of course begins at the airport or on the train. Prophylaxis is, though, also to a very significant extent, a matter for the individual stock farmer, and I must say, some very worrying things come to light. When I run an open day for visitors to my farm, there is no doubt in my mind; I always see people from the towns running through the stables without taking any steps whatever to prevent the spread of disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking all these things together, I would consider it possible to stop this dangerous disease in its tracks. Let me plainly say here and now that I very much question the assumption on which we have based our actions over the past years, namely that we can stamp it out across the board. So I urge the implementation of a prophylaxis worthy of the name, and I ask the Commission to give an appropriate answer on the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one of the tasks of the Temporary FMD Committee under the dynamic leadership of Mrs Redondo Jiménez to look into this and to publish a report on this subject later on in the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Every attempt should now be made, however, to prevent FMD from being imported. The outbreak in South Korea is now in the limelight accidentally because that is where the World Cup is being held. Many supporters travel to that destination. Some return and some do so much sooner than they had wanted, and there is thus a risk of them bringing the FMD virus with them.</p>
<p class="contents">As Dr Kindermann rightly pointed out, however, travellers and tourists are already returning from Africa and Asia every day, where FMD, with its many varieties, is a common occurrence.</p>
<p class="contents">The big question is what the European Commission and the Member States have done since the most recent major outbreak last year in order to protect the external borders more effectively. The daily traveller has noticed no difference at all since then. Despite this, the latest FMD outbreak incurred billions´worth of damage to the European economy. Better border control is also expensive, of course, but much cheaper than what we have had to spend in the wake of the FMD outbreak. Financially, it is an extremely profitable investment. We have to model ourselves on the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand and impose heavy fines on imports of foodstuffs from countries that, in terms of infectious animal diseases, are in the risk area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the Commission wants to thank the European Parliament for this timely reminder of the risks of foot-and-mouth disease. The outbreak in the Republic of Korea coincides with the World Cup when many thousands of Europeans are present to support their football teams. Clearly, we need to be alert to any potential risks that they may come in contact with the disease and return with it to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not, however, focus our attention only on Korea. The fact is that foot-and-mouth disease is widespread throughout the world. All foot-and-mouth-affected countries represent a potential risk to Member States and therefore the problem must be addressed in a general way.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it would appear that the outbreaks in the Republic of Korea are at least 40 km away from the nearest football venues, the potential threat to Member States cannot be ignored. Therefore, this issue was discussed with Member States at the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain on 8 May 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I also understand that Mrs Redondo, chairperson of Parliament's Committee on foot-and-mouth, raised the issue directly with my colleague David Byrne. This is no doubt in the context of the ongoing work of Parliament's Temporary Committee on foot-and-mouth disease. I understand the issue of controls, including on passengers at points of entry to the EU, is the primary focus of the committee's work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has subsequently reminded all Member States that, in accordance with EU law they are not authorised to import from the Republic of Korea foot-and-mouth disease susceptible animals and their products (fresh meat, meat products, meat preparations, milk, milk products, etc.). They have also been advised that imports of foodstuffs from Korea by passengers are not allowed under EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has requested that all Member States ensure that public awareness of travellers visiting Korea is specifically addressed at airports and that controls at points of entry into the Community on goods coming from the Republic of Korea are reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic, the Commission has been preparing a number of proposals addressing the issues related to foot-and-mouth, including measures to raise public awareness. The Commission intends to present a proposal shortly to raise public awareness and reinforce controls on passengers at points of entry.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the technical and logistical problems, and consequently the financial implications associated with such procedures, should not be underestimated. It must be borne in mind, that unlike Australia or New Zealand, the EU has a long land border. There is passenger traffic of millions each year between our Member States and third countries where foot-and-mouth disease is endemic.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are air-traffic links with 90 countries that are not internationally recognised to be free of foot-and-mouth disease and infection. The extent of the challenge is also highlighted by the existing difficulties in combating drug smuggling in international transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to thank the European Parliament for raising public awareness of the risk from foot-and-mouth disease. I am sure that the issue can be addressed in greater detail following the report of the Committee on foot-and-mouth disease and in the light of the Commission's forthcoming proposals on foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall pass on the record of this debate to my colleague David Byrne. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When the Maoist rebels attacked the Nepalganj army camp at the end of May, over 100 of them were killed, as were many soldiers. The number killed since the conflict broke out six years ago has risen to 3 500.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite international appeals for peace, there is no sign of the violence coming to an end. What is worse is that families in Kathmandu and western Nepal – with whom I have had contact for years and whom I visit regularly – tell me that the fighting is getting more intense from day to day. The rebels are destroying specific infrastructure targets, cutting off the public's supply of electricity, and murdering both police officers – who are poorly trained – and government officials in the provinces.</p>
<p class="contents">The overwhelming majority of the Nepalese people are still backing the monarchy and supporting King Gyanendra, who has substantially gained authority in the past few difficult months. He has dissolved Parliament early at the request of the Prime Minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba, and called new elections for 13 November this year. He has appealed to all sections of the population to turn out to vote in large numbers and thereby unambiguously declare their support for democracy and play their part in bringing about internal stability.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is supporting Nepal to the tune of some EUR 15 million, and quite rightly so. I speak on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats when I say that it should send independent observers to see that these November elections are fair and free and that the secrecy of the ballot is maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the European Union should definitely be willing to act as a mediator in this conflict, should it be asked to do so. Quite apart from that, there must be no let-up in the efforts to make use of every opportunity for negotiations between the parties that presents itself. We are also looking to see a proper trial for Krishna Sen, imprisoned on suspicion of leading guerrilla operations, and for four other suspected members of the banned Communist Party.</p>
<p class="contents">I know Nepal very well – it is one of the poorest countries in the world, but also one of the most fascinating. Its principal source of income is tourism, and of that it is currently deprived. Why? It is because of the lack of security in this beautiful part of the Himalayas that thousands of foreign visitors are choosing not to travel to Nepal.</p>
<p class="contents">As much as they need the state's internal affairs to be well ordered, Nepal's people need even more sustainable interventions, economic and structural reforms in all parts of the country, if they are at last to emerge from poverty, which is one of the essential causes of violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of the Socialist group on the resolution on Nepal, we have a situation where Maoist rebels are threatening a very fragile constitutional monarchy, and the situation is in danger of fast sliding into a civil war. Several thousand people have died and hundreds have been arrested. The way forward is clear: the Government must ensure respect for human rights and internal law. The alleged massacres of 500 Maoist guerrillas in May, if it is true, will only make the situation worse.</p>
<p class="contents">We must provide the means from the European Union to try and find a peaceful solution to the current conflict, and the finance to help rebuild the economy, in particular in the rural areas. The government of Nepal itself must restore the rule of law and order and there is a need to set up an independent investigation into the allegations against the security forces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I now turn to Nepal. The Commission deplores the increasing number of victims of continuous clashes between Maoist and Government forces, particularly following the promulgation of the state of emergency. The EC is also particularly concerned by the consequences of the suspension of constitutional guarantees and by reports of abuses perpetrated by terrorist attacks and counter-insurgency forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU was disappointed by the interruption of the negotiations with Maoist leaders started by new Prime Minister Deuba in November 2001. The new wave of terrorist attacks is having a disastrous impact on the economy and progressively disrupting the entire development process in Nepal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is further concerned that the recent dissolution of the House of Representatives marks a blow to democracy in Nepal. The anticipation of new elections on 13 November 2002, the establishment of a "caretaker government" and the extension of the state of emergency will not help ensure a solution to the Maoist problem. It will further increase the democratic deficit of Nepalese institutions, while further delaying the most urgent administrative reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission calls on the Nepalese political class to abandon the internal rifts and personal rivalry that are one of the causes of the endemic state of crisis of Nepal.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the political crisis, the Commission is committed to support for Nepal's sustainable development. The primary objectives of the new EC Cooperation Strategy for Nepal for 2002-2006 will be the consolidation of democracy, conflict prevention and poverty eradication. Development activities will be located in the most deprived areas of the country, including the west, with the hope of improving poor socio-economic conditions of local populations and thereby reducing any pro-Maoist sympathies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is at present considering the possibility of supporting the electoral process of 13 November 2002 with EU observers. The Commission has also planned the mobilisation of conflict prevention resources through the Rapid Reaction Mechanism following an overall assessment of the situation and a detailed report carried out in February 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>European enterprises face an ever increasing volume of liability rules in vastly different areas (environmental liability, product liability, etc.). The host of national and Community legal provisions under which an entrepreneur can be held liable for his business activities are a burden for European SMEs, in particular, because they are so numerous as to cause confusion and so complex in terms of what they regulate and in many instances, because of the financial consequences they involve, they are even a threat to a firm's existence.</p>

<p>At Lisbon, the Community set itself the clear goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. To achieve this goal, the Community also has to have the will and the means.</p>
<p>Economic analysis and surveys seem to indicate a lack of dynamism in Europe and it is generally felt that there is scope for enhancing entrepreneurial activity, particularly if the Community is to exploit fully the opportunities arising in the knowledge economy. The Community must allow entrepreneurship to play its full part in delivering the shared objectives.</p>
<p>Hence the significance of the Green Paper on Entrepreneurship, which must look at the whole range of issues that has to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Barcelona Council (March 2002) has noted that the Commission will submit the Green Paper before the 2003 Spring European Council.</p>
<p>The approach that is envisaged is that a broad debate should be launched on the significance of entrepreneurship, on how to promote entrepreneurial drive and how to achieve the right balance between entrepreneurship policy and other policy considerations.</p>
<p>The Lisbon conclusions were based on the idea that economic performance, social cohesion and sustainable development mutually reinforce one-another.</p>
<p>In this context, it will certainly be necessary to face the issue of regulatory and other restrictions on entrepreneurial activity. It will be necessary to stimulate debate about the complementarity between the objectives of providing an encouraging environment for entrepreneurs, to enable them to create growth and viable jobs and the objectives of social cohesion and sustainable development (NB. as stated in Lisbon, economic performance and social cohesion do not oppose each other, but rather go hand in hand!).</p>
<p>In referring to these issues, it is important to bear in mind the parallel debates on Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development, and the fact that many businesses recognise the need to integrate ethical, social and environmental considerations into their strategy and daily operations. They do so as a way of better managing risks, improving their performance and ensuring their long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>The particular issues concerning environmental liability, product liability, etc raised by the Honourable Member, are certainly instances of a more general regulatory issue that arises from both Community and Member State legislation. There may indeed be reference in the Green Paper to such specific concerns, by way of focusing attention. However, it does not look likely at this stage that the Green Paper will want to highlight the question of regulations concerning liability, to the exclusion of other regulatory questions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0409"></a>

<p>The Commission sent out a letter last year, encouraging airlines to inform their passengers on the possible risks of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) during long flights, and on precautionary measures to take, for example leg exercises during travel and it plans to contact the airline associations shortly, to find out which initiatives have been taken so far.</p>
<p>As for adequate legroom for passengers, it should be noted that the distance between seats in aircraft cabins is regulated for safety reasons, in particular to allow evacuations during emergencies. Medical opinion seems to indicate that the real problem concerns immobility. Both passengers from economy and first class can be vulnerable, even though more legroom is available in first class. The leg exercises, proposed by doctors, can be carried out in the legroom presently available in aircraft.</p>
<p>In order to find a clearer answer to the question of how far DVT is linked to air transport, the Commission will co-finance a study on DVT. This study will be carried out by experts, under the auspices of the World Health Organisation. The study aims to measure the strength of the link between air transport and DVT, and the importance of other, patient-related factors, like age, weight and medical condition. It will also examine the effects of cabin conditions, like low air pressure and levels of oxygen.</p>
<p>As the strength of this link is not known, it is not possible for the Member States or the World Health Organisation to collect statistics at this stage. The above mentioned epidemiological study will certainly facilitate the design and collection of statistics, once the results are known.</p>

<p>Over the last months, the public debate in Lithuania on the early closure of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (of an RBMK type similar to the reactors at the Chernobyl NPP, but with improved safety features) has been particularly intense. The Commission is encouraged that this debate will lead to Lithuania taking its decision in the near future. The Ignalina NPP is the only nuclear power plant with power reactors of the RBMK type in candidate countries. The Union expects Unit 2 to close by 2009, at the latest. On 14 May 2002, the Lithuanian Parliament passed a resolution, giving the Government a mandate to negotiate the terms for the closure of Unit 2 with the Member States of the Union. A clear commitment of Lithuania to close down Unit 2 by 2009 at the latest will be needed for the closure of the chapter Energy in the accession negotiations.</p>
<p>Within the framework of its regular dialogue with Lithuania, the Commission has constantly highlighted the expectation of the Union with regard to the closure date. Since 1999, the Commission has enhanced this dialogue through a joint Community-Lithuanian Working Group on Energy. Members of the Commission have persistently pursued the said closure date during their bilateral meetings with Lithuanian interlocutors.</p>
<p>Also since 1999, the Commission has committed Community funding from the PHARE financial instrument to support Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia in their decommissioning efforts regarding the respective power reactors subject to early closure. With regard to Lithuania, in view of the burden of decommissioning that is not commensurate with the size and economic strength of the country, and acknowledging that decommissioning will last for decades the Commission furthermore proposed, earlier in 2002, to the Member States to continue its assistance as an act of Union solidarity with Lithuania also after accession.</p>
<p>In its information note of October 2001 to the Gent European Council meeting on a mid-term review of the implementation of the enlargement strategy, the Commission stated that the closure commitments regarding Ignalina, Bohunice V1 and certain units of Kozloduy must be respected and therefore duly included in the Accession Treaties.</p>
<p>With regard to Bulgaria, according to an Understanding reached in 1999, the Commission expects Bulgaria’s decision on the closure dates of Units 3 and 4 at the Kozloduy NPP by the end of this year, and that the firm date for final closure of units 3 and 4 will be no later than 2006. The Commission is already closely monitoring the preparation for final shut down of Units 1 and 2 by the end of this year, following the schedule that Bulgaria agreed with the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission has no reason to assume that Lithuania, Slovakia or Bulgaria will not close the reactor units in time, once all closure dates will have been decided. The Commission is also engaged, together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) as the manager of the three International Decommissioning Support Funds through which the bulk of Community-funded support to decommissioning measures in the three respective candidate countries is delivered, in pursuing that the necessary decommissioning projects are designed and implemented without undue delay. The Commission both chairs the Assemblies of Contributors to these three Funds as well as represents the Community as the largest single Contributor.</p>
<p>Thus, the Commission is continually engaged in a variety of actions to ensure the timely closure of certain reactor types that the Honourable Member has summarised as “high-risk”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0362"></a>

<p>The Commission has defined the preservation of the European agricultural model as one of the core elements of its Agenda 2000 reform proposal. This requires both a clearer recognition and a more determined defence, both internally and externally, of the multifunctional role of agriculture in European society: it needs to be stressed that agriculture not only plays an economic role but also makes a social and an environmental contribution.</p>
<p>To the above end, the Commission obtained from the budgetary authority a financial framework enabling the above objective to be met. It is clear from the first two years of implementation of the Agenda 2000 reform that attainment of the objective is feasible within that financial framework.</p>
<p>The Commission's recent proposal concerning the agricultural dimension of enlargement was based on the principle that the acquis communautaire should be applied. It is compatible with the existing financial perspective (which will, in any case, need to be adjusted in the wake of enlargement).</p>
<p>As regards the mid-term review shortly to be submitted to the Council and Parliament, the Commission will be guided by the same objectives. There is no question of the CAP being undermined.</p>
<p>From a longer-term perspective, the Commission will of course strive for the continuous improvement of the instruments of the CAP (entailing their simplification, as well as the further development of subsidiarity, as is already the case for the utilisation of the national envelopes for the COMs and the rural development measures), and it will, at the same time, continue to work for the preservation of the CAP's basic principles.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0372"></a>

<p>At its fourth meeting, which took place in Tbilisi on 29 and 30 April 2002, the EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee adopted a final document in which (item 14) it ‘calls on the Georgian and EU authorities to fulfil, as soon as possible, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), in order to create the basis for starting negotiations for an Association Agreement’.</p>
<p>Can the Commission provide a comprehensive list of points of the Cooperation Agreement which have not yet been implemented and the reasons why this is case, together with a statement of strategy and the timetable prepared by the Commission so that the Agreement as a whole can be implemented as soon as possible?</p>
<p>Moreover, does the Commission not consider that the PCA, or even a possible Association Agreement, is not a suitable EU response for Georgia to be able to face the challenges arising out of the region’s extremely problematic situation? Does the Commission not consider that the issue of Georgia’s accession to the EU should no longer be evaded, and that therefore, without further delay, Georgia should be included in the list of candidate countries, on the understanding that its membership will depend on its ability to integrate the acquis communautaire into its national legislation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with Georgia entered into force in July 1999. The Union supports Georgia's aspiration to integrate further into European models and structures. Since independence in 1991, the Union has provided technical assistance of some EUR 350 million to support Georgia’s transition. For example, the Union Food Security Programme covers about 65% of budget of Ministry of Agriculture, a sector accounting for 40% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 60% of labour force.</p>
<p>However, the country faces very severe difficulties:</p>
<p>Since 1991, one million people have left the country;</p>
<p>GDP per capita has decreased by 70%;</p>
<p>60% of the population is poor;</p>
<p>Two unresolved internal conflicts have generated nearly 300 000 internally displaced persons;</p>
<p>Corruption (including vested interests in maintaining status quo on conflicts) is rampant;</p>
<p>Announced reforms in the electoral code, local self-government were not adopted following the Presidential elections in 2000;</p>
<p>Religious minorities are victims of aggressions which the authorities have difficulty in punishing.</p>
<p>All of this, as well as the lack of implementation of existing legislation, hamper progress and limit the impact of Union assistance. Commitments undertaken by Georgia in October 2000 to adopt a national programme for PCA implementation have not yet materialised. Respect for the rule of law in trade and business (customs, taxes) is a key concern. Foreign investments are almost non existent. The Union reviews all these issues during the regular annual meetings. Furthermore, we want to be stricter in ensuring Georgia fulfils all conditions linked to our assistance.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Commission considers that it cannot envisage any further step at this stage other than to pursue full implementation of PCA. This depends mostly on political, social and economic reforms, as well as on resolution of two internal conflicts on which the lead must come from Georgia itself. The Georgian authorities who have not requested Union membership or candidate status are very well aware of the situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0374"></a>

<p>The thematic priority 5 (« Food Quality and Safety ») of the Union sixth framework research programme (FP6) aims at assuring consumer health and well being by providing safer, high-quality and health-promoting foods, including seafoods, relying on fully controlled and integrated production systems. This end-user driven approach will trigger research on the development of new, safer, fully traceable, seafood products and feeds. Given that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) constitute a major part of the seafood sector, the success of activities undertaken will rely on the adaptation of knowledge and processes to the specific characteristics of these enterprises.</p>

<p>In the support it gives to consumer organisations under the current financial legal basis for Community activities in favour of consumers the Commission works at two levels<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>:</p>
<p>-first, the Commission provides financial support for the activities of European consumer organisations of which national consumer organisations are members. There is no direct core funding allocated to national consumer organisations;</p>
<p>-second, the Commission provides financial support for specific projects to promote the interests of consumers in the Member States. These projects can be described as follows:</p>
<p>The Commission develops education and capacity building measures, which are most helpful to weaker national consumer organisations, including organisations from Ireland.</p>
<p>As presented in the new Consumer Policy Strategy<a href="#defann_15_2" name="refann_15_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission will develop an on-line inter-active project to improve information and education for consumers. This website is designed for consumer associations and other multipliers to train their staff in specific aspects of cross-border transactions such as financial services. To this end, the Commission will make full use of best practices developed by Member States and consumer organisations.</p>
<p>The Commission is also launching a training project to strengthen the capacity of consumer organisations. The Commission will organise, from 2002 to 2004, training actions for staff members from all consumer organisations - including Irish consumer organisations - in 3 areas: management, public relations and lobbying, as well as Union consumer law.</p>
<p>There are also specific programmes to which national consumer organisations can apply provided they meet certain criteria.</p>
<p>Every year, the Commission publishes call for projects and gives financial support to specific transnational education projects. Several education projects have been co-ordinated by Irish consumer organisations in the past.</p>
<p>It is also worthwhile mentioning the annual European Young Consumer Competition, organised since 1993, in which more than 1200 schools participate. Fifty-six Irish schools participated in this project in 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>- Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (‘Brussels I’)<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which, following the Treaty of Amsterdam, communitarised the Brussels Convention of 27 September 1968. Denmark is, of course, party to the Brussels Convention;</p>
<p>- Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, by which the Council communitarised a convention of 26 May 1997 concluded within the framework of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union (but which has never entered into force). The ‘Brussels I’ regulation explicitly refers to the provisions of the Regulation on the transmission of documents for its application.</p>
<p>This solution was devised by the Commission, observing the following principles:</p>
<p>	In accordance with its Protocol, Denmark does not have a case-by-case opt-in facility as regards the measures based on Title IV of the EC Treaty which do not represent an extension of the Schengen acquis. The restrictive wording of Article 5 of the Protocol relating solely to the measures ‘to build upon the Schengen acquis’ does not allow, under any circumstances, its application to be extended to other measures under Title IV of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>	At any time, Denmark may, in accordance with its constitutional requirements, inform the other Member States that it no longer wishes to avail itself of all or part of this Protocol. In that event, Denmark will apply in full all relevant measures then in force that have been adopted within the framework of the Union (Article 7 of the Protocol).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the Commission’s opinion, the long-term objective must be Denmark’s full participation in the measures based on Title IV of the EC within the institutional framework of the Community, once Denmark has fulfilled the necessary constitutional requirements to this end.</p>
<p>	It follows that any mechanism enabling Denmark to participate in all or a significant number of the measures based on Title IV of the EC Treaty, such as the conclusion of agreements on the instruments mentioned by the honourable Member and adopted in accordance with Article 65 of the Treaty in the area of family law or insolvency, where this participation did not take place within the institutional framework of the Community, would be incompatible with the spirit of the Protocol on the position of Denmark. It would certainly make it less in Denmark’s interest to renounce its Protocol and the answer to the fundamental problem raised by the honourable Member must, ultimately, be that it should renounce the Protocol.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore considered, when adopting its decision of 30 April 2002, that the conclusion of parallel agreements with Denmark in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters can only be envisaged in the two exceptional cases set out above.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As East Timor is to celebrate its independence on 20 May it appears that many East Timorese living in Indonesia are concerned about returning to their homeland for security reasons. Furthermore, the same security forces that are allegedly responsible for crimes against humanity and several violations of human rights in East Timor are now operating in Aceh and West Papua. Many human rights abuses have been identified by local NGOs and these in turn have been threatened by militia.</p>
<p>As the Commission is actively involved in promoting development projects in Indonesia, I would like to know what it proposes to do to address these very serious and consistent human rights breaches. Would it suspend funding or condition the allocation of funding to the thorough respect of human rights? Would the Commission send an inspection team to ensure that human rights are respected and that the militia are disbanded?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is concerned by the security situation and human rights abuses within Indonesia and continues to monitor the situation closely, participating in appropriate Union demarches to the Indonesian authorities.</p>
<p>The situation is calm in the newly independent Democratic Republic of East Timor. Independence on 20 May was attended by the President of Indonesia Mrs. Megawati Soekarnoputri who was welcomed by President Xanana Gusmao of East Timor.</p>
<p>Of the 250 000 refugees in West Timor in 1999, approximately 30 000 East Timorese still remain in Indonesia and most of them reportedly want to stay there. The Commission has provided EUR 6 million through United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to assist repatriation of refugees from West to East Timor, including a contribution to the Reception, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which has been operating in East Timor since January 2002 to facilitate re-entry of refugees and resolution of post-conflict tensions. The Union continues to encourage Indonesia to proceed with the Ad Hoc Human Rights Tribunal investigating past human rights abuses in East Timor.</p>
<p>The situation in Aceh has preoccupied the Commission for some time now. Union Heads of Mission visited the region in October 2001. The Commission has therefore welcomed the Joint Statement issued on 10 May by the Indonesian Government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), following two days of consultations in Geneva. This Statement recognised the Special Autonomy Law as the starting point for further negotiations in an all-inclusive dialogue and confirmed the intention of both parties to work on an agreement for the cessation of hostilities. It is our view that full implementation of the special autonomy legislation will be key to a durable resolution of the present situation.</p>
<p>Papua has equally been a matter of continued concern. The Union has condemned the kidnapping and murder of Theys Eluay in November 2001 and called on the Government of Indonesia to ensure a full investigation of this dreadful incident and bring its perpetrators to justice. Union Heads of Mission in Jakarta also visited Papua in February 2002. In the case of Papua, too, it is clear that full implementation of the special autonomy legislation will be key to the resolution of the current situation.</p>
<p>The Commission has included in its Country Strategy Paper for Indonesia, now in the final stages of preparation, particular emphasis on institutional capacity building, good governance and rule of law, as well as conflict prevention. Financial support has already been committed to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)-managed Partnership for Governance Reform, and Technical Assistance has been provided to the Attorney General’s Office. Provision has been made in the draft National Indicative Programme, 2002-2004, for a specific programme to support implementation of the Government’s policy for decentralisation in Indonesia and to promote good governance at the local government level. In addition, Indonesia is one of 29 focus countries of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have also taken steps to support conflict resolution more directly. Following discussions between the Commissioner in charge of External relations and the Indonesian Foreign Minister last November, and in the context of the Commission’s Rapid Reaction Mechanism, an independent mission on conflict prevention in Indonesia visited the Moluccas, Sulawesi and Papua in February 2002. (A visit to Aceh was not possible at that time because of security conditions.) The expert mission met a wide range of Central and Local Government representatives, as well as Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in these areas. On the basis of the mission’s report, a package of projects is now in preparation for the Moluccas and Papua. The projects in Papua will support both the regional authorities and civil society.</p>
<p>All of these measures are consistent with the Commission’s support for the Union’s stated position, which firmly supports the territorial integrity of Indonesia, while encouraging the Government to make urgent efforts to address and resolve peacefully Indonesia’s internal conflicts, whether separatist or sectarian in character. The Commission will continue to follow this approach and to provide all possible support for constructive action to deal with these very difficult situations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0388"></a>

<p>Respect of human rights, including non-discrimination of homosexuals, is a key element of the political accession criteria laid down by the European Council at Copenhagen in 1993. This was confirmed by the Commissioner in charge of Enlargement, speaking in the Parliament on 4 September 2001.</p>
<p>Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the Community provides a basis for action to combat discrimination on a number of grounds, including sexual orientation. Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation shall be prohibited.</p>
<p>The 2001 Regular Reports published in November 2001 provided an assessment of the progress made by candidate countries in this respect and referred to anti-homosexual legislation in particular in the field of criminal law in a number of candidate countries.</p>
<p>The Report noted that Romania decriminalised homosexuality in June 2001 by repealing Article 200 of the Penal Code. This was confirmed by the Romanian Parliament at the end of 2001.</p>
<p>In some candidate countries, the existing criminal law still provides for different ages of consent for heterosexual versus homosexual relations, which is however also the case in some Member States.</p>
<p>Candidate countries are required to transpose Council Directive 2000/78/EC<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation by the time of accession to the Union. This Directive prohibits direct and indirect discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and a number of other grounds.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to monitor closely and assess developments in this area, in particular in the context of preparation of the 2002 Regular Reports. In its contacts with candidate countries, the Commission highlights, where appropriate, the importance to remove any kind of discrimination in legislation or in practice.</p>
<p>The Commission stresses that compliance with the Political Criteria is the essential precondition for opening of negotiations with any candidate country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Fishmeal is, in the main, produced from fish for which there is no market for human consumption and for which Community fishing is restricted in order to limit its impact on the marine environment. However, as indicated in its proposal to reform the common fisheries policy, the Commission will give particular attention to this area and will request the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to carry out an evaluation of the impact of industrial fishing on marine eco-systems.</p>
<p>Council Decision 2000/766/EC of 4 December 2000<a href="#defann_20_2" name="refann_20_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> banned the use of processed animal protein (PAP) in the feed of animals intended for use in the production of foodstuffs. The use of fishmeal in feedingstuffs for non-ruminants is still permitted, however, under certain conditions.</p>
<p>In organic farming, where synthetic nutritional supplements are banned, the practice of not using fishmeal has caused problems of well-being in farmed poultry, giving rise to a deficiency in these animals of certain essential amino acids such as methionine, lysine and threonine.</p>
<p>In March 2001, the Commission presented an analysis<a href="#defann_20_3" name="refann_20_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> of the consequences of the ban on PAP, and more generally of the consequences of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) on supply and demand relating to plant proteins. Following the ban on mammalian meal for ruminants in 1994, protein from fish- or animal meal represented, in 1999, only 2.4% of crude protein used for feedingstuffs, and that was mainly for pigs and poultry. Most of the protein was obtained from meat-and-bonemeal.</p>
<p>Plant products containing proteins, such as oilseeds and cereals, in particular, are widely available on the markets, and there has not been a significant or sustained increase in their price following the ban on PAP.</p>
<p>Replacing fishmeal with plant proteins or synthetic or hydrolysed amino acids does not pose any major technical or economic problem for traditional livestock farming.</p>
<p>In terms of organic farming, some problems have been noted and zootechnical solutions are currently being examined for these.</p>
<p>For fish farms, however, there are still major problems, given that the majority of species of farmed fish require certain nutritional substances which are not found in fishmeal. There is currently no possibility, therefore, of an effective substitute for fishmeal in aquaculture.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission, which has recently received reports that include the specific cases referred to in the question of the Honourable member, remains concerned by the human rights situation in Iran and Pakistan and views the practice of inhuman punishment in these countries, such as stoning, as particularly disturbing.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the comprehensive dialogue between the Union and Iran, questions regarding human rights, including stoning, are consistently raised by the Union side.</p>
<p>As to the draft negotiating mandate submitted by the Commission to the Council for a Trade and Cooperation Agreement with Iran, with which no contractual relations have yet been established, the Commission can confirm that a clause on human rights is intended to be included in the future agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission is actively participating in joint Union efforts to address human rights issues in Pakistan. The new Community-Pakistan Cooperation Agreement, which contains a clause on human rights and democratic principles, will offer, once it has entered into force, the possibility to re-establish the full cooperation dialogue with Pakistan, including on human rights issues.</p>
<p>The Union has consistently opposed the imposition of the death penalty and has set out its policy in the Guidelines to Union policy towards third countries on the death penalty. These guidelines also underline that those States which persist in applying the penalty must do so in a manner which inflicts the minimum possible suffering. Clearly, the practice of stoning would not conform to that condition. The Union also pushes for moratoria pending abolition.</p>
<p>In addition to raising the issue of the death penalty in contacts with States which retain it, the Union has also taken a strong lead in international fora. The Union tables the annual resolutions on the death penalty at both the United Nations (UN) Commission on Human Rights and at the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. It also draws attention to the application of the penalty in particular countries.</p>
<p>The Council Working Group (COHOM) will take stock of recent Union efforts against the death penalty in both Africa and Asia at its meeting on 20th June.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0392"></a>

<p>The Commission is very much aware of the seriousness of the nuclear waste situation in North-West (NW) Russia, and of the importance of working together with the Russian authorities to address this. The task is not an easy one, in part because most nuclear sites in the regions still come under the control of the military. Moreover, nuclear safety or clean-up projects are very complex and expensive activities, which must be carried out in a stable and well-defined legal framework which currently remains to be completed.</p>
<p>Significant progress is being made in the context of the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP) Support Fund, which the Commission hopes will soon start its operations with the full political and financial involvement of the Russian Federation. The Commission has already indicated its willingness to contribute EUR 50 million to the Fund, and a pledging conference bringing together all potential contributors will be held in Brussels in July.</p>
<p>In this context, the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme in the Russian Federation (MNEPR) will make an important contribution to improving the legal framework in which some donors can operate (though Tacis, for example, is already covered by a separate agreement). Negotiations on the text of the MNEPR agreement had made considerable progress last year, when the Commission and other Western donors had agreed with the Russian authorities on a compromise text. More recently, however, it seems that the different Russian authorities concerned have not been able to confirm their agreement on this text, whose signature has therefore been delayed.</p>
<p>This is a matter to which the Commission and other Western donors attach great importance, and the topic has been raised at a number of meetings, at all levels, held with the Russians in the last months. Most recently, this matter was raised at the Union-Russia Summit on 29 May, and the Commission shall continue to press for an early signature of the MNEPR agreement at every available opportunity. While awaiting resolution of this issue, however, the Commission does not think it useful to delay in implementing the NDEP Support Fund, nor our other contributions to nuclear safety and waste-management in the region.</p>
<p>As regards the Lepse issue, we likewise remain committed to the successful implementation of this important project. The next (industrial) phase is currently in an advanced stage of preparation, and donors, including the Community, are coordinating their efforts with the beneficiary to achieve an early and effective commencement of these activities. This will however require a positive resolution of negotiations on the MNEPR agreement, confirming the importance of this agreement as a major step in addressing nuclear safety and waste issues in NW Russia.</p>
<p>More generally, it might be noted that the Commission of course remains extremely active in addressing nuclear safety and waste issues in this region and elsewhere in Russia and the other New Independant States (NIS). Over the period 1991-2001, the Union has committed some EUR 825 million under the Tacis programme to international efforts to improve nuclear safety levels in the NIS. Along with this financial effort, the Commission continues to give nuclear safety issues an important place in the Union policy dialogue with the Russian Federation, with the overall objective of raising awareness and promoting a whole-hearted Russian participation in the solution of these critical issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0393"></a>

<p>According to information received from the Greek authorities, the “Cross-border Commercial Exhibition and Export Center Promakhon AE” project was co-financed by the Structural Funds during the 1994-1999 period. The project was selected for support in response to a call for an expression of interest launched by the managing authority (Northern Greece Agency for the Development of Private Infrastructures) in relation to the financing of commercial, distribution and exhibition centres, either of a cross-border nature or in urban areas. The project provided infrastructure needed for such a centre which is an eligible expenditure in accordance with the rules governing the Structural Funds. The business premises developed under the project were leased to companies active in various sectors. No contractual obligation exists that would limit these to a 'cross border transit centre'.</p>

<p>In particular the Commission is verifying whether or not the aid measures are covered by broader State aid schemes already approved by the Commission in the past.

Public money may play a role but other factors may be more decisive in terms of where to invest.

Firstly, in the guidelines on regional national aid<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission laid down provisions which oblige those receiving structural aid to maintain any investment or employment created during a period of five years.

If Community production exceeds 1 777 261 tonnes, aid is reduced proportionally in line with the amount by which the national guaranteed quantity is exceeded for each Member State. Furthermore, the Community has limited grants of aid for olive oil produced from olive trees planted before 1 May 1998. The common organisation of the market does not provide for aid to fell olive trees and the Commission is not encouraging the planting of additional olive trees.

<p>During the passage of the review of the COM in sheepmeat and goatmeat through the European Parliament last autumn, I tabled a number of amendments which aimed to prevent the widespread exodus of sheep farmers from this sector. One such amendment which was accepted by the Parliament proposed that 'for the purposes of calculating the extensification premium, the first 15 livestock units of ewe/she-goat shall be excluded from consideration'.</p>
<p>As the Commission agreed on the record in the Parliamentary debate to deal with this issue under the mid-term review, what measures will the Commission adopt to include this much-needed provision in the review which will prevent further exodus of European farmers from the sheep sector?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>An important aim of the Agenda 2000 reforms in the beef sector was to tighten the eligibility criteria for extensification premium scheme for beef cattle by including in the calculation of stocking density all bovines, actually present on the farm, and all sheep for which premium is claimed.</p>
<p>That is the reason why, at the time of the discussions of the sheep reform, the Commission was reluctant to consider any exemption for sheep from the calculation of the extensification payment because the objective of the payment is to encourage producers to practise extensive beef production, that is, to produce beef at low stocking density.</p>
<p>While the Commission is aware of the arguments forwarded at the end of last year by the Honourable Member, since then, an ongoing Special Report of the Court of Auditors on the extensification payment goes further against any flexibility in this domain.</p>
<p>The Court criticises the fact that the stocking density calculation fails to apply to all sheep present but only those receiving premiums. This means that the Commission must now answer questions over why the eligibility rules are not tighter, rather than weaker, with regard to sheep.</p>
<p>Turning to considerations of the beef and sheep sectors and the Mid Term Review, the Commission has been analysing the situation of these livestock markets and their prospects in the annual Medium Term Forecasts.</p>
<p>The high price that has been a feature of the sheep meat market in the Union since the year 2000, coupled with the new, fixed level of the ewe premium of EUR 21 head (or EUR 16,8 for producers marketing sheep's milk or products based on sheep's milk), have been identified as contributing to very favourable prospects for the sheep sector, such that the relative profitability of sheep compared to beef is expected to improve.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Honourable Member can be assured that this issue has been taken into consideration in our preparations for the Mid Term Review.

<p>In October 2001, the Commission sent the United Kingdom Government a formal request for information about its application of EU law relating to excise duties on tobacco and alcohol, following a complaint about the rigid application by UK Customs and Excise of quantitative ‘guidelines’ on imports of duty-paid alcohol and tobacco. Such practices have included the seizure not only of goods but also of the vehicles used to transport them – often private cars. In December 2001, the United Kingdom sent a reply.</p>

<p>In October 2001 the Commission initiated an enquiry into certain practices of United Kingdom Customs &amp; Excise. The purpose of this enquiry is to ensure that the United Kingdom applies the harmonised rules on excise duties properly, in distinguishing between individuals holding excisable goods for commercial purposes, and travellers engaged in legitimate cross-border shopping who bring back such goods from other Member States, solely for their own use.</p>
<p>This matter, which concerns the crucial but delicate balance between the general principles of the Internal Market and the fight against fraud, obviously calls for a most thorough analysis. Thus, in addition to the information provided by complainants and the British Government, the Commission recently dispatched officials on a mission to the United Kingdom to gain first-hand impressions of the situation.</p>
<p>The material gathered by the Commission’s services is still being carefully considered. The Commission hopes to be able to reach its final conclusions shortly, but it is still too early to announce any action that the Commission may decide to take.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0413"></a>

<p>Following the recent extension of the EU list of terrorist organisations to include the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), there is a growing fear that the Turkish state's policy of oppression against the Kurdish people will be reinforced.</p>
<p>How, in the Commission’s view, will this decision affect a peaceful resolution of the Kurdish question?</p>
<p>Whom does the Commission consider to be its interlocutor in the peace process on the Kurdish side, now that the PKK has been included on the list of terrorist organisations?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Council Regulation 2580/2001<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, to which the Honourable Members refers, sets out specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism. This Regulation is intended to implement the Common Security and Foreign Policy Council Common Position of 27 December 2001 establishing the list of persons, groups and entities involved in terrorist acts. The Regulation and the Common Position implement Resolution 1373 (2001 of the Security Council of the United Nations (UN), which is based on Chapter VII of the UN Charter and thus creates an obligation for UN Members to act.</p>
<p>This list was further updated by a Council decision of 2 May 2002 to include other groups and entities. The Council decided to include the PKK and the DHKP/C among the groups and entities in this list. It will be up to the Council to decide whether, when further adapting the list, to include KADEK (successor of PKK) among the groups and entities involved in terrorist acts.</p>
<p>The Commission is monitoring closely developments in Turkey in the context of the enlargement process. As an Union candidate country, Turkey has to comply with the Copenhagen political criteria. The respect for cultural rights for all Turkish citizens, regardless of their origin is a short-term priority of the Accession Partnership.</p>
<p>Other short-term priorities concern the use of languages other than Turkish and the reduction of regional disparities, with a view to improving the situation in the Southeast. The Accession Partnership also provides for the lifting of the state of emergency in the Southeast as medium-term priority.</p>
<p>Implementation by Turkey of these political criteria and priorities, on which the Commission will be reporting in its Regular Report in October 2002, should help achieve the objectives to which the Honourable Members refers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to Botswana’s law, land-holders in customary tenure areas, which comprise 79% of all land, do not own the land, but rather hold customary use rights. Formalisation of Basarwa tenure rights has never been granted. However, over a long period they enjoyed undisturbed use of lands in Wildlife Management Areas and the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. The recent decision of the Government of Botswana to relocate people from the Reserve, an issue that has been under discussion for more than a decade, resulted in a major confrontation between the government and representatives of the Basarwa.</p>

<p>Referring to the questions of the Honourable Member on the status of waste water treatment of certain regions in Greece it can be stated as follows.</p>
<p>In 2000, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure under Article 226 of the EC Treaty against Greece for failure to comply with Council Directive 91/271/EEC<a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, given that the Gulf of Thessaloniki was not identified as sensitive area and the urban waste water of the city was not subject to a sufficient treatment. In their reply to the letter of formal notice sent by the Commission, the Greek authorities have reported that since November 2000 urban wastewater in Thessaloniki was subject to more advanced and stringent treatment than secondary treatment under the Directive (nitrogen removal). Nevertheless, as the Gulf of Thessaloniki was still not identified as sensitive area by the Greek authorities, the Commission decided in December 2001 to address to Greece a reasoned opinion. In April 2002 the Greek authorities identified the Gulf of Thessaloniki as sensitive area.</p>
<p>Concerning the collecting system, the Commission found out that a minor part of Thessaloniki might not be in compliance. This fact is currently still under investigation. Non-compliance regarding collecting systems was not subject of the above case.</p>
<p>The Commission is not informed on details of the connection of specific industrial areas and its laboratory tests.</p>
<p>As regards the situation in Athens (treatment plant in Psittalia) and the Saronikos Gulf, an infringement procedure was initiated by the Commission in 2000 for non-compliance with Directive 91/271/EEC concerning the identification of sensitive areas and insufficient waste water treatment. In December 2001 the Commission decided to bring the case before the Court. As a consequence the Greek authorities designated the Saronikos Gulf as sensitive area in April 2002. The construction of treatment facilities for more advanced than secondary waste water treatment in Psittalia is underway and will be finished, according to the Greek authorities, by the end of 2002.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Will the draft regulation contain that proposal? Physical inspection at first entry into the EU is necessary until the diamond-producing countries have a watertight system. Can the Commission guarantee that the Antwerp system can co-exist with the new EU system until a watertight system has been established? The adage 'trade not aid' still seems to hold true for the diamond trade in spite of its considerable disruptive effect in Africa. This regulation affords the Commission the very opportunity of integrating trade and development policy. Can it guarantee that Articles 133, 179 and 95 - trade, development and the internal market - will form the legal basis for implementation of the Kimberley Process, and will Parliament de facto be given power of codecision on the proposal?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Certification Scheme that will be established under the Kimberley Process will only enter into force when all participants have established the necessary control mechanisms.

<p>Physical inspection cannot reliably establish the presence of conflict diamonds in a parcel, especially when a parcel consists of rough diamonds of different origins.</p>

<p>These intense contacts have been maintained during the preparation of the proposal for an implementing Regulation which the Commission will soon submit to the Council.</p>

<p>Mr Souladakis’ interpretation is inaccurate. Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine does not contain a definition of dried grape vinegar.</p>
<p>Only wine vinegar is defined as, vinegar which “is obtained exclusively by acetous fermentation of wine”. The Commission has already given a legal interpretation of this, which it has announced officially to the representatives of the Member States. Only products that comply with this definition may be described as wine vinegar.</p>
<p>The Commission has not taken any steps to impose restrictions on the marketing of grape vinegar. Many other types of vinegar are produced in the Member States and placed on the Community market. In this case, the name of the substance or fruit from which the vinegar is obtained may accompany the word 'vinegar' on the product label.</p>
<p>Let us not forget that Annex I to Regulation No 1493/1999 defines wine as the product obtained exclusively from the alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes, whether or not crushed, or of grape must, and that the alcoholic fermentation of dried grapes cannot produce wine.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore considers that the above definitions and the general rules on the presentation of foodstuffs laid down by Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council are sufficiently clear and precise as to ensure that consumers are correctly informed with regard to these products.</p>
<p>It therefore considers it unnecessary to lay down specific, more precise rules for the presentation of vinegar.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission considers that, within the framework of the Community method – which is a unique decision-making method adapted to the specific nature of the Union, a Union of States and peoples – the Commission alone must have the right of initiative, the right of decision-making being the joint prerogative of Parliament and the Council. This distribution of powers is intended to avoid the institution responsible for making a decision being responsible for the proposal as well.</p>
<p>The Commission points out that Parliament has already declared itself to be of this opinion in the resolutions containing Parliament’s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference which drew up the Treaty of Nice<a href="#defann_44_1" name="refann_44_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and again, recently, in the resolution on the division of competences between the European Union and the Member States (the Lamassoure report)<a href="#defann_44_2" name="refann_44_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The reason, which is still valid, why the founding fathers conferred an almost exclusive right of initiative on the Commission is the need to make an independent institution responsible for discerning the general interest of all the Member States and proposing suitable solutions for furthering it. Indeed, it is important for the decision-making and legislative process to be based on an initiative which is not geared towards the specific interests of one or more Member States and/or towards the interests of certain ‘stakeholders’. It is Parliament and the Council, however, who make the final decision.</p>
<p>The Commission would point out that granting Parliament a right of initiative would, in all probability, lead to a right of initiative being granted to the Council or the Member States. In an institutional system which is not based on the conventional national model in which there is a government formed by a parliamentary majority, this solution would be likely to cause great dispersion of the Union’s action. The results of the experience within the ‘third pillar’ of a right of initiative shared between the Commission and the Member States have not been conclusive.</p>
<p>Lastly, it should also be pointed out that Parliament – like the Council – may, at any time, request that the Commission submit any appropriate proposal on matters on which it considers that a Community act is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaty (Article 192 EC). Moreover, the Commission undertook in the framework agreement concluded with Parliament to give Parliament’s requests maximum consideration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission conducts on a continuous basis broad consultations on the subject of trade in services in order to ensure a balanced input in the current services negotiations.</p>
<p>Over the last years, the Commission's Directorate-General for Trade has engaged in a dialogue with civil society organisations, encompassing industry, trade unions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In the context of this dialogue, services-specific meetings have been organised on several occasions to give all stakeholders the possibility to express their views. For example, Directorate-General Trade officials held such meetings on 25 September 2001 and on 7 May 2002; the Commissioner responsible for Trade held debriefing talks on the whole of the Doha agenda, including services, on 14 December 2001 and 18 April 2002. It is regrettable that some of these meetings have not always been well attended by all organisations that expressed their interest in the subject.</p>
<p>In addition, during the same period, the ESF organised four meetings (including its semi-annual meeting) on world trade in services, to which the Commission was invited as an observer. As for ESF’s attendance at the ad hoc 133 Committee (Services) meetings, this is a question that should formally be addressed to the Council. Nonetheless, as far as the Commission is aware, the ESF does not take part in or have any access to meetings of the ad hoc 133 Committee, nor is there any form of cooperation between this Committee and the ESF.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue its cooperation with civil society by organising regular sessions of information and discussion. The future venues can be consulted on DG Trade’s Website, under the icon “civil society dialogue”. In addition, the Commission has repeatedly asked civil society representatives at such events to provide written contributions but, apart from industry, only a limited number of contributions has been received from other organisations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0441"></a>

<p>First of all Community legislation does not forbid the irrigation of golf courses as long as all the relevant Community legislation and in particular directives relating to habitat protection and environmental impact assessments are observed.</p>
<p>Secondly, according to the information, at present, golf courses in Murcia are irrigated in general either with treated waste water or desalted water. In some instances irrigation may come from the drinking water supply systems. Water from the Tagus-Segura transfer is strictly controlled for agriculture irrigation and water supply purposes by the “Sociedad Estatal de Aguas de la Cuenca del Segura” and the remaining part goes to the “Mancomunidad de Canales de Taibilla”. Some water intended both for population supply and economic activities other than agriculture might go to irrigate golf courses.</p>
<p>With specific relevance to the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, the Commission notes that the plan excludes the use of transferred waters for the purposes of increasing the amount/extent of irrigated land but just intends to consolidate the existing ones.

However, it states that it cannot predict how each Member State will decide to distribute its fishing effort limitations between fleets and/or regions. That is why the Commission has undertaken to establish bilateral consultations with the Member States (Section 3.7) in order to ascertain:</p>
<p>the likely employment impact of fishing effort limitations;</p>
<p>the regions in which fishermen may require assistance to find new jobs;</p>
<p>and the scope for reprogramming of the Structural Funds, notably in the context of the mid-term review, to facilitate the transfer of fishermen to other sectors and support the diversification of coastal economies.</p>
<p>It is only on the basis of these consultations that the Commission will then be able to draw up an action plan to counter the short-term social consequences of adjusting fishing capacities to the level of available resources, which should, in the long term, benefit the fisheries sector and fisheries-dependent regions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

There is no estimate of the overall effect of a reduction of effort and capacity to sustainable levels, but the scientists (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and Scientific Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)) have assessed the effects of a reduction in fishing mortality on a large number of stocks. In general the scientists predict an increase in stock size resulting in increased productivity leading to not only a higher catch per effort but also in an increase in the total yield.

<p>The Commission considers that its proposals for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy are compatible with Parliament’s resolution on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) adopted on 17 January 2002 and do not contradict it.</p>
<p>Parliament agreed with the Commission’s analysis about, inter-alia, the critical state of many Community fish stocks, the lack of proper compliance, the inadequacy of scientific information, the failure of multiannual guidance programmes (MAGPs), the over-capacity of the fishing fleet, the need to ensure coherence with other policies, to involve the stakeholders in policy shaping and to strengthen the international dimension of the CFP.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposals for reform are designed to provide for timely and effective answers and solutions to the pre-occupations expressed in Parliament’s resolution, and reflect most of the ideas expressed therein. For example the Commission’s proposals fully respond to the demands of Parliament to preserve relative stability, to incorporate environmental requirements into the CFP under the Treaty, to put the precautionary principle at the forefront, to improve the scientific basis upon which decisions are taken, to reduce discards and by-catch through stricter technical measures, to adopt measures to protect cetaceans and other non-target species and habitats, to subject industrial fishing under the same conservation rules as other types of fisheries, to maintain support measures for safety onboard vessels without entailing an increase in fishing effort, to simplify the monitoring of fleet, to take into account Member States past performance in the new fleet policy, to foresee more effective sanctions, to maintain measures for small-scale fishing, to take into account the needs of outermost regions, to strengthen control and enforcement, to create a Joint Inspection Structure, to foresee development of observers, to pay more attention to environmental problems in third countries waters, to proceed to rigorous stock assessment of third countries’ resources, to ensure coherence of external fisheries policy and development policy, to take initiatives to combat illegal fishing, to promote social dialogue, to provide for financing for social measures, to consider health and safety at work issues, to consider aquaculture as an integral part of the CFP and to help the sustainable development of that sector, to provide support for research, to provide for the integration of the Mediterranean into the CFP, to promote greater stakeholder involvement, and the simplification and transparency of legislation.</p>
<p>There are also ideas in the Parliament’s resolution that the Commission shares and will take into account within the framework of its forthcoming supplementary reform proposals foreseen for example for the Mediterranean, the international relations and aquaculture.</p>
<p>There are a number of areas, however, where the Commission does not share the Parliament’s views. While the Commission agrees with the continuation of structural support for the fisheries sector, it strongly believes that such support foreseen for renewal, modernisation, and export of vessels and for the creation of joint-undertakings should be re-oriented towards reduction of fleet over-capacity and socio-economic measures to address the regional and social consequences of the inevitable restructuring of the sector.</p>
<p>Public aid should work for and not against conservation. Given the current dramatic state of affairs in European fisheries, with which the Parliament agrees, this is the only way to deal effectively with fleet over-capacity which is at the root of the current problems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0448"></a>

<p>The Commission itself admits that the proposal for a reform of the common fisheries policy which it has adopted involves the scrapping of 8 600 vessels and the loss of 28 000 fishermen’s jobs – quite apart from the incalculable losses which will be felt in the regions concerned on account of the multiplier effect which the fishing industry produces in other, related sectors.</p>
<p>The proposal will mean an end to the 2003-2006 EU fleet-renewal subsidies which are paid out of the Structural Funds and which were approved at the Berlin European Council. Mr Fischler, Commissioner, has stated that the Commission is proposing to allocate a further EUR 272 million for</p>

<p>after the funds available for fleet adjustment within the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) have been reprogrammed for each Member State, the Commission estimates that the total additional requirement for scrapping will be EUR 271.6 million;</p>
<p>in order to facilitate the transition during 2003 from the present programming decision towards the modified approach, EUR 32 million will be available.

<p>The Union has identified water as a priority issue for the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). In that context the Commission has proposed an Union water initiative to be presented in Johannesburg. The initiative is focussed on the delivery of the millennium targets in relation to drinking water supply and the provision of sanitation. The initiative also foresees that these targets should be delivered within the framework of an integrated approach to water management based on river basins or catchments. Such an approach will inter alia ensure that ecological objectives are also taken into account as well as providing a framework for the management of trans-boundary water bodies. The initiative provides for joint efforts from the Member States, the Commission, international funding bodies, the private sector and Non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The Commission believes that efficient and sustainable management of water resources is one of the major development challenges. It believes that the proposed initiative will make a significant contribution to addressing the problem.</p>
<p>The linkage made between the proposed Union water initiative for the WSSD and the Spanish National Hydrological Plan is not appropriate. The Union water initiative is a contribution to the challenge of 1.2 billion people without drinking water and 2.4 billion without sanitation: where thousands are estimated to be dying each day from water related problems. In relation to the Spanish hydrological plan, the Commission has on many previous occasions made it clear that the plan both in design and execution must respect relevant Union legislation and in particular the legislation dealing with habitats, water and environmental impact assessment. Union contributions to the funding of the plan (structural funds and cohesion funds) will be subject to the normal rules and procedures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0453"></a>

<p>In a number of cases, Danish fish importers have had to pay penalty customs duties to the European Union as a result of errors and inadequate checks on fishermen in Norway. Norwegian fishermen have exploited the preferential tariff agreement between the EU and Norway (zero tariff), which has led to distortion of competition on the market for fish, as other third countries pay 12% customs duty. It has emerged that errors have been made as regards over half of fish exports from Norway. The Norwegian authorities have been unable to confirm and guarantee that the fish was of Norwegian origin, and it is suspected that the fish did not come from Norway but from Russia.</p>
<p>What steps has the Commission considered taking to deal with the Norwegian authorities' errors and infringements of the preferential tariff rules, which have meant that importers in the EU have had to pay substantial additional customs duties?

<p>The Commission would like to recall that importers are not ‘sanctioned’ but requested to pay normal customs duties for products which appeared not being entitled for tariff preferences, following regulatory controls of the proofs they presented and then highlight the responsibility of the exporting country in the issue of such proofs.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently implementing verification actions regarding fisheries products imported from Norway into the Community under cover of movement certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations. These actions include a mission made by European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and Danish Customs to the Norwegian Directorate of Customs and Excise in Oslo (18-09-01), and the communication by Norway to OLAF of their report on verification of origin of codfish exports (16-11-01). The first phase of the verification program has been finished by the Norwegian competent authorities and communicated to OLAF in May 2002. The measures to be considered by the Union depend on the results of this verification program, and could include the publication of a notice to importers informing them about the situation as well as the collection of guaranties for any customs duties that might be liable.</p>
<p>The Commission has already established, from August 2001, systematic contacts with Norwegian Customs to obtain additional management and control measures for proofs of origin and the implementation of an effective post-audit control system, which Norway is currently putting in place. The Commission will ensure a close follow up and monitoring of these measures.</p>
<p>In more general terms and regarding the other preferential arrangements, the Commission has committed itself to do – as it has been done with Norway - all that is necessary to ensure that these arrangements operate properly, by:</p>
<p>- taking immediate steps to follow up possible fraud or malfunctioning of a preferential arrangement methodically with the beneficiary country concerned, inter alia through the existing co-operation procedures or bodies and the mutual assistance mechanisms ;</p>
<p>- whenever there are reasonable doubt about the functioning of an arrangement, promptly notifying traders and Member State administrations through the publication of a notice to importers in the Official Journal, in order to warn them about the risks, to generate additional control actions and thus to better protect the economic and financial interests at stake ;</p>
<p>- Whenever facing fraud problems and a lack of administrative co-operation from a beneficiary country, making an increased use of the procedure for suspension of preferences or dispute settlement provided for either in autonomous arrangements or in preferential agreements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0454"></a>

<p>The results of the recent local elections in Afghanistan were extremely disappointing in respect of women's representation.

In its last resolution on the rights of Afghan women<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, Parliament called on the Union to ensure that Afghan women have full access to funded programmes and are the direct beneficiaries of 30% of the economic aid for the country. Has the Commission assessed what has thus far been achieved with the economic aid provided (EUR 320 million), primarily in regard to restoring women's rights? What measures does it intend to take in this respect and, in more general terms, to incorporate gender equality into the EU's bilateral relations with third countries?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The factions in Afghanistan agreed on 5 December 2001 in Bonn/Petersberg an Agreement which contains numerous specific references to the role and participation of women in the Interim Administration and the Emergency Loya Jirga. It recognises that the interim arrangements set out in the Agreement are intended as “a first step towards the establishment of a broad-based, gender sensitive … and full representative government …”.</p>
<p>The Commission has consistently made clear to the authorities that compliance with the terms of the Bonn/Petersberg Agreement is a fundamental conditions of its support for the reconstruction process in Afghanistan. To this end, the Commission has committed up to EUR 2 million to set up the Emergency Loya Jirga in conformity with the Bonn principles. The work of the Emergency Loya Jirga Commission is being closely monitored.</p>
<p>The Commission will equally expect the Transitional Authority which follows the Interim Authority to abide by the Bonn/Petersberg Agreement. The situation of women and girls in Afghanistan has been a specific concern over many years. The Commission’s aid programme, which has implemented health, education, nutrition and employment projects aimed at refugees, internally displaced persons and other vulnerable groups has consistently contained significant components which addressed the plight of Afghan women.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the Commission sent expert missions into the field to make proposals for initial quick impact projects in the areas of education, health, rural development/food security, urban regeneration. A gender specialist accompanied these missions, with the specific objective of ensuring that gender issues and the need to improve social conditions and opportunities were fully taken into account.</p>
<p>The expert’s proposals are now being incorporated into the first tranche of EUR 57 million for programme support in 2002. One of the health projects will provide women with the opportunity to meet with other women outside their direct family. Another project includes a health education and community-based sanitation component, through the establishment of a network of women to work as health and sanitation educators and community mobilisers to work in a number of urban districts.</p>
<p>Whilst it is not possible to be precise on the percentage of these activities which directly benefit women, the Commission is intent on mainstreaming a number of gender concerns and in its second Recovery Programme (EUR 70 million) expected to be approved in the fourth quarter of 2002 specific projects in health and institutional support will address contraints faced by women in urban and rural areas.</p>
<p>Regarding emergency humanitarian aid provided by the Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), women have always been implicated in various types of projects, even in the Taliban era : all medical and nutritional projects funded by ECHO aim to treat malnutrition among children under five years of age, as well as monitor the health status of women, in particular lactating and pregnant women. Usually, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) organise elementary hygiene education for women.</p>
<p>NGOs have access to all beneficiaries, women included, and can employ women as local NGO personnel in medical related programmes, in spite of the fact that separation between the two genders has to be strictly observed. Medical NGOs play a great role in the medical training of women.</p>
<p>Furthermore, over two years, income generating activities for women have been started to encourage their self-sufficiency, and are increasingly being supported by ECHO. ECHO has financed “Food For Work” (FFW) projects for men and women through various partners. While men are occupied in land recovery works and city drain cleaning, women are given raw material and knit quilts and sweaters to be distributed to other beneficiaries. This operation implies that some educated women will first conduct a survey to identify the most vulnerable women, among the widows, handicapped and internally displaced people. This kind of programme ensures the participation of women coming from a variety of socio-economic classes, from educated to illiterate women, each of them using their knowledge and/or manual ability. The programmes have proved successful and will be continued as they provide an immediate impact on people's livelihood.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission fully shares the Honourable Member’s concern at the rising tension between India and Pakistan, which has reached a dangerous level. It is indeed extremely urgent that this tension should be reduced.</p>
<p>The Commissioner in charge of external relations visited Islamabad and Delhi on 22-24 May, where he met, inter alia, Pakistan President Musharraf and Indian Foreign Minister Singh, as well as members of both country's civil society and media. The Commissioner in charge of External relations concluded from his visit that the situation was exceptionally worrying with a real danger of miscalculation leading to war between nuclear powers.</p>
<p>The Commissioner reaffirmed Union’s full rejection of any form of terrorism and stressed that a stop must be put to terrorist activities. This implies tangible progress in reduction of infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>He made it absolutely clear that Pakistan has to deliver on this. President Musharraf must follow-up on his 12 January speech, and also implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373. No country should allow its territory to be used for terrorist acts.</p>
<p>The Commissioner retained the strong impression that India’s patience is at an end. However, there is still potential to avoid a war, providing that Pakistan takes rapid and efficient measures to put a stop to cross-border terrorism. Both sides must also row back on the rhetoric which is only inflaming matters.</p>

<p>The data contained in the annual report from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) on deaths caused by work-related accidents and diseases world-wide is shocking. These deaths, numbering 5000 every day or approximately two million a year, are due to deficient or downright non-existent health and safety measures, and this in turn is due to the cost of taking such measures, which would run counter to the sacred cow of competitiveness, coupled with the immunity enjoyed by employers under capitalism. This is the price paid by the working class at the altar of the free market economy, namely achieving at all costs that system’s supreme goal of extracting the largest possible profit. According to the ILO report, the annual rate of death from work-related diseases is 32% from cancer and 23% from traffic injuries, while deaths from work-related accidents amount to 19%. It concludes that 80% of work-related accidents and deaths could have been avoided if countries had enforced the application of health and safety measures.</p>
<p>Since the situation in the EU itself is not much better, what measures does the Commission intend to take to protect the life and health of all workers and to ensure that they are not sacrificed on the altar of an uncontrolled drive for enormous profits?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As indicated in its communication "Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002–2006"<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission is of the opinion that, in spite of the number of occupational accidents falling by just short of 10% between 1994 and 1998, the absolute figures remain high, with almost 5,500 deaths and 4.8 million accidents resulting in periods off work for three days or more.</p>
<p>These figures do call for heightened vigilance, since what they indicate is that the preventive approach set out in Community directives has not yet been fully understood and taken on board by the various players, nor applied effectively on the ground.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore proposes in its communication a Community strategy based on:</p>
<p>a global approach to well-being at work, taking account of changes in the world of work and the emergence of new risks, thus enhancing the quality of work;</p>
<p>a culture of risk prevention, relying on combining a variety of political instruments - legislation, social dialogue, progressive measures and best practices, corporate social responsibility and economic incentives;</p>
<p>building partnerships between all the players on the safety and health scene.</p>
<p>As regards international cooperation, the Commission will continue its active collaboration with the agencies of the United Nations — the World Health Organisation and the International Labour Organisation — which have a similar role to play in improving the level of protection of workers at world level.</p>
<p>In response to the Commission's communication, the Council adopted a resolution 3 June 2002 calling on the Member States:</p>
<p>to develop and implement coordinated, coherent prevention policies, with measurable targets set for reducing accidents at work and occupational illnesses,</p>
<p>to ensure better implementation of the legislation in force, in particular through more effective inspection and monitoring, through making available to businesses, especially small- and medium- sized businesses, suitable advisory and consultancy services, as well as through improved occupational risk-prevention training and the adoption of measures aimed specifically at reducing accidents at work and occupational illnesses in high-risk sectors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
