I call upon you to inform the Council of this and to urge it to relieve Mr Hombach of all his duties until such time as this investigation has been resolved in a conclusive and legally valid manner.

No one could, by the wildest stretch of the imagination, consider someone like Emma Bonino a racist.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the method, it is clear that the procedure remains the same: the Community institutions present truncated reports, which minimise the consequences in terms of further loss of sovereignty for the Member States, and then proceed by means of successive small-scale tinkering.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, when introducing the euro, the Commission maintained that the sovereignty of the Member States was in no way threatened by the ECB, or the ESCB, which was set up to hold and manage Member States’ official foreign reserves. However, they forget that, on the one hand, the national central banks manage these funds on behalf of the ECB, which has sole control of monetary policy. On the other hand, while Article 30(1) of the statutes of the ECB sets the maximum amount for reserve assets at EUR 50 billion, an amount considered sufficient to safeguard the independence of the ECB, two years later, the dogma of independence is looking to Article 30(4) to grant further assets, because it needs to increase its independence and credibility further … It seems legitimate to ask ourselves whether we are throwing funds down a bottomless pit!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the content, the ‘dressing up’ of this new exorbitant demand should not fool us. It is not simply a question of giving more financial resources to an independent institution so that it can apply an effective monetary policy which benefits the Member States, but also of, indirectly, creating additional resources for a technocratic structure so that it may finance its ever greater operational needs.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue therefore remains skilfully blurred; while the euro was intended to be ‘strong and stable’ and the reserve assets were originally intended to provide protection during the transitional period (should this prove necessary), it now appears that neither of these expectations has been fulfilled and Frankfurt is totally deadlocked!</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, another question arises regarding the effective use of financial resources. Why should the Member States give up their resources in favour of a Community institution which, as a result of its need to be independent, cannot be controlled?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let us remember that a State is not defined in terms of the sovereignty it enjoys as a result of its autonomy of action. In fact, experience shows that its authority and credibility in the international arena depend very largely on its available resources: we must therefore take care, because to progressively deprive it of both would eventually cause it to cease to exist! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title3"></a><a name="creitem3"></a>

<p class="contents">This report sets a precedent, as it is the first time that the Council has consulted Parliament on these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has studied this legislative motion for a resolution extremely promptly and with great interest, and has approved it unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the following aspects of the amendments proposed by Parliament: First, in Amendment No 2, rural information and activity centres are included as possible agents for these measures. Secondly, the amendment refers specifically to the important role to be played by young farmers in the aforementioned measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we indicate to the Commission the value of simplification and cutting through red tape, both in the examination of the programmes submitted and in subsequent monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we single out countrymen and women, farmers and other parties active in rural areas as the ideal beneficiaries of these measures. On examination of our amendments, it is clear that they have a human aspect and allow a far more dynamic, open discussion. They avoid dealing with the CAP in a passive, purely bureaucratic and technological fashion. That is why we believe that Parliament's amendments improve the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, with regard to the cofinancing percentage, Parliament would like the Commission to be able to increase this percentage, increasing financing for organisations or associations with few financial means.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, we already know that, according to the proposal, commitment appropriations provide EUR 4.5 million annually through the EAGGF, which implies EUR 27 million for the current period, 2000-2006. However, the proposal made by Parliament indicates that the European Commission should adapt the budgetary allocation to the large number of organisations entitled to participate under this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to highlight the contribution of Amendment No 10, which proposes a new Article 5a, defining the following criteria to be met by programmes or measures eligible for funding: that these programmes should foster sustainable, multifunctional farming; they should serve to maintain or create jobs; they should promote social and regional cohesion; they should give a more prominent role to women and young people; they should protect the environment and safeguard the water supply, air quality and soil quality; they should treat agricultural waste and control energy expenditure, in the countryside and in transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, these are proposals that should promote rural development and improve food safety and product quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament would like the Commission to make these priorities, which are priority objectives for agriculture in 2000, easier to visualise in these next information measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, that is all I have to say. I would like to thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the support and collaboration they have given me at all the meetings we have held. I would also like the European Commission, in one way or another, to take account of Parliament's criteria.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fiori (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, this is a very specific instrument which is of major importance for all citizens. However, it is the farmers who have to be its protagonists. Our position on the proposal for a regulation on information measures relating to the common agricultural policy can be summarised as follows: after the period of DG VI management and dependence on EAGGF-Guidance, a window of further transparency has at last been opened, and it must not be allowed to close. The common agricultural policy is an instrument for farmers: it is a basis from which to provide farmers with a broader understanding of their overall role, both in respect of the consumer and in terms of the major environmental issues. It is also the means of increasing awareness, among farmers, of current situations and, in particular, of the requirements of European society as a whole. </p>
<p class="contents">All too often, we have heard speeches extolling the virtues of the CAP’s role in production, the environment and consumer and agricultural protection. On many occasions, these words proved to be an end unto themselves and did not provide specific occasions for taking up the opportunities offered. This regulation is our chance to send a clear message to the farming world. This is why we do not understand why the CAP should be extended to include all the consumer and environmental associations, which can claim no rights and have no responsibilities as regards measures of this type. Should we pass up this opportunity, we will miss another chance to target the objectives of growth, shared responsibility, multifunctionality and quality improvements, which are the basis of the European measures envisaged for the agricultural sector. We are also concerned at the poor level of funding available to implement the programme. </p>
<p class="contents">This is all the more reason why the policy should not be broadened to include as many potential tenderers as possible, but rather, in the light of what has just been said regarding determining who represents agriculture, this extension must lead to the judicious, appropriate allocation of funding to the destination indicated in the very title of the programme, the common agricultural policy, where the term “agricultural” is a decidedly operative word. If we were to take a different path, we would only be contributing to highlighting the existence of a tangle of roles, which would be of no benefit to either farmers or consumers. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, this major programme is an opportunity for responsibilities to be defined and recognised, in order to provide the farming world with a genuine opportunity to take the lead in the changes taking place. However, in all this, we must not forget or overlook the merits of the other organisations<span class="bold"> </span>which have<span class="bold"> </span>taken up parallels with the world of agriculture production and interpreted them to best advantage, without mentioning the fact that this broadening out to embrace other activities in itself represents a development of areas of potential recognised by the Union. The transfer from EAGGF-Guidance to EAGGF-Guarantee is another consoling aspect, in terms of attaining the objectives already outlined, providing both the possibility of tracking funds to their destination and, in particular, to the objectives which we want to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside all this, in consolidation of the positions expressed, the true focus of the programme must not be forgotten: the involvement of the farmers themselves in adopting a more resolute stance on the validity of the instruments introduced under the reform of the common agricultural policy. Today, this instrument appears to be fully understood by most of the farming world, but not all. It is probably this element which is most attached to conventional schemes that are difficult to reconcile with the rapid, revolutionary changes which we are witnessing. But it is an element which the Union itself intends to adapt more closely to current conditions and manoeuvre towards the euro, globalisation and the open market, and also towards those market niches which are characteristic of economically sound areas which must be developed still further.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In line with this rationale, a parallel with the development of rural tourism springs to mind. Rural tourism is a source of income and, at the same time, a means of protecting a citizen’s land. It is proposed as a driving force that will speed up the passage to a European agriculture which encompasses as wide a range of production possibilities and sources of income as possible. Rural tourism not only meshes well with organic production, but also complies with the highest of product quality standards recognised by the European Union. Factors such as these confirm the integration of agricultural policy with the other forms of economic and social development of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Providing factual and objective information about cooperation in Europe has become very important in recent years as we face considerable challenges with the extension of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe. It is especially important to explain what the common agricultural policy is about and to provide information about objectives, resources and potential for development. There are many target groups – farmers, first and foremost, but also people generally, as well as everyone directly or indirectly affected. If this work is to succeed, it is important that cooperation should be established with the farming organisations and also with consumers. The common agricultural policy was the first, and is also the most extensive, of the Community’s integrated policies and it accounts for a very large proportion of the EU’s budget. It is, therefore, also important to make it clear that the subsidy arrangements ensure that consumers obtain food at prices which, as a result of the subsidy, are lower than they would be without the subsidy. This means that the EU’s agricultural arrangements are of benefit to all EU citizens. The common agricultural policy is always undergoing change and development. It demands a great deal in terms of the supply of information and, especially, in terms of the coordination which is needed if cooperation is to succeed, both within the Member States and independently of the Member States. Circumstances are very different from one country to another, and it ought, therefore, to be farming organisations which are among the main players, because these organisations focus primarily upon farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It represents the attempt we need to give the financing for groups and associations in the EU agriculture sector a legal basis. This budget line has always been there, only there were no legal safeguards, and the Court of Auditors criticised us for this. In producing this legal standard, the Commission has now put the matter to rights.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The only difficulty regarding implementation resides in the fact that the Commission is now to lay claim to a large portion of the budget for its own information measures – or so the report says – when previously, the budget was available in its entirety to the associations in varying amounts. We have reason to fear that these funds are now to be withheld from the associations, and that is not a very happy turn of events.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it used to be the case that the money was made available to the associations and it was for them to draw up their own criteria as to how the money should be spent. This was, and continues to be, an unacceptable practice, and it is therefore right and proper that the criteria are now to be stipulated. However, precise rates of interest are now to be fixed for the financing – Mrs Izquierdo has already made reference to this – which will mean that small associations having limited financial resources will be deprived of the opportunity to delve into this pot because they do not have their own resources. The smaller, weaker associations will therefore be at a disadvantage. That is why we welcome with open arms Mrs Izquierdo’s proposal that the possibility of full financing be allowed for where there is evidence that the measures meet the criteria, and where there is financial weakness – which may be the case throughout the region – so as to avoid these areas being completely left out. </p>
<p class="contents">All in all, our Group welcomes the fact that we are now to get a legal basis, and also supports the proposed amendments tabled by the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our opinion, the main criticism of this proposal for a Commission regulation relates to the opening up of a budget line to non-agricultural organisations and also the reduction in budget appropriations to EUR 4 500 000. This situation has been made even worse by the reserve of appropriations that the Commission is building up for itself, which, when taken in conjunction with specific actions, in fact leaves the organisations with only EUR 3 million, which is obviously a very limited amount.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the rapporteur’s proposal that the Commission should match the budgetary appropriations to the numerous organisations that have a right to funding under this regulation. However, another negative aspect of the Commission’s proposal relates to limiting cofinancing to a rate of 75%, when actions implemented directly by the Commission are financed at a rate of 100%. Furthermore, we know that the draft guide to the rules makes access to the budgetary line I have just mentioned even more difficult for organisations, especially those in a weaker financial position, in other words, exactly the ones that need the most support.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the importance of our amendment designed to supplement the concept set out in the report. With our amendment, we hope to see Community cofinancing rise above 75% for organisations representing small farmers and family-run farms in financial difficulty. We hope that this amendment will be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendment designed to reduce funds intended for the Commission by EUR 1 million and instead increase specific actions, we feel that this is potentially a way of improving the Commission’s proposal for a regulation. Lastly, it is important to emphasise the need for the Commission to simplify its administrative procedures both in order to study the programmes presented by the organisations and for their future monitoring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From an administrative point of view the formalisation is a good thing. But when we come to think about it the amount of money is quite small – EUR 27 million over a period of six years. Considering the size of the agricultural budget and the fact that it extends to every corner of the Union, it is a relatively small amount of money. That is why I welcome that fact that most of it will be spent at the rate of 50% rather than 75%. The more of it that is spent at the rate of up to 50%, the further the money goes and the greater the impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The common agricultural policy gets a lot of criticism. One of the things that was not widely understood was the importance of this policy from a social point of view: the fact is, that in all the depressed regions of the Union, the common agricultural policy has maintained the population and supported communities, in a social sense, that would not otherwise have survived. This is particularly true of the peripheral countries such as Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal, where communities that would have disappeared have been supported and maintained, if not for ever, certainly until a change in economic environment, until the new technologies arrived. The long-term effect of the common agricultural policy in that sense will be greater than people have often imagined.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no fault to find with the way the Commission interacted with the agriculture industry over the years. From my experience the European Commission was more open to representations and information exchange with the agriculture industry than most departments of agriculture in most Member States. The Commission taught Member States over the years how to be open with very limited resources. But there are new pressures, arising out of consumer concerns about new processes and systems of producing food. These have to be explained, not only to farmers, but to consumers as well. There is a lot of mythology about what is safe and what is not safe. We have an important job to do to explain the workings of the whole productive system to the consumers of Europe and those outside the Union who will buy our food. It is important that we apply as many resources as possible to this.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I want to make is that, arising from these pressures, we will have a reaction from agriculture. As we inevitably wind down some of the supports in the process of enlargement and, at the same time, maintain the pressures to protect the environment and the consumers, then there will be friction between the producers and the European administration. To devote as many resources as possible to good relations is a wise policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposed regulation intends to provide the Commission with a tool to help it to present an operational model for European agriculture, and give wider publicity to the common agricultural policy. In this way, the implementation of agricultural policy is facilitated.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I would like to speak about Parliament’s proposed amendments. They are not generally aimed at changing the subject matter but rather at amending the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 2 and 6 concern organisations falling within the scope of aid. It is the opinion of the Commission that it is not necessary to mention the groups and organisations by name. All agricultural organisations and rural players fall within the scope of aid according to Article 2. This being the case, the proposed addenda are unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 5, 8 and 10 concern measures that are eligible for aid. Amendment No 5 contains amendments regarding information services and fora for discussions for men and women in rural areas. They are unnecessary, as they are already contained in the Commission’s proposal. One of them, which reads “supporting them in their choices” is not in harmony with the Commission’s proposal. The purpose of this regulation is not to offer farmers any special services. Local bodies are better qualified to do that. The resources available would not be sufficient for that either. I would, moreover, like to make the comment, with regard to the amendments tabled for Article 3, that information visits are not being ruled out. The list of activities that are eligible for aid is not exhaustive, which is indicated in the word “particularly”. The Commission is prepared, however, to adopt this amendment. The funding of long-term exchange programmes cannot, however, be accepted, as such action is not a part of the information policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 10 concerns Article 5. The Commission supports the objectives mentioned here, proof of which is to be seen in the fact that they are implicitly contained in Article 1, which concerns the operational model for European agriculture. That is why it makes no sense to repeat the contents of the model in further detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7 and 13 concern contributions. The Commission thinks that it is not desirable to pay more than 75% of eligible aid costs. The funds available are modest. The lower the contribution stays the more measures there will be that can be financed and the greater the multiple effect. Amendments Nos 9 and 12 concern the allocation and approval of appropriations. As we know, Parliament is a budgetary authority together with the Council. For this reason, the Commission thinks Amendment No 9 is not necessary. Regarding Amendment No 12, which proposes including the allocation of appropriations in the regulation, I would say that if the allocation is settled on beforehand, the administration of the budgetary heading will lose its vital degree of flexibility, which might be damaging from the point of view of proposed applications for financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 11 concerns evaluation. The Commission agrees with Parliament on the usefulness of regular evaluation. It can best be taken account of in the implementing regulation. Amendment No 4 concerns administration. This extra recital is unnecessary in the regulation, in the opinion of the Commission. Provision for administrative details, evaluation and later assessment will be laid down by the Commission in the Implementing Regulation. In this connection, it has to be said that the effective monitoring of public funds has to be assured in the process regardless of how open and simple the process is.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1 and 3 concern linguistic nuances. These the Commission does not consider significant, as Recitals 4 and 7 in the Commission’s proposal are not as restrictive.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Parliament has been analysing this proposal since October 1999 and approved this draft legislative resolution unanimously on 23 February 2000. I would like to highlight the following aspects of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">First, Amendment No 1 on the inclusion of a Recital 2a. This amendment supplements the Council approach, which is purely commercial, and opts for a proposal with wider economic, human and food quality aims. Whereas the Council only talks about the market, the European Parliament highlights the economic interest for the Community of the production of these grain legumes. Given the deficit of protein crops in the European Union, Parliament considers that this system should be improved without cutting the level of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Parliament’s Amendment No 2 proposes that seed vetches should also be included in the aid system. Aid for seeds already exists for rice, chickpeas and lentils. We propose this aid because, as we all know, the production of seeds is subject to supplementary technical and quality control requirements, so that if the cultivation of seeds were not supported by some form of aid, this could have extremely negative consequences for the quality of production of seed vetches.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Amendment No 3 indicates that, in our opinion, the Commission should, without further delay, make proposals for the 2000-2003 period.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, Mr President, I would like to point out that in 1993 – which is some time ago now – the Council indicated that it intended to gradually strengthen the current aid system for grain legumes. However, this has still not been done. Secondly, successive periods show that we are faced with a chronic imbalance in this system. The maximum guaranteed area is being systematically reduced, thus penalising time and again the farmers who are suffering reductions in aid of up to 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Mr President, what the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament would really like to see is an improvement in the system. However, we appreciate what the Commission is telling us, that this is a time of serious budgetary restrictions that we could not implement without reducing aid. That is why we are presenting this proposal, which is really a maintenance proposal, and what we are saying to the Commission is that, without further delay, proposals must be drawn up at the latest for the 2000-2003 period to achieve an improvement in this system without decreasing aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their collaboration and support, as well as the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. Thanks also to the Commission for its willingness to hold a dialogue and I hope it will be open to our proposals.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So slight is the reform that it does not amend the total maximum guaranteed quantity, although it does split it into two, nor the amount of aid per hectare. The only new element is the substitution of the management committee by the cereal management committee.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Spanish saying goes, which is very much in agreement with this regulation, ‘<span class="italic">Esto son lentejas; si quieres las tomas y si no las dejas’ </span>[‘here are some lentils, take them or leave them’]. Consequently, my Group will support the rapporteur's report and, above all, will particularly support Amendment No 2, which proposes the inclusion of areas dedicated to the production of seed vetches in the aid system, as this will lead to high-quality crops.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear that we have missed the opportunity to support a substantial, very arid area of southern Europe, which has no other crop alternative for its soil. Furthermore, the demand for vetches for feeding livestock is increasing all the time, as shown, at least in Spain, by the fact that the area sown in the last three years has exceeded the proposed maximum guaranteed area by 100 000 hectares per year on average.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the food problems we have had in the European Union have been caused by feeding herbivores with animal-based feedingstuffs, and if we do not encourage the feeding of livestock with plant proteins, such as legumes, and lower their price, farmers will continue to resort to animal meal due to the enormous pressure of competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it just remains for me to lament, once again, the fact that the Commission's agricultural policy is more concerned with reducing spending – or, at best, not increasing it, as on this occasion – than with maintaining a genuine European agricultural sector that is so essential for the equilibrium of the region.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Grain legumes are a traditional crop in certain areas of southern Europe, including Spain and, more specifically, Castilla-La Mancha, the region I come from, which contains one third of the total area dedicated to these crops in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Our concern is therefore to avoid damaging the aid system for this sector of agriculture and, more specifically, for the production of chickpeas, lentils and vetches.</p>
<p class="contents">Chickpeas and lentils are two essential products in Spanish gastronomic culture and in our diet, the Mediterranean diet, which is now so highly thought of by scientists, which includes dried pulses in our traditional recipes.</p>
<p class="contents">The purchase of dried pulses in Spain has been increasing by up to 5% annually. In my country, the consumption of these is 6.5 kg per head annually and anyone who knows how these products are cooked can vouch for the fact that this is a very substantial amount.</p>
<p class="contents">Religious customs, for example, mean that we do not eat meat during Lent and due to the wiliness and common sense of our compatriots, meat has been replaced by other dishes – delicious dishes, of course – such as our lentil and spinach stew.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about uses that have been consolidated throughout history and are now consumed throughout the year, including by non-believers and those who do not practise a religion, and that have left an almost infinitely varied series of main courses based on dried pulses, which undoubtedly increase the consumption figures.</p>
<p class="contents">Another sector which requires this type of product is livestock farming. At times like this, when we are seeing fraudulently-fattened livestock and the use of unauthorised products, it becomes essential for the market to provide reasonably-priced, good quality natural feedingstuffs, such as some of those that this regulation concerns, and specifically vetches.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are talking about Community protection for a crop which last year, in my region, provided an honest living for around 17 000 families. Moreover, this is a sector in which, fortunately, there has not been a proliferation of bounty-hunters who move into agriculture in order to receive grants from the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are dealing with traditional crops farmed by people who devote themselves to these crops from generation to generation, and who have contributed to the formation of a large part of the countryside and cuisine of substantial regions of Europe, which still interest us and which we should maintain.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore asking for the support of Parliament for the Commission's proposals and the improvements which, by way of amendment, are contained in María Izquierdo's report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also draw your attention to the fact that, in recent years, conventional farming has been put under pressure. Prices have fallen for just about every product. This is what some people call stability. Farmers experience it somewhat differently because costs are, of course, rising and price freezes will therefore automatically be experienced as a setback. I would also recall the fact that the Commission has recently tightened up on the conditions for intervening in the area of grain. Wheat growers, in particular, will be affected very badly, which they already are because of a 15% fall in prices, but then there is also a tightening up on quality and with regard to the issue of protein crops. This means, moreover, that, especially in the northern part of the EU, there will be further price falls in the offing. On behalf of my Group, I shall, as I said, support an extension to the arrangements, but I would strongly urge the Commission, before 2002-2003, to make a concerted effort to investigate possible changes to the way in which we employ resources so that we can, in the future too, safeguard that group of farmers which, until now, has been supported by means of the aid arrangements in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that the system of aid established in 1989 has been modified several times, but no report has been presented on the application of the present system. Now, by advocating a maximum guaranteed area of 400 000 hectares, the Commission wants to reduce the average production area over the last three years by around 100 000 hectares, which will mean considerable reductions in aid. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, although we do not disagree with splitting the maximum guaranteed area into two, we feel it is necessary to adjust the historical reference period in order to calculate each of the maximum guaranteed areas excluding the last three years, in order to reduce the damaging impact for Portugal on products designed for human consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important to point out that it is vital for Portugal that dry bean should be considered in this system, even without the change to the maximum guaranteed surface. We therefore firmly believe that the Commission should bear in mind these amendments to the new system which it hopes to establish for grain legumes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two Commission documents that serve as a basis for the issue of grain legumes. The first is a report on the aid scheme in place for grain legumes, and the second a proposal for improved administration of the system. What vegetables are we actually talking about? I know that the Spanish members know the subject well, but I should mention that by grain legumes are meant three annual vegetables with a high protein content and which are gathered in the form of dry seeds. Lentils and chickpeas serve as food for humans, while the seeds of vetches, which to us are more unusual vegetables, are used as animal feed. Grain legumes are grown as field crops, particularly in the southern part of the Union, as they thrive well in dry climates. In fact Spain accounts for 90% of all EU grain legume production.</p>
<p class="contents">Grain legumes are not covered by the aid scheme that was remodelled with the Agenda 2000 programme, although they can be used in crop rotation schemes involving other crops such as corn. Grain legumes are covered by their own scheme where the amount of fixed aid per hectare is EUR 181 and the maximum guaranteed area is 400 000 hectares. The scheme was established in 1989 when the growing area of grain legumes was reduced at the expense of corn, which was already suffering from overproduction. The special scheme aimed to preserve traditional legume grain growing areas by means of the aid per hectare arrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the conclusions of the Commission’s report? An examination of how the scheme has been applied reveals that the MGA of 400 000 hectares has been systematically exceeded. There are two conclusions to be drawn from this. First, the aim of the scheme has been successfully achieved and, second, the growing areas have to be brought under better control. The MGA overruns in the last few years have shown themselves to be mainly with regard to vetches. Although the scheme is being applied satisfactorily as a whole, MGA management is problematic, as those responsible for the overruns are not being treated any differently from other producers.</p>
<p class="contents">So how could the system be improved? We should aim to find solutions regarding improvements within the framework of the present scheme and the appropriations set aside for it. We are in a situation in which the Agenda 2000 reform has been adopted and international trade negotiations are drawing closer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the rapporteur’s proposed amendment whereby the current aid scheme for vetch farmers could be combined with another market arrangement, i.e., that for seed vetches, would not achieve the improvement desired. This is a reference to Amendment No 2. It cannot be adopted for two reasons: firstly, the schemes are mutually exclusive, as in one scheme the seeds, in principle, have to be harvested as animal feed, while, in the other, they are designated for sowing. The other reason is that it might involve extra expense.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s report recommends that the MGA should be divided into two parts based on the earlier land area division in the proportion 40/60. It would divide up thus: 1 600 000 hectares would be used for the production of lentils and chickpeas, and 240 000 hectares would be used for the production of vetches. In addition, it is proposed that the Management Committee for Dried Fodder be replaced by the Management Committee for Cereals. The purpose of this change is only to legally endorse what has become common practice on the committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that the Commission will adopt the rapporteur’s amendments that reinforce its position, proposing that the Commission submit a new report, as in Amendment No 3, and seek ways of improving the system, as in Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the European Parliament, in the light of my comments, the proposal will probably not be difficult to adopt so that it can be applied from the marketing year 2000 – 2001 onwards.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Jillian (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner, the purpose of the Structural Funds is to target the poorest and most run-down areas of the European Union, those in greatest need of development, with extra money to help them begin to rebuild the economy, create jobs and regenerate poorer communities. Additionality is meant to ensure that happens and to prevent governments from using EU funding to replace their own aid as this would defeat the object. But in many regions and nations that is what happens at the moment and I can illustrate the problem using the example of Wales. The granting of EU Objective 1 status to West Wales and the Valleys last year was an acknowledgement of the poverty in two-thirds of the country. EUR 1.2 billion of European funding used effectively could provide exactly the additional help that is intended. But if we look at the government budget to Wales, in practice there will be no more government spending next year with Objective 1 than there is this year before Objective 1.</p>
<p class="contents">The National Assembly budget which comes from the Treasury remains the same so that in the first fifteen months, at least, of the new programme period there are no additional resources at all. The money will be taken from other budgets in the National Assembly, such as health and education. Therefore central government expenditure is reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Structural Funds, areas of greatest need are identified and selected on regional criteria. Yet when the Commission looks at additionality it is dealt with on a Member State level. This is a clear contradiction. The rules as they stand allow this to happen. Member States are not legally required to demonstrate additionality at the regional or programme level. I agree with the statement made by Commissioner Barnier in a written reply to me when he said that the spirit of additionality rather than the letter of the law on the matter is an important consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the revision of the system and a central part of that is looking at additionality internally in the Member States at the programme level as well as at the Member State level. Mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that Member States respect the principle and the spirit of additionality so that funds are targeted and spent effectively. So we are asking in this question, Commissioner, for confirmation that this will be done and I look forward to the vote on this debate in April.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this way, European Union structural policies will have a greater impact on reducing regional and social disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> verification of additionality is at present being undertaken in application of Article 11 of Regulation 1260/99. This is an integral part of the negotiation of the Structural Funds programmes with the Member States. This exercise is a demonstration of the Member States' intention to implement the principle of additionality over the programming period that lies ahead. Where necessary, the Commission may request clarification from the Member States on the details of their forecasts for eligible expenditure for the period 2000-2006. As a further measure, the Commission has prepared detailed implementing provisions for inclusion in the programming documents covering both the situation <span class="italic">ex ante</span> and also the mid-term and final verification of additionality.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue covered by the questions is the possibility of the verification of additionality at regional level. I would like to develop a number of elements of previous answers. Firstly, although additionality is implemented at the level of the overall eligible spending by the Member States rather than at regional level, it must be borne in mind that the overall additionality required to be demonstrated is, by definition, the sum of the eligible expenditures at the lower level. In practice, reduced national eligible expenditure in some regions would have to be balanced with an increase in other regions in order for additionality to be respected overall. On this point the Commission can give a clear assurance that, where evidence exists of reduced national expenditure in a given region or regions, it will be particularly attentive with regard to the credibility of the overall figures.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point of clarification concerns the scope of additionality and the suggestion that, when implemented at national level, it may be incompatible with the regional vocation of the Structural Funds. It must be borne in mind that the development-related expenditure of a Member State which is taken into account for the assessment of additionality is generally a mixture of resources allocated and managed at national level and those managed at regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">While there might be some categories of expenditure for which stability could be expected at regional level between the programming periods, it could hardly be suggested that the level of spending on, for example, major infrastructure should be maintained at the same level in each region regardless of current needs. This is why the Commission takes the view that the strict application of additionality at regional level would lead to excessive rigidity in the management by the Member States of their own development expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding budgetary provisions within the Member States between the central government and the regions, the Commission can only repeat that these are matters exclusively for national consideration and are not related to additionality as defined in the regulations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that there is a more important issue in Wales at the moment than the application of Objective 1 funds and it is important to look at the background to the issues that we are currently considering.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two major news stories breaking in the United Kingdom today. One is the shock news of BMW's decision to break up the Rover-Land Rover Group with the threat of massive redundancies right the way across the UK and the other breaking news this morning is the Conservative Party's stunning victory in the Ayr by-election driving the defending Labour Party into a miserable third place with a swing of almost 10%.</p>
<p class="contents">Now these stories are not just topical background to this debate. In my view, they underpin the very issues which we are considering in the context of Structural Fund spending under Objectives 1 and 2 in those parts of the European Union which are facing major economic problems. As we have already heard from Jillian Evans, a major part of Wales, in constituencies which I also represent, has been granted Objective 1 status, but sadly ever since that announcement was made by the Commission, our problems in Wales have actually got even worse. As a direct result of what I would describe as UK government policy, our agricultural economy has all but collapsed. Farm incomes are at their lowest level for a generation and this decline is also hitting the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not apologise for saying that the massive overvaluation of sterling which gives the UK Labour Chancellor an electoral war-chest of unprecedented proportions has handicapped every Welsh and UK manufacturer trying to export into the European market. It is little wonder that BMW blames the Rover decision directly on UK government economic policy, but that I fear is little comfort to the thousands of workers in Rover who have strained to improve the efficiency of the company only to find that their efforts have been undermined in Downing Street.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn then to the central hand of Labour government at work in terms of the European Structural Funds package. The unacceptable behaviour of the UK Government over this has already brought about the timely end of the political career of the first Secretary of the Welsh Assembly. Sadly, the Structural Funds spending issues have been marked by delay by disputes in relation to matched funding and also in relation to the issue of additionality. Lest it be raised later in this debate let me make it clear: this is not a new issue and I share the view that it is an issue that needs to be examined very carefully by the Commission itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the honour to be appointed as the rapporteur on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for the Structural Funds guidelines 2000-2006 and the committee agreed on that occasion, based on our recommendations to the Regional Policy Committee, that the Commission should pay attention to this issue of additionality. We reiterated the importance of ensuring that Structural Funds do not just merely, as it were, replace public spending otherwise earmarked for those areas that are lagging behind. I am rather sorry that the Regional Policy Committee did not incorporate that in the report themselves, but there it is.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of questions that I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to take back to Commissioner Barnier. I appreciate that he is the Commissioner in office today but he may not be in a position to respond to these points himself. However, these are points that I seek to put in the context of certainly the area that I represent and I daresay they are points that would be supported by Jillian Evans on behalf of her party. What progress is being made in relation to the approval of the programming documents within the Commission? Will the Commissioner take the step in terms of transparency of publishing at an appropriate time the correspondence that has taken place between the Commission and the National Assembly? We were assured, I am bound to say by a rather complacent Economic Secretary, who has now become the First Secretary, that all matters were proceeding in an orderly fashion. Yet we hear from remarks that are made from time to time by the Commission that there are real problems and we find it difficult to do our job within this Parliament without that degree of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">So, will the Commission undertake to make that information available to all Members of the European Parliament? Will they undertake to keep us informed in relation to these matters? Will they undertake to challenge Member State Governments in relation to the maps that have been drawn up in relation to Objective 2 where also there has been quite clear evidence of jerrymandering also. The additionality issue is an important one, but I must say it is not the only one which gives much concern to many Members of this European Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I acknowledge that there is difficulty in the Midlands with the Rover Group. I would not like to make political capital out of it. There are too many jobs at stake. Secondly, he also mentioned their by-election. I congratulate his party in securing a victory in this by-election. But, unlike him, I have been in Ayr for the last three weeks, on the doorstep. I can tell you that additionality was never raised once.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the question at hand. I thank the Nationalists for having raised this. It is right that we have a proper discussion on the whole question of the Structural Funds. But I suspect there is a deeper plot here. What are they actually trying to achieve? I listened to Ms Evans. Basically, what I took from her contribution is that she wants to redefine the Structural Funds regulations. I would remind people in this Parliament that it was not so long ago that this Parliament passed, by the assent procedure, the rules and regulations governing the Structural Funds, including Article 11, which defines additionality.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it therefore Parliament's role now to change that? We should not change that. The role of this Parliament is to ensure that the rules are complied with. That is what we should concentrate on.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that Ms Evans, along with one of her colleagues, Dafydd Wigley and a member of the Scottish Nationalist Party, Mr Wilson, went to meet Commissioner Barnier. I should like to read out the statement made by Commissioner Barnier after that meeting:</p>
<p class="contents">“I know that there has been a great deal of debate in Scotland and Wales recently about European regional funding. But I have the impression that this has sometimes confused two separate issues – additionality and cofinancing. I am not surprised that there is a certain amount of confusion among the Nationalists on this. Additionality, whether or not EU funds are providing additional impact, compared to what would otherwise have happened, can be used as <span class="italic">one</span> of the selection criteria by the local programme planners before they decide to approve aid to individual projects. The Commission, on the other hand, is obliged by the rules to make a global assessment of additionality for the UK as a whole, with the specific aim of ensuring that the European financial aid is additional to, and not a substitute for, national finance. We have always been satisfied in the past that the national requirements have been met”.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the Commission will be aware, however, a number of Member States within the European Union have devolved systems of regional government. Such regional systems of government are normally financed in whole or in part from central government funds. It appears to me that, under the present rules, central government can build the EU contribution to structural funding into its calculations for determining regional government budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">There appears to be no mechanism, despite what the Commissioner said, for ensuring either of two things: first, that the additionality rule is applied to this calculation, and second, that the amount of EU funding which ultimately reaches individual regions corresponds directly to the amount earmarked for those regions at the planning stage. At the very least, this engenders a lack of transparency. It may also mean that the additionality principle is not being properly implemented on a region-by-region basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept, like Mrs Evans, that this does not, strictly speaking, contradict the letter of European Union law on this matter. But, unlike her, it seems to me to be quite clearly contrary to the spirit of additionality rules and undermines the very purposes for which structural funding was established in the first place. Although I come from Scotland, I know these issues are of concern not just to my Liberal Democrat colleagues from other parts of the United Kingdom but also to ELDR members representing regions across the whole of the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some of us newcomers to this Parliament are already beginning to tire of good intentions, fantastic programmes and of hearing about the spirit of the Community regulations. Instead of spirit, we are going to end up with ghosts and sleepless nights because, in reality, commitments are not being fulfilled. It is therefore appropriate for the European institutions themselves to start by making good their commitments with regard to additionality. The Court of Auditors has already drawn up an assessment of the implementation of the additionality principle in June 1999 which shows that it is a total disaster and a mistake.</p>

The first rules that need to be complied with are those in the Treaty, in this case, Article 158, which takes the objective of economic and social cohesion to its highest level. Our task is to ensure that following on from this, the Commission’s regulations and behaviour attain and serve to attain these objectives. Our task is also to be alert enough here to criticise and to raise the issue whenever we see that this is not being done. We support the good timing and the reasoning of the issues raised by the authors of the oral question and we agree with the comments that have already been made here. We call on the Commission to exert more pressure to ensure that these instruments are used effectively in favour of the regions with the greatest needs, instead of, as it seems to us, letting the objective of economic and social cohesion go cold.</p>
<p class="contents">This subject is obviously a delicate one, and its development has been discussed at great length over the years, with many rules being regularly revised, but what we cannot accept is that the revision of these rules and the development of the bureaucracy always hit the most needy. We cannot, for example, accept the fact that problems have been raised about allocating funds to regions which are eligible under various programmes, because if these regions are eligible for various funds it is precisely because their needs are the greatest, and anything that hinders the operation of these funds holds back their development and threatens the objective of economic and social cohesion. Similarly, we do not accept that the Commission should in any way associate itself with the degree of inertia shown by some national governments who are not prepared to support the regions with the greatest needs.

The first is that the money in absolute terms in most regions of the Community is relatively small, and its impact is political rather economic – though that is important too. I have often said it is important that we as a European Union should not just make regulations telling people what they may or may not do, but that we should extend what appears to the European public and to the regions of the Union to be tangible benefits. Even in rich regions they will appreciate the fact that the European Union tries to help close the gap between rich and poor.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing in the macro-economic sense that we can say is that, if a certain amount of Structural Funds is allocated to Portugal or Greece or Ireland, as it has been in the past, then that money goes into these states in any case and that is the first impact that it has. The money is actually transferred and, regardless of whether the letter of the law is observed or not, the countries become the better off.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that I would like to make is that we can learn from the past. First of all, we have now tidied up the regulations to some extent, but originally they were written in an effort to please every sector and every political interest, so that it became impossible, with the staff that the European Commission had at its disposal, to police the spending of the money, and that is still the case to a large degree.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now into to the third or fourth programme. What we must do is learn from the mistakes of the past and try and apply the lessons to the future. If you want to be absolutely effective with the way this money is spent, what you need to do is to look at what a country has been spending previously, and to ask them to submit their plans to the European Commission. The European Commission identifies the weaknesses in this plan and says: This is the way we would like our money to be spent in addition to what you have already allocated for all this work you intend to do.</p>
<p class="contents">In my personal experience in Ireland, I never heard the European Commission take Ireland to task for failure in the area of additionality. But one should remember that, between 1982 and 1992, the Structural Funds to Ireland peaked; they are getting less now, and there was a generous amount of money. But, from 1982 to 1992, the public capital programme actually reduced, including Structural Funds. It reduced in real terms by 30%. So where did the Structural Funds go? The Structural Funds actually went into public sector pay and social welfare, and it is very questionable as to whether they did a good or a bad turn to the Irish economy in those years, because they contributed to inflation and increased wage demands. So there are lessons to be learned: set against the staff the Commission had at its disposal to deal with the Irish problem – three or four people – Ireland had 30 000 civil servants, and the Irish Civil Service won every time!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I am going to refer to a subject that none of the previous speakers has discussed. I am referring to the report by the Court of Auditors on the principle of additionality. This is a report that was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 9 March.</p>
<p class="contents">This report contains a very interesting section – section 62 – that discusses privatisation. Over the past few years, various European Union governments have enthusiastically embarked on a policy of privatisation placing the heritage which previously belonged to the community in very few hands. In Spain, for example, over the last four years, public companies have been privatised to the tune of 4 billion, with a B for Barcelona or Brussels. These public companies have passed into the hands of private individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liikanen is an expert in accounting, and knows that privatisation is a form of public disinvestment and, specifically, that it can be a form of regional disinvestment. If, for example, an airline providing regional services was privatised, regional disinvestment could occur, and we would thus be infringing the principle of additionality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors has referred to this, saying that Member States are aware that spending decreases as a result of privatisation and it is in their interests to reduce it. Taking into account the importance of the categories of spending affected, telecommunications, energy, etc., this simple operation can substantially modify the final result.</p>
<p class="contents">And we also have the response by the Commission, which must be very recent, and which Commissioner Liikanen, as a member of the College, must remember perfectly. The Commission replies here with a system that we call the Olendorf method, a method of language-learning that consists of the teacher asking the student “Have you got my uncle's underpants?” and the student replying “No, but I have my grandmother's glasses”. And the response given to us by the Commission in section 62 is very short. It says: "Although the private sector sometimes invests in sectors that are traditionally considered public, it would be incredibly difficult to increase the verification of additionality in private investments, as this would imply the collection and examination of the accounts of a number of private companies which would not be obliged to provide the corresponding information to the national authorities or to the Commission”. That is, the Commission is replying using the Olendorf method. We have here Commissioner Liikanen who knows the subject very well, and perhaps he could give us a more specific response, as I believe that this considerably affects the core of additionality.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that the Berlin financial forecasts anticipated a substantial reduction in the Structural Funds. This year we have EUR 29 430 million. In the year 2006 we will have a nominal figure of EUR 26 600 million, that is to say, a reduction of 14% over seven years. Taking into account inflation, I can calculate that there is a reduction of 20%. That is, from now until 2006, the Structural Funds will lose over 20% compared with the current figure, which means that it will be very difficult to meet the needs we are meeting today and, as we have heard, there are still many problems in many Community regions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further problem, which should also not be hidden from the Commission or the members of this House: we are talking about the impending enlargement of the European Union with thirteen new Member States, most of which have a far lower average income than that of the poorest regions of the Community and there are no plans to fulfil cohesion policies with regard to these candidate Member States. I know that the Commission will not be able to give me a reply on this question, but I am drawing the attention of the House and the Commissioner to the problem that this will cause with regard to Community cohesion policies.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This principle of additionality is important to reduce regional disparities, which is the aim of the Union’s regional and structural policies. The Commission must oblige the Member States to work in such a way that the principle of additionality is implemented both nationally and regionally.</p>
<p class="contents">I suspect that this principle is being seriously violated in the Member States. The effect of the Union’s regional policy is dramatically weakened by governments drastically reducing national, public and structural aid and subsidies, even in excess of what is coming into a region via Union funds. In some cases this violation is covered up by including as national regional funds development funds, which are mainly, however, targeted at the fastest growing areas. The regional failure to observe the principle of additionality aggravates the situation with regard to internal regional disparities within Member States, which runs counter to the aims of the Union’s regional policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a matter of real concern because it is made to appear as though a scheme which is supposed to provide specific help really ends up just been a conjuring trick between the Commission and the national governments in which extra money is supposed to be coming in, but we are told afterwards it makes no difference whether extra money went into the particular region as long as it went into the country as a whole. That is simply unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We are further told, however, that all is well, because the additionality rules in the regulation are being carried through properly. Yet the Court of Auditors, in the very report that we have been talking about, says the following things: the difficulties encountered are caused by the limited development of the principle in terms of concepts and methodology and the joint failure to find appropriate and effective procedures for verifying it. And then two paragraphs later, the identification of the structural assistance interventions in the eligible regions is unreliable, and this leads to the inclusion of a large number of estimates and hypotheses which are difficult to verify.</p>

Great Britain, as a whole, receives some £10 billion in support from the Structural Funds programme. Indeed parts of my own constituency, the West Midlands, have been awarded £550 million under the Objective II strand.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Structural Funds programme the European Union, by having this programme, is indeed providing an opportunity – an opportunity for regions to develop and for communities to strengthen; an opportunity for businesses to prosper and for people's lives to be improved. The Structural Funds programme provides, in many cases, the single most important and positive opportunity for our own worst-hit and most deprived areas to get up off their knees and back on their feet. This is a laudable objective and something that every Member of this Parliament would, I hope, support.</p>
<p class="contents">But Structural Funds also provide an opportunity for national governments. If unregulated and unmonitored, they are an opportunity for national governments to ease their cash burden and to iron out their accounting difficulties – or indeed more cynically, one could say, to siphon away a war chest or pay for vote-winning tax reductions. Granting of Structural Funds is often trumpeted by governments as a sign of its success, whereas in truth it is merely a recognition of difficult problems that a region faces. The aim of the Structural Funds programme is not to help governments win elections, but to help the lives of Europe's citizens. It is a great shame, therefore, that just by having this debate today, we are signalling our awareness that money from the Structural Funds programme is not allocated in many Member States as it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">We are accepting the fact, for example, that matching funding is often not provided by national governments and that, by clever accounting, figures are all too often shrouded and fudged. So what can we do? What can be done to ensure that our aims and objectives are met? To begin with, additionality must mean exactly that – additional funds being spent where they are most needed and on the most important projects. We must work harder to ensure that the true figures for spending are rigorously checked and that spending is identified more clearly. Only recently the Commission published a devastating critique of the UK Government's handling of the Structural Funds, due in large part to the inequality of public sector matching funding. This is clearly not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In one area alone – Liverpool and Merseyside – the lack of support by the UK Treasury is putting at risk the creation of </p>
<p class="contents">10 000 jobs, and up to 5 000 existing ones will be lost, according to a report by the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce. The end result of all this is that private-sector partners will have little confidence in projects, often resulting in the failure of worthwhile schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, as I have said previously in this House in previous debates on the subject, we must endeavour to ensure that these funds are seen not as a hand-out but as a hand-up.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we must look in detail at that problem, and we need also better coordination between DGs on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionality is <span class="italic">your</span> concept, and it is up to you to ensure that it works effectively in Member States. We understand as well, of course, the problems you are facing concerning the overlapping of programmes, creating problems of continuity for you.</p>
<p class="contents">Verification is another matter that needs to be tackled with Member States, because they are guilty as well. We understand your problems, that they are not providing for you sufficient data in good time, especially with Objectives 2, 3 and 4, to enable you to ensure that the system works more effectively. One of the worst offenders in this connection is the UK. No additional money has been built into the budget of our Welsh Assembly. This is clear non-compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the European Union admit that our nation of Wales is poor and yet the UK government, not only the Labour government, has not complied with additionality. It is all very well for my colleague Jonathan Evans to imply that his party is not guilty. For eighteen long years the concept of additionality was not complied with by his government either.</p>
<p class="contents">I think some momentum is being lost, Mr President. I was talking to councils in Wales yesterday. They need this scheme to go ahead. It is in line with the excellent principle of cohesion, and we ask the Commission to adhere to that and to assist the poorest regions in the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We pay the taxes that make up the grants that other areas receive. We have no Objective 1 funding. What Objective 2 funding we had has been reduced by the present government and the Conver Fund that used to be very helpful is now being phased out. So, why do I speak? Because even in the south-east of England there are pockets of deprivation.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I want to speak of the Isle of Wight, a beautiful island with 130 000 good people but 68% GDP per head of the European average – a very poor region. It gets no support from Europe. Why not? It does not get the grant from Europe because at NUTS II it is classified with Hampshire. Hampshire is a prosperous county – 100% of European average so, no money for the Isle of Wight. Yet, it has a population of 130 000, a bigger population than the Åland Islands which are NUTS II and do get grants from the European Union. The island has taken its case against the British Government that it feels is treating it unfairly, to the High Court in London. I think they might win that case.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Europe is concerned, on my advice, they took their case to the Ombudsman because we believed that EUROSTAT, by refusing to define the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region, was treating the island unfairly. This week, in what I would say is a landmark ruling by the European Ombudsman, he has said that constitutes maladministration by EUROSTAT and by the European Commission. Let me read out his ruling: “In the present case the Commission has not provided the Ombudsman with elements which show that EUROSTAT, when deciding not to classify the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region, has taken into account all relevant factors including Article 158 of the Treaty and the Viola report of the European Parliament”. He has recommended that the Commission and EUROSTAT should look again at this particular problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to consider fairly this recommendation that has come from the Ombudsman so that I can go back to the people of the Isle of Wight and say that this issue will be looked at again, that they can expect the Commission to treat fairly the particular problems and concerns of the island. Then we can get in on this act of additionality and take up our fight with the British Government to make sure that we get support from Europe and from the British Government to treat fairly an island which to date has not been fairly treated either by the British Government or by the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This will only get worse for Labour when the truth about their incompetent and cynical administration of the European Union's Structural Funds becomes better known and better understood. Because of the Labour Government's tardiness in submitting its proposed maps nine months late in December instead of March last year, it is still struggling to come up with acceptable specific projects. Scottish local authorities are left not knowing whether or not the projects which they are having to underwrite will indeed obtain Structural Fund support.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner: three questions:</p>
<p class="contents">When do you expect to be able to provide certainty for the Scottish regions and the badly needed projects which are looking for EU support? Are you satisfied with the preparedness of the Scottish Executive to provide the necessary matching funding and to assure you that it is truly additional?

<p>The Council is deeply concerned at the increasing number of attacks against civilian personnel working for the United Nations, which resulted in the death of 184 United Nations staff members between 1 January 1992 and 31 January 2000, and fully supports the condemnations of these acts of murder and other violence against UN staff members, as expressed by the UN Security Council, most recently on 9 February 2000.</p>
<p>The protection of United Nations and associated and humanitarian personnel is a fundamental responsibility for United Nations missions in situations of conflict. Violence against them is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated under any circumstances. Without their safety and security, missions and operations could not function, let alone succeed.</p>
<p>The Union has expressed a firm position on this question during the Security Council open debate held on 9 February 2000. On this occasion, the EU stressed that the responsibility for the safety of personnel on the ground falls, in the first instance, on the governments hosting peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. The Union urged all parties to conflict to take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and security of United Nations and associated, as well as humanitarian personnel, including locally-recruited personnel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Union expressed the view that perpetrators of crimes against such personnel must be brought to justice. Governments must act forcefully to prevent these acts of violence and to punish those responsible for them. In this context, the Statute of the International Criminal Court is also essential. The inclusion in the Statute of the war crime of intentionally attacking personnel involved in humanitarian assistance or peacekeeping missions will help to bring perpetrators to justice.</p>
<p>Finally, the Union stated that the United Nations Secretariat must ensure that United Nations and associated personnel are adequately protected. The Union supports the Secretary-General’s continued strengthening of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator with personnel dedicated to security in peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p>The Union's positions are largely reflected in the Statement made by the President of the UN Security Council on behalf of the Council on 9 February 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0178"></a>

<p>In the Council President’s view, have the sanctions against Austria, adopted by the 14 Heads of State and Government and announced by the Portuguese Presidency, had the desired effect? Can the Council President state whether his view on this matter will have any influence on the maintenance of these sanctions by the Heads of State and Government?</p>
<p>What requirements will have to be met in order for the sanctions to be lifted?</p>
<p>Finally, does the Council President consider that this procedure should continue to be used in future, in preference to the provisions laid down in Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>1.	As I pointed out in a written answer to a question put by Mrs Pernille Frahm in the framework of the Question Time of February last, the position expressed by the President of the European Council, in the name of fourteen governments of the Member States of the European Union, regarding the inclusion of the Freedom Party in the Austrian Government, does not represent a Council position.</p>
<p>2.	Therefore, it would be inappropriate for the Council to express an opinion on actions which have been taken by one or more of the Governments of the Member States and which have no direct bearing on the work of the Council.</p>
<p>Any such action is a matter for the governments of the Member States concerned. The use of the provisions of Article 7 of the EU Treaty is a separate issue. The mechanisms provided for under this Article have not been invoked nor has the possibility of having recourse to them been discussed by the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1. With regard to Turkey, the pre-accession strategy will outline the EU’s priorities for satisfying the so-called Copenhagen criteria. Accession negotiations will not be able to start until Turkey satisfies these criteria, which include human rights and the protection of minorities. In this context, it should be made clear that Turkey does recognise the minorities referred to in the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, specifically the Greek, Armenian and Jewish minorities. The pre-accession strategy for Turkey will probably be adopted in October or November 2000.</p>
<p>2. On 24 February, the current Chairman of the HADEP (the pro-Kurdish party) and his predecessor, together with 16 other members of the party, were given prison sentences, some of more than three years, for allegedly supporting the PKK terrorist group. The support in question involved hunger strikes in support of Abdullah Öçalan during his stay in Italy at the end of 1998, before his arrest in February 1999.</p>
<p>3. The elected leaders of the councils in Diyarbakir, Siirt and Bingöl, who are all Kurds and members of the HADEP, had been arrested a few days previously by the security forces in spectacular circumstances. They were then also accused of supporting the PKK and were remanded in custody pending trial. The three council leaders have since been released, following intervention by the EU.</p>
<p>4. Human Rights organisations have condemned the recent actions carried out against Kurdish politicians. The European Union stressed – through the confidential work of a troika in Ankara – the importance of non-interference in democratic institutions in the context of the Copenhagen criteria for accession and of the proper treatment of the arrested men. The EU also expressed its “surprise” at these arrests.</p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The reason given for the EU’s approval of NATO’s bombing of Yugoslavia at the Berlin Summit on 25 March 1999 was to stop human rights violations in Kosovo.</p>
<p>In the light of the human rights situation before, during and after the intervention by Russia in Chechnya, what is the difference in the quality, scale or nature of the human rights violations that led the EU to support the bombing of Kosovo, but do nothing in Chechnya other than allow the Russian Government to act as it sees fit?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly condemned Russia’s military intervention in Chechnya and considers it to be completely unacceptable. It has stressed the fact that the fight against terrorism does not justify, under any circumstances, the indiscriminate use of force. The Council has made it quite clear that this behaviour contravenes the basic principles of humanitarian law, the commitments given by Russia to the OSCE, as well as its obligations as a Member of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>The Council has on several occasions urged Russia to end its military offensive against the Chechen people, to allow the delivery, in safe conditions, of humanitarian aid, and to immediately enter into political dialogue with Chechen representatives. The Council is convinced that only a political agreement can provide a lasting solution to the complex underlying causes of the conflict. The Council therefore fully supports the efforts of the OSCE and the Council of Europe. Any political agreement would clearly have to give the Chechens a sufficient degree of autonomy, without threatening Russia’s territorial integrity.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the Council is deeply alarmed at the increasing number of reports on human rights abuses, such as torture and executions. In their meeting on 2 March with the Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, the EU Troika urged Russia to end these abuses and to bring those responsible to trial. The Troika appealed to Russia to allow independent investigations to take place in order to ensure complete transparency. In addition to this, at the trilateral ministerial meeting of 3 March in Lisbon, the EU and the US together put pressure on Russia to do so. The Council will continue to follow this issue very closely, and to put pressure on Russia if necessary.</p>
<p>In this context, we must emphasise that the Council has already urged Russia on several occasions to allow a permanent presence in the region of competent international organisations such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the United Nations. The Council supports the efforts of the President-in-Office of the OSCE, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, who will shortly be travelling to the region, as well as the commitment of Mary Robinson and of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Gil Robles. The Council will continue to exert pressure on Russia so that the OSCE Assistance Group can return quickly to the region.</p>
<p>As a result of the situation in Chechnya, the Helsinki European Council decided to refocus the Joint Strategy for Russia, to redirect the TACIS programme towards certain priorities, to adopt a strict approach to trade matters, if Russia violates the PCA and to end cooperation under the PCA in certain areas. The EU is currently working on the implementation of these measures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council is particularly concerned at the treatment of journalists working in Chechnya. In light of the case of Mr Babitsky, the Council has urged Russia to adopt all necessary measures to guarantee basic conditions for free and independent media to operate, as well as an unhampered flow of information.</p>
<p>Under growing international pressure, Russia has accepted the participation of experts from the Council of Europe in Vladimir Kalamanov’s team, and has stated that it is willing to study the possibility of other interested organisations participating. On its own initiative, Russia has invited the president of the ICRC to travel to Moscow, and he will probably also visit Chechnya. The new head of the OSCE Assistance Group travelled to Chechnya on 11 March.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to closely follow the human rights situation in Chechnya and to take every appropriate opportunity to express its concerns to the Russians.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Over the last few days, the Israeli Airforce has frequently attacked targets in Lebanon. During these so-called 'reprisal' raids, strike aircraft and helicopters made repeated attacks on positions occupied by the radical Islamic Hezbollah militia. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy warned Hezbollah, which operates out of Lebanese territory, not to attack border areas in Northern Israel, since, according to Levy, Israel would not tolerate this and Lebanon would burn. Lebanon's economic interests could be hard-hit by this and reconstruction could last years. The situation had already escalated to the point where Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was obliged to declare a state of emergency in Northern Israel.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Russian Airforce has continued its attacks in Chechnya, which have been going on for months. The second Chechnya war started when the Russians marched in last September. According to latest reports, the Russian military has now given advance notice of the 'final phase' of the war in what is an utterly destroyed and broken region.</p>

<p>1. With regard to the questions on Chechnya, I would ask the honourable Member to refer to the answer I gave to the previous questions on this subject.</p>
<p>2. With regard to the questions on the repeated air strikes by Israel on Southern Lebanon, I would draw you attention to the Presidency’s recent statement on Lebanon on behalf of the European Union, the tenor of which was the following:</p>
<p>Declaration by the Presidency on behalf of the European Union on Lebanon </p>
<p>The EU has followed the situation in Lebanon very closely and wishes to express its deep concern at the escalation of hostilities, its consternation at the consequent deaths and injuries, and its deep sympathy with the wounded and the bereaved families. In response to attacks on its forces, Israel launched air strikes against Lebanese infrastructures, causing casualties amongst Lebanese civilians. The EU consequently wishes to emphasise that the main objective of the agreement of April 1996 is to protect civilians from such attacks, and it regrets any violation of this agreement. The escalation of hostilities threatens the progress that has recently been made in the peace process and as a result of the reopening of negotiations with Syria and with Lebanon.</p>
<p>The EU urges all parties to exercise restraint and to scrupulously respect the terms of the cease-fire agreement of April 1996. The EU also calls for the Monitoring Committee to be convened quickly in order to ensure that tensions are appeased and to prevent further violations of the agreement.</p>
<p>These incidents confirm the urgent need to redouble our efforts to establish lasting peace in the region. Our success in this depends in particular on the implementation of Resolution 425 of the United Nations Security Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0193"></a>

<p>Sweden is currently negotiating with the Commission for an extension of its derogation regarding the alcohol brought into Sweden.</p>

This system will in principle be the same as the arrangements which are intended to apply within the EU, that tax should be imposed only in the country of origin of the goods. When the Council, after considering the report, believes that the conditions for transition to the final system exist, it should, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting Parliament, adopt the rules to apply to the final system. It goes on to say that the transitional rules shall be automatically extended until the date on which the final system enters into force. The agreement concluded in 1996 (Article 1(3) of Directive 96/99/EC<a href="#defann_10_2" name="refann_10_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>) states, according to the IOGT-NTO, that Sweden is entitled until 30 June 2000 to continue to apply the current restrictions on the quantity of alcoholic drinks, subject to review as laid down in Article 28 of Directive 77/388/EC.</p>

<p>Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union states that “the Common Foreign and Security Policy shall include all issues relating to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, in accordance with the second subparagraph, which might lead to common defence, should the Council so decide”. Common defence is envisaged in the Treaty as a possible long-term objective, which will in any event require a specific decision by the European Council and the subsequent adoption of a decision by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional laws.</p>
<p>There is currently no “supreme guarantee” within the Union. This guarantee of assistance against external aggression is laid down by the North Atlantic Treaty and by the amended Treaty of Brussels (the Western European Union) in relation to the States that are party to these Treaties.</p>
<p>The purpose of developing the Union’s military capabilities is to provide the Union with the necessary means for crisis management, in other words, to satisfy the so-called “Petersberg Tasks”, which are humanitarian and evacuation tasks, as well as tasks aimed at maintaining and re-establishing peace, to which specific reference is made in Article 17(2). This fact was clearly stated by the Cologne European Council in June 1999 and confirmed in Helsinki in December 1999. In addition to this, it has also been specified on several occasions that this process “does not imply the creation of a European Army”.</p>

Under the single institutional framework, all of the EU’s Member States, whether they are neutral, non-allied or Nato members can participate on equal terms in all preparatory stages and in decision making with regard to EU-led operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With regard to the participation of applicant countries and countries which are Nato allies but not EU Members, the Helsinki European Council decided that, in crisis management operations launched by the EU, appropriate structures will be created for dialogue and the exchange of information with those countries. These structures will be used for the purpose of consultation when the Council has not reached a decision. The possible forms of these structures are currently under discussion in Council forums.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0198"></a>

<p>This system – in which one Member State of the Union is also involved – has vast technological surveillance capabilities and, through a worldwide satellite system, is able to monitor, record and exploit at will conversations and information with enormous economic and political implications.

The Council, at that time under the UK Presidency, did not deign to answer me, saying it was not a matter for the Council.

<p>1.	The Council decision to which the honourable Member refers relates to the Council conclusions of 4 March 1996, in which the Council agreed that including standard readmission clauses in joint agreements would be given due consideration on an individual basis at the time of adopting negotiation directives for such agreements. The Council decision modifies these conclusions to suit the new situation arising as a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam coming into force. In fact, it was necessary to review these standard clauses agreed in 1996 in order to take account of the fact that henceforth, the European Community is authorised to conclude readmission agreements with third countries. According to this decision, the revised standard clauses would, in future, have to be incorporated into Community agreements and into association and cooperation agreements between the European Community, its Member States and third countries. In legal terms, this relates to negotiation directives adopted by the Council pursuant to Article 300(1), of the EC Treaty.

<p>1. The Council is aware of the problems resulting from the specific situation of the Canary Islands and has always attached great importance to instruments designed to reduce the structural disadvantages resulting from its remote location.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. With regard to this matter, the Council strongly defends the Community strategy designed to ensure that the Canary Islands participate fully in the activity of the internal market. This Community support is demonstrated on the one hand by the implementation of the Structural Funds, reformed under the priority given to the Objective 1 regions. On the other hand, and in a complementary way, Community support is also demonstrated by taking account of the specific requirements of the Canary Islands in implementing Community policies, with the help of the Programme of Options Specific to the Remote and Insular Nature of the Canary Islands, the so-called POSEICAN programme.</p>
<p>3. POSEICAN has been implemented since 1991 with the help of the approval by the Council or the Commission, depending on the particular case, of the necessary legal measures in the sectors in question, such as agricultural policy, infrastructures and tax and customs issues.</p>

<p>How does the Council assess the implementation of the 1997 joint action and what is its position on reviewing the action so as to give a political signal of the EU’s commitment in this field?</p>
<p>What progress has been made in adapting the Member States’ legislation? Have the reports on this question been drawn up and published?</p>
<p>What significance is given to the question of anti-personnel mines in the Union’s political dialogue with its partners, in particular the applicant countries (five of which have not signed the Convention)?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>1. Shortly before the Ottawa Conference in 1997, the EU approved a new joint action on anti-personnel mines, in which it reiterated its commitment to the objective of completely eliminating these mines throughout the world. The Union was therefore delighted at the signing of the Convention in Ottawa, as well as at the efforts made by its signatories to promote universal adherence to the Convention.</p>
<p>2. At the first Conference of Signatory States to the Ottawa Convention (3-7 May 1999), the Union called on all States to unite their efforts to achieve the complete elimination of anti-personnel mines throughout the world. The following associate countries subscribed to this statement: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Cyprus (Poland did not). In order to promote the rapid and full implementation of the Convention, the Union undertook several initiatives which demonstrated its full support for the Convention’s objectives. It was with this in mind that, in the Joint Action, the EU Member States also made a commitment to actively participate in the conferences due to be organised following the signing of the Convention and to promote, in all appropriate forums, any effort likely to contribute to the objectives of the Joint Action.</p>
<p>Finland has not yet ratified the Ottawa Convention.</p>
<p>3. As the honourable Members will be aware, the Convention has been ratified by fourteen EU Member States. Finland is studying the possibility of signing up to the 2006 Ottawa Convention and replacing anti-personnel mines with alternative means by the end of 2010. Finland has emphasised that it is continuing to participate in international cooperation, both in terms of the objective of a total ban and in terms of mine clearance.</p>
<p>4. The EU has raised the issue of the universal acceptance and implementation of the Ottawa Convention in the meetings involving political dialogue on global disarmament and arms control that it has held with all associate countries, with the EFTA countries that are members of the European Economic Area, with Canada, with the United States and with other countries such as Australia and regional groups such as the SADC.</p>
<p>Reference to the issue of the Ottawa Convention in negotiations for accession to the EU.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5. With regard to negotiations for accession to the European Union, it is hoped that the applicant countries will fully adhere to the acquis, including the joint positions and joint actions adopted under the Common Foreign and Security Policy.</p>
<p>Reports presented by Signatory States to the Convention.</p>
<p>6. At the first meeting of the Standing Committee of Experts, on the general status and operation of the Ottawa Convention, which was held on 10 and 11 January 2000, a positive assessment was made of the increasingly universal acceptance of the Convention, which has already been signed or accepted by 137 countries and has been ratified by 90. It was stated that 31 States had already submitted their respective reports on the implementation of the Convention to the Secretary-General of the United Nations (Article 7 of the Convention), while 34 other States are late in doing so. In their capacity as co-chairs of the Standing Committee of Experts, South Africa and Canada have informed the participants of the meeting that they had implemented, together with interested States, initiatives for the States in question to encourage them to adopt all the necessary measures to prove that they still firmly support the prohibition of anti-personnel landmines. While the Convention does not require the publication of reports and while the Council is not aware that reports by EU Member States have been published, Article 7 of the Ottawa Convention stipulates that the Secretary-General will forward all the reports that he has received to the signatory States to the Convention, who will then study the issues raised in them at the meeting of Signatory States. Furthermore, we wish to inform the honourable Member that the reports by the United Nations Anti-Mine Services will be available on the website of the United Nations department for disarmament issues.</p>
<p>Implementation of the Joint Action</p>
<p>7. The Joint Action establishes the framework for specific actions and for the EU’s financial contributions to mine clearing activities. In the period between 1993 and 1997, the Union contributed USD 140 million for mine clearing operations and assistance to victims. This amount does not include individual contributions by EU Member States. In 1998, funds provided by the European Community and by the Member States reached a total of approximately USD 95 million. These figures demonstrate the EU to be the largest donor in the world in these areas.</p>
<p>On 28 November 1997, the Council of the EU adopted a decision on the implementation of Joint Action 96/588/CFSP, of 1 October 1996, on antipersonnel landmines, in order to contribute to the funding of certain SADC programmes (EUR 2.07 million), of the ICRC “Mines Awareness Programme” in former Yugoslavia and of the rehabilitation programme for the victims mutilated by mines in Iraq (EUR 1.43 million). On the same day, the Council approved a decision on implementing Joint Action 96/588/CFSP on anti-personnel landmines, in order to cofinance the ICRC “special appeals” (maximum contribution of EUR 8 million).</p>
<p>Updating the Joint Action</p>
<p>8. In the Union’s statement at the first Conference of Signatory States to the Ottawa Convention, it remarked that all of the Signatory States had committed themselves to never, whatever the circumstances, using anti-personnel landmines. The EU also hopes that all of the Signatory States will fully respect the objective, the design and the spirit of the Ottawa Convention. Although the EU was guided at first by humanitarian concerns, it will focus its efforts on the Party States and the Signatory States, who in practice are fully observing the principles and the objectives laid down in the Convention. The recent civilian victims of the use have emphasised the importance of this lethal weapon being abolished and the appropriate nature of the objectives stated in the EU Joint Action, which are to completely eliminate anti-personnel landmines and to help to resolve the problems already caused by these weapons. As the objectives remain valid, the Union does not currently envisage updating them.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Although it is recognised that the lead role in coordination lies with the local National Institute for Disaster Management and the UN agencies, the Member States have placed great emphasis on the need to exchange information between themselves and with the Commission on their activities. This is to ensure effective coordination so that there is no duplication of effort and that the aid provided has maximum impact.</p>
<p>The Council recognises the broader impact this catastrophe is likely to have on Mozambique's economy and development. It will follow a twin-track approach aiming at meeting the immediate needs for relief while working with the Commission to look at measures to ensure macro-economic stability, the rehabilitation of the affected areas in the medium-term and the maintenance of on-going programmes of development assistance including Lomé. To this end, several Member States have already announced measures for rehabilitation, budgetary support and debt relief and their intention to redirect their development assistance programmes towards rehabilitation if this is required. This complements the EUR 21m in aid announced by Commissioner Nielson for the medium term needs of the flood victims.</p>
<p>EUR 100m were provided in 1999 for Mozambique from the European Development Fund and up to EUR 150m could be available for the National Indicative Programme in 2000.</p>
<p>The Council also plans to look at the lessons to be drawn from this crisis in the context of its on-going discussions on the evaluation of humanitarian aid and its emerging response on the management of non-military crises in general.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0237"></a>

<p>We can assure the honourable Member that the EU’s aim is still to establish a democratic and multiethnic Kosovo within the internationally-recognised borders of the former Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly condemned all acts of violence, whoever may have perpetrated them and has expressed particular concern at the countless outbreaks of ethnic violence in Mitrovica and the recent attacks on Members of KFOR. The Council has requested all political leaders in Kosovo to strongly condemn every kind of violence and to use their influence to bring it to an end. Kosovo’s leaders also have a responsibility to help prevent separatist attacks on Southern Serbia. The Council has drawn their attention to the fact that their presence in Kosovo also depends on the progress made in reconciliation between ethnic groups and in total compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, in all of its aspects, including the promotion of the principle of the territorial integrity of the former Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Council accepts the urgent need for a solution to be found for the continuing violence against Serbs, Gypsies and other non-Albanian Communities and to the growing problem of organised crime. The establishment of a safe environment will be a central factor in preventing the Kosovar Serbs from leaving the region and in encouraging those who have already done so to return. To this end, the Council recognises the need to strengthen the presence of the international police in Kosovo. Member States are responding positively to the urgent appeal by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Dr Kouchner, and of the High Representative, to bolster the numbers of police officers supplied by the United Nations in Kosovo’s civilian police mission.</p>
<p>Resolution 1244 of the United Nations Security Council granted KFOR, an international force under NATO command, the mandate to establish a security presence in Kosovo, to prevent the renewal of hostilities, to demilitarise the KLA and to establish a safe environment to which refugees can return and in which the international civilian workers can operate. The EU fully respects the division of labour decided on by the United Nations Security Council. The Council is Consequently, leaving to NATO and KFOR the task of assessing and deciding what they need to fulfil the mandates that they have been given by the international Community.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council would remind the honourable Member of the EU’s special responsibility under the “Fourth Pillar” (economic reconstruction) for the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which is administrated by the European Union, and thus the importance of this pillar for Kosovo’s peaceful future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0216"></a>

<p>Trade policy is never gender-neutral. Women make up 70% of the poorest people in the world and they are hardest hit by liberalisation of trade and the transition to a market economy. Nevertheless, gender rarely forms a natural part of the analyses on which our trade policy is based.</p>
<p>Article 3(2) of the Amsterdam Treaty provides that equality must be present as an aspect of all areas of policy, including trade. What practical measures does the Commission intend to take to ensure that the EU's trade policy is not detrimental to women but, instead, benefits the population as a whole ?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the honourable Member is aware, trade policy as such is gender neutral and non-discriminatory. Where the Commission might agree is that the effects of trade liberalisation may not always be gender neutral to the extent that the local framework to which this liberalisation is applied, does not support equal opportunities sufficiently.</p>
<p>As such, the Community's trade policy is based on the principle of a level playing field for all economic actors, and therefore a basic of equal opportunities.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is surely aware, the Community proposed in Seattle the establishment of a joint World Trade Organisation (WTO) - International Labour Organisation (ILO) forum to consider the issue of core labour standards. Even though no conclusion was reached, a point raised by many countries is the need to consider, apart from the issue of core labour standards, other social development questions arising from United States conferences. This may therefore provide an opportunity to also initiate a dialogue on issues related to gender in the context of trade policy.</p>
<p>At the level of the Community the Honourable Member will be aware that 'mainstreaming' of the issue of equal opportunities for women and men is part of its policy-making.</p>
<p>Therefore, as one of the concrete steps to improve knowledge on the effects of our policies, the Commission has launched last year a Sustainable Impact Assessment (SIA), which should also seek to assess gender impact.</p>
<p>One clear outcome of the SIA is that trade liberalisation, while not itself intrinsically bad for gender inequality or any other sustainable development objective, can create problems if it generates growth in an economy where the framework of law fails to guarantee equal opportunities (or adequate environmental protection for that matter).</p>
<p>That is why the Commission, with the support of Parliament in its pre-Seattle resolution, has pressed for trade talks to be flanked by capacity-building measures and for the aid effort undertaken in other frameworks to be better coordinated with the WTO's work programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0204"></a>

<p>Does the Commission not consider that there is now an urgent need to amend the Community rules by introducing the principle of direct income support for producers, rather than for processing, i.e. adopting the system used for aid to the cereals sector, and thus by-passing the tangled web of a bureaucracy which is often parasitical and biased.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The 1999/2000 financial year for citrus fruits was characterised by a general drop in production prices in the EU, attributable to increased output. As far as southern Italy is concerned, alongside this general state of affairs, the consequences of adverse weather conditions throughout October and November 1999 must also be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>To these cyclical problems should be added the structural problems arising from the continuing deficits in production, marketing and processing structures.</p>
<p>Citrus fruit producers earn a living either by selling their produce on the fresh market or by selling it on to the processing industry. This necessitates bringing production into line with market requirements in terms of both quality and quantity.</p>
<p>The Commission is of the opinion that the introduction of a subsidy per hectare would be unsuitable as far as the Community’s citrus fruit sector is concerned. A subsidy of this sort does not promote the specific switching to different varieties which is necessary to be able to boost demand.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the difficulties, which have been experienced by sheep farmers in Ireland over recent months due mainly to an oversupply of lambs in the autumn of 1999. It is clear that in some Member States the market price may be below or above the Community average. The aim in having the same premium throughout the Community is to avoid distortions between producers, which could undermine the single market. For this reason the Commission does not favour a regionalisation of the premium.</p>
<p>Concerning extensification, the Commission is not convinced that the introduction of new premiums in the beef sector under the Agenda 2000 reforms will result in significant numbers of farmers leaving sheep production. Furthermore, to exclude the first 30 livestock units from extensification would undermine the effectiveness of the measure.</p>
<p>New Zealand has the possibility in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements to export sheepmeat to the Community at 0% duty within a quota. During the Uruguay negotiations the Community obtained an undertaking from New Zealand not to destabilise the Community market. The Commission monitors the imports closely to ensure that the quota is not exceeded and that New Zealand fulfils its commitments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0236"></a>

<p>A few years ago, people in the Netherlands were shocked to learn that there was a huge black market in fish there, with hundreds of thousands of guilders’ worth of revenue being lost through fraudulently concealed fish sales. Since then, it has been generally assumed that the Netherlands State authorities were strictly enforcing quotas and limits on fishing days. Recently, however, it has been rumoured that some Member States, including the Netherlands, are still evading quotas by means of ‘black’ and ‘grey’ markets. The figures quoted by the Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture apparently do not correspond to reality, inspections remain lax and the self-monitoring system introduced in the Netherlands is said to be ineffective. More specifically, boats (longer than 10 m) which no longer operate are included in lists submitted to the EU in order to increase the fish quota and the number of fishing days.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of these claims? Is it possible that such fraud may be taking place? To what extent does the Commission carry out checks in the Member States? How does the Commission inspect the national monitoring systems? Does it do so only by administrative means or also by means of visits on the spot?

<p>The Commission has, on many occasions since it presented its 1992 Report on the Implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, drawn to the attention of Parliament and the Council to weaknesses in the area of fisheries control. The last time it did so was in 1998 when it presented its Communication on Fisheries Monitoring under the Common Fishery Policy (CFP).</p>
<p>If the situation is not yet satisfactory in all cases, over the last eight years, the Commission has observed considerable progress on the improvement of control of fishing activities in many areas and notably an improvement in the efficiency of control of landings in several Member States. The Commission expects further significant progress in control notably as a consequence of the introduction of surveillance by satellite tracking of fishing vessels (VMS). Since 1 January 2000, all Community fishing vessels exceeding a length of 24 m overall are subject to this type of surveillance.</p>
<p>The Commission is fully aware of the fraud which took place about 10 years ago in the Netherlands. In fact, the fisheries inspectors of the Commission documented these practices and action has been taken against the Netherlands. Since 1992, these practices have ceased to exist.</p>
<p>The Commission fisheries inspectors verify on the spot the implementation of the CFP by the national authorities. They are, so to speak, the 'controllers of the controllers'.</p>
<p>The Commission checks on a sampling basis the consistency between trade figures and catch and landing data. On a routine basis the national authorities have the obligation to cross-check catch and landing data with sales notes and transport documents. Sales notes correspond to invoices as referred to in the Sixth Directive on VAT.</p>
<p>The Commission cannot usefully investigate allegations of the existence of 'black or grey' fish if it does not get reasonably concrete and verifiable information as to where, how, and when such practices are suspected to occur.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0165"></a>

<p>In order to promote Renewable Energy, the Commission is implementing the White Paper for a Community strategy and Action Plan: a progress report will be submitted to Parliament and the Council, probably in April 2000. In addition the Commission is implementing the Campaign for Take-Off. The Commission is also preparing a draft Directive on electricity from Renewables that will be sent to Parliament and the Council in April 2000. Also a communication on an Action Plan for Energy Efficiency will be transmitted to Parliament and the Council at the same time.</p>
<p>Concerning the ALTENER II and SAVE II Programmes the Commission will launch a call for proposals for each programme this year, with budgets doubled compared to last year. The 5th RTD Framework Programme includes in the ENERGIE sub-programme, two Key actions related with Renewable Energy Sources and Energy Efficiency. After the allocation of EUR 315 m to innovative ventures in 1999 (about two thirds of this amount rewarded to renewable and energy efficiency proposals), an additional call for proposals, with a budget of EUR 100 m, will be launched this year for these two energy sectors.</p>
<p>In the former Directorate-General (DG) for Energy, activities related to promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency were dealt with in one unit which was part of the former Directorate C, whereas the activities related to technology promotion was dealt with in the former Directorate D. In order to more effectively promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, these activities have now been regrouped in one Directorate with three Units specifically dealing with these matters and one Unit dealing with clean urban transport.</p>
<p>After the merger of the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport, the number of officials dealing specifically with energy and transport issues is as follows:</p>
<p>-	142 officials of categories A, B and C deal specifically with energy;</p>
<p>-	189 officials of categories A, B and C deal specifically with transport.</p>
<p>Moreover, approximately 200 officials are dealing with important horizontal tasks on energy and transport, including internal market issues, international cooperation, environmental protection, information, communication and dissemination of technological innovations, as well as Trans-European Networks. Because of the integrated approach to energy and transport issues it is not possible to specify the exact break-down between energy and transport for these officials.</p>
<p>According to a rough estimate, about 68 people were working on renewable energy and on energy efficiency in the former DG Energy. With staff now grouped in one single Directorate (New Energy and Demand Management) 28 people deal exclusively with energy efficiency, 25 with renewables and 11 on clean urban environment. Also on these issues, a significant number of officials in horizontal directorates have important tasks related to policy and technology promotion, for example with regard to environmental protection and dissemination of innovative technologies. In total therefore, Energy efficiency and Renewables have been strengthened in the new organisation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0167"></a>

<p>Inverness, the capital of the Scottish Highlands, lost its air connection to London Heathrow and to that airport's worldwide network in November 1997, with damaging economic and social consequences for this remote and fragile part of Europe, which at the same time was a beneficiary of Objective 1 funding. Should it not be a requirement that a certain percentage of slots at vital European hub airports should be reserved for regional connections of this type?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The current slot regulation gives the possibility to Member States to ensure that domestic scheduled air services have physical access to congested airports by reserving slots at such airports for routes that were already operated in 1993 when the Regulation entered into force or for routes where public service obligations have been imposed. Such obligations may be imposed according to the provisions of the Regulation on market access, where for particular regions it is economically vital to ensure that sufficient scheduled air services are provided where otherwise none or unsatisfactory air services would be operated.</p>
<p>In both cases it is the competence of Member States to examine the need for such services and reserve the appropriate slots. There is no limit in the slot Regulation for the amount of such reserved slots, which seems to give more flexibility than just opening the possibility for a certain percentage of slots.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to demonstrate that a public service obligation can be imposed on services from Inverness to Heathrow if another London airport, like Gatwick is already adequately served. Obviously, a service to Heathrow would be even more attractive, however, it would have to be examined whether such service is "vital for the economic development of the region" as the Regulation requires.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European air transport sector has great problems in terms of congestion and delays, leading to significant cost consequences and inconvenience for the airlines and the travelling public. The problems also have a negative impact on the environment and could affect safety. Several European states including Denmark, Germany, Holland, Italy, Spain and Sweden and some airlines have, with the sponsorship of the European Commission, been involved in the highly successful development of new European technologies that could help to solve those problems. The same technology has recently been adopted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) as mandatory equipment for ships at sea.</p>
<p>Mr K-H Neumeister, Secretary-General of the Association of European Airlines (AEA) in a letter to the Director-General of EuroControl, Mr Yves Lambers, has expressed serious concern about a possible reduction of resources and redirection of focus on the implementation of the technology referred to as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). AEA points to the successful development programmes conducted in cooperation with airlines such as Alitalia, Lufthansa and SAS on a technology called VDL Mode 4. A rapid implementation of this system could, according to AEA, 'contribute to solving the delay situation'.</p>

<p>The Commission agrees with the honourable Member that the implementation of Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) can contribute in the mid-term to solving the delay situation in Air Traffic Management. The Commission saw a high potential in the VHF (Very High Frequency) Data Link Mode-4 technology as an enabler of ADS-B, that is why it has supported its further development through both the research and trans-european transport network funds, with a total sum exceeding EUR 10 million.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the introduction of the new technologies, the Commission, in conjunction with experiments and pilot projects, is supporting standardisation of that technology in European Standardisation Organisations. It is being considered whether a standardisation mandate to cover formally the work undertaken in European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) is appropriate at this time.</p>
<p>Implementation of new technologies in air traffic management is a complex issue because it requires the definition of a new concept of operations and a greater degree of cooperation between the different actors.

<p>In the framework of the revision of the trans-European network's (TENs) guidelines, the Commission does not intend to propose radical changes to the maps, but rather to update them to reflect where planned links had now been completed and identifying bottlenecks. Of course, one of the objectives of the TENs is to ensure economic and social cohesion and the Commission will continue to support the development of infrastructure links to peripheral regions.</p>
<p>In terms of funding, the Commission will follow the priorities identified in the guidelines. In this context, it has to be noted that TENs budget line does not represent the only source of Community funding for infrastructure projects, and that many transport projects in peripheral regions receive significant Community financial support through the Cohesion Fund and Structural Funds.</p>
<p>The Commission will ensure that priority is given to the promotion of rail and maritime links. To this end, the Commission has followed and will continue to follow the limits set by Parliament in the notes to the Community yearly budget and now also included in the revised TENs financial regulation. This means that at least 55% of the TEN-T (transport) budget be allocated to rail projects (including combined transport). For maritime transport, the Commission is keen that the TEN-T be amended to include the key ports, and hopes that agreement on this proposal is reached shortly. These funds place particular emphasis on connections and interconnections with TEN-T where they need to be completed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The “Friob” study, to which the honourable Member referred in his question, was the result of the Commission’s obligation under Directive 81/670/EEC (Article 4(1)) to produce a comparative analysis of the requirements applied in each Member State for issuing pilots’ licences on an equal basis. This analysis, which was carried out in 1993, was intended to assist Member States in assessing the equivalence of licences issued by other Member States. It is not a legally binding document and hence, Member States can not use it to refuse to accept licences issued by other Member States. The Commission has not received, in the case in point, any complaints from Italian pilots whose licences would not be recognised on the basis of this analysis. </p>
<p>Directive 91/670/EEC still remains the only legal basis for the mutual recognition of pilots’ licences. In this respect, it must be noted that if the directive (Article 3(1)) obliges Member States to accept equivalent licences issued by other Member States, it further stipulates (Article 4 (3)) that should a host country have reasonable doubt as to the equivalence of a licence – particularly taking into account the aforementioned comparative analysis – then it can insist upon further requirements or additional tests before accepting it.

<p>All the Member States were to have implemented the 'electricity directive' in 1999 but not all have yet managed to do so. Denmark has taken the opportunity to carry out an overall reform of the electricity sector based on complete liberalisation of market access together with the introduction of quotas for CO2 emissions and quotas for renewable energy. Part of the Danish legislation is to be approved by the Commission, which has not yet been done. This means that the new quota system designed to reduce CO2 emissions cannot be introduced. It also means, however, that Danish windmill owners cannot obtain the price for their electricity that they were led to expect.</p>
<p>Will the Commission say when this matter is expected finally to be settled so that the EU is not blamed for putting bureaucratic obstacles in the way of a green liberalisation of the market in electricity?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission welcomes the Danish approach to liberalising the electricity market and to open up fully the Danish electricity market to competition. In principle, the Commission also welcomes the Danish quota system for CO2 emissions as a cost efficient approach towards reducing the CO2 emissions from the electricity sector.</p>
<p>However, the way in which the Danish Government has proposed to allocate CO2 emission quotas only to incumbent electricity producers (“grandfathering”) could unduly distort the functioning of the internal electricity market, and in particular the establishment of new generation capacity hence hampering the entrance of new players into the market.</p>
<p>The Commission has had a fruitful dialogue recently with the Danish authorities with a view to find a mutually satisfactory solution. On 17 February 2000, the Members of the Commission responsible for energy and transport on the one part and for competition matters on the other had meetings with the Danish Minister for Environment and Energy, Mr Auken, to discuss the Danish schemes and it is hoped and expected that a balanced solution will be found soon. The Danish authorities have given a commitment to the Commission to amend Danish legislation on CO2 quotas in case of an application to construct new power generation capacity in Denmark in order not to discriminate against new entrants.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Commission has adopted on 8 March a Green Paper on “Emissions Trading within the EC” setting out options and questions in relation to the trading of CO2 in a Community context, for consultation of all concerned.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of the support scheme for renewables for electricity generation in the form of a green certificate system, the Danish Government has decided to notify the part of the scheme which concerns new plants under a proposed new set of guidelines regarding state aid to environmental protection which the Commission hopes can enter into force in a matter of a few months following consultation of Member States this month. The Commission will decide on the other aspects of the notified scheme shortly.</p>
<p>More generally the Commission is working on a draft Directive aimed at promoting renewable sources of electricity production in the internal market for electricity. It intends to present a proposal for such a Directive at the next meeting of the Council of Energy Ministers on 30 May 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0230"></a>

<p>The Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that, according to the investigations carried out by the British Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the falsification of data occurred during a secondary manual diameter check of a subset of the mixed oxide fuel (MOX) pellets produced in the Sellafield MOX Demonstration Facility.</p>
<p>The investigations performed by the Commission have revealed that Commission competence is not involved in this case.</p>
<p>In particular, as far as Euratom safeguards is concerned, the falsifications do not have any consequences, since operators' declarations for safeguards purposes are based on pellet weights and not diameter measurements. The verifications performed by Euratom Safeguards do not indicate that these declarations have been incorrect nor that the relevant procedures - related to nuclear materials control - have not been followed.</p>
<p>There is also no indication that an infringement of basic Commission radiation protection standards defined in line with Chapter III (Health and Safety) of the Euratom Treaty has occurred in connection with the falsification of data.</p>
<p>Thus, stipulations in the Euratom Treaty have not been violated in this case. The Commission therefore has no intention in this instance to urge the British Government to refuse the granting of future licences to British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) to manufacture MOX fuel nor to issue the directives or sanction foreseen in Articles 38 or 83 of the Euratom Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The document relating to the costs of transition to competition (CTC) for Spanish companies is currently being reviewed in the context of the rules pertaining to state aid, which form an integral part of competition policy. When analysing the compatibility between state aid and the common market, the Commission should at all times ensure that the distortion of competition unavoidably created by the aid does not adversely affect trade to the extent that it goes against public interest. As for competition policy, its ultimate aim is to protect the end consumer.

<p>The Commission underlines that reconstruction in Kosovo is well underway. The Commission in fact began the first steps even before the conflict, carrying out a damage assessment in late 1998 the provisional results of which were presented in February 1999. The fact that this damage assessment already existed permitted a rapid update, once access to Kosovo was again possible in June 1999, and use it as a basis for the international community's reconstruction efforts in Kosovo.</p>
<p>In late June and early July 1999, the Commission sent a Task Force of officials to Pristina. This Task Force was intended as an interim measure until the Kosovo Reconstruction Agency could be established. As the honourable Member is aware, the establishment of the Agency took somewhat longer than foreseen, with files currently being transferred to the Agency which has finally replaced the Task Force. In a few short months, the Commission's Task Force succeeded in committing a total of EUR 127 m, over EUR 50 m of which was already contracted by the end of 1999. The Task Force has, in effect, shown what can be achieved when suitably flexible procedures are available, and it is hoped that the Agency will continue this success. As far as fair distribution of funding between nationalities is concerned, the priorities for funding are agreed with the UN Mission on the spot (UNMIK).</p>
<p>Apart from the implementation of Community assistance, the Commission is also involved in the wider international effort, working with the major international financial institutions and actors, having responsibility with the World Bank for donor coordination. The Commission is also fully involved in the work of the United Nations (UN) civil administration in Kosovo, where the Union has special responsibility for "pillar 4", dealing with economic reconstruction, recovery and development.</p>
<p>Full details of the assistance provided to Kosovo from the Community budget, by Member States and by other donors are available on the web-site of the Joint Office of the Commission and the World Bank: www.seerecon.org as well as full details of the two Kosovo Donors' Conferences which the Commission has organised, with the World Bank.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0140"></a>

<p>The Swiss Foreign Minister was certainly right in saying that there are several thousands of women being victims of trafficking in Europe each year. It is, however, by definition almost impossible to confirm an exact figure such as 300 000 since there is a lack of reliable statistics and data. The Commission recognises however that trafficking is a growing phenomenon and one striking feature is the increase in numbers of women trafficked into the Union coming from Central and Eastern European Countries.</p>
<p>The Union has since 1996 developed a wide policy in the fight against trafficking in women. Its objective is to involve all those responsible in the fight against this degrading and serious form of violation of human rights and dignity. Action is needed throughout the trafficking chain of recruiters, transporters, exploiters and clients. Preventive and repressive measures, as well as support to the victims, are taken and are essential. Because this phenomenon is world-wide, the Union is also actively engaged in international cooperation.</p>
<p>The Joint Action of February 1997, whereby the Member States agreed to review their criminal laws on trafficking, is part of the “acquis” which must taken on board by the candidate countries. Under the existing STOP Programme the involvement of partners from the candidate countries has also steadily increased over the years.</p>
<p>For the future the Commission, as indicated in its work programme 2000 is committed to present detailed proposals to approximate the penal provisions of the Member States as regards trafficking. When adopted, they will form a part of the “acquis” to be implemented also in the candidate countries. The Commission’s intention is to include the issue of temporary residence permits for victims who are ready to provide evidence in front of courts. In addition, the Commission will draft a proposal for the renewal of the STOP Programme, which will be opened up to the candidate countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0142"></a>

<p>The Commission has become increasingly concerned in general about the welfare of animals.</p>
<p>The Commission’s responsibilities towards animal protection have increased under the recent amendment of the Treaty. A Protocol to the EC Treaty on the welfare and protection of animals requires the European institutions and Member States to consider animal welfare a priority when drawing up agriculture, transport, single market and research policies.</p>
<p>Community legislation is drawn up on the basis of the results of scientific research and practical knowledge, both of which indicate that animal transport is feasible if specific conditions to protect animals are met.</p>
<p>Community animal welfare legislation is under revision in line with new scientific knowledge and practical experience in the field.</p>
<p>The scientific Committee on Animal welfare recently adopted a report on standards concerning temperature and humidity conditions in the transport of cattle, pigs, sheep and goats in vehicles for journeys over 8 hours. The report will serve as a basis for new legislative proposals by the Commission.</p>
<p>Concerning the experience of Member States derived from the application of Directive 91/628/EEC a specific report will be presented to the Council and to Parliament before June 2000. The report will include the data submitted by Member States and those derived from the inspections by the Food and Veterinary Office.</p>
<p>The Commission may consider amending current Community legislation on the basis of the conclusions of the above-mentioned report and following the recent opinion of the scientific committee on animal welfare.</p>
<p>Furthermore the Commission has started to negotiate the participation of the Community in the revised "European Convention for the protection of animals during international transport".

<p>There are plans to set up a gold-processing plant at sites where deposits have been discovered in the Perama hills and the municipalities of Sapes and Arriana on the boundaries of the prefectures of Rodopi and Evros in Thrace. The local population is anxious as there is a very serious risk of an environmental disaster in the region owing, among other things, to the use of cyaniding as a method of ore-extraction, which is considered to be extremely hazardous to the health of the inhabitants and to the environment. The concern is compounded by the fact that such disasters have occurred in areas where gold-processing plants are in operation, such as Olymbiada in Halkidiki where local protests, which began some years ago, are continuing in a bid to close down activities there, which, although environmentally devastating, are extremely profitable for the Canadian multinational company involved.</p>
<p>Will the Commission say whether the necessary environmental impact assessments have been carried out for the above project and, if not, what steps it will take to identify the environmental hazards involved?

<p>However, recent events in the Danube have highlighted the need to take account of the possible severe human and environmental consequences which could arise in the case of accidents. Therefore, following the recent cyanide spill into the Danube, the Member of the Commission in charge of Environment announced the extension of the ongoing Commission study on environmental hotspots in the mining industry to include the candidate countries.

<p>The Commission is aware of safety issues including the need for fire prevention. It is aware that effective fire prevention requires measures to be taken by the national or local authorities in all relevant areas such as building standards, requirements concerning the reactions and resistance to fire, fire exit arrangements, fire-fighting equipment (sprinklers) and public information. A coherent policy can therefore only be carried out at the appropriate national level.</p>
<p>Requirements regarding inflammable furniture are only one of the fire safety aspects. In the absence of harmonisation at Community level regarding these products, it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure the protection of health and safety of persons and property on the basis of national rules adopted to this end. In addition, under the provisions of the Treaty (Articles 28 to 30) the principle of mutual recognition of these products and testing and certification procedures makes it possible to avoid unjustified obstacles to trade.</p>
<p>In addition, the CEN (European Committee for Standardisation) has developed methods of testing inflammability of furniture. These standards must be used as a reference for the purposes of mutual recognition referred to above. Finally, the Commission has immediate plans to proposed amendments to the directive on the general safety of products when it will introduce the concept of ‘presumption of conformity’ in order to ensure a consistent and high level of consumer protection.

<p>A generalised call for proposals in the field of Democracy and Human Rights was launched on 17 June 1999 aimed at improving access to Community grants on a basis of transparency and equal access for non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The launching of the call for proposals was delayed, partly due to the adoption only in May 1999 by the Council and Parliament of the regulations which constitute the legal basis for financing actions in this field.</p>
<p>The proposals selected did not include several submitted by NGOs working in the field of torture victims which had previously enjoyed Community support. In an attempt to meet the needs of good projects which were not selected, 8 torture victim projects have been placed on the reserve list of the call for proposals in order to proceed with them as soon as funds become available under the 2000 budget. A further eight proposals have been earmarked as potential targeted projects within a global amount of some &#x80;million to be made available under the 2000 budget. The Commission is in touch with the organisations concerned.</p>
<p>The priority given in the Call for Proposals to projects over EUR 500 000 reflected the need to manage projects effectively with the resources available, and to reduce the delays which have occurred in this area. However, the priority given to larger projects was not, in itself, prejudicial to those concerning torture victims. Firstly, small projects were not excluded. The guidelines expressly stated that up to 30% of the total available for the call for proposals would go to proposals under EUR 500 000. Secondly, attaching priority to larger projects encouraged NGOs to cooperate in their requests for funds which several successfully did. Thirdly, many of the proposals presented were for sums exceeding EUR 500 000.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that many NGOs have faced uncertainty and lack of clarity over their funding. The Commission is making major efforts to address these problems. However, given the need to prioritise and to ensure sound financial management, it will always be the case not all requests for support in this area can be guaranteed funding.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0152"></a>

<p>The Greek Agriculture Minister recently announced government measures to limit the area of land devoted to cotton-growing throughout Greece. The measures rest on the legal basis of the EU concerning the protection of the environment from nitrate pollution and on the Commission’s proposals for a new regulation on cotton.

<p>Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources is non-specific in that it is not directed towards any particular livestock or crop sector but rather towards the protection of water. It sets down a series of steps, which must be taken when an area is deemed to be nitrate vulnerable, namely the obligatory respect of nitrate-related good practice together with the implementation of ad hoc action plans. These steps involve restrictions, which concern the use of nitrogen largely in so far as timing and application rates are concerned and appropriate crop rotations (including winter cover of the soil) in order to avoid nitrogen leaching and erosion.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently examining a draft action programme for nitrates in Thessaly, which envisages certain restrictions on nitrogen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should be recalled that now under Regulation (EC) n° 1257/99 for rural development Member States have to draw Codes of Good Agricultural Practices as a threshold beyond which agri-environmental measures will apply.</p>
<p>As for limitations on cotton growing, from the information available in the Commission, the recent decisions of the Greek Government seem to take into account the proposed reform of the Common Market Organisation for cotton, which is under discussion in the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission would like to remind the honourable Member that, pursuant to Article 255 (ex Article 191A) of the EC Treaty, the Council and the European Parliament’s proposal for a regulation on public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, adopted by the Commission on 26 January 2000, aims to establish general principles and restrictions for the rights of access to all institutional documents enjoyed by European citizens and all natural or legal persons resident, or based, in one of the Member States. </p>
<p>This legislative proposal is not in any way intended to govern interinstitutional relations between Parliament and the Commission. </p>
<p>The question of access by Parliament to Commission documents is currently the subject of negotiations with Parliament as part of broader negotiations with Parliament on the Framework Agreement (ex-Code of Conduct). Provisions on access to information also covering exceptions and confidential procedures are likely to be contained within the core of the Framework Agreement or in an annex with equivalent weight to the main Agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission for its part considers that the Agreement drawn up in March 1999 between Mr Oreja for the Commission and Mrs Theato and Mr de Giovanni for Parliament, but which was never approved by Parliament in plenary sitting, should form the basis for the negotiation. The Commission is awaiting a substantive reaction from Parliament.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Commission seeks to apply the spirit of that Agreement on an ad hoc basis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0154"></a>

However the regulation lays down that where on 1 January, a Member State has not banned, in accordance with Community law, one or more of those antibiotics, those antibiotics shall remain authorised until 30 June 1999. In most Member States the suspension entered into force only on 1 July 1999. Therefore for the majority of Member States it will be one year next 1 July 2000.</p>
<p>Concerning the quantities of antibiotics used, although records are be kept by the industry for official control purposes, an overall picture is not currently available to the Commission. This is why a programme to monitor the consumption of antimicrobial feed additives during the year 2000 has been set in agreement with the Member States. The results should be available by May 2001. The Commission is also considering a call for tender to assess the amounts of antibiotics used as veterinary drugs.</p>
<p>A surveillance system to monitor compliance with the law, already exists in Directive 70/524/EEC<a href="#defann_63_2" name="refann_63_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span> on feed additives and its implementation is Member States responsibility. The Commission recently asked the Member States to provide specific information on the ban on the four antibiotics in question and also in relation to other additives banned in recent years.</p>
<p>In addition pursuant to Directive 95/53/EC<a href="#defann_63_3" name="refann_63_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup">3</span> on controls in animal nutrition, the Member States shall provide the Commission with the result of the control activities carried out in animal nutrition during 1999 by 1 April 2000. The Directive requires also that the Commission shall prepare by October 2000 a summary on the situation with a recommendation for a coordinated control programme for next year.</p>
<p>In this framework the Commission will look with special attention to the controls carried out on feed additives and will put forward the relevant proposals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission Decision 1999/830/EC of 26 October 1999, on the national provisions notified by Denmark on the use of sulphites, nitrites and nitrates in foodstuffs, rejected the request for Danish national legislation to be maintained since this is not compatible with Directive 95/2/EC on food additives.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 95(4) of the EC Treaty, the Danish Government justified its request for a derogation based on the rules of free movement in the internal market considering that the provisions of Directive 95/2/EC, with regard to the three substances in question, represented a consumer health risks. </p>
<p>However, it could not be ascertained from the information presented by Denmark in support of its request that the request was justifiable or necessary for the protection of public health, and that no measure which would be less obstructive to trade could be allowed.

<p>In its Communication of 30 July 1996 setting out the new European Community Disability Strategy, the Commission made clear its commitment to a rights-based equal opportunities approach to disability.</p>
<p>Since then, the Commission has paid particular attention to the employment needs of people with disabilities. Guideline Nine of the National Action Plans for Employment says that Member States will give special attention to those needs and develop appropriate forms of both preventative and active policies to promote disabled people's integration into the labour market.</p>
<p>In November 1999, the Commission adopted proposals for an anti-discrimination package based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty which gives the Community new powers in this field. These proposals include a draft Directive to outlaw discrimination in employment on any of the grounds mentioned in Article 13, including disability.</p>
<p>However, until this package becomes law, the Commission is not in a position to intervene in the case mentioned by the Honourable Member.

<p>The euro is currently about 10% below its level of January 1999 on a trade-weighted basis. This decline mainly reflects movements in the bilateral exchange rates against the US dollar, sterling and the Japanese yen. While the euro depreciation is substantial, it has not reflected any disorderly behaviour in foreign exchange markets. Moreover, the depreciation in the euro is only 6.5% with respect to its level in May 1998 when the decision to launch the third stage of economic and monetary union (EMU) was taken.</p>
<p>The implications of the euro depreciation for output growth and inflation in the euro area are limited. This is because of the relatively closed nature of the euro-area economy. The share of external trade in euro-area GDP is about 16% - only moderately greater than the 12% share in the US economy. On the other hand, it cannot be complacent about the inflationary effect of recent exchange rate developments. Indeed, such considerations contributed to the European central bank's (ECB) decision to raise its main refinancing rate on 3 February.</p>
<p>The evolution in the euro exchange rate can be explained by two main factors.</p>
<p>The first is the unexpectedly robust performance in the US economy relative to that of the euro area.</p>
<p>The second is the unwinding of euro-denominated investments made in the months preceding the launch of EMU. At that time, enthusiasm for EMU was at a high point and markets were concerned about the implications of the Russian debt default for the US economy and financial system.</p>
<p>As economic growth rates in the US and euro-area converge in coming years, a significant appreciation in the euro is to be expected.</p>
<p>Finally, the historical link between the euro, the ECU and the US dollar is indeed complex. The euro was introduced at parity with the ECU on 1 January 1999 as provided in the Treaty. The honourable Member rightly recalls that the ECU, when created in 1978, was identical in value and composition to the European Unit of Account (EUA). This latter unit was introduced in 1975 for the purpose of expressing currency amounts in the Lomé agreement. The EUA was constituted in such a way that its value was equal, when it was created on 28 June 1974, to one Special Drawing Right (SDR). The value of the SDR was initially at parity with the USD.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0171"></a>

<p>On 12 January 2000 the EU’s Standing Veterinary Committee decided in principle to allow imports of reindeer meat from Russia. It has come to light that part of the cost of the on-the-spot inspection mission (including costs of organisation and interpreting) was borne by the same private party which had asked for imports of reindeer meat to be authorised. Given that there are clearly veterinary problems with reindeer meat from the Kola peninsula, that slaughter and hygiene are not monitored there, and that the same principles are not applied to them as in EU countries, the decision is very dubious.

<p>Prior to its accession to the Communities, Sweden imported reindeer meat from Russia. Under Community legislation this was no longer possible. At the repeated requests of the Swedish and Russian governments, an inspection team from the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission visited the Murmansk region of north western Russia in October 1998. Its purpose was to assess the structure, organisation and legal powers of the veterinary services in the field of animal and public health as well as the actual health situation on the ground in the region inspected.</p>
<p>The report of that mission was submitted to Parliament on 11 February 1999.</p>
<p>The inspection team comprised two Commission officials, and one official from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture. Severe difficulties were encountered during the organisation of this mission due to the very slow response from the central veterinary services in Russia. Furthermore, although two of the inspectors were fluent in Russian, it proved impossible to obtain official interpretation support for the third inspector. For these reasons, it was necessary to take exceptional measures, which fell outside normal Food and Veterinary Office practices, to ensure the successful performance and completion of the mission. To this end, the assistance of an interpreter for the third inspector, provided through the Swedish-owned exporting company, was accepted. In addition, the mission programme was finalised with the regional, rather than the central, official veterinary services, with assistance from the Swedish exporting company. A director of that company travelled with the team to assist with travel arrangements but did not actively participate in the mission or in the evaluation of the findings by the mission team. The performance of the mission and the reporting of its findings, conclusions and recommendations were in no way prejudiced by this arrangement. All travel and accommodation arrangements were made fully in accordance with Commission rules and were paid for directly by the inspection team.</p>
<p>The mission inspected all aspects of reindeer meat production, including disease monitoring and meat handling, and found that the veterinary controls and health situation in the region inspected were largely acceptable, subject to the receipt of satisfactory assurances from the Russian authorities, which were forthcoming. The mission also found that the Murmansk region was practically self-contained and sufficiently isolated from other regions of Russia, with good regional veterinary services and animal health situation. The mission did not investigate quality issues as these fall outside the scope of a veterinary inspection.</p>
<p>On 12 January 2000 the Commission presented draft proposals to the Standing Veterinary Committee which had the effect of permitting the import of reindeer meat from the Murmansk region of Russia inspected by the Commission. The Member States gave a unanimously positive opinion on this proposal. The draft proposal has now been approved by the Commission and was published as Commission Decisions 2000/160/EC and 2000/161/EC in the Official Journal L51 of 24 February 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0181"></a>

<p>A centrepiece of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey, launched at the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999, is the Accession Partnership (AP) to be prepared by the Commission before adoption by the Council. The aim of this AP is mainly to set out priorities to be implemented by Turkey in all the fields of the Copenhagen criteria (including the political field) with a view to Union membership. In parallel, Turkey, as the other candidate countries, will have to decide on a National Programme for the adoption of the acquis (NPAA), which sets out the way in which the priorities of the AP will be implemented in terms of a precise timetable, human and financial resources. The first AP and NPAA will be adopted before the end of this year.</p>
<p>As Turkey does not fulfil for the moment the political Copenhagen criteria, it is clear that the AP/NPAA will have to cover this field substantially. As far as the AP is concerned, the main basis for the definition of short or medium-term priorities will be the last regular reports on Turkey provided by the Commission. The 1999 regular report identifies main shortcomings and deficiencies in the political field, notably concerning the issue of the protection of minorities. The Commission is currently working on how the AP could better cover this issue.</p>
<p>On all questions to be covered in the AP, the Turkish authorities will be consulted at the appropriate moment in order to be able to reflect the AP priorities in the NPAA they have to prepare.</p>
<p>As far as the Kurdish issue is concerned, the Commission continues to support a civil solution to the situation that prevails in the south-eastern part of the country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0184"></a>

<p>The Commission’s responsibilities towards animal protection have increased under the recent amendment of the Treaty.

<p>Article 6 of Council Directive 91/630/EEC laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs provides for the possibility to prepare appropriate proposals to improve the welfare conditions of farmed pigs in the Community on the basis of a specific report from the scientific veterinary committee on animal welfare.</p>

<p>The Commission will submit a proposal to amend the present legislation based on these recommendations and practical experiences of the Member States before September 2000.</p>
<p>The draft Commission proposal, which is under preparation, will envisage in particular provisions for the keeping of sows in groups and establishing separate areas for the performance of their normal behaviour patterns.

<p>First of all the Commission would like to explain the legislative framework of checks and controls of products of animal origin made in the Community. Member States apply the provisions of Directive 89/662/EEC concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade. With the completion of the internal market in 1992, checks are made at the place of production of goods according to the rules laid down in Community veterinary legislation. At the place of destination, the authority may check the goods by means of non-discriminatory spot-checks to verify compliance with the checks at origin. These rules should ensure that health is protected.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned Directive also lays down the rules for procedures to be followed if the Member State of destination considers the control measures at origin inadequate. As a first step, the two Member States together seek ways of remedying the situation. In cases of repeated irregularities, the Member State of destination shall inform the Commission and the veterinary department of the other Member States.</p>
<p>In the case of Sweden, specific rules apply as regards salmonella, which were agreed in the context of the Act of adhesion. Primarily, the consignments of fresh poultry, beef, veal and pig meat shall be tested for salmonella at the establishment of origin and the results must be negative. The results of the testing shall be available in the documents following the consignment.</p>
<p>In the case referred to in the question of the honourable Member, the Swedish and French authorities have been in contact in accordance with Directive 89/662/EEC. Since no further events have occurred, the Commission has not deemed it necessary at this stage to take further action.</p>
<p>Finally, no Member State, including Sweden, has made a request to change the provisions concerning the so-called salmonella guarantees. Should that happen, however, the Commission would naturally study the initiative, and prepare necessary proposals, if the request is deemed appropriate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0197"></a>

<p>What action does the Commission propose to take to encourage banks and other credit card issuers to start offering 'chargeback' services to help consumers feel more confident about buying on-line?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The question concerns payments by card in the context of electronic commerce. The honourable Member suggests the development of chargeback mechanisms to enhance consumer confidence. The Commission shares this idea.</p>
<p>The term chargebacks covers facilities offered to consumers who paid for goods or services with a payment instrument (usually a card) to dispute certain or all aspects of the transaction through the issuer of the payment instrument. These facilities are diverse, complex and differ from Member State to Member State. Essentially they are based on the idea that the contract for the purchase of goods and services and the payment form an economic or legal unit.</p>
<p>Experience in the United States, where extensive chargeback rights and services are available to consumers, shows the very positive effects chargebacks have had for consumer confidence in distance selling and more recently electronic commerce. According to the American authorities chargeback rights and services have also contributed significantly to the growth of the payment card sector itself.</p>
<p>In the Community the picture is rather complex. For payments within a Member State, national rules apply. For cross-border payments the international card associations have systems in place. But these systems are voluntary and their use varies from Member State to Member State. Consumers tend to be little aware of these systems.</p>
<p>This is an unsatisfactory situation. Attempts to come to more coordination have been made. The Organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) Committee on Consumer Policy has had for a number of years a working group on the issue. In December 1999, the OECD adopted guidelines on consumer protection in electronic commerce. They highlight the importance of chargebacks as a powerful tool to enhance consumer confidence and state that they should be further developed and their use should become more widespread.</p>
<p>At Community level a number of legal provisions already exist that relate to chargebacks.</p>
<p>Article 11of the consumer credit Directive (87/102) provides that the consumer who has paid for goods or services by means of credit can, under certain circumstances, exercise claims against the grantor of the credit, where he is unable to exercise his claims against the seller of the goods or services. The Commission is currently preparing a revision of this Directive. The Commission intents to submit a formal proposal before the end of this year.</p>
<p>Article 8 of Directive 97/7 on distance selling provides that the consumer can ask for cancellation of a payment where fraudulent use has been made of his payment card in connection with distance contracts, and be recredited with the sums paid. The proposed Directive on distance selling of financial services contains identical provisions.</p>
<p>Also Commission Recommendation 97/489 on transactions by electronic payment instruments is relevant. It contains provisions on liability in case of unauthorised transactions. The Commission is studying the degree of implementation of this Recommendation. Should the Commission encounters problems with this, it will present a proposal for a Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the lack of consumer confidence in on-line payments is a major barrier to the development of electronic commerce. That is why it intends to elaborate further on this issue in the context of overall strategy on electronic commerce.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0224"></a>

All the Bavarian NUTS III areas adjacent to the land borders of the Community will be eligible for cross-border cooperation under INTERREG III, which is soon to be adopted by the Commission and which will last until the end of 2006.

It is up to Germany to decide on the domestic allocation, per border and per programme, of its total allocation for Interreg (EUR 737 million for 2000-2006). As regards the Czech Republic, the PHARE-CBC sums earmarked for the border with German (Bavaria and Saxony) come to EUR 30 million for 2000-2002. </p>
<p>As regards the joint programming, a document entitled ‘joint document for cross-border cooperation’ covering the borders between Germany and the Czech Republic is being drawn up.

<p>As far as the origin marking for products marketed in the Community is concerned, there exists no marking system at Community level. Member States legislation applies in this field. In the particular case of ceramics, the Commission will consequently not propose any specific legislation on origin marking.</p>
<p>The Community is currently involved in the international harmonisation of non-preferential rules of origin. In this context, the World trade organisation (WTO) Agreement on Rules of Origin stipulates that, if marking systems are based on the origin concept, then harmonised origin rules should apply. The origin rule supported by the Community at the WTO negotiations is that the country of origin of ceramic products should be the country where the firing of the products took place (origin rule currently applied in the Community). Consequently, depending on the production costs, such process might not always represent 90% of the value of the finished article.</p>

<p>The Commission shares entirely the concern of the honourable Member – setting up an enterprise in Europe is often too cumbersome and time-consuming.</p>
<p>However, the time it takes to set up a business varies widely across the Community. It takes in average more time in the Community than in the United States (US), but there has been progress in some Member States. Further, time to set up an enterprise is not the only important factor affecting entrepreneurs. The main difference between the Community and US is the lack of a dynamic enterprise culture in Europe. Other reasons are the complexity of procedures, lack of seed and venture capital, higher costs, slowness in Internet take-up and e-commerce, and often the lack of second chance after a bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Commission has shown in its BEST Report<a href="#defann_79_1" name="refann_79_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> all aspects impacting on entrepreneurship and enterprise. One priority is the simplification of the formalities involved in business start-up as a priority. That is why, while recognising that this is primarily a matter for national governments, the Commission has encouraged Member States to address this problem and has supported their efforts to find simpler and better solutions. Other areas are education and training, access to finance and better public administration.</p>
<p>The BEST Report calls on Member States to facilitate the creation of enterprises. Under the follow-up<a href="#defann_79_2" name="refann_79_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span> to this report, the Commission is monitoring and evaluating progress made by the Member States. It is also sharing information about good practices. The Commission will report on the follow-up later this year.</p>
<p>Further, under its Concerted Actions<a href="#defann_79_3" name="refann_79_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup">3</span>, the Commission assists Member States in exchanging good practices. A good example is the French Centres de formalités d’entreprises, which have greatly simplified procedures for start-ups. Moreover, there is encouraging evidence of Member States learning from each other's experience. Thus the Portuguese Centro de Formalidades das Empresas network, which has reduced normal start-up times for businesses from around six months to around fifteen days, exploited the French experience.</p>
<p>Benchmarking is an important tool to show differences and progress. The Commission will continue benchmarking between Member States and vis-à-vis Japan and the US in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Promoting the take up of e-commerce amongst small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is a priority of the e-Europe initiative adopted by the Commission in December 1999. Action 3, "Accelerating e-commerce", insists that Europe needs to accelerate the growth of e-commerce, especially for SMEs, so that they can consider the whole European market as their market. This requires a reliable Internal Market legal framework for e-commerce, which provides legal certainty, removes barriers to cross-border services, encourages on-line innovation and consumer trust. To this end, a number of legal initiatives are under way at Community level. Their adoption by the end of 2000 and rapid transposition to national laws is a Commission priority, as is expressed in the Commission’s contribution “An Agenda of economic and social renewal for Europe” to the special European Council in Lisbon. In addition, e-Europe proposes the launch by Member States and the Commission of a campaign to help SMEs “go digital” by facilitating the transfer of technical know-how through traineeships and a network of centres of expertise. The said campaign should also be launched by the end of 2000.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of concrete actions have also been launched recently to help SMEs to access the electronic market. Typical examples are the WEBTRADER scheme which aims at putting in place an on-line certification and arbitration programme for enterprises in 7 Member States (Alternative Dispute Resolution-ADR scheme), the EUROECOM project to promote the start up of pan-European projects in the area of electronic commerce in several regions, the IECOMM project (international electronic commerce for SMEs) which aims at fostering of international electronic commerce within SMEs through an on-line service, the TECHSPHERE project setting up an Internet based network for various services addressed to SMEs. The SCREEN (Small and Craft Enterprises Electronic Networking) is another example (http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg23/craft/craft-screen/craft-screen.html). It works through a consortia of regional business support organisations and involves enterprises testing existing on-line support services for E-commerce and exchanging information at European level on successful small businesses involved in E-commerce.</p>
<p>Furthermore, electronic commerce standardisation and in general consensus building initiatives have been launched in close cooperation with European standardisation organisations to promote open electronic marketplaces in several industrial sectors and, after a targeted awareness campaign, attract interested parties including SMEs, through their European associations, to come to industry agreements, codes of conduct etc. in the form of European committee for standardisation (CEN) Workshop Agreements or open specifications representing a self-regulatory scheme (ECOM-IS: Electronic Commerce Open Marketplace in Industry Sectors) (</p>
<p>The Commission recognises the crucial importance of consumer confidence for E-commerce, in particular for SMEs. Unless consumer confidence is broad-based, large companies will dominate the market. The Commission is working on an initiative in the context of e-Europe to promote consumer confidence.</p>
<p>This year, "The School of Tomorrow" is a key issue addressed within the IST (Information Society and Technologies) Programme. The new Minerva action of the Socrates Programme, devoted to the critical and responsible use of new technologies in education is addressing this issue strategically from an educational, pedagogical and organisational perspective. The Comenius action for schools will also contribute to the launch of collaborative projects, thematic networks and the dissemination of best practices in this field. These actions will contribute to the implementation of e-Europe in particular making sure that by the end of 2003 all pupils should be “digitally literate ” by the time they leave school. In cooperation with the Member States the initiative eLearning will be adopted by the Commission in order to ensure that the e-Europe targets are reached and to promote the widespread introduction of innovation in education. It will be presented to the Council of Education Ministers on June 8, 2000. The e-Europe initiative also sets the target that all schools in Europe should be connected to Internet by 2001.</p>
<p>The European Schoolnet (http://www.eun.org) initiative brings together 20 Ministries of Education, national school administrations and school networks in cooperation with the Commission. Its objectives are to foster and support school cooperation in Europe, to provide high quality pedagogical and information services on the Internet with a European added value, to support the professional development of teachers and to provide a framework for cooperation between the Commission and the Member States. A major conference "Learning in the New Millennium. Building New Education Strategies for Schools" will take place on March 20-21, 2000 in Brussels in partnership with the ICT industry.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Netd@ys Europe (http://www.netdays2000.org) initiative is aiming to raise awareness in schools and elsewhere of the potential value of using the Internet, as a teaching and learning resource. It is now in its fourth year and is the largest event of its kind in the world. Taking place this year on November 20-27 it will, amongst other things, aim to reduce barriers to learning ensuring equality of access for people of all ages, including those who live in disadvantaged and isolated areas and those with special needs.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0234"></a>

Moreover, the relevant decisions have been taken without any dialogue or negotiations with trade unions and European works councils.

For the purpose of the Directive, project means the execution of construction works or of other installations or schemes or other interventions in the natural surrounding.</p>
<p>For projects falling within Annex II of the Directive Member States have to ensure that an environmental assessment is carried out where they consider that the projects will be likely to have a significant environmental effect (Articles 2(1) and 4(2)). The developments identified in the Crowe Report would presumably fall under category 10(b) of Annex II, urban development projects. In determining whether an Environmental Impact Assessment would be required for the entire planned venture rather than for separate and specific site developments, it is necessary to consider whether the entire venture would constitute one single project for the purpose of the EIA Directive. According to the information in our possession, this would not be the case. In this respect, it should be noted, however, that the Directive requires to evaluate in the environmental assessment process the cumulative effects (where they are significant) of individual projects on the environment.</p>
<p>According to the Commission's information, the Crowe Report does not constitute an application for development consent for a project. In that context it would not appear that the adoption of the Crowe Report requires an Environmental Impact Assessment.</p>
<p>As far as plans/programmes are concerned, the future Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive will expand the principle of Environmental Assessment to the planning level.

According to data compiled by the Commission itself, in the last eight years since the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty and with the broadening of the criteria for convergence and the Stability Pact, we have been witnessing a stabilisation of monetary conditions, a growth in GDP and in productivity per man-hour, but at the same time there is a worrying increase in unemployment, labour deregulation, insecure jobs and social exclusion, combined with a reduction in social security benefits.</p>
<p>In view of these contradictory developments, with positive economic figures and negative unemployment figures, does the Commission not consider that the criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability Pact should be revised?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The employment situation has improved considerably in recent years, with the average unemployment rate in the 15 Member States at its lowest level since 1992.</p>
<p>This is partly due to the framework of macroeconomic stability that has been established with Economic and Monetary Union. It is also partly due to policies to improve the functioning of labour markets that Member States have pursued. These policies go beyond deregulation of labour markets to embrace a comprehensive approach, including in particular a shift from passive measures to active measures aimed at improving employability.</p>
<p>More active employment policies and reforms in labour markets - in line with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines - have given rise to improved labour market performance. In particular, through a comprehensive, preventive approach to employment policies and through contributing to a progressive shift from passive spending to active spending measures, as mandated by the Florence European Council in 1996.</p>
<p>However, unemployment, much of it structural and long-term, remains unacceptably high, and is the prime cause of social exclusion in the Community. Therefore, one of the Commission's proposals for the Lisbon European Council is that Member States commit themselves to a return to full employment. The main policy strands for achieving this should be the pursuit of economic reforms and the strengthening of the European social model through investing in people.</p>
<p>The Convergence Programmes and the Stability and Growth Pact have played and will continue to play a crucial role in establishing a stable macroeconomic environment, which is a necessary condition for achieving sustainable growth and employment. Therefore the Commission does not consider that the convergence criteria or the Stability and Growth Pact should be revised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
