<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miloslav Ransdorf (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(CS)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor on the issue of nanotechnology with some trepidation, because we have seen that the original plans in this area, from the point of view of the budget, have not been fulfilled. We have seen expenditure cut by 38%, and, even though in the last framework plan there was a substantial increase from EUR 140 million per year to EUR 600 million, this figure still falls short of what we would have wanted, especially given the EU’s dynamism in this area. We are still in a great position in the area of fundamental research and publication – the EU is ahead of the United States in the field. As regards patents, however, the United States’ worldwide share is 42%, whereas the EU stands at 36%. We have also seen that when it comes to getting products onto the market, the EU works more slowly. US federal expenditure is approximately equivalent to that of the whole of the EU in the area of nanotechnologies and nanosciences, and the individual Member States have unequal spending levels. In fact, only Ireland spends more per head of the population than the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to stress the fact that opinion polls carried out in 2001, based on a sample of 16 000 people, showed that very few people in the EU are informed about nanotechnologies. In this regard, I should like to quote two great scholars. The first is Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In Faust, Mephisto says: ‘Despise reason and science, and you are mine, all mine’. I do not wish to take the same position as Mephisto, but, in any event, I should warn against cutting spending in this area in comparison with other countries. The other great scholar I wish to quote – and I hope this makes him happy, even though he is not here today – is Günter Verheugen, who last week listed the ten priorities for the Union in this area, one of which is of course preparation of staff, that is to say, investing in educating the public so that it is ready for the new technologies. We cannot move forward without such change, because public opinion in the EU is often not in favour of these technologies. Some safety issues are of course exaggerated, for example, some proposed amendments tabled to this report by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. Amendments 3 and 6, for example would mean the virtual collapse of a whole framework of progress in research into nanosciences and nanotechnologies in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme. It is unacceptable that an entire complex research programme should be dismantled on the grounds that there can only be investment in areas where there will be no exposure for people and the environment. I believe that the European public, the European citizens, should be given safety guarantees, but it is not possible for us to wipe out an entire complex research plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say that it is vitally important to emphasise the social aspect of nanotechnologies. They represent a huge opportunity for creating new jobs, for increasing investment in people, and for strengthening the whole area of medicine and health science. In this regard, nanotechnologies represent a huge opportunity. They are comparable in scope with microelectronics in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. Just like microelectronics, nanotechnologies permeate every area of people’s lives. They have major implications in the field of energy, for example, in terms of the possibilities of new lighter, more reliable and more robust materials. The possibility also opens up of building transport equipment that will use less energy. Demand for materials and energy can be cut substantially by means of using nanotechnologies. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the challenge that we have to meet head on if we are to guarantee that the European Community remains competitive on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, these are my introductory remarks and I look forward to the debate. I should like to thank Mr Potočnik and Mr Verheugen of the Commission, the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, and Mr Renzo Tomellini, head of the nanosciences and nanotechnologies unit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janez Potočnik, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span><span class="bold">. </span> Mr President, I am here today to talk about the big issue of small technologies. Over 2000 years ago, the ancient Greek politician Demosthenes said: ‘Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises.’ I believe he was right. And I mean enterprise in every sense of the word – not just as a business, but as a project and a voyage of discovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Nanotechnology has already shown that it holds a lot of promise. It not only offers new solutions to many current problems, but also opens up new innovation opportunities, boosting the economy and creating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Nanotechnology is already making a difference in many areas. For example, new medical treatments are being developed for severe diseases such as brain tumours and Alzheimer’s disease; it is helping the environment through more efficient catalysts, better batteries and more efficient light sources; and smaller, lighter and better-performing materials, components and systems are being created. But nanotechnology could also make a huge contribution to major global challenges such as how to tackle threats to the environment, how to make better use of resources and create less waste, and how to improve energy generation technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is in a leading position in the world today, partly thanks to the Commission’s framework programme. European industry should now reap the benefits of that knowledge through innovative products and processes. But to follow through, we need to take action on several fronts, which are outlined in the Commission’s communication Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies: An Action Plan for Europe 2005-09. These include the need to increase investment, boost interdisciplinarity, create necessary infrastructures, expand human resources and foster innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Much progress has already been made in implementing the action plan: Commission funding for research in nanosciences and nanotechnologies has steadily increased to about EUR 470 million in 2005. In fact, the Commission has now become the world’s largest single public funding agency for nanotechnology. It accounted for 30% of public funding of nanotechnology research in the European Union last year. Significant funding increases are expected over the duration of the Seventh Framework Programme. The Commission has proposed expanding funding for nanotechnology, with a new emphasis on developing infrastructures and projects assessing the risk of nanotechnology for humans and the environment. That is a key area, because, as well as the benefits, we must also recognise the potential risks. These must be carefully assessed. Some concerns have already been raised about new applications.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan addresses these too. Special projects and publicity in many languages will provide information and communication. There are projects to engage the public – presenting both sides of the argument; brochures explaining how nanotechnology works; and even DVDs explaining the issues in simple terms for children. In addition, the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies is working on an opinion on the ethics of nanomedicine, which we expect to be delivered to President Barroso soon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed to ensuring a balanced approach. What is fundamental is to have a high level of public health, safety, environmental and consumer protection. To do that, in Europe we need to identify the safety concerns, collect data for a health and environmental impact assessment of the product, and act at the earliest possible stage through adjustments, where necessary, of risk assessment procedures for nanotechnology.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also looking at the European legislation applicable to nanotechnology. We are assessing how adequate and appropriate that legislation is to deal with the increasing use of nanotechnologies. We also need to consider potential regulatory issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we are active in many international fora, addressing new issues and seeking to develop a code of good conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very happy to note that the European Parliament, through the report of Mr Ransdorf, fully recognises the important role to be played by nanosciences and nanotechnologies and welcomes the Commission’s action plan. I find it very positive that the report calls for increased public investment in related research and development, particularly in developing relevant infrastructures and nanomedicine. It is equally important that it stresses the importance of creating the right climate for innovation in Europe as well as emphasising the importance of ‘speaking with one voice’ internationally in this highly promising research area. I am very happy to note that the report has enjoyed a very large measure of support from the three parliamentary committees that have discussed it.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I hope I have given you a brief outline of the Commission’s balanced and growing nanosciences and nanotechnologies policy. Together, we can all benefit from that exciting new enterprise. I thank the European Parliament for its support so far and hope you will continue to support the Commission in further developing the European dimension of nanoscience and research. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear that nanosciences and nanotechnologies represent one of the fastest-growing industries of the 21st century. Nanotechnology has the potential to have an impact on a number of industries and it has a predicted market of nearly one trillion euros within a decade.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Europe has been slow to realise this potential and thus holds a small market share in research and development and education and, as a result, industrial innovation in this field. It is imperative that the EU adopt this plan to support nanoscience development, education and vocation within the Member States. Furthermore, an emphasis on nanoscience and nanotechnology is critical to reaching the goals set by the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report, I should like to highlight a few goals that have been incorporated and identify an important point that unfortunately has not been addressed adequately. Firstly, nanoscience and nanotechnology is permeated with ethical issues. As such, I am pleased that the report has included our committee’s suggestion to maintain high ethical principles and has welcomed public reviews on non-therapeutic human enhancement and privacy. In addition, I support the Commission’s proposal to respond to the dynamic nature needed for proper regulation in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the proposal has a strong emphasis on patents. Reform, as well as global incorporation of the patent system for nanoscience and nanotechnology within the Member States, is crucial to Europe’s success in this field. Reform must include a decrease in cost for the patent process, as well as an increase in accessibility of patents for SMEs. Furthermore, to promote global compliance with patent recognition and protection, we should emphasise the importance of fulfilling WTO regulations, especially in China.</p>
<p class="contents">However, protection of intellectual property rights, both internationally and within Europe, has not been developed sufficiently in the report. Member States are called upon to coordinate actions regarding IPR and act within OECD and UNESCO. This is too weak to protect IPR in this field. These organisations deal more with promoting good practices than with ensuring action. Thus, real standards could prove more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">With strong growth projected in the field of nanosciences and nanotechnology, it is important that the EU accept the Commission proposal to adopt new approaches to this industry, from education to R&amp;D. Such actions will contribute to heightened competitiveness and development in our Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to affirm my Group’s general support for his report and for the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Nanosciences and nanotechnologies are very important for the future of the economy and society. They hold huge promise for industrial and other applications. It is a very exciting technology in all sorts of areas. As a measure of the priority we are giving to nanosciences and nanotechnologies in Europe, I note that this topic is a significant theme in the Seventh Framework Programme. I welcome this action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I wish to enter a note of regret at the rather negative and fearful approach characterised in the Verts/ALE Group’s amendments. It is a pity to react against imagined risks, merely because they are in something that is so small as to be difficult to identify, or even, dare I say, to understand. Or perhaps that just applies to simple souls like myself. I would urge caution, therefore, on the requirements for labelling in advance of scientific evidence and on applying the precautionary principle. If we always applied this principle, then innovation, invention and inquiry would all go out the window and we would make no progress at all.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to enter a reserve on the issue of whether nanoparticles should be included in REACH. Let us be quite clear that many known particles are part of existing chemical stock and should therefore be treated under that category. We have enough problems with REACH without adding to them on a very small level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I shall end on a note of optimism and remind colleagues of the old saying ‘out of little acorns grow huge oaks’. I hope my party at home is listening to that remark. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nanotechnology is based on this research. It is a particularly promising area of technology and represents a potentially positive trend that may dramatically increase the likelihood of progress in many areas of our lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst others, the automotive and aviation industries could benefit. One of these benefits could be the manufacture of smooth abrasion-proof coatings containing nano particles. There could also be benefits for our health, in the form of medicinal products or cosmetics. In addition, there may be useful spin-offs for the energy sector, in the form of fuel cells or nano-porous hydrogen absorbers and efficient solar batteries. I could also mention ICT technologies exploiting optical and spin states that facilitate further compression of information to be read with blue lasers, and to biotechnology, including DNA research and bioinformatic systems. To these examples one could add sensory or construction materials such as nano-composites or fibres and fabrics whose surfaces are activated by electron compounds. At the same time, unfortunately, permanent damage to the environment may be caused, and the atmosphere may be polluted by the long term presence of aerosol gases that are difficult to monitor.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two kinds of nanotechnology. The first is known as ‘top down’ technology. Amongst other things it involves the transition from the macro to the nano state, for instance by the grinding of powders, and the development and activation of their surfaces through increased potential. Nano-diamond coating materials are one example of such technology. The second group is known as ‘bottom up’ technology and allows the molecular level to be set. The creation of highly integrated spintronic devices is one example of this. Unfortunately, we have few technologies available that use tunnel microscopy or self-organising phenomena. Biological information systems form part of this group.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, it should be stated that scienctific policy in the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology should first take account of the fact that, as it stands, the development of ‘top down’ technology in the European Union allows for the creation of at least a few and perhaps more than a dozen technological platforms. Secondly, ‘bottom up’ technology requires further intensive cutting edge research in the area of basic science. And thirdly, a method of researching current pollution levels should be devised as a mater of urgency. I am referring to the current pollution of the atmosphere with nano particles that is not a result of nano technology. This is something more than PM 2.5, which passes easily into our bodies through cell membranes and whose catalytic action can be harmful to health. Who knows, perhaps the cancer epidemic may be linked to the permanent presence of nano-aerosols in our environment. It is a presence that is difficult to define, may be growing and has a range of sources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We Europeans have to be aware of the fact that we will not remain leaders in a range of markets and technologies for ever, and that there are many markets in which we have already lost it, and along with it the power to control many technologies; one thinks of the pharmaceutical industry, more and more of which is moving away from Europe, and microelectronics, a sphere in which more and more of the discoveries are being made in Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, in nanotechnology, we Europeans are ahead of the world and are, technologically speaking, the tops, this has to be qualified by saying that we focus not only on the technology, but also on people, and that is a characteristically European approach, one that is brought out in this report – at any rate in the form in which it was adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. That is the form in which it must remain. The report in its present form strikes a balance between high-tech and the bounds of ethics as well as between industrial policy and the interests of the consumer, both of which are equally important and must be balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to stay ahead, real support must be forthcoming from the European Union, and that can be done not only through the Seventh Framework Programme for Research but also – and this is at least equally important – through standardisation and the application of norms. What is needed for global competition is a globally binding framework, and this is where we can do as we did with GSM technology, where we Europeans were active in moving the process forward and achieved a certain position on the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">The big problem with the whole nano-debate, though, is that the subject is too abstract; people have no conception of what it is about, and so, once more, the door is wide open to those who make it their business to spread fear throughout Europe, whose attitudes are reflected in a number of amendments tabled here, just as they were when we were considering software patents, and also, to some degree, with REACH. We cannot afford the same thing with nanotechnology, to which the scaremongers in the fear industry are becoming the principal obstacles. What we need at the moment, though, is every job we can get; it is because we must not blow out of the water the Lisbon Strategy that is on our lips every day that we have to make nanotech more real to people. Nanotechnology is already creating jobs; I myself have visited firms working in this field and find it utterly fascinating. There is enormous scope available in the semiconductor industry, in the automobile sector and in medical technology. By all means, let us have risk assessments, but let us not go overboard about them.</p>
<p class="contents">Can anyone among you confirm to me that they do not use a mobile phone in view of the known risks involved? If consumers see the potential gain as greater than the potential damage, then they will use the technology; that is what is absolutely crucial, and that is why people need to be able to have the information on the basis of which they can come to their own decisions. We in the European Parliament are playing our part in ensuring that they get it. STOA, this House’s Committee for scientific technology options assessment, is organising nano-cafés, which are happening in Brussels on 18 October, and you are all warmly invited. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Otherwise, we will never have the consumer confidence needed, we will not be able to take advantage of the great potential benefits of this technology, and investments will have been squandered.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who spurn precaution are not friends of nanotechnology. Quite the opposite. At the moment, we are stepping on the gas of nanotechnology without first ensuring that we have emergency brakes or even knowing whether the steering is working.</p>
<p class="contents">Nanoparticles are being used widely in sensitive consumer products such as cosmetics, detergents, paints and textiles. Our worry is that we may be paving the way towards a great health scandal in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">These fears are not without foundation. The European scientific committee has stated, and points out in its opinion of 28 and 29 September of last year, that there are significant gaps in the knowledge required to assess the risks, for example with regard to the definition of nanoparticles, their detection and measuring, data, doses, responses, evolution, the persistence of nanoparticles in human beings and in the environment and all aspects of environmental toxicology. That same committee stresses that we do not even have methods for evaluating the risks.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about elements that have a very different value. The main problem is that the uncontrolled release of nanoparticles may be considerably more dangerous than that of conventional particles, because nanoparticles are much more chemically reactive and are easily oxidisable, and radicals that are highly reactive and harmful to the human body may be produced. Nanotubes may behave in the human body in a manner similar to asbestos fibres. We all know what happened in the case of asbestos.</p>
<p class="contents">Once they are released into the environment, we know very little about how nanoparticles behave and react, and the European Union must do everything it can to promote research in that area. Nevertheless, at the moment just a tiny fraction of investment in research is directed towards precaution, and we have no regulation whatsoever. We do not have a legal framework for the use of these products.</p>
<p class="contents">Our policy cannot be to market these products first and then ask questions later. We need a policy of precaution in order to be able to move forward definitively with this technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to express my appreciation and support for the report before us, which confirms that this is one of the key technologies of the 21st century. It is therefore appropriate that nanosciences and nanotechnologies should figure among the EU’s priorities. There are both negative and positive aspects to this issue, however.</p>
<p class="contents">On the positive side is the support that upcoming technologies have gained across the whole of Parliament. As the report correctly says, the development of nanotechnologies presents an extraordinary opportunity. Europe is currently keeping pace with the world. I saw evidence of this a few days ago during a visit to the northern Czech town of Liberec. The results of work carried out by Liberec Technical University and a company in the town were, in terms of the research and application of nanotechnology, absolutely world-class, including the manufacture of exceptionally high-quality machinery. I should also like to point out that this is one of the smaller Czech towns and not a potential science centre, like Prague or Brno. Nanotechnologies also represent an opportunity, in my view, for smaller countries, and generally for smaller organisations. The development of nanosciences and nanotechnologies naturally requires substantial support, not only in the Czech Republic but also across Europe as a whole. The rest of world is already aware of this. Who do you think is among the most actively interested in the conclusions of the work of scientists and technical experts in Liberec? Naturally, it is people from other continents – especially from North America, but also from South East Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">Which brings me to one of the negative aspects of the development of nanotechnologies in Europe, and this is what I feel to be the insufficient protection of intellectual property in relation to the application of the results of research in other sectors. Another issue is financial support, which, in my opinion, is insufficient, complicated and difficult to obtain. The report also points out that the United States already accounts for 37% of the world’s expenditure, whereas Europe's spending stands at 24%, less than that of Japan. The planned funding of nanosciences and nanotechnologies as part of the Seventh Framework Programme also lags behind that of the US.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude. I should like to mention what I personally feel is a further significantly positive effect. Nanosciences and nanotechnologies offer very good prospects for young people with an interest in science and technology and in studying at university. We must not pass up this opportunity to give the development of science and technology in the EU fresh impetus. We must ensure that we are present when the prefix ‘nano’ – meaning ‘dwarf’ or ‘gnome’ – gives birth to a giant of the 21st century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Progress is rapid, and the technology will have a dramatic impact on nearly every field.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a deep-rooted notion in this House that all important phenomena such as this must be controlled by the EU. In every report it is stressed that organisation, legislation, supervision and funding must be the responsibility of the EU. In every report the importance of the EU not lagging behind the USA, Japan and China in terms of global competition is pointed out. Yet we never see any convincing analysis of what it is about the market that cannot sort itself out of its own accord and therefore requires official measures. We never see any convincing analysis of the level at which such official measures should be taken. Every single time, the reports are based on the idea that the European Parliament is perfect in its proficiency and therefore can and should charge the Commission and the Member States with the task of complying with its instructions. The European Parliament calls on and reminds everyone of the problems faced by the world and of how they are to be solved, stressing and emphasising these. For example, the rapporteur, Mr Ransdorf, wants Parliament to establish that nanotechnologies ought to be geared to the development of hydrogen energy. I contend that the European Parliament is guaranteed to be incompetent to decide a matter of this nature. Nanotechnologies are developed with the most speed and efficiency when not controlled from on high by international bureaucracies. It is the international research community, businesses and the national institutions that are best placed to experiment and compete in the field of nanotechnologies, and it is private and state organisations within the nation states that are best placed to produce information material about nanotechnologies in keeping with the values and experiences of their own peoples. The role of the EU in this context should be restricted to setting up a patent-monitoring system for this field, establishing ethical and environmental policy standards and possibly providing funding of very large-scale projects along the lines of fusion research. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nanosciences and nanotechnologies can play a positive role in achieving important economic, social and environmental goals, and I hope that they will be able to meet the needs of the citizens and thus contribute to the well-being of the nations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are undeniable facts that we cannot overlook: a whole host of technological advances are just round the corner thanks to the way in which atoms and molecules have been aggregated to form new materials. It is vital that more funding be granted to this area of research so as to guarantee the competitiveness of the European industrial system, but there must always be respect for inalienable ethical principles and public health and environmental criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with some of the amendments tabled by Mr Hammerstein and Mrs Breyer, and they are: Amendment 1 to paragraph 2, which is a useful and sensible recommendation on the assessment of potential risks to human health and the environment and the subsequent social and ethical implications and which takes nothing away from the original text; Amendment 6, which maintains that funding for research must be granted exclusively to projects that use at least half of the resources to carry out risk assessments; and Amendment 8, which stresses that the risk assessments must be carried out throughout the life cycle of the products obtained from nanotechnologies, from conception to completion.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot overlook the fact that there appear to be many toxicological risks linked to nanotechnologies, a point that is also upheld by countless experts interviewed by the prestigious MIT periodical ‘Technology Review’. The report does, however, also consider this side of things.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the new paragraph 5a, I believe, instead, that it is only right to advise caution in terms of a satisfactory risk assessment and to guarantee the traceability and labelling of, and accountability for, products based on nanotechnologies. However, although I agree about the limitations of research, I find the text to be slightly vague and so I shall abstain, just as I shall abstain on the proposed new paragraph 17.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the nations and Europe have to be competitive in the field of nanosciences, and the effort proposed seems minimal – a half-hearted commitment – in terms of trying to bridge the gap that already exists between us and both the United States and the Far East. The report rightly considers both the economic and strategic perspectives of the knowledge triangle and the requirements in relation to sustainability and people’s health. I shall therefore vote in favour of Mr Ransdorf’s excellent work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our researchers in this sector are not lagging behind researchers anywhere else. On the contrary, one could say that they are the first in the world. Thus, here too, the bet which we are being called upon to win is to develop and exploit economically the knowledge produced. In order to win this bet, we need, as in other knowledge sectors, to link our wealth of human resources with production promptly and effectively. We need cooperation between the state and the private sector. Universities, research centres, industry, companies and banks need to come together and cooperate closely and with vision. We need, above all, to advise and prepare the citizens for the revolution which nanotechnologies will bring to their everyday life. They will change the world as we know it.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, nanotechnologies and nanosciences are to the 21st century what the Internet was to the 20th century. We cannot afford to again experience the European paradox which we have seen in the past. In the past, the Internet, a clearly European idea, was developed by America better than anyone.</p>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as previous speakers have said, nanosciences and nanotechnologies are seen as key technologies for the 21st century, with significant repercussions for our industry. This is a multidisciplinary field which opens up a whole range of new opportunities and of solutions to citizens’ and companies’ real needs, and it is therefore expected to make a great contribution to the European Union's achievement of its sustainable development and competitiveness objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is certainly the leader in this sector, although it invests considerably less in R and D in this field than the United States or Japan. I agree with the rapporteur’s opinion that the European Union must strengthen this leadership in order to consolidate and enhance our position in a highly competitive world context and in a very promising sector.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, it is not sufficient simply to increase investment in R and D. At the same time we must guarantee the excellence of research, ensure that we have sufficient qualified personnel, greater coordination of resources and better coordination of policies with the Member States, and continue to improve the business environment, mainly by modernising our SMEs and creating new ones on the basis of knowledge, so that excellent R and D in nanosciences and nanotechnologies is converted into new products and new processes.</p>
<p class="contents">The European technological platforms linked to nanosciences and nanotechnologies contribute to establishing common research objectives and priorities that are of interest to industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress the importance of international cooperation. Ladies and gentlemen, we must not place obstacles in the way of scientific progress. We must support our researchers, since it is they who are more aware of the pros and cons in this field than anybody else. What certainly is the case though is that, in order for the citizens to have faith in science, knowledge of scientific progress must be disseminated in a comprehensible manner and the public’s awareness must be improved, so that there is greater understanding of the real challenges and implications for our lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nanotechnologies are extremely important, and none more so than nanoelectronics, which enables us to achieve ever greater gains in efficiency while consuming less energy than we currently do with microelectronics, as is also confirmed by the platform’s work.</p>
<p class="contents">Nanotechnologies signify the intelligent use of common materials, for example through filtration and catalysis, of materials that may enable us to avoid the difficulties linked at times to the scarcity of rare elements. I should, however, like to point out that the fears about the consequences for people’s health are not unfounded. The nanometric size of the particles requires consideration to be given to the risks associated with a new kind of toxicology. According to the available evidence, these particles can pass directly through the cell membranes and therefore may attack the nucleic acids. I think it only right for resources and energy to be devoted to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by addressing the Commissioner: we need to reform the European Patent Office, as it currently lacks satisfactory controls. Parliament must be able to have its say; the work can no longer just be intergovernmental, but must become part of the Union’s activities. The overall issue of advancing and safeguarding science is in fact a Union issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot allow ourselves to become no more than promoters who uncritically accept hype, and nor can it be our function to go into the roadshow and nanocafé business in an attempt at allaying people’s real fears. We cannot allow ourselves to be no more than carriers of advertising for nanotechnology.</p>
<p class="contents">Politicians are there to see to it that consumers and the environment are protected. Nanotechnology is used to put on the market products such as cosmetics, cleaning materials, and textiles, which are aimed at private consumers and virtually unregulated. As Mr Prodi has just said, there is no legal framework applicable to nanotechnology. When the Commission’s scientific committee admits, as it did on 29 September last year, and I quote, that ‘there are considerable gaps in terms of risk assessment, of characterisation and of the measurement of nano-particles. Little is known about the relationship between dose and effect, nothing at all about where in the human body nano-particles end up and how long they remain there, and little about the degree to which they are toxic to the environment’, then we cannot ignore that and bury our heads in the sand; on the contrary, is it for you, you in the Commission, to create a permanent legal framework to protect all consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Have we really learned nothing from our experience with asbestos? We have just heard that nano-particles are capable of crossing the blood/brain barrier. Knowing as we do of these risks, surely we have to put protective mechanisms in place? We cannot simply allow these products to be put onto the market and tested on consumers; we cannot allow consumers to be treated as guinea pigs!</p>
<p class="contents">It is no part of the role of policy makers to be placard carriers for nanotechnology; their role, on the contrary, is to put in place a comprehensive legal framework for their regulation, control and measurement – all the things, that is, to which your own expert opinion makes reference.</p>
<p class="contents">Anything else would be to do a disservice to nanotechnology, which can make headway on the market, and be economically sustainable, only if we make it plain that account must also be taken of the interests of the consumers and of the risks involved. If Europe is to be a good place in which to site a business, it must also be a good place in which to be a consumer, and there is a lot missing in that respect. I see it as positively irresponsible that the Commission, even though it knows what is missing and is aware of the lack of any methodology for assessing the risks, wants to allow the marketing of consumer goods aimed at private citizens and their households, without the certainty of every risk having been removed. I again appeal to you, as a matter of urgency, to do something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have as yet had little to say about the dangers, the ethical problems, about enhancement, about the enrichment of nano-particles in human beings, for we have long believed that these were the stuff of science fiction, but these perils are drawing closer.</p>
<p class="contents">What I expect of the European Union is that it should give the USA an answer, and our answer, the European response to nanotechnology, far from being that we are willing to follow technology in a lemming-like fashion, must be that we will take a socially responsible approach and consider the risks involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The production of new material at the molecular level results in the creation of new characteristics, the effects of which on human health and on the environment are as yet unknown. The Commission has produced a proposal for an action plan to run until 2009, which is full of high expectations of the economic and social benefits, but the Commission regards the public's ethical misgivings and concerns mainly as obstacles, and so, Commissioner, in that respect, I have to tell you that the action plan is particularly unbalanced.</p>
<p class="contents">The same, unfortunately, can be said of the Ransdorf report, even though it does, to some extent, act as a counterbalance. What, then, is missing? What is absent, above all, is the willingness to consider concerns other than safety risks, not least the issue of whether or not new technologies are desirable, or issues to do with people’s convictions about life in general. The benefits and possible adverse effects must first of all be considered, in order to prevent choices being made solely on the basis of economic value while the technology is still at an early stage in its development.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we in the European Union must concentrate more on international coordination, not only as regards toxicity tests and risk assessments across the whole life cycle, but also as regards legislation on standards, labelling and liability, with those who market nanoparticles being liable for any damage caused by them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one has to consider the desirability or otherwise of patents relating to nanotechnologies and nanomaterials, particularly with regard to basic and general technology and to materials capable of being used in a wide variety of different ways. Can the Commission have a critical analysis done of this? It might then consider the question of to what extent the patents and licenses would put poorer countries at a still greater disadvantage and what might be done to counteract this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The changes brought about by nanotechnologies are comparable with the technological revolutions of the past and may perhaps even outstrip them. The possibilities unfolding before us give rise to a series of challenges. The report reacts to some of these, while leaving others unanswered. The conclusion from the text before us is that our global partners and competitors are aware of the importance of nanotechnologies and related research. This is clear from the sums earmarked for this research and from the conditions created for it. Although the Commission had intended to raise the volume of funding from the Seventh Framework Programme earmarked for nanotechnologies, it did not actually do so substantially, according to the rapporteur, who compares the public and private resources of Europe, the United States and Japan in this regard. Europe lags behind the United States as regards both generating competitive infrastructure and adopting standards on intellectual property.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of patenting inventions in the area of nanosciences and nanotechnologies is moving ahead slowly in Europe and the report emphasises the need to reform the European patent system in order to help science and innovation as a whole. What is sadly missing is a timetable. One aspect of the use of nanotechnologies missing from the report is that of their possible use for the military. The fact that these technologies are not the subject of any restrictions may come back to haunt us. The free transfer of these technologies is likened by Thomas van der Molen in his report to providing a nuclear reactor to all countries on the understanding that none will be used for developing nuclear weapons. I believe that in the near future we will have to take the area of nanotechnologies into account too, and address this question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nanoparticles do not have the same toxic characteristics as ordinary particles. Coal dust is not hazardous, but nanoparticles in the form of carbon clusters cause serious brain damage in fish within 48 hours at concentrations as low as 0.5 ppm. Nanotubes are capable of destroying mitochondrial DNA, while nanoparticles on the skin can migrate to the brain and the lymph nodes and damage our bodies. Our immune system is simply not adapted to cope with nanoparticles. The EU’s own research shows that non-biodegradable and biologically incompatible nanoparticles can be life-threatening and that all inhalation and ingestion of these should be avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While laudable, this leads to one major gap: the recommended increases in research in nanotechnologies are preceding legislation to regulate these technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation should, at minimum, keep up with research. In the hurry to get ahead of China and the United States, we may see regulation including risk assessment as being something that could hold us back. However, there are questions on non-therapeutic human enhancement, privacy, equity, patenting, military applications, safety and health and the environment, which we need to answer first. Regulation in this case should ensure that we do not in our haste create very difficult problems. If it is good regulation, it will serve research and make it more focused and effective. ‘Look before you leap’ has always been a good and useful maxim. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, there is fundamental research, there is the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, the Europe Research Council, and the technology platforms – where we have done something of lasting value – and I would like to congratulate Commissioner Potočnik on the prospective great success of this Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the Joint Research Centre, which could do more to deal with what has become known as the anxiety industry, and its objectivity would certainly be a sound basis on which to monitor these new technologies. The ‘European Institute of Technology’ proposed by the Commission under President Barroso could make it its business, by means of a top-down strategy, to communicate the insights of fundamental research to the education and training sectors, or a bottom-up strategy might be employed to extract this knowledge from the educational institutions, but also and in particular from small and medium-sized businesses and to present it on such a platform as ‘eBay’, with the possibility of the net being used to exchange ideas, express aspirations and guarantee better communication in the twenty or more European languages.</p>
<p class="contents">The fusion reactor ITER could also play a role in this respect, for it is in research into fusion and plasma that nanotechnology presents a whole new challenge as a means of advancing energy efficiency, minimising losses due to wear and tear, and of developing strategies for fighting against corrosion, not least in the generation of energy.

<p class="contents">The European Commission’s action plan outlines preconditions for the continued support of this sector and calls on Member States to put more emphasis on it within the context of developing a knowledge-based economy. Nanotechnology forms an integral part of various technological disciplines and will, in the near future, have a major positive impact on virtually every branch of industry, and these facts alone necessitate the implementation of an action plan in order to ensure a high degree of coordination and support.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to mention some of the problems facing this important area of research and development. I believe that research and development of any extent at all in the area of nanotechnology would in itself meet the criteria of excellence. However, in many instances this formal requirement, in combination with the requirement for a so-called critical mass of resources, blocks the participation of smaller university research and innovation centres, as well as innovation centres in small and medium-sized enterprises backed by national and European support programmes, such as the Seventh Framework Programme or the upcoming Framework Programme for Competition and Innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard I would like to draw your attention on the one hand to the need for better cooperation between the small and large organisations that are active in this area of research and development, and on the other hand to the need to enhance the internal competitive environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The other problem I would like to highlight is funding. We continue to witness a deterioration in the amount of funding available for research and development, and this applies also to nanotechnology. It only remains to be stated that despite our capable scientific and innovative potential we are clearly behind the US in this area. In addition to the Seventh Framework Programme, a solution might be sought, primarily for smaller research and innovation projects, in venture capital, where the potential for more efficient institutionalisation by means of public-private partnerships is often underestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Commission, along with the European Investment Fund, could play a better coordinating role through the JEREMIE Programme, accompanied by specific and clear recommendations to Member States regarding the creation of efficient incentives financed from public funds, including the structural funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, politics too should act in line with technological development, be it with various initiatives or with legislative measures. Here we have to promote development and put into place legislation which prevents abuses and limits risks. In this light, the document drafted by the Commission is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are rather late in dealing with this matter. Parliament, the Commission and the Council are close to finalising negotiations on the Seventh Framework Programme. This programme includes some essential elements of the Action Plan, such as research, innovation, and, to an extent, human resources. I sincerely hope that Parliament has been engaged in serious negotiations and has advocated an appropriate role for nanoscience, both by defining the subject areas for research and by attempting to secure a substantial increase in research funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, there is one area which remains open and which the Action Plan defines as essential in securing the critical mass for infrastructure. It involves connecting universities, research organisations and industry and recommends that this objective be met through the use of existing mechanisms. In the meantime, a lively debate has been sparked about what is called the European Institute of Technology, which is a further development of this idea concerned with securing the critical mass with an emphasis on human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to take account of the well–considered conclusions that have already been reached about nanosciences and nanotechnologies when deciding on the development of future mechanisms for securing the critical mass. In this respect, I would like to stress that we need to facilitate cooperation both with those groups that have already demonstrated research excellence and with those that have a great potential to achieve excellence over a relatively short period of time. Nanosciences and nanotechnologies can serve as one of the test areas for establishing an ever closer relationship between the three sides of what is known as the knowledge triangle.</p>

Its use in medicine, for example, opens up possibilities of improved treatments for cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, which, together, account for two-thirds of deaths in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a field in which Europe’s research institutions and businesses are world leaders; in the Netherlands alone, the nanotech industry achieves a turnover of EUR 20 billion, and the government is investing record amounts in it, for example in the ‘Centre for Molecular Medicine’ in Eindhoven. As an example of a pro-active strategy, with the sort of attitude that world development and competition are crying out for, businesses are doing likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">The need for choices to be made, for investment, and for support to be given to European basic infrastructure – all these things are expressed well in the Ransdorf report. It follows that the task for the Commission, for the Member States, and for the regional authorities is to work together with industry and SMEs to ensure that this is put into practice in industrial production in this part of the world. The Seventh Framework Programme for research and development, the European technology platforms and the 'regions of knowledge', together with the Structural Funds, have laid a good foundation, particularly where finance is concerned. Then there are the risks. These must, of course, be considered, particularly at the global level within UNESCO and the OECD.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this autumn sees Commissioner Potočnik embarking on a roadmap for research infrastructure, which should reveal which regions, areas or clusters really do have the potential to meet the challenge of global competition. Investment is not about a global ‘brain drain’, but should, on the ground, result in a ‘brain gain’ – a gain for the European economy and for the prosperity of Europe’s people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janez Potočnik, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I should like, in a telegraphic way, to respond to and summarise what I think is the message from today’s debate concerning innovation, funding, risks, ethics and the regulatory framework. I shall take them one by one.</p>
<p class="contents">On innovation, there is no doubt that nanosciences and nanotechnologies have a very high potential. Nanosciences are very much like information technology. So a breakthrough in this area would provide results for all sectors. That is why it is very important to pay close attention to innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to compare ourselves to the United States, we would find that in many areas we are not lagging behind. However, the one area in which we are truly lagging behind is information technology. If you look at how much money we provide for innovation, research and development, you would find that even structurally, not just globally, we are lagging behind. We should not make the same mistake when it comes to innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are trying to engage European technology platforms, joint technology initiatives – in which we are very active – and the companies from that area. I agree that the intellectual property issue, IPR, is also important and that is why it has received special attention in the action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to funding. We have two themes which are dealing with that very seriously. One is, of course, nanosciences and nanotechnologies and the other is information and communication technologies. However, there is more than that. There are also the questions that will be dealt with in the European Research Council, in the people programme, in the capacities programme, and in infrastructure – the things connected with regional development. So it is very hard to compare the money that was devoted today to FP6 with the money that will be used in FP7. What I can tell you is that the funding will be increased considerably in comparison with the existing situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Again, if we compare the funding in Europe to that in the United States, we must not forget that the framework programme is 5% of European public funding. Therefore, it is obvious, if you compare how much public funding is provided for nanosciences, that it is 30% of that public funding in Europe. Obviously, we are giving it proportionally much higher attention than the Member States are doing. That has to be clearly underlined.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in normal circumstances, two thirds of funding should come from the private sector, where we have to focus our attention. So here one of the things we found out – and it was published in August 2006 – was what the decisive elements are according to the companies doing the research in the area of Europe: first, the existence of the market; and second, the knowledge pool, not the wage level. The wage level is almost irrelevant when we talk about knowledge and research and development. These are the areas which need attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, concerning the risks, it is true that we do not know everything and it would be hypocritical to say that we do, because it is not true. However, we know a lot, and I agree with all those who said that we need to pay proper attention to that in FP7. In the action plan we have also paid proper attention to the questions connected with the risks. Informal collection of inputs for further projects under FP7 has recently been completed. It is also extremely important that the way in which we approach questions of risk should be transparent and that we educate people in the proper way.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning ethics, it is quite clear that we have to maintain the high ethical standards and principles that we have always followed and pay proper attention to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the regulatory framework, regulatory issues again form an integral part of the action plan. They are concentrated there and the Commission is working in close collaboration with research DGs and DGs active in regulatory aspects, and with external experts, with a view to addressing various uncertainties with regard to potential hazards and exposure, to addressing gaps in knowledge, and to further developing guidelines and methods. The adequacy of existing and future legislation with regard to nanotechnology products is also being examined carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise, without any doubt we need a balanced approach, which is transparent, with a high level of care for public health, safety, the environment and consumer protection, but aimed at exploiting the huge potential of nanosciences and nanotechnologies in research and innovation. Today’s report was a very good opportunity to underline all these components of our approach and I should like to thank honourable Members for their attention to these issues, for the support given to our work and for the concerns they have raised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alain Hutchinson (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the report I hope we are going to vote in favour of today follows directly on from the three Commission communications that constitute what is referred to as ‘the 2006 aid effectiveness package’ and the report is therefore more broadly about pursuing the objective of improving European development cooperation. So much for the context.</p>
<p class="contents">As for what is at stake here – or even, I might say, constitutes the challenge – this could not be clearer: how are we Europeans significantly to improve the actual aid we provide to the countries of the South? In other words, how are we to set about ensuring that the aid we grant to the countries of the South is converted much more systematically into practical progress such as will genuinely change the lives of millions of people living in humanly unacceptable conditions?</p>
<p class="contents">There is now a collective awareness of the fact that we could provide better aid, and political commitments have been made enabling us to give this issue priority status in our development cooperation policy. We have a European consensus on development and also a new strategy for Africa. That is excellent. Moreover, the legislative and technical arrangements are being put in place. If I may say so, all that remains for us to do is to give practical expression to all this.</p>
<p class="contents">The many issues that we have dealt with in this report include the following: the actual definition of development cooperation and, therefore, of what each Member State is legitimately entitled to include under public development aid; the minimum level of aid to be obtained if our commitments are to be honoured; the untying of aid, a process that Member States – a number of them, in any case – are clearly reluctant to apply; the absence of indicators enabling real progress in improving European aid to be assessed; or, again, the concern of actors on the ground who note a certain reluctance to involve beneficiary countries in the strategies and programmes intended for those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these specific issues that give us some grasp of how far we still have to go in improving our aid in practical terms, the three Cs – complementarity of actions, coordination of programmes and coherence of policies - also constitute a framework within which to work and a particularly important template for interpreting the action that we shall have to take over the next few years where cooperation is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to complementarity of actions, whether these be taken on a sectoral or geographical basis, the fact is that distribution of the work gives rise to some resistance and a number of difficulties. By adopting an open and bold approach, we should be able to overcome these problems. The debate cannot be reduced to a clash between Member State protectionism and Brussels centralism, useful though it undoubtedly is to guard against excessive centralism. This is characterised by a top-down approach to programming and, in particular, by reduced participation by the partner countries and by civil society in defining strategies and priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact remains that centralised coordination between Member States and the Commission would offer undoubted advantages and would, in particular, make it possible to avoid the present situation in which a multitude of different actors do the same thing in the same country or region. For example, the atlas of donors clearly shows the existence of forgotten crises or of what are known as orphan countries, together with post-tsunami-type situations in which the beneficiary countries are incapable of absorbing a huge quantity of aid provided on a one-off basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Although coordination has been talked about for years, huge challenges remain when it comes to harmonising procedures and doing a better job of coordinating the EU’s various cooperation programmes. What is more, not only do the various Community policies themselves need to be internally coherent, but there also needs to be a coherent approach to policy-making in the various geographical areas in which our development policy applies. This precise point appears on the agenda of the Finnish Presidency, which has decided to devote a large part of its work to the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">If, therefore, we thought it wiser to confine ourselves in our report to emphasising the importance of this aspect while waiting to see what the near future holds for us, I should like to take this opportunity to raise this issue which I think is vital and ultimately has bearing on the very basis of any cooperative initiative or even, indeed, of any political project.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know - because it is regularly talked about - boats continue, every day and even as we talk, to reach the Spanish coasts – which is to say our own coasts - with hundreds of people on board attempting to flee a fate that they have decided to reject at peril of their lives. This situation obviously raises issues about border controls, the management of migratory flows and policy on integrating immigrant populations. In addition, it strikingly raises the issue of how effective our cooperation policy is, as well as the issue of how well that policy ties in with our other policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to descend into caricature, but what kind of cooperation is it – and one lasting more than 40 years – at the end of which the populations that we were claiming to help have only one aspiration: to flee the conditions under which they live at any price? Let us not mince our words. To me, this situation sounds like failure. What, indeed, can the countries of the South make of a cooperation policy through which a sum of EUR 50 billion per year is granted when it is combined with a policy requiring them to honour a debt whose annual reimbursement represents four times that sum?</p>
<p class="contents">How can we continue to state in every possible way our determination to facilitate the development of the countries of the South while, at the same time, we continue to foist on them the free-trade rules that they are incapable of obeying under the conditions we impose on them? How can we agree to combating poverty when, at the same time, nothing is done to fight against the structural causes of that poverty?</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that, however effective it might be, development cooperation policy will never by itself succeed in responding to the many challenges posed in the countries of the South. It is with precisely that thought in mind that there is a need to improve development cooperation, as such cooperation will be more effective in proportion to the degree to which it succeeds in making Europe aware of the need to conduct an overall policy focused entirely on the pursuit of a common priority objective: the emergence of a fairer world characterised by greater solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to begin by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Hutchinson, and the Committee on Development for a constructive report on aid effectiveness, a topic of key importance for the EU development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Improving both the quantity and the quality of our aid is certainly one of the core commitments set out in the European Consensus for Development, the latter having been endorsed by all Member States, the Commission and Parliament in 2005. The Consensus is a crucial document for all of us. First, it opens a new dimension for joint work between the 25 Member States and the Commission. Secondly, it highlights, for the first time in EU history, our collective European vision, principles and objectives that govern our development policy. Thirdly, it sets out the comparative advantage of the Commission and the objective of redeploying Member States’ activities in order to achieve better and highly necessary synergy.</p>
<p class="contents">As demonstrated during all the debates on the European Consensus, the Commission should promote the impact of Europe in development and push the European aid effectiveness agenda. The European Union must be a leading force in international fora dealing with aid effectiveness, in particular in the OECD/DAC, where the Commission enjoys full statutory membership. A strong EU makes for a strong DAC.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this in mind that Commissioner Michel has proposed a package of concrete deliverables on aid effectiveness, which were endorsed by the Council in spring 2006. The Commission’s approach to aid effectiveness is based on lessons learnt from the field, good practices and expectations from the partner countries. It is rooted in the principles of harmonisation, ownership, alignment and management by results, as in the Paris Declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has made it clear in previous resolutions and again in this report that it supports the Commission in its efforts to strengthen the coordination and coherence of both Commission and EU actions in the development field. The report highlights three important areas in which progress needs to be achieved in 2007 and I would like to comment on them briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">First, strengthening complementarity and the division of labour: these issues are crucial for the Commission. The EU Donor Atlas has indeed underlined the gaps and duplications in donor activities which hamper the impact of aid. In order to address these weaknesses, the Commission launched a process with Member States aimed at adopting operational principles for a better division of labour between EU donors. Discussions are currently ongoing and this initiative should be rendered operational with Council conclusions in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the joint programming of aid: the EU now has at its disposal a joint framework adopted last spring. This framework foresees the drawing-up of common diagnostics and analysis in partner countries, in close partnership with Member States involved, to establish common operational solutions. Partner countries and civil society play a major and active role in this process. Far from being excluded from these discussions, civil society is strongly involved in the country diagnostic set up in order to ensure its full ownership. This approach is fully in line with the approach used in EC programming.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a few words on an essential tool for improving the division of labour and coordination, that is, cofinancing. In 2007, the Commission will bring forward specific proposals on how to strengthen the use of cofinancing as a tool to support the division of labour amongst donors, as well as to assist those Member States building their development capacities. Parliament has been persistent in its well-founded requests to the Commission to ensure coordination among Member States in order to strengthen the effectiveness of financing for development. As you can see, the Commission has clearly adopted a proactive attitude and will, in close collaboration with Member States, use all tools at its disposal to make greater aid effectiveness a reality. I can only advocate that the European Parliament uses the joint meeting on development with the national parliaments next October as an opportunity to expand support for these initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, it is important for the EU to ensure that its political ambitions match its financial status as the largest global donor. In this respect, Parliament has a crucial role to play in helping Member States to accelerate their reforms and make the necessary cultural changes implied by this new joint working dimension. Success on this front is of major importance for reaching our development goals, as well as taking the lead on the global development agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us recall that the ultimate objective is to succeed in the fight against poverty. It is only by acting together and by making the best possible use of all the means at our disposal that success can be guaranteed. Thanks to the European Consensus, we now have all the necessary tools to achieve this goal. We must make sure that these commitments remain high on our political agenda and that we do not miss this real opportunity to turn our ambitious political commitments into reality. It goes beyond politics; it is a matter of collective credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If development aid is to be effective, that presupposes that the EU’s approaches to aid and trade will be mutually coherent. If we want to achieve the Millennium Goals in 2015, aid and trade must – as they indeed can – complement one another, but the lamentable reality is that they often do not. Aid and trade policies – including agriculture – still, all too often operate in isolation from one another, and that is surely one reason why it will take another century for us to make poverty in Africa a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, little is being said about the coherence of Europe’s policies. Commissioner Mandelson’s negotiators preach free trade subject to global rules, while the people under Commissioner Michel work for development and try to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and policy on agricultural subsidies runs counter to what either camp is aiming for. I regard the various policy fields as comparable to ‘ships that pass in the night’.</p>
<p class="contents">In this situation, alas, it is all too often the development aspect that gets squeezed out; for example, trade considerations loom far too large in economic policy agreements, the renowned – or sometimes, perhaps, notorious – Peas. When it comes to development, those who seek aid are all too often pointed towards existing funds, and there is far too little evidence of a truly integrated approach, which really would involve extra money and new development plans being put on the table, despite the fact that it is the EPAs, taking as they do enhanced local cooperation as their starting point, that could help to make aid more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we have to take it as read that, in the development field, precautions have to be taken to protect the weaker negotiating parties, so that honest agreements and a realistic timeframe can emerge from the EPAs. If trade is to really ‘take off’, then such things as, for example, the reform of the taxation system with the replacement of duties paid when crossing borders, stronger public and social service institutions, better education and health care, are indispensable. The current lack of coordination and coherence is not merely inefficient but also unacceptable on the grounds that it goes against Article 178 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the reasons for this is that the knowledge and expertise of the trade experts, or, conversely of the developers, often impinge on each other’s area of work, and another is the lack of willingness to tot up the real costs and benefits of integrated development and, together – which means in the Council, too – to seek new funding for it. Moreover, it is often the case that European policies – in such areas as agriculture, trade and development, among others – have the effect of working against each other, export subsidies enable agriculture to dump its products in North Africa, with a consequent increase in unemployment there. Those in charge of immigration complain about the flow of economic refugees from the region and do little by way of providing aid, preferring instead to work on sound agreements on the regional labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing that could make a substantial improvement to the situation would be a coherent European agenda from the Commission and the Council. Global trade is important and of great benefit in enabling developing countries to escape from the vicious cycle of poverty; much is to be gained by a good combination of aid and trade, and the process of combining the two must not be allowed to stand in the way of these countries’ development; it is in this way that we will be able to achieve the Millennium Goals. What I am calling for is a coherent European agenda; the new development cooperation instrument can provide it with a framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate him.</p>
<p class="contents">2005 was full of decisive events relating to the issue of development aid. If matters are now really getting under way, let us translate our words into deeds. On this basis, we can only welcome the efforts made by the European Union and by a number of Member States substantially to increase development aid. Although, however, it is obvious that financial resources are indispensable to effective aid, that cannot be enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, development practices must be stringently monitored if the implementation of these policies is fully to be measured. Development aid must be as ambitious in terms of quality as it is in terms of funding if there is to be an appreciable reduction in poverty. With this in mind, I would emphasise the importance of putting innovative funding mechanisms in place, enabling stable and predictable resources to be made available. In view of this, I welcome the creation of Unitaid at the last United Nations summit. This will enable developing countries to access medicines more easily. At a time when this mechanism is still in its early days, let us now hope and pray that it will show how effective it is and secure the commitment of countries in addition to those that, on the model of France, are already involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must play the role of conductor with a view to bringing about a better distribution of the tasks under the heading of development aid. Such coordination must take place both at European Union level and on the ground, with the beneficiary nations also being involved. The package of measures designed to bring about effective aid constitutes a first stage. The European Union and its Member States have the same ambitions in terms of development. Let us, therefore, together take up the challenge of bringing about effective and transparent aid while remaining faithful to our commitments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this regard, the report prepared by my friend and colleague Mr Hutchinson is a document of very great significance, in terms of its rigour and profundity and given the time at which it is being produced: a time when public opinion in the European Union is becoming aware of the fact that, both on the basis of the principle of solidarity, and given the exodus of emigrants fleeing from under-development towards our countries, Europe has no alternative but to apply all of its efforts to the development and stabilisation of the countries of the South.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hutchinson report and his extremely laudable motion for a resolution, which we shall surely approve by an overwhelming majority, are not just one more document amongst the many we debate in our Parliament. Since I entirely agree with its proposals, I shall not reiterate its content now. I will say that it is of particular relevance on a day such as today, when it appears that just a few hours ago we reached a good conclusion in the negotiation on the new legal instrument for the funding of our development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also say that the report is a piece of true doctrine and that it contains very many ideas and proposals that the Council and above all the Commission will have to take into account in order to increase the effectiveness of our work in the field of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament, in our Committee on Development and, of course, in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament must commit ourselves to ensuring that Mr Hutchinson’s proposals do not remain a mere statement of good intentions and that they do not come to nothing. We must work to ensure that they are a kind of guide for our actions, that the efficiency we achieve in this field contributes to obtaining more and better objective results, which furthermore justify allocating more significant and generous budgets in a field that is no longer a secondary or peripheral matter or a mere means of easing our consciences, and that this area is transformed into a truly major priority within the European Union’s policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As long ago as the year 2000, the UN General Assembly set itself the task, one that Members belonging to every grouping in this House have taken very seriously over recent years, of making success measurable, setting goals and showing where progress has been achieved. For us, too, the Millennium Development Goals are the yardstick whereby we assess the effectiveness of what we do on the development policy front.</p>
<p class="contents">We found the United Nations’ interim report alarming, in that it showed that the targets set had not been achieved, and, while that sort of failure gives well-paid Europeans a guilty conscience, to millions of people living in poverty it means death, and for millions of young women a whole life without education. That should be a good enough reason for the Commission to review the effectiveness of its aid provision, and certainly gives us enough justification for looking further into its self-analysis, so let me again congratulate Mr Hutchinson on the good work he has done in spelling out very clearly to the Commission what it should be doing.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, though, let me take this opportunity to consider the role of this House, for we too, to some degree, share responsibility for this failure. It is evident that we have, for years on end, been agreeing to budgets that did not do what they were meant to do, but were we in any kind of position to reach better decisions? Do we possess sufficient information to perform our monitoring role? I doubt it. To date, the Commission has produced no convincing evidence of having managed projects in such a way as to achieve the eight Millennium Development Goals, and the budget data on the basis of which we have been required to take decisions are superficial.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005, we called on the European Investment Bank to carry out a benchmarking exercise in respect of its lending, that is to say, to evaluate every loan in terms of its contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The funds over which we have control cannot at present be benchmarked in this way, and, since there is no institution that could take over from us the overall monitoring of what is done with the money, we should also demand that we, as Europe’s Parliament, be given permanent input right along the line of development cooperation, in other words, to have a say in the programming of the European Development Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Proposals need to be made at both the national and regional level, containing definite targets and milestones for the progressive achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and we will, in future, want to see from the Commission country-by-country and region-by-region reports, divided up by sector and project, along with reports listing the project promoters and the firms of consultants involved and detailing the funds that have been remitted to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The 65 important proposals contained in the Hutchinson report make clear the fact that this House does indeed possess competence that should be drawn on in future, but I believe there is a second pillar of competence, alongside the governments of the objective regions, in the form of the institutions that operate in those regions, which need to be far more involved. According to one approach, individual donors in a particular region should take on leadership roles in specific sectors; not only does this come in for praise in the report, but we too could consider the possibility of making use of the financial clout that the European Union wields – greater than that of the United Nations – in taking over the leadership in respect of one of the eight Millennium Development Goals, and the one I would propose is water.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union could commit itself to ensuring, jointly with local partners, the supply of drinking water to the continent of Africa and the disposal of its waste water. That would do us more credit than the latest scandal involving the poisoning of drinking water by European companies, and so we should call on the Commission to produce a timetable stating by which dates it should be possible to provide all the major cities south of the Sahara with sustainable systems for the supply of drinking water and the drainage of waste water, and should insist on regular interim progress reports relating to the performance of this task.</p>
<p class="contents">I want the Commission to tell us whether or not it possesses the structures that might make a master plan for such a task possible in the first place, and whether it agrees that the international community needs that sort of specialised centre. Better ways must be found of bringing together those who work in the field with policy-makers and donors, and what I would suggest is that the Commission should organise, every other year, an international conference on African development with the specific objective of making policymakers and donors aware of what is needed and of what has been learned in practice. One possibility is that there could be an exhibition detailing successful and unsuccessful projects, with the former being honoured.</p>
<p class="contents">This would also be an opportunity to recruit new specialised workers in the field of development cooperation, particularly from among young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, the European Union which provides over half of the public aid in the world and is the biggest donor in the world. Unfortunately, this achievement does not translate into European leadership in the international arena. We say ‘Union’ but we think in terms of ‘Member States’, as the European Council’s decisions from December 2005 in Brussels clearly state that 80% to 90% of new aid to developing countries must come from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We should ask ourselves whether, in the future, we will be prepared to view debt reduction for specific countries, most recently Iraq and Nigeria, as a form of development aid. It is an easy solution for the Union but, in effect, it reduces the actual amount of aid provided to developing countries. Nonetheless, leaving debt cancellation aside, there was a five billion increase in the actual aid provided to poor countries last year. Some refer to this sum as ‘only five billion’, and others say ‘as much as five billion’.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, speaking as a representative of a new Member State of the European Union, the new and poorer countries of the Union find themselves in a completely unfamiliar situation. We are part of the European Community and wish to accept the obligations involved. Our countries need to understand that there are those in the world who are even poorer than us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its 65 points, he addresses the many areas and factors that will be necessary to provide more and better aid. He discusses the innovative sources of financing for development and the need for an approach involving debt relief, in order to give the developing countries greater room for manoeuvre in the fight against poverty, and, of course, he also stresses that there needs to be consistency between the various policy areas. Our aid will only be effective if there is greater consistency between the policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that efficiency must not undermine the necessary accountability. Precisely at a time when ever greater resources are being devoted to development cooperation as direct budget aid, sufficient resources are needed to build an independent and critical civil society. If the donor countries want to make their aid more effective, they are in many domains dependent on non-governmental organisations in order to ensure that the aid provided is actually used to reduce poverty, and that it does in fact reach the poor and disadvantaged in the partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must keep to the commitments they have made regarding the funding of development aid, in other words 0.56% of their gross domestic product in 2010 and 0.7% in 2015. In this connection, it is important to note that debt relief should not be included in these calculations. According to the most recent figures from the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, in 2005 the European Union identified debt relief for Iraq and Nigeria, in particular, as development aid, despite the fact that the Monterrey Consensus explicitly states that financial resources provided for debt relief should not come from development aid funds that are normally intended to be directly available for developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament therefore calls on the Member States to draw up an accurate list each year, clearly showing the contributions provided directly for development aid. As the rapporteur said, aid from the European Union and the Member States must be coordinated in a complementary way and be consistent. Many of the partner countries are overwhelmed by the number of donors: parallel projects often result in an unnecessary duplication of structures and sometimes even hinder progress. It will only be possible to solve this problem by means of better coordination between the development cooperation of the Community and that of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes a working group in which representatives of civil society should be involved. Specific case studies should be used to show what is already working and where a great deal of work still needs to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union is able to become, and in fact must become, a leader, not only in terms of the scope but also in terms of the effectiveness of aid. We can continue to express our regret that the amount of aid to third countries is insufficient, but first we need to be sure that whatever aid is at hand is used effectively. We need to better coordinate the provision of aid, abandon the redundant formalities and strengthen control in order to be able to respond to the ever-changing situation. The role of the European Commission should only intensify in this respect, in particular when coordinating the provision of aid. This is quite significant for the new Member States, since their contribution to aiding developing countries is gradually increasing. In this sense Lithuania is already changing its status within the World Bank by its transformation from a beneficiary country to a donor country, a situation which will largely facilitate my country’s involvement in the Bank‘s development programmes. </p>
<p class="contents">A factor of crucial importance is public support, as to date it has not been as substantial as it should be. We need to promote the perception among new Member States that by aiding developing countries we also help ourselves. In these times of globalisation, the world reminds us that poverty and hunger, unrest and natural disasters in Africa or Asia also impact stability and standards of living in Europe or America. However, beneficiary countries also need to demonstrate their capacity to properly manage the funds entrusted to them. Maximum attention to the issue should come from the Members of Parliament, and from both the EU and from beneficiary States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is indeed hard to find a better reason for tackling the issue of the effectiveness of European Union development aid. One cannot but agree with the statement that it only makes sense to increase development aid funding if there is a significant improvement in the effectiveness of this aid. I am convinced that the citizens of Europe will support an increase in funding for development aid. They will not, however, tolerate waste, inefficiency, a lack of transparency and sham activities, hence the importance of improving efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that only actual aid should be classed as such. I therefore support the view that reducing poor countries’ debt should be kept separate from expenditure on development aid. Indeed, the HIPC initiative has not provided a permanent solution to the problem of the indebtedness of poor countries. On the other hand, it is essential for the greatest possible amount of financial aid available to be sent directly to the beneficiaries. It is important not to create the impression that a large proportion of these funds is used to pay middle men such as civil servants and advisers. The provision on achieving deeper, decentralised cooperation and working directly with local authorities in developing countries should therefore be recognised as being worthy of support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

India has a responsibility to its citizens to enforce core labour standards and meet environmental standards. At the same time, the EU as a global leader and a principle trading partner of India must work with the Indian authorities to ensure that the Generalised System of Preferences can continue to support Indian industry and that a delicate balance can be found between the need to enforce international rules on intellectual property and making sure that traditional knowledge and access to medicines for poverty-related diseases can be maintained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The balance that was sought at the time, however, remains too fragile today. What we are seeing is a trend towards placing security concerns ahead of human rights. The fight against terrorism and against illegal immigration have clearly dominated the Justice and Home Affairs agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Hague Programme of 2004 lacks a vision for the future. The issue of immigration is crying out for Community decision-making – that is to say, the legitimacy that comes from Parliament’s intervention in the codecision process – and needs a binding Charter of Fundamental Rights. Immigration policy must be a Union policy based on humanitarian concerns, prevention and cooperation with countries of origin. What is needed is commitment and solidarity between the Member States, based on shared responsibilities. Otherwise the policy will not be a fair one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is absolutely right for it to be pointed out in this resolution that the Dublin II Regulation has been, and continues to be, a failure. The Regulation has meant that countries in the southern and eastern parts of the EU, primarily, have been given the ability to decide the fate of migrants without taking any account of the immigration policies and needs of the other Member States. It is highly peculiar, as well as unacceptable, that the EU should have been experimenting with a common migration policy for a decade. All these political experiments have undermined the Member States’ right of self-determination in relation to migration whilst at the same time causing great suffering amongst migrants. The solution to the situation we face today is not to give the EU even more powers in the area of immigration so that it can continue its failed immigration policy, but to give back to the Member States their right of self-determination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is obviously no question of changing the laws on immigration and the right of asylum on the model of Switzerland, where 68% of those who went to the polls have just voted in favour of a new law on immigration and more stringent conditions of access to the right of asylum, so equipping themselves with one of the most restrictive sets of laws in Europe.</p>

I should particularly like to emphasise the importance of the International Labour Organization (ILO) for all Indian workers. Although the report calls on foreign investors to discharge their political responsibilities, by applying the International Labour Organization's core labour standards, I should like to stress that this should, of course, also apply to Indian employers, in order to create consistent structures within India so that inequalities can be addressed and work quality can be improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report is a piece of left-wing, feminist agitation that cannot bring any positive results. We are completely opposed to the theory of gender equality and to all of the requirements based on this mistaken approach to human society. We look upon people as individual citizens with individual rights and freedoms guaranteed by the State and not as collective groups pre-determined by gender and with collective rights. Equality before the law has long been a reality in all countries. In the EU Members States all men and women enjoy freedom and make use of it in various ways as they see fit, and an example of this would be the way that women devote more time to looking after children more than men do. The requirement for equality between men and women conflicts with the idea of freedom. Consequently, we cannot under any circumstances support quotas for women in the boardrooms of public companies, as proposed in the report. I also disagree with the rapporteur’s belief that the liberalisation of world trade will bring men and women the world over fresh opportunities for fulfilment and greater wealth. We therefore voted against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Free trade increases wealth and reduces poverty. In recent decades, globalisation has led to dramatic improvements in standards of living, not least amongst women and children.

<p class="contents">In this report, the focus is on form instead of substance. Equality is important, especially in terms of the working world, where a situation in which women receive their own wages contributes considerably to their becoming independent and gaining control over their own lives.

It finds that inequality continues to exist between women and men both within and outside the European Union in terms of their opportunities to pursue education and work. At the same time, the report draws attention to the important fact that so-called 'women’s work', including caring for the family and providing social care, has been traditionally unrecognised and unremunerated.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that women already contribute significantly in economic terms in both the public and private spheres. Many international trade and development policies have in the past failed to recognise the extent to which women in developing countries engage in income-related activities and control the household budget. I therefore welcome and support calls for policies to encourage greater economic participation by women with the aim of further improving their status and boosting their income and assets. I also support the report’s recommendation that EU Member States should follow Norway’s example in providing for a 40% quota in female representation on the boards of its joint-stock companies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report maintains that the growth of trade has made it easier for women to enter the modern industrial economy and to do so more quickly than before. Allow me to make an observation: all too often statements of principle do not correspond to reality; in fact, female entrepreneurs continue to encounter huge problems, partly because they often represent small and medium-sized enterprises or distributors and the craft industry, sectors that are being increasingly affected by the globalisation of markets, a process that all too often lacks clear and common rules.</p>
<p class="contents">What is in fact required is not only more economic aid, but also more structural aid, in order to support women in the world of work and enterprise and to take a firm stand against this pseudoculture that sees women’s social and economic rights – as sanctioned by the Beijing Platform for Action – ignored or even labelled obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite our vote in favour of the report, I must point out that the Union’s political and practical task is to tackle, with courageous proposals, the negative aspects that penalise a broad cross-section of women, especially in the poorest countries, but also in the EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, I can only endorse its conclusions, which recommend, and I quote: ‘radically changing the European Union’s trade policies’. It has taken a report by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for the rights not just of women, but of all workers, to at last be taken into account in the current globalisation process sought and undergone by Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is almost naïve in her apparent discovery that competitive pressure in an increasingly globalised economy leads to a reduction in salaries and operating costs, to unemployment, to relocations and to the closure of businesses. The figures are in fact very worrying: 70% of the 1.3 billion people who live in poverty worldwide are women.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I must admit that it is worth stressing here that gender inequality, particularly in Asia and Africa, where women are humiliated, scorned and considered inferior to men, obviously creates difficulties in the economic, commercial, social and political fields.

In remote areas especially, such as the Aegean Islands in Greece, survival depends on fishing, which also helps to maintain local cultural traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent years there have been numerous problems, in coastal fisheries in particular, partly caused by the COM, vessel scrapping programmes, the reduction in first-sale prices to fishermen, with no concomitant reduction for consumers, and increased costs due to increased fuel prices. As a result, the industry is in crisis, incomes are falling drastically and areas are being abandoned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication identifies the difficulties in the industry, but the solutions it proposes are not viable. They not only fail to resolve the problems; they also create more. In addition, no provision whatsoever is made for the subsidies needed for the industry, as the rapporteur rightly points out.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, it proposes a reduction of fishing effort and fleet adjustment; in other words, a cessation of activity resulting in unemployment for a large number of small and medium-sized fishing undertakings and the concentration of the fleet among a few large undertakings. This policy of the ΕU and the governments is condemnable, because it creates a cartel in several industries, which exploit producers and consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The regulation is designed to prevent shark finning where shark carcasses are thrown overboard after high-value shark fins have been removed. The practice of shark finning is known to endanger the survival of several shark species.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background the EPLP is appalled and disappointed that the Miguélez Ramos report before us threatens to increase shark finning. Paragraph 5 of the report requests an increase of the 5% fin to live weight ratio to 6.5%, particularly for blue sharks. Paragraph 5 of the report incorrectly implies that ICES and ICATT support an increase in the fins to live weight ratio for the blue shark. A paper was submitted to ICES in 2005, but ICES has not considered this paper or issued an opinion. Likewise in ICATT where scientists have reviewed fin to carcass ratios but have not recommended an increase of the fin to carcass ratio.</p>

<p class="contents">I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity to report on the successful outcome of the Sixth Summit of the Asia-Europe Meeting held in Helsinki on 10 and 11 September. The summit was attended by all 39 ASEM partners, including the Commission, 35 of them at Head of State or Government level. The very high attendance testifies to the great importance attached by partners to the Asia-Europe relationship as ASEM enters its second decade.</p>
<p class="contents">Foremost among the deliverables of the summit was the decision to admit Bulgaria, Romania, India, Mongolia, Pakistan and the ASEAN Secretariat to ASEM. The opening to South-East Asia is an historic development which will significantly reinforce ASEM’s collective weight in promoting multilateralism and advancing shared policy goals in the international arena.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the overarching theme of ‘Global Challenges – Joint Responses’, President Barroso stressed the borderless nature of the challenges and threats facing today’s world and the need for a concerted response. Global issues such as terrorism and health threats could only be tackled through the multilateral international system, with the UN at its core.</p>
<p class="contents">To preserve an open and fair multilateral trading system, it was essential to resume the Doha negotiations as soon as circumstances permit. However, appropriate economic, education, employment and social policies had to be adopted to improve society’s capacity to adjust and enhance social cohesion while pursuing productivity growth. The development of a knowledge society was another essential element in ensuring sustainable growth and global competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The President joined other partners in giving strong support to intercultural and interfaith dialogue. Harmony in diversity was possible, and there could only be zero tolerance for intolerance. The President shared with others deep concern at the progress of climate change, and called on partners to work together to achieve efficient, clean and sustainable energy use and the reduction of emissions. It was significant that the summit was able to adopt an ambitious Declaration on Climate Change, containing a common undertaking to fully implement commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention and its Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaders engaged in really open and frank discussions on major regional developments including the Korean Peninsula, Burma/Myanmar and the Middle East. In the presence of the Burma/Myanmar Foreign Minister, Member States expressed deep disappointment at the lack of progress towards democracy in the country since the Hanoi Summit in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking forward, the summit adopted a Declaration on the Future of ASEM, identifying areas on which ASEM should focus its work to prepare for the next summit in Beijing in 2008 and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the bilateral summits with the Republic of Korea and China, President Barroso had meetings with the President of Indonesia and the Prime Minister of Singapore, and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner met the Foreign Ministers of Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of ASEM’s value lies in its ability to bring into play all relevant stakeholders. The President of the Asia-Europe Parliamentary Partnership addressed the leaders at the summit for the first time, and representatives of NGOs, business communities and trade unions also met alongside the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">The Helsinki Summit has given ASEM a fresh vitality as it enters its second decade and, with the enlargement, an even greater capacity to influence the international agenda. The Commission will continue to fulfil its role in seeking to realise the forum’s full potential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The emergence of the geostrategic and geoeconomic role of Asia and the dynamic appearance of strong emerging economies are shaping the new international framework within which the European Union is being called up to face up to the serious political, economic, energy and environmental challenges being created by globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Asia is giving dynamic presence to and affecting the international system and is helping to shape the new power correlations of the 21st century. Nor is it a coincidence – even at a symbolic level – that the new UN Secretary General will come from Asia. The need, therefore, for the European Union to effectively develop the new Asian environment is now becoming more urgent. The institutionalisation of the annual summits is contributing towards dialogue and multilateral cooperation in crucial sectors for the future of mankind, such as peace, security, energy, the environment and economic and social development. From this point of view, the ASEM summit in Helsinki had positive results, because it confirmed certain basic principles of multilateral cooperation and highlighted the basic priorities for meeting the new international challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not delude ourselves or cultivate major expectations, because the European Union does not have an integrated common strategy for Asia, with policies and mechanisms that will affect developments. The national strategies of the Member States do not add up to a stable basis for the common European strategy. In addition, the strong Asian countries – over and above the framework of general pronouncements – have already formulated and are consistently following their national strategic agenda in the fields of energy, trade and the resolution of international and regional problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, multilateral cooperation and the rules of conduct are being cited on their terms, for example, in the fields of environmental protection, workers' social rights and women's and children's rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to comment in particular on the fact that the European Union may record a positive statistical balance in its economic and trade relations with the countries of Asia; however, this cannot conceal the unfortunate fact of Asia's shortcomings in the protection of human rights and democratic freedoms and defence of the principles of tolerance and diversity. The recent coup in Thailand and the democratic deficit in numerous countries of Asia confirm this. In addition, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism is jeopardising stability and security as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a feeling that at every summit there is a surfeit of wish lists and a lack of clear commitments and objectives being laid down for implementation. That is why the European Commission could table some ideas with us for the operational follow-up to the summits and the need – in my opinion – for relations between the European Union and Asia to be institutionalised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is in fact making a great deal of sense in what it has just put forward, and it is sad that we have not been able to express it in a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">This dialogue does of course give priority to economic cooperation, of which I am very much in favour as a means of further strengthening economic ties – in the shape of both trade and investment – between the European Union and Asia, which has enormous economic potential, with South Korea, for example, having achieved impressive results. Fifty years ago, it was still a developing country, but now some 97% of its people between the ages of 25 and 34 have completed at least secondary schooling – the highest percentage in the industrialised world. Investment in education brings an abundant return in the shape of an expanding and flourishing economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Our economic programmes need to be extended to include the promotion of contacts between, and joint ventures involving, small and medium-sized businesses in the European Union and Asia, as well as cooperation between such bodies as local authorities and universities. I also rejoice to see that the Commission is now seeking to give serious consideration to the possibility of concluding bilateral trade agreements with Asian countries, certainly with Singapore, and possibly also with Thailand. You might, of course, also consider such countries as Malaysia and Indonesia in the absence of any global trade agreement. I see that as a good way of moving forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">If, though, you are going to have dealings with Asia, you cannot, of course, consider the economy in isolation from other matters, and it is, to my mind, unthinkable that this House should keep silent in the face of the recent <span class="italic">coup d’état</span> in Thailand, where, on 19 September, a military body calling itself the ‘Council for Democratic Reform’ overthrew the democratically elected government, one about which we may well have had serious doubts, but, even so, if you want to be rid of that sort of government, a military coup is not the answer. We see, then, that Thailand, a country that really was on the way to being a stable democracy of the kind that would be an example to the world and certainly to Asia, has taken a step backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Parliament buildings and the law courts have been closed, foreign television stations can no longer operate, and the local channels, under military control, are broadcasting patriotic songs. Even the weblogs of people in Thailand have been shut down and subjected to censorship. It is clear that there is good cause to be very worried about this, and the European Union, in dealing with this state of affairs, must put democratic values first and foremost. I therefore find our treatment of Taiwan highly incorrect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, human rights must also feature in this sort of dialogue. There are indeed disturbing things going on in the Philippines and in Myanmar, and I am glad that these are being talked about. I do, however, want to congratulate the Commission – and, in this instance, the Council too – on the ASEM summit. We have, in the past, taken a highly critical line, particularly of the Council’s stance and of its failure to be present at this summit. This time, though, there was something of an improvement, and I hope that that will continue. I wish the Commission success in its efforts to this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Innovation is the key to Europe’s prospects of becoming more competitive on a global level. Protection of intellectual property is of crucial importance, because IPR not only rewards investment in new products and services but also ensures the transfer of technology stimulating further innovation. The recent consultation on the future of the patent system in Europe delivered one simple message: the legal framework should offer an affordable patent protection for all businesses, small and big, ensure legal certainty and be applied for the benefit of all players. A solid legal framework is therefore essential. I must repeat that we need to keep up. Compared to our major trading partners, Europe is losing ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community patent remains blocked in the Council, but recognising the economic importance of patents, I felt that it was not a good thing to leave the entire patent agenda in limbo. So, earlier this year, as you know, I launched a broad consultation of all interested parties on future patent policy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultation has shown that industry favours the Commission’s effort to simplify the patent system in Europe and to make it more cost-effective. There are two major issues here: languages, or translation costs, on the one hand and the jurisdictional system on the other. There is strong support for the introduction of a Community patent. However, industry is not enamoured of the political compromise reached in the Council in 2003 on the Community patent. It rejects the proposed solutions on both language and the jurisdictional system because they do not achieve the cost reductions and simplification of the patent system that industry is calling for.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, there is also a strong call for the improvement of the existing European patent system, established by the Munich Convention, by the successful conclusion of a European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) on jurisdiction, and by the ratification and entry into force of the London Agreement on language arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting to note that no single initiative for the improvement of the EU patent system has received unanimous support from stakeholders. Different stakeholders highlight different aspects, and many suggest that a package of different measures is needed, which should be implemented in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore convinced that we need to take a multi-faceted approach. In order to succeed, we should tackle all the patent issues in one package. That package will have to respond to stakeholders’ criticism and needs. We will only succeed if we can demonstrate that what we propose will have added value compared to the status quo<span class="italic">,</span> in particular, regarding costs of patenting (translation costs) and legal certainty (jurisdictional system). We are currently working on the options for the way forward and will present them in a communication and action plan, which the Commission should adopt before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">A key component of this work concerns the jurisdictional issue. At present, although business has a one-stop shop where it can acquire a patent (the EPO), it may find itself defending the patent on several fronts at once. That is because the patents granted by the European Patent Office are in fact a bundle of national patents and can only be enforced by national courts. The possibility of multi-forum litigation concerning the same invention naturally adds cost, but even more importantly it creates uncertainty, as different courts in different countries can deliver diverging interpretations on the same patented invention. We need to tackle that issue as a matter of urgency. The current ‘patchwork’ may prevent patent holders from being able to enforce their rights and it discourages candidates, in particular SMEs looking for efficient and affordable patent protection, from using the European patent. Europe is, at present, unable to offer innovative businesses an optimal solution when it comes to protecting their intellectual property. We cannot aspire to be the most competitive economy in the world if we do not find workable solutions for patent application and protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community patent and the initiatives to improve the European patent, that is, the London Agreement on translations and the EPLA, are not mutually exclusive. They both aim for the same goal: a better, cheaper, more reliable patent system. That is why I want to pursue both. We face similar challenges in designing the jurisdictional arrangements for the Community patent: we need to find a unified system that provides judicial independence and gives clarity and reliability to patent users while avoiding both over-centralisation and fragmentation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve that objective, the Community needs to get involved in the EPLA, which addresses shared responsibilities between Member States and the Community. It goes without saying that Parliament will have to contribute when the Community proceeds with the required proposals, in order to take this issue forward in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware of some critical voices against the EPLA. Let me just say that I see the EPLA as a practical initiative to bring greater unity to the case law on patents in Europe. And legal certainty is what our industry, big and small alike, need. There are hundreds of thousands of patents granted by the EPO. Even if we had a Community patent, there would be a need to streamline the jurisdiction process for EPO-granted patents.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to us to get involved in this initiative to ensure that it serves the competitiveness of our economy. I recognise that there are legitimate doubts and concerns: the cost of litigation under the EPLA, the impact of the rules of procedure, which we have yet to see, and the independence of the EPLA judges from the EPO. But I am convinced that the best way to confront these problems is by engaging actively with the process and by securing an outcome that is satisfactory and fair to all concerned and in full conformity with EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, neither the Community patent nor the EPLA are a panacea. There will always be businesses – the smaller ones – that prefer to deal with their national patent offices, or to use business models that do not rely on patents. We need to look at ways in which we can help and support them. And, of course, we need to ensure that large companies do not abuse their position, either by unfairly exploiting their own patents or by unfairly ignoring the patent rights of others.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultation threw up many such issues, for example, the possible mediation mechanisms that could precede litigation, the need to create technology markets that would enable businesses to trade their IPR more successfully, and the idea of exchanging best practice between national patent offices, especially in terms of the special needs of SMEs. I will be responding to all these issues, in cooperation with my colleagues in the Commission, and therefore intend to propose a comprehensive strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with a 21st-century global and knowledge-based economy, we urgently need to find a solution to the patent issue. I count upon Parliament’s support in finding a comprehensive solution to these rather complex issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know, we launched the Lisbon process together in 2000, and, since then, we have worked tirelessly to point out, in declarations of the Heads of State or Government and in Parliamentary resolutions, that the development of the European patent system is one of the most important preconditions that will enable us to reach the goals defined by Lisbon. I was impressed by Commissioner McCreevy's emphasis on the importance of this matter. Our goal must be to achieve a simple, cost-effective patent, applicable throughout Europe if at all possible, which gives not only big business but, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises the opportunity to protect their innovations in the internal market: indeed, it is medium-sized enterprises that hold the greatest number of innovative patents.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisive issue is that we must make changes in Europe's current fragmented patent landscape, with the aim of drastically reducing consultancy, procedural and translation costs, which are a particular burden on small and medium-sized enterprises. That is the decisive goal that we must achieve. Of course, people can already obtain protection for their inventions throughout Europe, but, in practice, they have to do so in all Member States, either directly through the national patent offices or indirectly through the European Patent Office, with the bundle of patents that has been mentioned. In the event of disputes or infringements they must, in theory, launch proceedings, incur legal costs and so on in all these countries. This must be resolved and made more viable and practicable, particularly for SMEs. The internal market needs to be developed further in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Under your predecessor, Mr Bolkestein, an admirable proposal for a single European patent regulation to establish a Community patent was set in motion. However, when Article 308 is the legal basis and unanimity in the Council is required, it is difficult to reach agreement. In this particular case, agreement could not be reached in the dispute about languages: there are currently 20 official languages that the Council is demanding; after the next enlargement there will be 22. The industry is quite rightly saying that nobody needs that sort of patent: it is so exorbitantly expensive that it is of no use and practically no economic value. The competitiveness of the European patent would push us a long way back in global terms and not guarantee the necessary quality. A patent of this kind would only be of benefit to very big, rich businesses that could afford that kind of thing, and perhaps not even to them. For medium-sized businesses it would be completely unusable. Therefore, the Regulation is stuck fast, and the Council is not shifting.</p>
<p class="contents">My suggestion of continuing with harmonisation, which you were so good as to include in the consultation, Commissioner, was also rejected by all parties, primarily following our experiences with the second reading of the Directive on computer-implemented inventions, which showed that there was a risk that legislation could be enacted that would not improve the current patent system, but would make it considerably worse.</p>
<p class="contents">So, we have made no progress with harmonisation either. What, then, is left for us to do? What is left is that we must carry on and further develop the currently existing patent system. There are, however, institutional problems in this regard: on the one hand, the European Union's fully legitimate claim that the Member States should not legislate in areas that, at any rate, actually lie partly in its sphere of competence and belong to the internal market; and, on the other hand, the Member States' keenness to make progress. I take the position that we must try to link these two problems together to solve them. In my view, one conceivable option would be for the European Union to be involved in some way – to be decided by negotiations – in the European patent agreement and, in return, for the European Union to clear up the institutional concerns regarding the European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA). This could be one way in which we could improve the situation while agreement cannot be reached in the Council regarding a Community patent.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the lobby's publicly expressed criticisms, in my view, the claim that the introduction of a single European patent court within the meaning of the EPLA would make it easier to patent software is, to put it mildly, nonsense. It is pure speculation for which there is no evidence – one of those matters comes under procedural law, and one under substantive law. Nor is the EPLA more expensive. It must be clear that apples are being compared with oranges here. If the EPLA is in place, it will not be necessary to pursue legal disputes in all the countries involved: one court, the second instance, so to speak, will reach a judgment that is equally binding on all signatory States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most grateful to Commissioner McCreevy for the way in which the consultation was conducted. I gather from the Commissioner's public comments that he, too, has obviously drawn the right conclusions from the results of the consultation. I should like to say, both personally and on behalf of the great majority of my group, that we share and support this position. There is no alternative. Otherwise, the grand project of developing the European patent system is doomed to failure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am going to address you on behalf of three political groups and of even more than that, just as my fellow Member and friend, Mr Lehne, also did.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this debate is due to the initiative of the European Parliament and it was born out of our desire to respond positively to your consultation. We thank you for it and we congratulate you on it.</p>
<p class="contents">After the difficulties that we encountered concerning the patentability of software, we were pleased that the Commission – with you yourself acting as intermediary - is launching a procedure aimed at restarting discussions and preparatory work on the European patent.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we clashed swords; we disagreed on several points. I have just listened to you extremely carefully. I can say that I agree with virtually everything you just said. I totally agree, but there is one argument that you have not mentioned, and, because of your silence, that is the one that I am led to wonder about and that, while we are still without a solution, currently leaves those that I represent in a rather negative state of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain myself a little more. All of us in this Chamber, as Europeans, want the Community patent. I have that in common with my fellow Member and friend, Mr Lehne, who just spoke with his customary eloquence.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that this patent has come up against enormous difficulties and that it is at a standstill. The main reason for this standstill is language-related. In reality, the four factors causing this standstill are the language problem, the cost problem, the problem of the legal consistency of the judicature and the sovereignty problem - the one about which you have not spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly believe that the real means of breaking the political, cultural and intellectual deadlock at the Council regarding the European patent is mainly connected with solving the language problem. Unlike my fellow Member, Mr Lehne, I am not just a European Member who is in favour of Europe; I am also French. Nobody is perfect, you will forgive me for that. I should like to state in this House that I believe that the ratification of the London agreement – something that my country has not yet officially endorsed, although I advise it to do so – would be an opportunity for us all to overcome our linguistic arrogance and the hostility that it creates and to learn to live together, in the knowledge that one language dominates the others worldwide. We may not like it, but that is how things are; it is convenient. That is what would potentially break the deadlock on the start of plans for a Community patent. We would therefore agree to the resolution resulting from these debates saying so.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is one of cost; I will hardly touch on it, except to say that three-quarters of the cost factor are language-related – that is the problem that I am going to address – and that the remaining quarter is modest, that the EPLA probably needs to be improved and that it is outrageous to think that we might see the ratification of an agreement that many experts say would increase costs. We do not need that.</p>
<p class="contents">The only problem about which you have not spoken is that of knowing which legislative sovereignty will define and develop over time the field of what is patentable and what is unpatentable.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament will be extremely sensitive to anything to do with the patentability of living matter, which is a significant problem for civilisation. Moreover, as regards software, we cannot ratify the EPLA, because the EPLA gives a professional group of judges a partly international, partly European function: that of making changes to the case law as they see fit, without any legislative control or sovereignty having a bearing on their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we do not accept: the idea that European sovereignty will play no part in defining the scope. Therefore, since the EPLA is a body of autonomous jurisdictions blocking and holding up the implementation of the European patent, we reject the EPLA and we advise you …</p>

I made my own submission and I have read many of the others and I think that what you have just given us is a very fair summary. I would also like to thank you for having moved that consultation day to a day that did not clash with a Strasbourg session, so that I and other MEPs were able to attend.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a very useful exercise, because it has shown the extent of the problems with the Community patent proposals. Translations, as we knew, were a problem but now it shows that the need for a litigation system, with specialist judges that are accessible within Member States, is another. We all want single market considerations to prevail and that leads eventually to having a Community patent, but the consultation shows that there are steps that can be taken to improve the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The EPLA initiative by Member States, which is optional, embraces some of those steps. It is still work in progress, so now there is an opportunity for you to participate and I welcome the fact that you say you are going to take that opportunity. That can only be helpful in working towards a goal in which there is eventually a single or merged European and Community patent system. Maybe you can help to fix some of the criticisms of EPLA. One fix I would like is to minimise court fees, rather than force litigants to bear all the costs of judges’ salaries and the establishment costs of the appeal court. A second fix I would like is the retention of national patent courts, instead of phasing them out after seven years. Surely they could remain, in the same way that national patent filings have now coexisted with European patents for nearly 30 years.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the possibility of having nationally based courts of first instance and a panel of judges, with at least one who is technically qualified and at least two who are legally qualified and from different Member States, might be superior to the current ECJ arrangements, were they to apply to a Community patent.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rocard and some others have criticised EPLA, since it would allow EPO Board of Appeal members to become technical judges. That objection is based solely upon not agreeing with particular decisions in one or two areas of technology. It takes no account of the publicly available record showing that technical boards of the EPO are independent of both the EPO examining division and EPO practices. It ignores the fact that, in the EPLA structure, such technical judges would be in the minority among national judges who have been praised by those of the same persuasion as Mr Rocard for their stance in those areas of technology. However, I question whether we would want them to be able to have the two jobs at once – I do not think that was intended – and I think that could be clarified.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the appointment of judges via representatives from Member State governments follows the precedents of many institutions, including the ECJ, so I do not think there is huge substance in these arguments and it would certainly be a mistake for the Commission to miss out on contributing to and learning from the EPLA process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We always speak about a competitive, knowledge-based Europe, but some people put so little trust in Europe’s potential that they prefer to strengthen a non-EU body – the European Patent Office – to the detriment of European Union interests. If what we want is harmonised jurisdiction, why do we not pursue that aim through EU directives? That would be the most obvious way to proceed. Some people are afraid to face the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">After the software patent fight, apparently there are people who are worried about the amendments that the European Parliament would propose. Therefore they want to proceed as undemocratically as possible. They want to put the fate of Europe’s companies in the hands of the patent bureaucracy instead of elected policymakers. Furthermore, the cost of litigations would be tough to meet for SMEs because every litigation concerning an EPO patent would go directly before a new international court – a real own-goal for Europe’s competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to draw your attention to the fact that some big multinationals such as Nokia and GlaxoSmithKline are very concerned about such a proposal. If this proposal neither helps SMEs nor is welcomed by big countries, who will help? What we can infer for sure is that it will only increase the work for some patent lawyers. Europe does not need merely more patents: it needs more high-quality patents that foster real innovation. The number of patent applications filed at the European Patent Office per year has, over the last seven years, increased by about 60%. However, that number does not correspond to an increase in innovative activity, therefore giving us cause for concern over an extension of the scope of Patent Office subject matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We will keep repeating to our colleagues, and especially to the Commissioner, that only a Community framework creates the conditions for an effective, competitive European patent law at international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament was also persuaded that patenting software would stifle invention, cripple small businesses and harm the economy, and yet this year the Commission returns with an even more sweeping proposal, which would permit software to be patented.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is for a single patent court, whose judiciary would be appointed by the same board as that which appoints judges to the present appeals court of the existing – purely advisory – European Patent Office. The Commission has a seat on the Board and, under this proposal, would acquire voting rights as well. This raises serious doubts about the independence of the new court, especially when we consider that the EPO has no scruples about issuing patents for software and that this proposal commits a single patent court to following the precedents set by previous EPO decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">By the proposal’s own admission, litigation in this new court will be two to three times more costly than litigation in national patent courts, which this proposal will also abolish, thus putting appeal to this court beyond the reach of all but large corporations. I thought the computer-implemented inventions directive was bad until I saw this proposal. If it goes through, I shall gladly take the Leninist view that worse is better. Nevertheless, we should say no again and ask the Commissioners what part of no they do not understand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why solutions are needed which will enable the process of harmonising patent law to begin. Accordingly, a clear definition of what can and cannot be patented is required. It is important not to resort to using patent law in isolation from the innovations themselves, because by its very nature a patent implies that free competition is restricted to a certain degree. A harmonising directive would be the best solution from the point of view of the Community’s interest, but Parliament rejected the Commission’s previous proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Other solutions must therefore be sought. One idea mooted is for all Member States of the Union to accept and ratify the EPLA Convention. It should be borne in mind, however, that we can only support this Convention when it meets the criteria deemed essential by the Union. Amongst others, these criteria include drawing up a clear definition, as far as is possible, of what may be patented ensuring the independence of ruling bodies and guaranteeing the total impartiality of the judges who rule on patent protection and the validity of patents. The costs relating to the protection of patent rights must also be balanced and easy to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the reasons why we are not in a position to adopt the Convention at present. Its implications may be difficult to assess, because although it is obvious that the EPLA concerns institutional solutions, the potential impact on substantive law should not be overlooked, particularly where the practices of the European Patent Office are concerned. That is why I am asking the Commission to provide a detailed impact assessment for each of the proposals submitted here. Nonetheless, it is most important to make it clear that Parliament does want a change of patent policy. The kind of change we have in mind, however, must satisfy the needs of both large businesses and small and medium-sized European firms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I must point out that we Members of the European Parliament are here representing our constituents, and the reactions I have received from constituents from the industrial sector in my country to this proposal have been negative. They are negative for various reasons: the issue of languages – I believe that the solution proposed is much worse than the one we have in the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, which offers greater language plurality – and the issue of jurisdiction, which has already been discussed here.</p>
<p class="contents">We have our own jurisdiction, which is that of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the Court of First Instance, and the creation or multiplication of jurisdictions outside of the European Union raises a series of problems that we must take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">My feeling is that this proposal may be doomed to failure, like previous proposals, as a result of not taking these factors into account. We need to make progress on patents, but, in order to do so, we must have a broad political base.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would say that, at the moment, jurisdictional procedures which extend beyond the structure of the European Union do not inspire confidence − we have great confidence in the wonderful institutions of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance − and, secondly, that the issue of languages is not a trivial matter. I know that many people have a language of a more universal nature, but within the European Union we have sought solutions to the language problem, because the European Union includes diverse cultures, diverse models and diverse legal systems, and they must be able to co-exist.</p>

We have spent more than thirty years talking about patents, and it is particularly strange that so many Members should be critical of your ideas, even though almost all the EU’s Member States are signatories to the Munich Convention. By so doing, they are implying a lack of confidence in our Member States; that I find in itself a pretty strange kind of deadlock, and I also think that there is something odd about the fact that a Community patent still cannot be discussed at Council level.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, the EU has no democratic control over the European Patent Office, and that is of course much to be regretted. We go along with your way of thinking, and it would be good if the EU were to do as it did at the Hague conference, were to take part as a political and economic organisation, so that we, as part of it, could have influence on what happens. If that happens, then intergovernmentalism is no longer the order of the day, and the community method will have been adopted. We would be happy to see the EU taking part in the Munich Convention in the same way, so that the Commission – and, perhaps, Parliament too – might be able to exercise ongoing democratic oversight over what goes on. Together, then, with the Group of the European People’s Party and with the Liberals – and I hope that the Socialist Group will join us in supporting this – we have brought in a resolution endorsing your position and with the intention of examining what options are available. We see that as the only solution if the Council is going to keep sitting on this for so long.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not talking here about the rules governing languages or about the costs, and we certainly have no desire to suspend the national courts, but there must eventually be a special chamber at the European Court of Justice with specialist judges capable of determining how patents should be dealt with across Europe in the event of cases coming to trial.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the computer-implemented inventions to which Mr Rocard referred, we do not want to open that particular Pandora’s box again; I agree with him that doing that would be a very tedious business. We can also see that mistakes may well still be being made within the EPO, and, for the simple reason that we cannot correct them, it is important that we follow this up.</p>
<p class="contents">I was very struck by the words of an Irish Commissioner, who recently said, in Finland: ‘No more fine words about Lisbon; we are now going into action’. I hope that that is what you are going to do, for you, Commissioner, were the person who said that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all agree that the situation is not perfect and we all know that there are different views as to the right solutions. I am convinced that in an ideal world the Community patent <span class="italic">is</span> the solution, but in the real world there is no prospect of agreement on the Community patent in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">So should I sit around doing nothing, just waiting for something to turn up? Well, that would certainly be an easy way out, but it would also be grossly irresponsible, because nothing will happen unless we take the initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultation delivered some clear and important messages. There is an overwhelming desire for a patent system that is simpler and more cost-effective and maintains the highest standards in the quality of its examination and grant procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">All the stakeholders went to great lengths to convey their views to us. Now, quite rightly, they expect action. And I agree. I believe the time has come to make a concerted push to improve the patent system in Europe. As policymakers and regulators, it is our duty.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently, we are at a standstill. We have to take the first most difficult step in one direction or another. There <span class="italic">is</span> no perfect solution. No single element will provide all the answers. We need to combine different instruments to meet the different needs of different stakeholders. As I said in my introductory remarks, the Community patent and the EPLA are not mutually exclusive initiatives; indeed, our aim should be to ensure that they converge. In both cases our goal is the same: a better, cheaper, more reliable patent system.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not blind to the potential drawbacks and dangers of the EPLA. But we have a better chance of getting the right outcome for Europe’s business if we actively engage in the negotiation of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The patent strategy now contains more than just our future plans for a Community patent and EPLA. There is a whole range of framing and supporting measures that we need to consider, most of them directed at smaller companies. Our objective is to produce a system that meets the needs of all stakeholders at all levels – national, European and Community –and provides a fair balance between the diverse interests involved.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final point. As a politician for 30 years now, I am not easily surprised. But this week I have been mildly surprised. I was mildly surprised that the outline for our future strategy, which I set out in a speech in Helsinki some weeks ago, has been used by some to make assertions that the Commission wishes to bring the computer-implemented inventions question back on to the agenda. Now I am used to hearing strong arguments and to links being made, but this one leaves me quite perplexed. I have stated before this House on various occasions that as long as I am Commissioner for the Single Market and Services the Commission will <span class="italic">not</span> present <span class="italic">any</span> initiative and will not carry out any work on this. Some might like that, others might disapprove. But this Parliament rejected the common position last year. I respect and accept that decision and will do absolutely nothing to turn it around.</p>

I should like once again, at the close of the sitting, to protest strongly against this. We were told that this was the second sitting in September, but that is incorrect: we held the August plenary session at the beginning of September, and this is now the September plenary session, so to speak. As such, it is our right to hold a topical and urgent debate at each regular sitting in Strasbourg.

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>First it needs to be stressed that it is the responsibility of the Member States to develop and practise a policy to reduce youth unemployment and poverty. The Finnish Presidency will continue the processes that have already been established to compare policies in Member States whenever the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council is sitting.</p>
<p>The importance of youth employment is repeatedly highlighted in the European Employment Strategy. The following objectives and benchmarks, which particularly concern the young, have been agreed under the Lisbon Strategy and within the framework of the European Employment Strategy:</p>
<p>Firstly, every young person will be offered a new start before reaching six months of unemployment. They will be offered education, retraining, job training, a job or some other means of promoting employment.</p>
<p>Secondly, at least 85% of 22-year-olds will have completed secondary education in the EU by the year 2010.</p>
<p>Additional guidance on how these objectives could and should be achieved is given to Member States in the guidelines for employment policies 2005-2008 adopted by the Council in 2005.</p>
<p>First of all, it should be realised that all Member States had already included young people in their national reform programmes for 2005-2008, which they presented in autumn 2005. Member States, however, were asked to propose their own priority objectives, and they have chosen different ways of dealing with youth employment issues. It should also be realised that the targets set at EU level have already been achieved in some Member States.</p>
<p>The Member States are at present updating their national reform programmes, which will probably be finalised at the end of October this year. The national reform programmes and the related measures taken to improve youth employment will be examined during the Finnish presidential term: in November by the Employment Committee and again in December by the Social Affairs Council. The findings will be submitted to the Commission, which will draft its annual report based on them.</p>
<p>The Member States are also currently preparing their national action programmes for the next phase of the European Social Fund (2007-2013). The links between the ESF and the policy framework – that is, the European Employment Strategy – will be strengthened so that the ESF can have a more effective role to play in achieving targets on employment under the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Employment. It is intended to use the ESF to support efforts aimed at extending and enhancing investment in human capital, in particular by improving educational and training systems. One aim is to enhance employability among students by improving the way vocational training can be adapted to the needs of the job market. In this way, Member States can include in their programmes measures to boost the employability of young people, reduce the drop-out rate among students and support the transition from education to employment.</p>
<p>With regard to youth poverty, the mid-term evaluations of the EU’s Lisbon Strategy revealed that the young have benefited less than other age groups from policies to encourage inclusion and dynamic job market policies. The honourable Member can ask the Commission for further information on this.</p>
<p>The Council and Commission Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion 2006 stressed that action under the Open Method of Co-ordination needs to focus clearly on child and youth poverty. At the same time, the crucial importance of general education and vocational training was highlighted in aiming to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty.</p>
<p>During the Finnish Presidency, the Social Protection Committee will have the opportunity to continue the debate on this subject while the Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion 2007 is being prepared on the basis of national action programmes on social inclusion for the period 2006-2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0698"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>In connection with this, allow me to remind you of the important commitments to regional integration given at the Fourth EU-Latin America/Caribbean Summit in Vienna on 12 May 2006 and in the Council’s conclusions on the Commission communication on Latin America. The Council acknowledges that the European Parliament has done much to encourage regional integration in Latin America and to improve relations with organisations in the region.</p>
<p>Paragraph 32 of the Declaration of Vienna states: “Regional integration is a key element for stability, economic growth and investment and for increasing the importance of both regions on the world stage. We affirm the principles of co-operation and solidarity as a basis of our integration processes. In this context, we encourage and strongly support Latin American and Caribbean countries to proceed with their respective regional integration processes.”</p>
<p>Regional integration can do much to promote stability. Both are key goals of the strategic partnership between the EU and Latin America. The EU and its partner countries in Latin America have evolved comprehensive systems to promote both of these, because it requires continued and considerable effort to be able to sustain them, to implement them more effectively, to allow both sides to benefit from them, and to be able to extend them in the future. These systems go beyond commerce and cooperation. They include political dialogue aimed at trying to achieve common views, and joint action in multilateral issues in order to strengthen the EU’s capacity, and that of Latin America, to influence global questions of the greatest importance to both sides.</p>
<p>Historically, all integration processes have had their problems, and this is also true of the EU. I can justifiably say that at Vienna the EU was prominent in trying to resolve the various problems connected with the integration process in Central America, the Andean Community of Nations and Mercosur.</p>
<p>It is with particular satisfaction, then, that I can mention that at Vienna and since Vienna there is and has been adequate progress, so that now we can start the much-needed internal negotiations and take the necessary action to commence talks on Association Agreements between the EU, Central America, the Andean Community and Mercosur. The Association Agreements will complement the agreements that have already been made with Mexico and Chile and those now being negotiated with Mercosur. The European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs held a meeting to review the situation on 11 July.</p>
<p>At the same time we also discussed the possible effects of changes in the membership of the Andean Community and Mercosur due to Venezuela’s decision to go over to Mercosur. Both the current Presidency of the Andean Community, Bolivia, and its General Secretariat deserve credit for their skilful crisis management in recent weeks. Mercosur will be looking at the challenges associated with accepting a new member into its fold. This could also be discussed at the forthcoming meeting with Mercosur on political dialogue. The EU confirms that it is willing to recommence talks with Mercosur as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, may I say that, as is stated in the Council’s conclusions adopted in February 2006, it is the EU’s aim to promote integration throughout the entire region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0703"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drafted by the Presidency is not binding as such on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The Council and Commission have been keeping a close watch for several years on the trend in roaming charges. The matter has recently become a focus of greater attention, especially since October 2005, when the Commission set up the first website aimed at providing more transparent information to users of roaming services and helping them to find the best solutions in the jungle of prices and deals.</p>
<p>As a result of the Commission’s activities, operators appear to some extent to have lowered their prices and made them more transparent. International roaming charges, however, continue to vary greatly, and customers are often still unable to understand how they are calculated. The softly-softly approach would seem to have proved insufficient, and the Council in its law-making capacity is ready to consider other ways to stamp out overcharging.</p>
<p>The Commission has submitted a proposal for a regulation that might help to put things right. The Council has only just begun to discuss the proposal, which was published on 12 July 2006. It will continue the discussion in cooperation with Parliament and aim specifically for a balanced solution, avoiding distortion of the market, needless disruption to operators’ business, and price rises in other sectors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0705"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member knows, the plans of the Finnish Presidency regarding climate change were presented when Minister Jan-Erik Enestam spoke to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 12 July 2006. In brief, these plans are as follows:</p>
<p>During the next few months, the EU will prepare for international negotiations to be conducted at the follow-up conference in Nairobi (6-17 November 2006). At the conference, the EU must again show that it is a strong leader in implementing the Montreal Action Plan in order to create a basis for a system for 2012 and subsequent years which is genuinely worldwide.</p>
<p>To this end, the Presidency is raising climate change issues at summits between the EU and third countries (China, India, the Republic of Korea, ASEM, Russia, Canada). Summits between the EU and China, the Republic of Korea and ASEM have already been held, and the ASEM statement on climate is already available. In order to prepare for the international negotiations, the Council and Parliament will have an opportunity to debate the new cost-benefit analysis of the emission reduction strategy which the European Council has requested from the Commission. The EU and the USA recently decided to launch a dialogue on climate change, clean technology and sustainable development. The first meeting concerning this subject will be held in Finland this autumn.</p>
<p>In addition, the EU is continuing its work to fulfil its commitments. At the proposal of the Commission, the Council and Parliament are again reviewing the European Union's emissions trading system and assessing the second stage of the European Climate Change Programme. The Second European Climate Change Programme, which was launched in October 2005, is investigating new cost-effective options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the principles of the EU's Lisbon Strategy. New working parties have been set up to consider carbon capture and sequestration, carbon dioxide emissions from light commercial vehicles, emissions from aviation and adjustment to the impact of climate change. The working party on aviation has concentrated on technical aspects concerning the extension of emissions trading to emissions from aviation. One working party has also assessed the implementation of the policies and measures of the First European Climate Change Programme in the Member States and their impact on reducing emissions.</p>
<p>Finally it may be mentioned that Finland has compensated for the emissions arising from journeys by those attending some of the meetings which it has organised during its Presidency or offers participants an easy way of adjusting their own emission levels on a voluntary basis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0707"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly expressed its commitment to a diplomatic solution which takes account of the international concerns that exist regarding Iran's nuclear programme but at the same time affirms Iran's right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In this connection the Council welcomed the initiative by the EU's High Representative and the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, the Russian Federation and the United States of America which the Secretary-General of the Council and High Representative communicated to Iran on 6 June 2006.</p>
<p>The Council has given its full support to the balanced approach contained in this initiative and encouraged Iran to opt for the positive course of action proposed to it. The proposal would pave the way for new relations with Iran based on mutual respect and greater political and economic cooperation, while assuaging the international community's concerns about the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme.</p>
<p>The Council would recall that the Board of Governors of the IAEA and the UN Security Council have repeatedly called on Iran to halt all activities pertaining to uranium enrichment and reprocessing. On 31 July the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1606 (2006), calling on Iran to halt all activities pertaining to uranium enrichment and reprocessing, which the IAEA should be allowed to inspect. If Iran did not comply with the resolution by 31 August the UN Security Council stated that it would take measures as provided for in Chapter VII, Article 41(1), of the UN Charter.</p>
<p>The Council has stated that if Iran decides to halt all its uranium enrichment activities and implements the Additional Protocol, negotiations can resume and the procedure in the Security Council be halted.</p>
<p>On 15 September 2006 the Council noted the report of 31 August 2006 by Dr ElBaradei, the Director General of the IAEA, stating that Iran had not acted as called for in UN Security Council Resolution 1696 and expressing the opinion that it would now be appropriate to consider follow-up measures to the resolution in question. The ministers were satisfied with the negotiations which the High Representative had held with Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Secretary Ali Larijan with the aim of exploring the possibility of launching negotiations with Iran. They supported these efforts and stressed that it was important to bring about a solution quickly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0709"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>Widespread use of broadband has been on the EU's political agenda for many years and will undoubtedly remain on it in future. Broadband services bolster the attainment of the general objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, and all the development stages of the policies relating to the matter are to be considered in conjunction with the pursuit of the two objectives of the i2010 strategy (which in themselves are compatible).</p>
<p>The first objective is to create a Single European Information Space, promoting a diverse internal market based on open, competitive and electronic communication, messages and content.</p>
<p>The second objective is to create a European information society which promotes participation, in which priority is assigned to improving public services and the quality of life and, in connection with this, reducing the digital divide between the haves and have-nots with regard to access to broadband services.</p>
<p>As the Council stated in its conclusions of 1 December 2005 on the i2010 Strategy, the Member States, Community institutions and stakeholders are jointly responsible for this strategy. The Council called on Member States '… to promote the roll-out of advanced seamless networks through the rapid implementation of national strategies, aimed at increasing broadband coverage and multiplatform access, and stimulating take-up, making use, where appropriate, of EU structural funds, in line with the Commission Guidelines'<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>All the national reform programmes which Member States submitted to the Commission last year after the launching of the Lisbon Strategy discussed issues relating to broadband cover and its introduction. Significant broadband programmes are mentioned in many of the national reform programmes (AT, IE, EE, FI, FR, HU, IT, LU, LT, PT, SI and ES). Although competition is regarded as the most important factor in stimulating the development of broadband communications, EU State aid rules permit Member States to provide State aid for broadband networks in regions where coverage is poor. This is permitted where State aid is used to promote the introduction of broadband and the aid is essential in order to correct a market disturbance or unreasonably high prices for broadband services.</p>
<p>The proposed strategic guidelines for the Community's cohesion policy also state that it is important that an appropriate broadband communications infrastructure should be available at a reasonable price throughout the EU. Accordingly, it has been made a special action guideline of the new cohesion policy programmes for 2007-2013 that the availability of an information and communications infrastructure and associated services should be guaranteed, particularly in peripheral and rural areas and the new Member States, if the market cannot maintain the necessary services at a reasonable price and to a sufficient extent.</p>
<p>At the ministerial meeting in Riga from 11-13 June 2006 at which information and communications technology for a participatory society was debated, a statement was adopted concerning an information society which promotes participation, stating that a large-scale EU strategy was a precondition for this. The EU ministers decided to concentrate, inter alia, on reducing the geographical imbalance in the distribution of broadband by facilitating reasonably priced access to information and communication networks and terminal equipment, content and services everywhere, particularly in remote and rural areas and areas which were in a weaker position, including small population centres, and by reducing substantially regional differences in Internet access, increasing broadband access in poorly covered areas and seeking to ensure that broadband services are available to at least 90% of the EU population by 2010.</p>
<p>The Riga statement called on the Commission to support the gathering of material, the creation of networks at all levels, including regional and local indicators, comparative assessments, exchanges of good practice and experiences gained from Europe and outside it. In addition, the Commission was asked to propose, as part of the 2007 i2010 strategy<a href="#defann_7_2" name="refann_7_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and in accordance with the Riga statement, a common approach to the 2008 information society initiative to promote European participation.</p>
<p>Finally, the ministers encouraged future Presidencies to propose appropriate initiatives and actively continue to support the Commission in developing the 2008 initiative. On this basis, promotion of broadband services in rural areas will be considered at the annual i2010 information society conference to be held in Espoo, Finland on 27 and 28 September 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member says, policy on the legalisation of the status of illegal immigrants falls within the sphere of national competence, and so far the Council has not deliberated on the possibility of trying to reach consensus among the Member States on a coordinated approach to regularising the status of such immigrants.</p>
<p>A tangible step in this direction will be the entry into force of the Council Decision on the establishment of a mutual information procedure concerning measures taken by the Member States in the areas of asylum and immigration. The Commission will be responsible for establishing the procedure and managing it. In September 2006 the Council agreed on a general approach to the matter. Still to come is the consideration of the European Parliament’s opinion, after which the instrument can be adopted.</p>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The comprehensive approach to immigration adopted last December deals with priority measures relating to Africa and the Mediterranean region with the aim of reducing migration pressures in those regions. The purpose of the measures is to reinforce cooperation and interaction between the Member States and to increase dialogue and cooperation with African States and the whole Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>The Council is following the progress of the implementation of the comprehensive approach. In addition, the European Council has urged the Commission to report on the progress achieved by the end of 2006.</p>
<p>The Honourable Members' attention is drawn to the practical measures and initiatives listed in the joint answer given by the Council to Oral Questions <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0440_EN.html">H-0440/06</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0455_EN.html">H-0455/06</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0460_EN.html">H-0460/06</a>, <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0473_EN.html">H-0473/06</a> and <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0478_EN.html">H-0478/06</a>.</p>
<p>A European and African ministerial meeting, organised by Morocco with the active support of Spain and France, was held in Rabat on 10 and 11 July 2006 to debate immigration and development. At the meeting an action plan was adopted dealing in particular with controlling illegal immigration into the EU from Central and West Africa and the repatriation of illegal immigrants. All the States which took part in the meeting stressed their commitment to implementing the action plan as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>As far as the situation in the Canaries is concerned, the EU has already taken action on account of the arrival of groups of illegal immigrants and has supported Spain with initiatives.</p>
<p>The initiatives in question include a visit to the Canaries by a fact-finding mission from the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) to monitor the situation on the ground. FRONTEX has also proposed that a joint support group should be set up consisting of officials from FRONTEX and national experts from the Member States and sent to the Canaries.</p>
<p>In June 2006, FRONTEX reported to the Council the findings of a feasibility study concerning the creation of a Mediterranean Coastal Patrols Network operation involving EU Member States and North African countries (the MEDSEA project). Next, there are plans for a technical feasibility study of a monitoring system completely covering the southern sea borders (BORTEC).</p>
<p>FRONTEX has also launched two operations, HERA I and HERA II, with the aim of reducing the numbers of immigrants arriving in the Canaries. HERA I was launched on 15 July and is to run for three months. Experts from the Member States are being sent to help the Spanish authorities to identify immigrants. HERA II concerns monitoring of the sea areas off Mauritania and Senegal and around Cape Verde. The operation was launched in mid-August and is continuing. Italy, Portugal and Finland have helped the Spanish authorities. Spain has signed agreements with Mauritania and Senegal permitting Spanish vessels to patrol their territorial waters. A coordination centre has been set up in Tenerife manned by representatives of certain Member States, a representative of FRONTEX and officials representing the Spanish authorities.</p>
<p>There are plans to launch a similar operation in Malta with the aim of reducing the numbers of migrants arriving there (the JASON I operation). The operation will fall into two parts: identifying and repatriating would-be illegal immigrants found at sea and joint patrols in Libya's coastal waters.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council has begun consideration of a Commission proposal for a regulation establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams.</p>
<p>The Honourable Members' attention is also drawn to the fact that, in addition, the European Union is currently formulating a strategy for joint administration of the external borders. Reinforcing such joint administration is among the priorities on the working programme of the Finnish Presidency, and it is discussed in detail in the Commission's communication of July 2006 on policy priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third-country nationals. In the communication, the Commission lists priority sectors in which measures should be implemented and/or continued, and measures which in its opinion should be adopted.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0717"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The first part of the Honourable Member's question concerns the situation in Gaza following the attacks by the Israeli army on a base in the northern part of Kerem Shalom on 25 June 2006. In its statement of 30 June, the Presidency reminded all parties of their duty to protect the lives of civilians and that, in the military operations then underway, international law must be respected. It particularly deplored the destruction of essential infrastructure, which had caused a further deterioration in the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The Commission responded to the situation directly by sending fuel to hospitals in Gaza by means of the Temporary International Mechanism so that the hospitals could use their back-up generators. At the extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament on 29 August, the Commission representative provided committee members with extra information about the substantial aid which the EU was giving to the Palestinian people this year. At the international donors' conference in Stockholm on 1 September, the EU gave a strong commitment. At its meeting on 15 September, the Council also welcomed the expansion of the Temporary International Mechanism and agreed to extend its operation for a further three months.</p>
<p>The second part of the question deals with the revival of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, which the Council supports. The 'form of words recognising Israel', to which the Honourable Member refers, entirely corresponds to one of the three principles of the Quartet, namely that Israel should be recognised. The other two principles are a commitment to non-violence and acceptance of earlier agreements and obligations, including the Road Map. The Council agrees with the Honourable Member that an undertaking by the Palestinian Authority to recognise Israel and a commitment on its part to the other two principles would facilitate progress in the fields mentioned in the question. The issue is central to the on-going political contacts and diplomatic efforts of the EU in this field. This was also reaffirmed at the EU Council meeting on 15 September 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0724"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>Like other significant aid donors, the European Union is fully committed to providing powerful and lasting support to democratic Afghanistan. However, merely giving substantial aid pledges does not alter the fact that the current insurgencies and the numerous illegal armed groups prevent some of the aid from reaching its intended destination in the various parts of the country.</p>
<p>The EU remains one of the leading donors who support the transition process in Afghanistan. At the conferences on Afghanistan in Tokyo (January 2002) and Berlin (March 2004), the European Union pledged USD 3.8 bn (€ 3.1 bn) in reconstruction aid for the years 2002-2006. This amount represents 30% of the total of USD 12.5 bn (€ 10 bn) worth of aid pledged by international donors in Tokyo and Berlin.</p>
<p>Afghanistan receives more aid from the EU than any other beneficiary in Asia. Since 2002 the Commission has granted € 657 m to Afghanistan in reconstruction aid. By the end of 2005 and 2006, at least € 376 m has been/will have been provided in aid, which means that the reconstruction aid provided by the Commission exceeds the pledge of € 1 bn given in 2002. These figures do not include the € 216.5 m in humanitarian aid given between 2001 and 2004. The Commission administers the aid efficiently: appropriations are committed, agreements are concluded concerning them and payments are made without delay.</p>
<p>So far, the EU has managed to fulfil the pledges it gave in London and it is confident about the future. The EU is still fully committed to supporting democracy and stability in Afghanistan in the long term. Like all the donors, the EU constantly assesses the aid it provides to Afghanistan and is fully aware that Afghanistan is still a very challenging environment in which to provide international aid.

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>With regard to the first and second questions, may I say that the Council welcomes the joint declaration signed in Athens on 3 September 2006. When the planned oil pipelines to which the honourable Member refers are operational, they will help diversify the supply routes of energy bound for the European Union. The European Councils held in March and June 2006 expressed their unreserved support for diversification of the energy supply routes, as this will improve the reliability of the energy supply in the European Union.</p>
<p>Joint Community funding could be used for the gas pipeline project alluded to in the second question, because the gas pipe between Turkey, Greece and Italy is considered to be a project that is of European interest in the new Decision on the trans-European Network.</p>
<p>Regarding the third question, I would like to mention that the Council and the European Parliament are actively encouraging, through the codecision procedure, only those projects which are mentioned in the new decision on the trans-European Network. These projects relate to gas and electricity networks (as mentioned before, the natural gas pipeline could receive joint Community funding). The conclusions of the March and June 2006 European Councils could be interpreted as providing a political incentive for these projects. In this connection, I should also mention the INOGATE Programme (Interstate Oil and Gas Transport Programme to Europe). The Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline has been designated as one priority route for crude oil pipelines under this programme. The INOGATE Programme is currently being financed out of the TACIS Programme, and in future it will receive funding under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.</p>
<p>Regarding the environmental considerations alluded to, the Council would like to state that these projects must comply with national environmental norms and procedures and, of course, Community environmental norms must be applied in the European Union, in addition to which the new Decision on the trans-European Network does state that projects, and especially those of European interest, must:</p>
<p>– promote sustainable development and environmental protection by, among other things, reducing the environmental risks associated with the transportation of energy,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>– comply with international environmental conventions.</p>
<p>In this respect the gas pipeline is useful, because it will help reduce the number of consignments being transported by sea in an otherwise very congested Bosphorus Strait.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0757"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The Council, in collaboration with the European Parliament, has been developing a common energy policy by bringing in legislation packages on energy in phases. These measures help to ensure that there is a stable supply of energy to the EU. The reliability of energy supply, together with the issues of competitiveness and sustainability, also form the basis for the Strategic EU Energy Review, which the European Commission proposes to present to the Council and the European Parliament in 2007, and to which the Council intends, during the Finnish presidential term, to make its own contribution.</p>
<p>Long-term strategic agreements are an important factor in the future of ensuring the supply of energy. But we also need to take into account other contributory factors, in particular those mentioned in the Presidency’s conclusions at the European Councils held in March and June 2006 and in the document produced jointly by the Commission and the Council’s High Representative. The principles set out in these documents include the diversification of sources of energy, transparency in the energy industry and good governance, the creation of transparent and secure conditions for investment and trade in energy, and non-discriminatory transit and third-party access to the infrastructures.</p>
<p>The Council intends to employ the existing Commission structures and cooperation mechanisms to try and revive the dialogue on energy between the EU and Russia. For this reason, another meeting of the Permanent Partnership Council between the Energy Ministers of the EU and Russia is to be held during the Finnish presidential term, and there will be a good number of issues to discuss on the agenda. The best way of ensuring the security of the energy supply between the EU and Russia in the future is to stress the importance of mutual dependence and to include Russia in a binding and coherent regulatory system. The Council is encouraging Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty and to bring to conclusion the talks on the Transit Protocol. Furthermore, the new agreement between the EU and Russia is to have a substantial chapter on energy, which will contain basic principles of cooperation on energy.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council would like to mention that the European Parliament and the Council recently adopted a Decision on trans-European energy networks, which will be an important step towards the diversification of energy sources and energy transportation routes, and thus a major improvement in securing the energy supply. This objective should also be realised when the Energy Community Treaty with the countries of South-East Europe is concluded and comes into force, as the agreement will extend the internal energy market model to neighbouring countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0736"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member knows, the decision on issuing the Directive on air quality will be taken by the European Parliament and the Council through the codecision procedure. While awaiting the results of the European Parliament’s first reading, the Council adopted a general approach to the Directive on 27 June 2006. The Directive’s purpose is to prevent and restrict the risks and negative environmental impact of air pollution on human health. With regard to fine particles (PM2.5), the compromise package contained a two-phase scheme which consisted of a non-binding target value for 2010 and a binding limit value to replace it in 2015. This would make it possible to gather data in Europe on concentration levels of PM2.5 particles. The limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, PM10 particles, lead, benzene and carbon monoxide have not been altered. On certain stringent conditions, exemption from the obligations applying to PM10 particles, nitrogen dioxide and benzene can be requested for a limited period.</p>
<p>The Council believes that the Directive is a step forward for improved air quality, and trusts that the European Parliament will consider the matter, so that the conditions necessary for establishing the agreement might be laid down.</p>
<p>As for the general question whether the EU institutions give sufficient priority to environmental issues, the Council affirms that it actively takes account of the fact that environmental protection and improvement is one of the key objectives of the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0739"></a>

<p>On 20 February 2006, the Council decided to undertake a thorough reform of the sugar industry in the EU, and drew up three regulations with the aim of enhancing its competitiveness and market orientation.</p>
<p>In connection with this, a major financial incentive was introduced, which was offered to the least productive sugar companies in the form of adequate restructuring aid, in order that they should end their production under quota. All companies that produce sugar, isoglucose or insulin syrup, for which a quota has been granted until 1 July 2006, are entitled to restructuring assistance, which will be paid per tonne of quota renounced, provided that they give up their quota in the marketing years 2006/2007, 2007/2008, 2008/2009 or 2009/2010.</p>
<p>The Council has taken the social aspects of factory closures into account in the regulation alluded to. To receive restructuring assistance, a factory must submit an application to the Member State in question, which should contain a restructuring proposal. The proposal should present a rationalisation proposal suggesting measures for the retraining of employees, for their transfer to new jobs, and for early retirement. The factory must also undertake to meet the requirements mentioned in the period set by the Member State concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0741"></a>

<p>Although some measures have been implemented, especially with regard to private local radio broadcasting in the Kurdish language, more action is needed to eliminate the obstacles that remain. We also need proper measures to encourage the study of languages other than Turkish. The negotiating framework covers these issues, and they are short-term priorities in the revised Accession Partnership. The Union will be raising them systematically at all levels as part of the process of reform underway in Turkey. It has done so at the most recent EU-Turkey Association Council meeting in Luxembourg on 12 June 2006.</p>
<p>Consequently, the honourable Member can rest assured that the EU continues to monitor developments in the field closely, in order to be able to assess Turkey’s progress towards accession. These developments naturally direct the progress of talks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0755"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The Council does indeed believe that a well planned energy policy can promote growth and competitiveness in the European Union. Many factors help to achieve this objective:</p>
<p>First of all, energy efficiency is one of the prime aims. In Europe there is still much scope for investing cost-effectively in energy efficiency. Progress in this field will help European undertakings, because on the one hand it will reduce their energy costs and on the other hand it will increase the competitiveness of European technology in this sector. During the current Presidency, practical steps are being taken by putting into practice a directive on ecological planning, a directive on the energy efficiency of buildings, and a directive on the efficiency of the end use of energy and energy saving. In addition, the Council expects the Commission to submit its energy efficiency action plan, recommending the necessary action to improve energy efficiency, to which the Council will respond appropriately. As regards R&amp;D, the Council draws the Honourable Member's attention to the proposal for the 7th Framework Programme, in which energy efficiency is among the principal objectives in the field of energy. It is therefore essential that cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council should be effective and productive, so that the Framework Programme can be adopted by the end of this year. In addition, mention may be made the Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation, which will be approved shortly. It includes an 'intelligent energy' programme and therefore measures to promote the use of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency and competitiveness by means of integrated projects.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency is also to be regarded as an essential factor in the innovation process. This is stated in the comprehensive communication, 'An EU-wide Innovation Strategy: From Theory to Practice', which has just been published, stressing that making efficiency objectives part of environmental innovation could serve as a model for other aspects of energy.</p>
<p>Secondly, it may be said that the operation of Europe's internal energy market should be improved with the aim of liberalising it completely by permitting more competition. In this way the cost of distributing and purchasing energy would be reduced for the benefit of Europe's businesses and citizens.</p>
<p>The Council is cooperating with the Commission to attain this objective, particularly on the basis of the two Commission communications on gas and energy market directives and on the basis of research into electricity and gas.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Council is adopting the same approach in its relations with third countries: it is seeking to improve the operation of third countries' energy sectors and to develop regulation and competition in these fields, which has an impact on Europe's economy. For example, creating a common regional energy market for electricity grids and natural gas networks in South-Eastern Europe and linking it to the wider European market is an important step to promote and maintain economic development. Promoting energy efficiency in cooperation with third countries is also an element in the Council's policy in this field. At the G8 meeting in St Petersburg, the Presidency and the Commission supported energy efficiency initiatives, whose aim is to improve energy efficiency in many fields worldwide. Energy and energy efficiency were important subjects at the ASEM meeting in Helsinki in September and also at bilateral meetings held with Russia and other countries during this Presidency. Another example of this is the recently approved renewal of the Energy Star Agreement with the United States on office equipment; the Council will consider the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion and signature of the agreement as soon as it receives it. The aim is to adopt the proposal as soon as possible, relying on good cooperation with the European Parliament over the matter. The same applies to the EU Regulation incorporating the bilateral agreement into Community law.</p>
<p>This was a brief overview of the Council's plans for bringing its influence to bear on the growth and competitiveness of Europe's economy by means of energy policy in the next few months.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0761"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The European Council that was convened on 15 and 16 June 2006 confirmed that it would be adhering to the plan for a second generation Schengen Information System, to be up and running by April 2007. An evaluation, carried out by technical working parties, of the data supplied by Departments of the European Commission, however, leads the Presidency to believe that enlargement of the Schengen zone will be unavoidably delayed.</p>
<p>The Presidency proposes to organise a debate at the meeting of the Council in December on the general timetable for inclusion of the new Schengen countries, but the discussion first of all depends on clarification by the Commission of many of the points in the project’s plan. Secondly, an evaluation timetable needs to be drawn up for the new Schengen countries, on the basis of the plan submitted by Departments of the Commission.</p>
<p>Furthermore, new legal instruments with regard to SIS II need to be adopted. The technical specifications have to be adapted to those instruments with which the adoption of the instruments and the System’s development are interlinked. The Commission’s Departments have already said that a description of the technical specifications can only be finalised when agreement has been reached on the instruments. The Member States will need to assess the possible consequences of this setback with reference to the information available at the time of the December Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0768"></a>

<p>According to the majority of reports from aid and advocacy agencies working in Burma and along its borders, conditions in that country have deteriorated considerably over the past year.

The use of rape as a tool of war in an attempt to destroy ethnic nationality groups across the country has been well documented.

<p>(FI) This answer drawn up by the Presidency is not in itself binding on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The European Union monitors closely the situation in Burma/Myanmar and, in that context, the situation of ethnic minorities in the country. As the Honourable Member surely knows, in May the Council severely condemned the attacks on civilians which followed the escalation of operations by the Burmese/Myanma army against the Karen National Union (KNU). The army's actions compelled a considerable number of people to move from their home area in the north of the Karen region, and in addition a substantial fresh wave of refugees fled to Thailand.</p>
<p>The EU has consistently called upon the leadership of Burma/Myanmar to cease its abuses against civilians and to put an end to refugee movements in the regions of conflict, and it urges both parties to fully respect international humanitarian law. The EU supports the regional inviolability of Burma/Myanmar but urges its government to protect the human rights of all citizens and groups, irrespective of their ethnic origin or religion.</p>
<p>At all its meetings with Burma/Myanmar, the EU urges the government to allow international organisations and NGOs unhindered access to the country, particularly to provide humanitarian aid, to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit political prisoners without supervision and to facilitate independent investigations.</p>
<p>By waiving the visa ban on U Nyan Win the EU had the opportunity, at a Troika meeting and in the presence of other Asian Foreign Ministers, to inform the Foreign Minister of Burma/Myanmar directly, in detail and unambiguously that the EU was still frustrated by the situation in Burma/Myanmar and shocked that the Government of Burma/Myanmar had not significantly promoted the democratisation of the country and improved the human rights situation. Similarly, the EU had the opportunity to express its concern about the situation of the country's ethnic minorities, particularly in the Karen region.</p>
<p>The Council also regularly raises the situation in Burma/Myanmar at political dialogue meetings with the neighbours of Burma/Myanmar, including China, and urges them continuously to use their contacts with Burma/Myanmar to bring about change in the direction of democracy, national reconciliation and sustainable development. In this way the Council also expresses its view that it would be to the advantage of neighbouring countries to support good governance and administrative capacity in Burma/Myanmar, which would make it easier to deal, for example, with trafficking in human beings and drugs and with the spread of infectious diseases.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0770"></a>

<p>(FI) This answer drafted by the Presidency is not binding as such on the Council or its members.</p>
<p>The Council is well aware of the anxieties which local producers in the Member States, and especially in Poland, have been expressing about imports of frozen strawberries from China.</p>
<p>The questioner will no doubt be familiar with the general anti-dumping rules, which require the Commission to open investigations and enforce temporary measures. The Commission opened an investigation on 19 January 2006 with a view to ascertaining whether the imports concerned constitute dumping in the legal sense and are adversely affecting the economic position of frozen strawberry production. If, in the light of that investigation, the Commission concludes that temporary measures should be taken, they would have to enter into force not later than 18 October 2006 and continue to apply for at most six months.</p>
<p>If in due course the Commission ultimately concludes that definitive measures need to be taken, it will send an official proposal to the Council. The Council would then have to decide on the measures in question within a month. It has received no such proposal from the Commission to date.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0774"></a>

<p>(EN) As rightly stated by the Honourable Member, the Commission is in the process of preparing an important initiative relating to the role of sport in Europe, with a view to the possible adoption of a White Paper on this subject.</p>
<p>Scope and aims of the intended White Paper</p>
<p>The envisaged White Paper on sport could be based on a stocktaking exercise aiming to clarify the important role which sport plays in Europe in societal and in economic terms and pointing to its potential to contribute to the Commission’s overall political objectives. It would also address the interests of sport as well as the challenges the specific organisation of sport is facing today in Europe, including in terms of public governance.</p>
<p>The envisaged White Paper would also seek to identify future actions concerning the profile of sport. The White Paper would therefore require close cooperation with different Commission services and further consultations with stakeholders.</p>
<p>Ideally, the initiative will be able to respond to expectations raised by sport stakeholders who have expressed their views within the dialogue framework “The EU &amp; Sport: Matching expectations” set up by the Commission in 2005. There are also concrete demands, including those from EU governments, to address recent developments relating to sport in Europe.</p>
<p>Cooperation with the Parliament is also crucial to the success of the initiative. The Commission therefore welcomes the timing of the planned report on “professional football” on which it stands ready to cooperate. The results of this report could feed into the envisaged White Paper.</p>
<p>Timescale</p>
<p>In terms of timing, therefore, the Commission considers that the momentum exists to launch an important initiative, such as the intended White Paper on sport, in 2007.</p>
<p>Naturally, a broad consultation process, involving governmental and non-governmental actors, has to precede the drafting and publication of such a document. The Commission has now entered an intense period of internal and external consultations which will continue until early 2007.</p>
<p>On the external side, the Commission started in June 2006 with a Consultation Conference involving the broader European Sport Movement. Five days ago the Commissioner in charge of Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism met with the leaders of European Sport Federations to discuss sport governance in Europe. Later in the autumn an on-line consultation will give the opportunity for everybody to voice interests and concerns on some key areas of the White Paper. The Commission continues to encourage sport organisations to participate in this process.</p>
<p>The Commission is open to examining further the specific concerns of sport organisations. Their written contributions are welcome at every stage of the consultation process. In order to structure the consultation process, the Commission calls on sport organisations to make their voices heard through their European umbrella organisations. This has worked very well in the recent past and should help us accomplish this challenging exercise.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0747"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Qualifications Framework's (EQF) objective is to improve the transparency of qualifications in order to promote lifelong learning and the geographical and occupational mobility of learners and workers.</p>
<p>The draft proposal recommends that Member States use the EQF as a reference tool to facilitate comparisons between qualifications awarded under different systems. It also recommends that Member States relate their national qualifications systems to the EQF and, where appropriate, develop national qualifications frameworks. Member States are also recommended to ensure that new qualifications and “Europass” documents contain a reference to the appropriate EQF level. These recommendations, if implemented, will promote the transparency and comparability of individual qualifications where no mandatory instruments exist. In accordance with Articles 149 and 150 of the Treaty, binding Community legislation on matters such as the EQF may not be adopted.</p>
<p>The EQF will therefore benefit awarding institutions and authorities by making it easier for them to interpret the variety of qualifications awarded under different education and training systems, as well as making the qualifications which they award more transparent to others. Where Member States adopt or already have National Qualifications Frameworks, this will, of course, make the implementation of the EQF much more effective.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0772"></a>

<p>(FR) Immediately after the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, the Commission drew up a framework regulation on civil aviation security. The regulation was adopted in December 2002<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It sets out common basic standards on aviation security measures and appropriate mechanisms for compliance monitoring, including inspections by the Commission.</p>
<p>Since it came into force, 10 implementing regulations detailing the measures and technical adaptations of common basic standards have been adopted by the Commission through the comitology procedure. With the help of the Committee on Civil Aviation Security, the Commission regularly reviews the civil aviation security measures and adjusts them if necessary.</p>
<p>Since February 2004, the Commission has also been carrying out regular inspections in Member States’ airports, to ensure they comply with common standards. The Commission has carried out over 70 inspections to date.</p>
<p>In September 2005, on the basis of its experience of implementing the framework regulation, the Commission proposed a revision of the regulation<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The aim of the revision is simplification of the current framework regulation. It will ensure greater flexibility, allowing a rapid response to new threats, implementation of the latest technological developments, and better protection of sensitive information on security standards.</p>
<p>The revised proposal for a framework regulation was presented to Parliament and the Council on 23 September 2005 and is currently at the stage of first reading by the Council. The Commission considers speedy adoption of this regulation very important.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue its unceasing efforts to ensure harmonised implementation of common aviation security measures, with the aim of preventing acts of unlawful interference in civil aviation in Europe. Moreover, the Commission, with the Committee on Civil Aviation Security, is in the process of developing an appropriate response to the new threats revealed by recent events.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) With regard to the ‘Magistrale for Europe’, the report by Mr Balázs, European coordinator for priority axis No 17 (Paris-Stuttgart-Vienna-Bratislava) indicates that the modernisation of the rail axis in question – part of the work on which is already under way – should be almost entirely completed by 2015. The French, German, Austrian and Slovakian Transport Ministers have confirmed their desire for that to be the case by signing a statement of intention on 9 June 2006.</p>
<p>As for the line between Munich and Kufstein (Austrian border), it is not a high-speed line but a conventional line. This line, which is located on the Brenner axis, has been subject to refurbishments over recent years. In the medium term, its capacity is expected to be increased within the context of the opening of the future Brenner Base Tunnel in 2016. Studies are scheduled in 2007-2008 to identify the best technical solutions. In particular, these studies will examine the Rosenheim bypass for goods trains and the cross-border section between Germany and Austria. Furthermore, in order to guarantee the interoperability of the axis, the possibility of equipping the line with the European signalling system ERTMS<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is being studied (this system being planned for the future base tunnel and the new lines in the Inn Valley in Austria).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) It is true that goods transport by rail via the Brenner Pass has been decreasing for some years. This fall is largely due to the difficulties with the ‘rolling road', that is, the transport service carrying lorries by train, which has diminished since the ‘ecopoints’ system came to an end at the end of 2003. Nevertheless, the results from the first half of 2006 show that traffic on the rolling road on the Brenner route has picked up considerably.</p>
<p>Over a longer period, we should bear in mind that current rail traffic via the Brenner Pass is twice the volume that it was in 1990. Over the same period, road transport has also doubled.</p>
<p>Traffic using the Brenner axis will continue to grow strongly over the coming years. In the current circumstances, this increase would essentially be absorbed by rail traffic, which raises the serious problem of pollution in the Alpine valleys and congestion.</p>
<p>The current operating conditions for the railway line through the pass are not suited to attracting a large volume of traffic. Two to three locomotives are required to ascend to the pass and two to come back down and the maximum length and weight of the trains is too restricted.</p>
<p>The Brenner Base Tunnel project, which includes the Brenner Base Tunnel and its access routes in Austria and Italy, will make an almost flat route possible. A locomotive will be able to travel without stopping from Munich to Verona with longer and heavier trains. The elimination of additional traction locomotives to ascend to the pass and of lengthy procedures at borders will reduce operating costs considerably.</p>
<p>The Brenner Base Tunnel is one of the list of priority projects of the trans-European network established by Parliament and the Council. Within the context of the preparations for this project, a socio-economic viability study was carried out in 2004. This study, which takes account of the access routes, indicates that the work will offer a net benefit as a whole.</p>
<p>The funding structure for the project will take the form of a public-private partnership the form of which is currently under discussion. The European Coordinator, Mr Karel Van Miert, and the European Investment Bank are directly involved in these discussions. The objective of all of the partners in the project is the presentation by the bi-national promoter BBT SE, on the recommendation of an advisory consortium led by KPMG and following an international call for tenders launched at the beginning of 2006, of a definitive plan – including the legal and financial aspects – at the beginning of 2007.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to stress that this project falls within the context of a global policy on Alpine crossing. The Swiss tunnels under construction, the Montcenis Tunnel project and the Brenner Tunnel project are complementary since they respond to different flows of traffic: the Swiss tunnels will not reduce the growth in road transport via the Brenner Pass.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At its meeting of 26 September 2006, the Commission decided to authorise the grant scheme on the grounds that Irish Government investment support at the six regional airports is a form of State aid compatible with competition rules.</p>

<p>Inland waterway transport firms play a limited role in the national and international freight markets in Poland, given that the state of the country's inland waterways and the potential of its river ports allow no scope for any appreciable increase in the volume of freight carried. In addition, the development of inland waterway transport in Poland is restricted in particular by the major variations in river levels that occur throughout the year, the lack of regulation of major rivers and their tributaries, the relatively long periods when waterways are ice-bound and the poor state of port installations. The existing network of waterways and the lack of major new investment in infrastructure are hampering the development of freight carriage by boats and barge trains throughout Europe, even though inland waterway transport is a particularly environment-friendly and low-cost solution for many types of freight.</p>

<p>With Presidential Decree 124 (Greek Government Gazette 136 of 6 July 2006) concerning freedom to provide services in marine transport, the Greek Government has arbitrarily abolished the 30-year age-limit for withdrawing Greek ships from service (Law 2932/2001), claiming that it is bringing Greek law into line with European legislation, on a proposal from the Commission. In our question of 23 January 2006 (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0031_EN.html">H-0031/06</a><a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>), we pointed out that the Commission's reasoned opinion to the Greek Government paved the way for the abolition of the 30-year limit for the withdrawal of superannuated, poorly maintained passenger vessels. The argument that the Commission was seeking to harmonise the legislation on ticket prices and crew composition is not valid since the actual increases over the last three years have been in excess of 250%. Shipowners and the Ministry of Mercantile Marine are using the criterion of shipping companies' profits to determine the organisational structure, the routes and frequency of services of vessels, thereby creating hazardous conditions which may result in a new shipwreck similar to that of the Samina Express and putting the lives of passengers and crews at greater risk.</p>

<p>(EN) Europe can build on a strong research base in the different disciplines of the humanities. Over the last years, research projects from these communities have benefited from a steadily increasing support through the Framework Programmes.</p>
<p>Already during the Fifth Framework Programme (FP5), the EU supported projects involving researchers from the humanities, notably addressing issues of European identity and identity building (including a historical perspective) and values linked to democracy and citizenship.</p>
<p>Under FP6, the humanities were explicitly addressed in several calls and more than 10 projects are currently under way in a number of areas, notably in the field of linguistics and history:</p>

<p>5 Specific targeted research project (STREP) and 2 Coordination Actions (CA)</p></table>
<p>Information on these projects is available under http://cordis.europa.eu/citizens/home.html</p>
<p>For FP7, the idea is to strengthen further the involvement of the humanities within the overall context of Theme 8 "Socio-economic Sciences and the Humanities". For instance, the proposed text for the specific programme gives the following keywords for the humanities: cultural interactions; traditions; cultural heritage; approaches to multiple coexisting cultures, the role of language, arts and religions; attitudes and values.</p>
<p>To further increase the participation of the humanities and to encourage inter- and multidisciplinary research between the social sciences and humanities, an expert group for the humanities was established in May 2006.</p>
<p>In parallel, the Commission launched a web based consultation, inviting the research community to comment on a first draft research agenda for Theme 8.</p>
<p>Against this background, the preparation of the Work Programme for 2007-2008 for Theme 8 is under way. While at this stage it would be premature to reveal any details, it should be highlighted that research issues related to literature and the arts, as well as to cultural interactions and approaches to multiple coexisting cultures are likely to be on the agenda of the first Call for Proposals. The publication of this Call will take place very soon after FP7 comes into force.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new proposed Culture programme (2007-2013), which will hopefully be adopted by the end of 2006, is also another financing instrument of the Commission in the field of culture. Following its adoption, Calls for Proposals will most likely be published early in 2007; a preliminary Call for Proposals for 2007 with the most important information is however foreseen for October 2006.</p>
<p>The general objective of the proposed programme is to enhance the cultural area common to Europeans through the development of cultural cooperation between the creators, cultural players and cultural institutions of the countries taking part in the programme, with a view to encouraging the emergence of European citizenship. The specific objectives of the programme are: 1) to promote the transnational mobility of people working in the cultural sector; 2) to encourage the transnational circulation of works and cultural and artistic products; and 3) to encourage intercultural dialogue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0699"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU market has to date been reacting well to the new import regime for bananas consisting of a tariff rate of €176/ton and a duty-free quota of 775.000 tons for bananas from African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) countries, which has replaced since 1 January 2006 the previous quota regime.</p>
<p>In the light of the continuing high sensitivity of the issue which has been the subject of long-standing trade disputes, the new import regime has been subject since the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference of December 2005 to a monitoring and review mechanism under the good offices of Minister Støre of Norway. The aim is to determine the tariff rate to be consolidated at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on the basis of which any future reductions resulting from the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations would apply. In the context of the DDA negotiations, which are for the time being suspended, the Commission has also been resisting the request of a number of countries to treat bananas as a tropical product and thus to apply higher reductions to the tariff rate.</p>
<p>The Commission is monitoring very closely the operation of the new import regime and participating constructively in the Støre process with a view to reaching agreement that would provide an adequate level of protection of the EU market and hopefully at the same time put an end to the bananas dispute.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0702"></a>

<p>According to a recent report from Teagasc, the Irish national research, advisory and training services for the agriculture and food industry, Irish farmers will be more reliant on EU direct income support in the future than currently is the case, should the EU agree at the WTO.</p>
<p>This prospect comes at a time when there appears to be less commitment from EU Member States to fund EU policies, including agriculture, in the future, thus making the survival of the current decoupled payment regime less certain beyond 2013.</p>
<p>From a budgetary point of view, how does the Commission intend to address the increasingly stark and conflicting realities facing many farmers across the EU?</p>
<p>Farmers are urged to be more competitive, yet know they cannot compete with increasing volumes of cheap food produced to lower standards outside the EU following a deal at the WTO.

<p>(EN) The main objective of the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform was to improve the competitiveness of the EU agricultural sector. The new CAP encourages farmers to make better returns from the market rather than calculate the best subsidy combination. It also promotes high standards of environmental care, animal welfare and food safety that equip EU agriculture to face the challenges of a reasonable future trade environment.</p>
<p>An ambitious outcome of the currently interrupted World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations on trade liberalisation will certainly represent a challenge for the EU agriculture, in particular the implementation of lower tariffs and the projected elimination of export refunds. At the same time, a WTO deal will open new market opportunities for EU agricultural exports, especially for high value added and quality products.</p>
<p>There is no reason, for the moment, to plan any change in the policy content of the 2003 CAP reform. A "Health Check" is foreseen in 2008 for the main instruments of the CAP. The objective is to maintain the thrust of the CAP reform – sustainability in economic, environmental and social terms – which will remain valid in the future.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member also raises the question from a budgetary point of view. By the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management the financial perspectives have been decided for the whole period 2007-2013. In December 2005 the European Council invited the Commission to make "a full wide-ranging review in 2008/2009 covering all aspects of EU spending, including the CAP, and of resources, including the United Kingdom rebate". This will therefore be a review which will address the budgetary issue raised by the Honourable Member. The Parliament will be associated with this review.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0704"></a>

<p>(EN) The final agreement on a Financial Framework for the EU 2007-2013 provides a coherent and stable framework for financing an enlarged EU over the next seven years.</p>
<p>Over the whole period, the EU will spend €74 billion on programmes and initiatives under Sub-Heading 1A, focusing directly on competitiveness and employment. In addition to this, substantial investment under other headings will help to promote growth and employment in Europe and, thus, contribute to strengthening our global competitiveness. This applies, in particular, to the €308 billion allocation under Sub-Heading 1B which target cohesion for growth and employment. The EU will thus invest €382 billion, or 44 percent of its overall budget, to stimulate growth, employment and competitiveness.</p>
<p>Expenditure devoted to competitiveness for growth and employment (sub-heading 1A) will increase by about 70% between 2006 and 2013 and those devoted to cohesion for growth and employment (sub-heading 1B) will increase by more than 20% in the same period.</p>
<p>Examples of specific programmes that will improve Europe's ability to compete on the global market include the new Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Research Framework Programme, the Lifelong Learning programme, the Galileo programme or the Trans-European Networks.</p>
<p>In addition, the recently proposed European Globalisation Fund, will contribute to tackling the social costs of the adjustment process that the EU is undergoing to promote competitiveness in the context of changing world trade patterns. This instrument will be financed using unspent funds.</p>
<p>The financial framework offers a basis for a more competitive EU over the next seven years, and EU funding can clearly play a catalyst role in this regard. This being said, promoting growth, jobs and competitiveness is very much a shared responsibility and will require similar efforts by the Member States. While the ground has been laid, the ambition and the actions at European level will have to be matched by investments and contributions by public and private actors at all levels to allow Europe fully to grow and prosper.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0710"></a>

However, if he was providing a private or commercial service, this VAT liability could be recovered from the state.</p>
<p>Will the Commission review the operation of the 6th EU VAT Directive to see how providers of public services can be treated so differently from the providers of private services in this matter and to see what can done to ensure that this anomaly can be overcome under this EU tax code regime in the future?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) It is a basic principle of the Sixth Value Added Tax (VAT) Directive<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> that the VAT incurred on the costs borne by a taxable person is deductible only insofar as these costs are linked to the provision by him of taxable supplies.</p>
<p>Article 13, A, 1, (a) and B, (e), provides that the supply of public postal services and of postage stamps are exempted from VAT. When the activities of an operator are covered by this provision, goods and services supplied (as outputs) are exempted from VAT but the VAT incurred on its purchases of goods and services (as inputs) is not deductible.</p>
<p>It is however true that this VAT exemption for public postal services and postage stamps is not fully suited to the postal market as liberalised through Directive 97/67/EC. The current VAT exemption distorts competition between operators such as the former state monopolies who benefit from the exemption and other operators that do not. Disparities in the way this exemption is applied throughout the Community have already been pointed out by the Commission.</p>
<p>To deal with this situation the Commission proposed<a href="#defann_51_3" name="refann_51_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> in 2003 to remove the current VAT exemption on public postal services and postage stamps together with an option for Member States of applying a reduced VAT rate to a wide range of postal services. This latter aspect would limit the impact on prices for private customers. Member States have however been unable to reach an agreement and the proposal remains blocked in the Council.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a proper application of the VAT postal exemption throughout the Community is needed. The Commission has been obliged to launch infringement proceedings against some Member States<a href="#defann_51_4" name="refann_51_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> where the current VAT exemption is not being correctly applied. In the meantime, the Commission urges the Council to resume discussion and adopt the Commission proposal for modernising the VAT treatment of postal services. The current situation is clearly unsatisfactory for all sides including, as the Honourable Member points out, the exempt sector operators who are unable to recover VAT on much needed investment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The promotion of academic and educational exchanges is an important aspect of the EU-India Joint Action Plan agreed at the last EU-India Summit in September 2005. It is a key element of our efforts to enhance EU visibility in India and demonstrate that Europe, like India, is also about the future.</p>
<p>The Commission has allocated €33 million to the India Window of the Erasmus Programme for the period 2005-2007. This amount should allow the funding of approximately 900 scholarships over a three-year period (2005-2007).</p>
<p>Erasmus Mundus has been extremely successful in India. In the first two years of implementation of the India Window of the Programme, about half of the total amount has been used to fund more than 400 scholarships for Indian students. In the third and last year of implementation of the window (academic year 2007-2008), the Commission is expecting to fund some 500 additional scholarships.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this result, the Commission, through its Delegation in Delhi, has recently intensified efforts aimed at disseminating information about Erasmus Mundus in India. An important European Higher Education Fair, which will be held in Delhi on 24-26 November 2006, will be used to raise further awareness about the opportunities offered by the Programme.</p>
<p>Following the positive outcome of its first phase, discussions are underway within the Commission to extend the India Window of Erasmus Mundus after 2007.</p>
<p>To respond to the Honourable Member's concern, the Commission would note that more than half of the Indian students who have received scholarships under Erasmus to study in Europe intend to study science and technology.</p>
<p>The Commission and Indian authorities have not envisaged replicating the Executive Training Programme (ETP) in India because the main purpose of this programme is to provide training to European professionals in the languages of key export markets for the EU (China, Japan and Korea) in which the knowledge of European languages is not widespread. The systematic use of English in business contacts with India does not make it necessary to extend such a programme to this country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0716"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the seriousness of the damages caused by forest fires this summer, particularly in the region of Galicia, and it would like to express its deep compassion with those who were affected.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently tendering a study to get a comprehensive overview on the causes affecting forest deterioration in the EU, including forest fires. This study, the findings of which are expected at the end of 2007, should result in concrete proposals for preventing forest deterioration at EU level. The study is part of the EU Forest Action Plan that the Commission presented in June 2006<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In addition, the LIFE+ proposal<a href="#defann_53_2" name="refann_53_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> joins the existing tools to support environmental actions in a new, broader and more integrated instrument. The proposal foresees to support forest monitoring programmes and forest fire prevention, allowing for the continuation of activities implemented under the Forest Focus Regulation, which will expire at the end of 2006.</p>
<p>As for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), substantial changes have been introduced in recent years following the 2003/2004 CAP reforms. Rural development policy promotes sustainable development of rural areas, helping to improve competitiveness of agriculture and forestry and the creation of new sources of income and employment in rural areas. The new Rural Development Regulation<a href="#defann_53_3" name="refann_53_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> for the period 2007 - 2013 includes a number of forestry measures that the Member States can implement according to their priorities, including forest fire prevention measures and restoration of forests damaged by fires.</p>
<p>As regards the Solidarity Fund, the Member State concerned has to make an application to the Commission within ten weeks of the date of the first damage. As of 26 September 2006 no such application has been received from the Spanish government. The possibility of financial assistance from the Solidarity Fund depends on whether the criteria in the Regulation<a href="#defann_53_4" name="refann_53_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> for mobilising the Fund are met. Financial assistance from the Solidarity Fund may be used for a limited number of emergency operations carried out by the public authorities, such as provisional repair of vital infrastructures, providing temporary accommodation or funding rescue services.

<p>The firm of Tréfimétaux, which is part of the Italian group KME and specialises in copper processing, is to relocate its French-based smelting and laminating operations to Germany and Italy, at a cost of 215 jobs. This decision makes no sense from the point of view of the firm’s competitiveness, since the German factory is less productive and labour costs there are higher. The decision taken by KME, under pressure from the finance company INTEK which requires rates of return of 18%, will drive customers into the arms of non-EU suppliers. The problem is due to unscrupulous shareholders who compromise the firm's strategy and its very existence to get a return on their short-term speculative investments.</p>

<p>(EN) Job losses due to company relocation are a concern for the Commission. However, the Honourable Member will be aware that the Treaty provides for the freedom of capital movements within the European Union, except in specified circumstances, as a condition for the smooth functioning of the Single Market. Company relocation is a normal phenomenon in economic life. It reflects a process of efficient allocation of resources across the EU economy, allowing investment to flow to those projects offering the highest rate of return and enabling the economy to restructure and diversify. Unfortunately, there are unavoidable adjustment costs in this process of resource reallocation, as capital, jobs and know-how move from projects in one location to another. However, the overall effect of company movements on the performance of the EU economy and the welfare of EU citizens remains positive. It would, therefore be counterproductive to discourage or prohibit this economic process.</p>
<p>The European Union has, however, a number of very clear rules that apply in these kinds of circumstances, and we must firmly insist that they be kept. For example, any such decision must be preceded by proper information and consultation of workers' representatives, as provided for in several Community Directives. Social dialogue is a crucial issue in this context, as the Commission systematically recalls.</p>
<p>Businesses bear considerable social responsibility for Europe, and this should be made generally apparent. The Commission does not criticise, a priori, any decision by a company that involves relocation. What it does, however, is pursue policies which place sustainable solutions above short-term benefits. This is not just a question of social responsibility, but also of achieving our industrial policy goals, an active industrial policy that keeps industry in Europe.</p>
<p>And the Commission is also putting in place a series of instruments which can help softening the social impact of change and restructuring. The Structural Funds and the European Social Fund in particular, can play a major role in this. The Commission is insisting that Member States fully integrate in their national priorities and programming the focus defined at European level on adaptation to change.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0725"></a>

<p>(EN) Vice President in charge of Justice, Freedom and Security did indeed refer to the European Unions Situation Centre – generally known as the "SitCen" - in the referred interview to the Italian newspaper l'Espresso. The Commission welcomes the contribution of SitCen to the EU's security following the reinforcement of its means and mandate in the aftermath of the Madrid terrorist attacks of 11 March 2004.</p>
<p>The expression "center of various coordinated secret services" mentioned by the Honourable Member was not used as such by Vice President in charge of Justice, Freedom and Security to describe the SitCen. That expression was actually used by l'Expresso which refers in Italian to a "centro di coordinamento dei servizi a Bruxelles".

<p>At any rate, there is nothing secretive about either the original creation of the SitCen to support the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy in the late 90's or the decision to extend its mandate to provide the Council with strategic threat assessments relevant for the fight against terrorism based on intelligence from national services taken in 2004. In fact, the European Council itself welcomed in December 2004 the revised EU action plan and additional reports presented by the Secretary-General/High Representative and the Commission on combating terrorism and the progress made since June 2004, which should lead to further concrete results as demonstrated in these contributions, notably: […/…] concerning intelligence cooperation: the links established between the Counter-Terrorism Group and the reinforced EU Situation Centre (SitCen) which, as of 1 January 2005, will provide the Council with strategic threat assessments based on intelligence from national services; and the improved exchange of information with Europol. The European Council invited the Secretary-General/High Representative to report on progress, including enhanced cooperation between police and security services, also in connection with the SitCen. These European Council conclusions are public.</p>

<p>(EN) First of all, it must be noted that car registration taxes, such as Imposto automóvel (hereinafter "IA") levied in accordance with Legislative Decrees no. 40/1993 and no. 264/1993 in Portugal, are manifestly of a fiscal nature and they are charged not by reason of a vehicle crossing the border of the Member State applying it, but because of other operative events, which includes the first-time registration of the vehicle in that State.<a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> They must, therefore, be regarded as part of a general system of internal dues on goods and not as import duties within the meaning of Articles 23 and 25 of the EC Treaty. Consequently, Portugal does not act in breach of Community law by merely maintaining such a tax, provided there is no discrimination against imported vehicles prohibited by Article 90 of the EC Treaty. The Commission does not have any information to prove such discrimination.</p>
<p>As to the requirement to register a vehicle in Portugal and pay a tax thereof when a person has spent more than 180 days in this country, it should be noted that Council Directive 83/182/EEC on tax exemptions for temporary imported motor vehicles provides for a quantitative requirement of six months in any 12 months, during which the Member States must exempt from such taxes private vehicles registered in another Member State. When a person spends more time in a particular Member State a general rule is that the Member State concerned can levy the tax at issue. Portuguese Legislative Decree no 264/93 by establishing a quantitative criterion of 180 days for that purpose in certain cases may fall short even of five days. The Commission intends to contact Portuguese authorities on the issue.</p>
<p>As to the possibility provided by the Portuguese legislation to obtain under very strict conditions the tax exemption from car registration tax in the cases when EU citizens wish to become residents in Portugal, it must be recalled that there is no harmonization at EU level in the area of car registration taxes, therefore, Member States do not have any obligation to exempt from car registration taxes vehicles permanently imported to their territories.<a href="#defann_59_2" name="refann_59_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> Nevertheless, Portugal, on its own initiative, has chosen to exempt from IA personal vehicles imported on the occasion of an owner moving his or her residence to Portugal. The Commission, of course, welcomes this initiative but has no competence to require Portugal to modify the conditions, which were set down for that purpose.</p>
<p>With regard to high tax rates, it must be reiterated that since there is no harmonization in the area of car taxation at EU level, Member States may levy such taxes and determine their level as they see fit. The Court has ruled in Commission vs Denmark that Article 90 of the EC Treaty does not serve to censure the excessiveness of taxation levels and that, therefore, Member States are at liberty to decide on tax rates, even if they might appear to be excessively high.<a href="#defann_59_3" name="refann_59_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Thus, Portugal by imposing high tax rates on car registration does not breach Community law, provided that they do not give rise to cross-border obstacles to trade between Member States and they respect the non discrimination principle established in the EC Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to reports in the Greek press (e.g. the newspaper Ethnos of 17 July 2006, etc.), the European Court of Human Rights has ruled in favour of an appeal lodged by a Greek building cooperative whose property had been confiscated by the Greek State (for decades) as being 'woodland', despite the fact that the Greek State itself had officially recognised that cooperative and 325 other cooperatives and that their members had paid their contributions regularly and continue to do so. Strangely enough, only the Commission remains unconcerned about this matter, despite the fact that the European Parliament - through the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Libicki - has called on the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Karamanlis, to resolve the situation.</p>
<p>Is the Commission not aware that everyone - except itself - recognises that the Greek authorities are acting illegally in holding the property of 1.5 million Greeks and other EU nationals in Greece?

<p>(EN) As the Commission has already said in its previous reply to Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0022_EN.html">H-0022/06</a>, the Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) confers the competence to monitor the lawfulness of personal data processing activities performed within a Member State on the data protection authorities of the Member States. These authorities must be endowed with appropriate powers of intervention to ensure compliance with their national data protection legislation and to prevent or put an end to unlawful data processing activities, namely by means of controls or sanctions.</p>
<p>The Directive also provides that national data protection authorities shall be able to receive and examine complaints lodged by any person concerning the protection of his/her rights and freedoms with regard to the processing of personal data. Member States must ensure when implementing the Directive that the conditions laid down by the law or national administrative practices enable any person to effectively exercise this right.</p>
<p>It is therefore up to each Member State, when implementing Article 7 of the Directive, which lays down the legal grounds that make lawful the processing of personal data, to determine by law or by a decision of the data protection authorities whether an enquiry may be carried out in order to assess the use of a language by hospitals and medical services and the conditions attached.</p>
<p>As the Commission said in its previous reply, should these enquiries carried out by the services of the Generalidad de Cataluña be in conflict with Spanish data protection laws adopted to implement the Data Protection Directive, the Spanish Data Protection Authorities are required to take the appropriate measures to enforce compliance with the law.</p>
<p>The Commission has already asked the Spanish authorities for information about the facts referred to in the question to verify that the enquiry conducted by the Generalidad de Cataluña complies with the Spanish legislation implementing Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data. The Spanish authorities have informed the Commission that as a result of the enquiries and inspections carried out to verify the lawfulness of the enquiries carried out by the services of the Generalidad de Cataluña, several proceedings have been opened which could lead to a finding of infringement of Spanish data protection legal provisions. These proceedings, which are still pending, could give rise to sanctions or other measures adopted by the data protection authorities in order to ensure compliance with Spanish data protection legal provisions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Directive 2002/58/EC - the e-Privacy Directive - uses the term "unsolicited commercial communications" for what is commonly known as "spam". Article 13 of this Directive requires Member States to prohibit the sending of unsolicited commercial e-mail or other electronic messaging systems such as SMS and Multi media Messaging services unless the prior consent of the subscriber to such services has been obtained. This protection applies to subscribers who are natural persons. Member States can either choose to extend this regime to include legal persons or choose an opt-out system for unsolicited communications addressed to legal persons.</p>
<p>In addition, where Member States permit unsolicited commercial communications to legal persons by e-mail, Directive 2000/31 on electronic commerce requires clear and unambiguous identification of such communications (Article 7.1).</p>
<p>Charges relating to the sending of (large amounts of) unsolicited e-mails would penalise unfairly those companies that conduct legitimate marketing practices in compliance with national spam provisions. With regard to those companies that break spam laws, decisive enforcement action is what is needed to deter such behaviour.</p>
<p>The Commission is planning to adopt a Communication on spam, spyware and malware before the end of 2006. The Communication will take stock of the efforts made so far to raise public awareness on the problems posed by spam, spyware and malicious software and actions taken by the EU, industry and Member States to address these issues. Building on the results so far the Communication will identify further actions that need to be taken by the relevant stakeholders.

<p>(EN) Substantial investments are necessary both in the EU and in transit countries to upgrade aging energy infrastructure and to establish new, alternative supply routes. As it was set out in the Green paper ‘A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy’, one of the priorities is building oil pipelines which would facilitate Caspian oil supplies to the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that several pipeline projects are considered with the aim of delivering crude oil from the Black Sea to European markets. In addition to enhancing our security of supply, these projects have a potential to reduce the maritime transport of oil in the congested Turkish Straits, thereby reducing serious risks to the environment and local population. The Commission is supportive to each well grounded project which can contribute to these objectives. Accordingly, the Commission welcomes the recent intergovernmental agreement on the Burgas−Alexandroupolis pipeline and hopes that it will lead to the eventual realization of this project.</p>
<p>The Commission provided financial support of €1.9 million for the feasibility studies of this project in the framework of the Structural Funds 1994-1999 through the Community Initiative INTERREG II ‘External Borders’. (The total public financing of the project amounted to €2.7 million). No financial contribution is envisaged in the present financial perspective covering 2000-2006, neither from the Structural Funds nor from the financial instruments of the foreign policy.</p>
<p>Oil pipelines do not qualify under the current guidelines for trans-European energy networks (TEN-E) for EU funds, as decided by the Parliament and the Council.<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> However, the project could be eligible for support from International Financial Institutions and, in particular, from the European Investment Bank.</p>

<p>(EN) Spending under the current Structural Funds period will continue until the end of 2008 and it is only then that a final evaluation will be possible. This is especially true in the new Member States, where programming only started in 2004 and most of the impacts lie in the future.</p>
<p>However, it is noteworthy that, in terms of Gross Domestic Product growth, all of the new countries except Malta have recently outperformed the old EU15 Member States. For example, in 2005, Estonia and Latvia both grew by about 10% and the Czech Republic and Slovakia by about 6%, as against an estimated EU average of 1.6%.</p>
<p>EU funding contributes to the creation of growth and jobs in the new Member States. In many of the new Member States, EU assistance is focused on strengthening the competitiveness of the business sector, on improving employment and job opportunities, and on correcting deficiencies in environmental and transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Concerning the absorption capacity, it is also too early to draw conclusions on interim payments since in 2004 and 2005 mainly advances were paid.</p>
<p>Finally, early evaluation results show that the new Member States have made significant progress in building the necessary administrative capacity, despite the relatively short period and limited previous experience in managing such programmes. The Structural Funds management framework has been successfully established, managing and paying authorities, monitoring committees, and implementing bodies have been set up, and management and audit systems are in place.</p>
