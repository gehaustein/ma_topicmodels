<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joe Borg,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, let me express the Commission's any my personal satisfaction with the method and the quality of the work done to tackle the challenge of developing adequate management measures for our Mediterranean fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">It could not be taken for granted that the deadlock on this matter during the term of the previous European Parliament could be overcome. The proactive attitude of this Parliament, along with a general awareness of the state of fisheries resources and marine ecosystems in the Mediterranean, has contributed to the achievement of a sound compromise. Members of the European Parliament have shown their ability to listen to the spectrum of views that have been voiced on this important question. Parliament's opinion, which I hope will be adopted today, is a good starting point for the work to be carried out in the Council and I hope that the European institutions will be able to deliver the new regulation shortly, in the interests of our fishermen and of fisheries and the marine environment of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very pleased with the close cooperation of the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, and the members of the Committee on Fisheries during our work on this important proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to be able to inform you that we can accept 22 of the 34 amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries and other Members. Nine amendments of the 22 accepted, and in particular Amendments 2, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21, 22, 25 and 26 were part of a compromise package agreed with the rapporteur and approved by the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise is not perfect in all details. Nonetheless a delicate balance of quite different views has been achieved without compromising the effectiveness of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the other amendments tabled to the report before us. The Commission can also accept Amendments 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23 and 24, which introduce new elements that either reinforce our proposal or make the timing of the introduction of certain measures more gradual. The Commission cannot, however, accept Amendments 1, 3, 4, 19, and 27 to 34.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the concept of responsibility of nationals of Member States is already enshrined in the basic regulation for the common fisheries policy and should be maintained here. Amendments 1, 3 and 4 cannot therefore be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to Amendments 19 and 33, which ask for the insertion of provisions for financial support for temporary fishing bans and for fishermen affected by the prohibition of certain fishing gear, the Commission believes that these proposals are not appropriate here, either because there are already rules on these matters under Community legislation and/or because these issues are to be dealt with in the framework of the European fisheries fund proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment 27, which could dilute the significance of setting a minimum landing size for the species covered by the proposed regulation. In the absence of a minimum size, there would not be any incentive for fishermen to avoid the areas of aggregation of juveniles or undersized organisms or to improve selectivity as regards fishing gear and practices. Moreover, the common market for fisheries products calls for a harmonised minimum size.</p>
<p class="contents">A strict correspondence between minimum size and selectivity of prescribed equipment is rarely possible, particularly in multi-species, multi-gear fisheries, as is the case in the Mediterranean. Moreover, some minimum landing sizes are set for species caught, mainly with fishing gear and practices that are not regulated in this proposal and where selectivity is essentially left to the fishermen themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendment 28 is concerned, the same is not clear. The deletion of paragraph 3 would mean that whitebait fisheries would be completely forbidden. The Commission's aim is instead to keep them within a clear regulatory framework of national management plans. The Commission cannot therefore accept this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment 29, because a 30% increase in the height of the nets would increase fishing effort for small pelagic species, against scientific advice that calls for no increase in the fishing effort targeting this resource. Moreover, since purse seines may be used to catch demersal species in coastal areas, we should avoid authorising large purse seines that could touch the bottom in coastal areas where protected habitats, such as Posidonia beds, occur.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is however open to regulating this type of fishing gear by differentiating between purse seine fisheries for small pelagic species, demersal species and tuna. Each category should follow different rules. I hope that further refinement will be possible within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendments 30 and 31. It is widely recognised that management of fishing effort should be one of the main management tools in the Mediterranean. Establishing the maximum overall dimensions for certain small-scale fishing gear is a way to address this.</p>
<p class="contents">The huge number of fishermen using this gear makes it indispensable to set maximum dimensions to avoid further increases in size which would result in insuperable walls of nets that impede free movement and migration for several species. Small-scale fishermen should also contribute to conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendments 32 and 34 for different reasons. The list of species in Annex VIII to Council Regulation 1039/98 requested by Amendment 32 contains species which are either not present in the Mediterranean or which can be caught by bottom-set nets and anchored floating nets in coastal areas. It is therefore undesirable to include the full list of species here. In fact the rationale of Article 7(2) as mentioned in Amendment 10 is to list a group of species which are caught offshore in midwater, or close to the surface of very deep waters and which, when they occur in the catch of a bottom-set gillnet or entangling net, are clear signals that such a net is a drift net rather than a bottom-set net. This provision is the only way to enforce the large pelagic drift net ban. Nonetheless, the Commission is open to a large list of species if there is evidence that certain species cannot be caught by real bottom-set nets but only by drift nets.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 34 suggesting a derogation for vessels smaller than 18 metres would gravely weaken the enforcement of the large pelagic drift nets ban. This amendment is based on the assumption that Article 7(2) addresses a type of surface gillnet targeting tuna. This assumption is not correct, since such nets cannot be classified as an anchored floating net or bottom-set net as defined in Article 2(9) and (12) respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I express the confidence that, with the help of the European Parliament, we can put before the Council an improved Commission proposal, which should facilitate its position vis-à-vis the Council. All Mediterranean fishermen and the marine ecosystems that they exploit need urgent and effective fisheries management. The adoption of a new, more effective and specially tailored European Union conservation policy for Mediterranean fisheries will also foster more ambitious steps within the multilateral framework of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are well aware, fishing effort has been increasing in many areas and the exploitation pattern is still not satisfactory. In order to guide Mediterranean fisheries towards sustainable exploitation of the Mediterranean marine ecosystem, the European Union, which is the biggest fishing power in the region, needs to set a good and credible example.</p>
<p class="contents">A more effective Community management framework is needed to recover the full production and productivity potential of the Mediterranean in the interests first of all of our fishermen and also of other European citizens that want to benefit from the richness of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">In concluding my speech, may I once again thank the rapporteur, as well as the chairman and members of the Committee on Fisheries, for their excellent cooperation on this matter. Their proactive cooperation has indeed provided us with a substantial input that will help ensure sustainability for fisheries in the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carmen Fraga Estévez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, through this report, for which it has been my pleasure to be rapporteur, we finally have the opportunity to produce a fisheries management system for the Mediterranean, eleven years after the first attempt to impose order by means of the technical measures regulation, Regulation No 1696/94.</p>
<p class="contents">This is therefore a crucial moment for the fisheries sector in the area, and for having made it possible for us to reach this moment, I must fully acknowledge the work of Commissioner Joe Borg and Director-General Jörgen Holmquist — who have been personally involved in moving this dossier forward — their services, with whom I have worked on a daily basis, and of course my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, who have been wise and generous enough to give up many of their local sectors’ demands, sometimes despite strong pressure, in order not to deprive the whole Mediterranean sector of common management rules.</p>
<p class="contents">With everybody’s involvement, we have been able to unblock the Commission’s initial proposal which, perhaps because it was drawn up too quickly, had opened up apparently insoluble conflicts with the national administrations, with the sector and with this Parliament, which, as you will remember, rejected the proposal by means of the report by Mr Lisi.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to get out of this <span class="italic">impasse</span>, I proposed to the Commission that we work in unison on a common text on the points on which there was the greatest controversy, with a view to achieving a joint compromise acceptable to Parliament and the Commission which we would then present once again to the Council of Ministers. The Commission accepted this method and, following a very hard negotiation and almost a year’s work, this is what we are presenting to the House today for its approval.</p>
<p class="contents">It may not be as ambitious a text as many of us would have liked; perhaps no one got everything they wanted. But we have all lost a little so that we may all emerge winners, because, if there was one thing we all agreed upon, it was that the situation of fishing in the Mediterranean could not remain at the mercy of a minimal regulation, which complicated more than it resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">If politics is a question of sacrificing individual interests for the sake of the common good, I believe that we can feel satisfied with our work on approving this report, which demonstrates that, when we work together, it is easier to make progress, and also that when a text that is balanced, and agreed amongst everybody, is presented to the governments, it is more easily accepted and therefore easier to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">This working method has also allowed us to avoid leaps into the dark with no scientific or logical basis, and certain contradictions in the initial text which led to the outright rejection of the proposal. For example, we introduce rationality and consistency into the regulation of the depths and distances from the coast within which it is possible to fish in such a biologically-, economically- and socially-sensitive sea.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, dredges are regulated, the way is opened for the use of more selective meshes — such as square mesh for towed nets — and considerable progress is made on bringing mesh size into line with the minimum sizes of species.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with regard to the Commission’s maximal initiative on bans, minimum sizes and hooks for the fishing of highly migratory species, it has been agreed firstly to attempt to get the regional fisheries organisations, such as the GFCM and the ICCAT, to produce these regulations, since this fishing is also carried out in the Mediterranean by third-country fleets and it does not make sense to impose restrictions solely on Community vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, if within a period of one year, these international bodies do not achieve a common rule, the Commission will be empowered to present a new proposal, since we do not want to ignore our responsibilities, stemming from our strong presence in the fishing grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the content of the report, I would finally like to stress the effort to provide greater protection for species by means of minimum sizes, with the only temporary exception of hake, where we worked on the basis of a Commission proposal to lower the size to 15 cm — which we have maintained until 2007, when the traditional size of 20 cm will return, coinciding with the proposed increase in mesh.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, for the first time, the size of sardine is regulated, sizes that had disappeared from the Commission’s proposal are recovered, such as the size of clam or striped venus, and reasonable increases in size are introduced for other species, since the ultimate objective is to move closer to the scientific recommendations in the Mediterranean as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, having once again called upon this House to approve this report and, in particular, the compromise reached with the Commission, I shall end by expressing my hope that the Council will fully accept this new proposal, which is the result of this compromise between the European Commission and the European Parliament.</p>

Such a specific character means that, although the objectives of the Community’s management of fisheries must be the same throughout the EU, the means for achieving them must be adapted to the specific features of fishing in the Mediterranean. Doing so would take account both of the various biological, geographical and legal circumstances of the region, and of the aim of utilising the experience and skills of fishermen’s organisations operating in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">One specific feature is small-scale coastal fishing. The majority of fishing vessels in the Italian fleet is less than 12 metres long and therefore we cannot disregard the difficulties that will be faced in converting them for other kinds of fishing – something that is greatly desired by the Community. Small-scale coastal fishing must not only be defined but also safeguarded, and, in the case of reconversion, higher levels of compensation and incentives must be dedicated to it, in order to avoid creating serious socioeconomic problems for the sector as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also specifies the role of the Regional Advisory Council, a body expressly created to promote the direct involvement of fishermen, and the vehicle for bringing first-hand experiences to the decision-making process, in order that Community legislation is increasingly in line with reality and the problems of the fisheries sector. We greatly welcome the role of the regulation for the Mediterranean in introducing common rules, but for this very reason all the non-European countries bordering the Mediterranean need to adapt their legislation to the stock conservation policy. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the position of the European Community at the heart of the large organisations regulating fishing, in order to make the main international forums such as GFCM and<span class="bold"> </span>ICCAT<span class="bold"> </span>more aware of Europe’s fishing tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would also like to draw attention to the centrality of research, inasmuch as the basis of any good policy consists of the quality and depth of knowledge of the factors in play. From this perspective, the specific character of the Mediterranean has always been a problem: over and above the quantity of research, the problem lies in the discrepancy between research and the specific knowledge requirements of an effective management policy. That is why we need to insist in future on the coordination of scientific research and its applicability to the action plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Respect and a degree of humility on both sides have enabled a compromise to be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been possible to reopen a debate with the fishing organisations. We have succeeded in preventing the Mediterranean from becoming marginalised in comparison with other seas, subject to a host of obligations and bans, amounting merely to a policy designed to penalise. Whilst appreciating the fact that the regulation represents a step forward and useful mediation, however, we believe that, even now, it retains an approach that is still linked – albeit to a lesser degree - to a model of fishing suited to the northern seas.</p>
<p class="contents">The northern seas are characterised by highly industrialised and single-species fishing, and they have a completely different marine biology to that of the Mediterranean. That is the reason for the long-standing debate – in committee and with you, Commissioner – on various minimum sizes, which we would have liked to fix more decisively: sardines and cod caught in the northern seas do not have the same rate of biological growth as the fish fauna of the Mediterranean. Equally, it is difficult to dictate overly specific limits on fishing gear, since an artisanal activity, carried out by small fleets, varies from country to country partly according to the kinds and variety of traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">With the implementation of this regulation, we would like to aim at an objective that is rarely achieved: a basin-wide policy, that is, a global approach. That of course involves paying attention to the management and conservation of fishery resources, to anti-pollution efforts and also to the safeguarding of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out, Commissioner, that 80% of the fishing carried out in the Mediterranean is small scale and takes place in regions that are mainly located within the area of the former Objective 1: areas experiencing extreme social hardship, high rates of unemployment, and, in many cases, deprived of social support.

<p class="contents">I wish to make some general comments. Fish, as everybody knows, is an important source of healthy human nutrition and is, quite rightly, much sought after by the consumer. It is also a major source of income for thousands of fishermen and other people involved in the fishing trade, including many small, medium and large businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The seas provide this fish, but uncontrolled fishing practices will eventually diminish supply and kill off the fishing industry. It is thus imperative that measures to manage the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources are legislated for and implemented as soon as possible. This is especially so with respect to the Mediterranean Sea, where stocks of many fish species appear in many instances to be at threshold levels. That is why this legislation is so urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, legislation becomes significant not when it is approved on paper, but when it is implemented in practice. This is a major weakness, especially with respect to fishing. Observation, surveillance and action to ensure application of the rules is unfortunately inadequate in many, if not in most, cases.</p>
<p class="contents">Out there on the high seas, things are not as they should be. Gross violations are committed daily by those who bend the rules or just disregard them altogether. So the first point to be made is that much needs to be done to verify implementation of the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the scientific data available to us. This information is essential if we are to understand and properly assess, for example, fishing stocks, breeding grounds, migration patterns and catchment methods. Are our present scientific data reliable? Unfortunately, it would appear not. It is thus of the utmost importance to direct efforts at getting accurate fishing data, free not only from scientific error but also from external manipulation aimed at boosting personal profits rather than fish conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I refer to the diminishing species of the small- and medium-sized fishing enterprises of the smaller Mediterranean Member States like my country, Cyprus. Already disadvantaged by being a small island at the periphery of the EU, half occupied by Turkish and British troops, Cyprus is now facing the very real threat of having its fishing industry completely destroyed. A few hundred fishermen who have been carrying on the centuries-old family tradition of fishing around their island are now facing annihilation by the bureaucratic and, it seems, heartless dragon of Brussels, acting in conjunction with faceless international commissions whose main concern is to satisfy the interests of the big multinational companies and powerful governments.</p>
<p class="contents">So vessels from all over the world fish freely around Cyprus, but the Cypriot fishermen cannot do so because they are being strangulated by ridiculously low quotas. Take tuna, for example. The EU has a quota allocation of about 18 000 tonnes per year and the Commission in its wisdom has, for some years, considered giving Cyprus a quota of just 5 to 10 tonnes, instead of the 500 to 1 000 tonnes needed. The Commission blames many factors, such as previous years undeclared or erroneous catchment statistics by the Cyprus authorities, but these are just excuses. The fishermen of Cyprus …</p>

I wished to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez, who has accomplished a difficult and delicate, but nonetheless urgent, task in order to regulate and make provision for sustainable fishing in the Mediterranean, a sea that is itself threatened by extremely problematic developments: various types of pollution, decreasing resources, and threats to biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted at this compromise for a number of reasons. Firstly, it sets out in a particularly clear manner which fishing gear is authorised or banned; it lays down the parameters for drift nets, mesh sizes, the minimum size of fish, deep-sea trawling and so on. Equally, it ensures that European policy with regard to other seas of relevance to us, whether in the Atlantic Ocean or the North Sea, is coherent. It was essential to equip ourselves with tools and policies for managing the fishery resources in the Mediterranean. It is also a fair compromise, allowing the majority of the countries concerned to find an effective balance between what one set of countries or another has had to accept or refuse in order to reach this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">There remain, however, a number of issues to resolve which have in fact been raised by the previous speakers. One is the management of the entire Mediterranean basin, since we are only talking about the Member States of the European Union in this compromise. It is advisable, in fact, to strengthen the efforts of the regional organisations and to establish, within the framework of the EU Neighbourhood Policy, how we can reach agreements with the other countries bordering the Mediterranean basin. Further problems relate to bluefin tuna, which is an endangered species, or types of fishing such as purse-seine fishing, carried out for the purposes of aquaculture and involving practices that present an increasing number of problems. This compromise regulation does not directly target that type of fishing, but it is understandable how artisanal fishermen who feel themselves targeted by this regulation find it unfair that no further regulation is imposed on a developing method of fishing that creates huge problems for the preservation of ecosystems, given the means by which it is carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will repeat what Members have said regarding the need for the European Union urgently to conduct a much more active research policy on the Mediterranean. However, we do not have a large amount of the information and data which would enable us to fine-tune these policies and these tools. Equally, I believe that monitoring and implementing them depend on the political will of the Member States to enforce this new regulation. That is what the debate hinges upon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It tries to focus solely on taking measures to ban the use of fishing gear throughout the Mediterranean, whereas it is common knowledge that the burden on this sea's ecosystem is an extremely acute problem of marine pollution, as the result both of the careless use of pesticides and industrial pollution in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We know full well that the composition and fishing potential in the Mediterranean are different, due to the different conditions which prevail and interact, resulting in different degrees of eutrophication and, consequently, of sizes of catch. That is why we emphasise that the levelling down approach taken in the proposal, which generalises reductions in their output, will have different consequences from one fisherman to another.</p>
<p class="contents">When the above generalised bans are applied, they will have tragic consequences for certain areas. That is because, on the pretext of protecting fish stocks, the proposal reduces the fishing capacity, resulting in the immediate reduction and disappearance of income from fisheries for small and medium-sized fishing operations and, ultimately, a mass exodus from this occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">The result of all the above measures being proposed will be the mass destruction of fishing communities and the abandonment of entire geographical areas, while aquaculture will hasten to cover the fishery deficit which is expected to be created and its interests will be strengthened for the benefit of large monopolies operating in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the role of capital in fisheries will become stronger and its previous social and other historic characteristics will disappear. The monopolisation of fisheries will be reinforced, as will the profits of business groups, to the detriment of small and medium-sized fishing operations, the workers and the grass-roots classes, with painful consequences for the marine ecosystem and the environment in general.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the policy of managing fishing capacity and the development of fisheries cannot be comprehended separately from the interests of small and medium-sized fishing operations. We consider that the development of fisheries must, at the same time, respect the ecosystem and the potential of each area, as well as the broader interests of the local society and economy, far from and contrary to the ambitions and interests of big business.</p>
<p class="contents">All this must be incorporated into a more global plan which, using cooperatives of fishery producers as a lever, will make the most productive use of individual fishery potential. Within this framework, appropriate technical measures can be assessed and imposed which will be scientifically substantiated and will be considered necessary in order to maintain fish stocks, safeguard the productive potential of each area ...</p>

It is indeed necessary to preserve a rich and diverse environment and essential food resources for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainable management of the marine ecosystem is essential. Of all the living creatures populating this planet, there is, however, one that has not only duties but also rights. I am referring to human beings. The regulation submitted to us presents a compromise, the intention of which I certainly understand: it is a compromise not only between the different sovereign nations that make up Europe, but also between the ways in which the environment is used and conserved. However, Amendment 10, tabled by our rapporteur, directly affects a Mediterranean fishing activity that is traditional to France, the <span class="italic">tonnaille</span>. This is an ancient fishing technique, specific to the French Mediterranean, in which bluefin tuna are caught using an anchored surface net.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow Members, be aware that, by approving this amendment, you will be signing the death warrant of 1 200 jobs directly and indirectly linked to this activity. On the ground, there is incomprehension, as well as legitimate anger. For years, fishermen in this sector have made significant efforts, particularly with regard to protecting cetaceans, in order to limit the impact of their activity on the ecosystem. Their accidental catches are now only residual. Scientific studies show that this method of fishing is one that respects its environment. I know that this compromise has been difficult to reach, but I appeal to the Commission, the Council and especially the French Government. What are a few extra days of negotiation compared with the distress of 300 families and an entire region? What weight will the argument regarding the compromise package carry, and that of Pandora’s box, which should certainly not be opened in France, where public opinion is increasingly aware that Brussels is out of touch with the reality of people’s lives? Let us not forget that 80% of fishing in the Mediterranean is of an artisanal nature, so why should we always favour the remaining 20%?</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Fraga Estévez, Members, reopen the negotiations in order to save these jobs! Commissioner Borg has just informed us that he refuses to approve our Amendment 34, on the grounds that Article 7(2), on which our amendment is founded, is based on a classification that does not correspond to the text. In my opinion, that is a matter of legal quibbling that concerns the detail of what the Commissioner and his services must regulate, but does not take account of the basis of the amendment, namely the protection of fishermen’s rights, which the amendment must crucially ensure is respected.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, I call on you to vote against Amendment 10 tabled by our rapporteur, whom I nevertheless congratulate on the tireless work that she has carried out, and I call on you to vote in favour of our Amendment 34. On behalf of the fishermen whom you will save, I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are delighted, for example, to see resurrected potential financial support for the biological standstill, even if the new European Fisheries Fund is not considering it. Important matters remain on the table, however, which, in our opinion, are at odds with the interests of fishing in the Mediterranean. A further example: we believe that, given the importance of the whitebait sector, that species can be put on sale on condition that it is caught with statutory gear. That is why we have tabled Amendment 27, which we hope will be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">We have stressed the specific character of Mediterranean fishing a number of times: it is essentially coastal and small scale, a type of fishing that is part of culture and which, in addition to passing down a centuries-old tradition from generation to generation, constitutes a vital source for the economy, particularly in an area – let us not forget – of extensive socioeconomic degradation. We therefore believe that points 3 and 4 of Annex 2 must be taken out, the intention of which is to regulate and standardise the technical features of small-scale gear, which, precisely because it is linked to a specific type of fishing and to specific coastal zones, cannot by its very nature be the subject of regulatory enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">We congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, and harbour the legitimate hope that this regulation may be a significant breakthrough towards a Mediterranean that is careful to preserve its fish fauna, but is also the source of livelihoods and employment for thousands of European fishermen, who, up to now, have only been required to observe bans and limits, whilst for the non-European fleets the Mediterranean has been a kind of free zone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards catch potential, according to the experts, we are reaching the limit and it is therefore right that the European Parliament and the Commission are attempting to put a limit on fishing, to manage catches in a sustainable way and to stamp out destructive forms of fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Fishing and aquaculture, however, represent one of the principal activities of the Union. The European fisheries market is ranked third in the world after China and Peru. In France, Greece, Italy and Spain approximately 100 000 fishermen and tens of thousands of fishing vessels are involved in the fisheries sector. The European fleet – which <span class="italic">inter alia</span> is an artisanal fleet, as the statistical data show – consists primarily of vessels lighter than 10 tonnes. The essentially artisanal character of our fleet and our fishermen is therefore obvious. Citizens thus expect the European Parliament and the Commission to strike a balanced position, reconciling economic and ecological needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the protection of fish stocks must be more strictly based on scientific information than is the case at present, but we must also actively involve fishermen in the management of fishery resources and liaise with the environmental world in order to raise awareness and call attention to employment issues. We therefore call for the gradual application of the new regulations. Mrs Fraga Estévez’s report, on the whole, puts ...</p>

I am convinced that this can only increase the credibility of this common policy within the European fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The cooperation –– which, as I have said, was close and effective –– between the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga –– who has done a magnificent job –– and the Commission services, has allowed us to come to this House today with a compromise acceptable to the majority of Parliament, and with a clear message to the sector, which under no circumstances must we break or spoil.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing is that this cooperation should allow us to unblock a situation which had become unsustainable; unsustainable for the Community institutions, of course, but above all for a sea whose resources have been regarded as over-exploited for some time, but which, owing to its special characteristics, has remained in a permanent state of exception, and it is now time to put an end to that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean is a different kind of sea: national waters are more limited than in other areas of the Community, fish populations transcend areas and are shared, the general characteristics of the activity are different — there is above all a small-scale fishing fleet and a high proportion of fishermen fish on a part-time basis — there are many small landing sites, etc. I have only mentioned a few of the characteristics that make the Mediterranean a different kind of sea, but the objectives of the CFP are the same in the Mediterranean as in other Community waters: we must guarantee that live aquatic resources are exploited in a way that allows for sustainable environmental, economic and social conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, therefore, to the structural and market measures defined in the CFP that are already being applied, the conservation policy must be implemented in the Mediterranean in a similar fashion, as well as the regulations –– which must be improved and developed –– the harmonisation of minimum sizes and technical measures –– which must be absolute throughout the European Union and effective throughout the Mediterranean Basin –– and effective control — which must resolve a problem; the sale in a Member State, which is all too frequently Spain, of illegal fish originating from another Member State, because that illegal fishing damages both parties: the State that is selling it, because it damages resources, and the State that is receiving it, because it damages prices and, above all, damages the faith of the fishermen in the management mechanisms.</p>

It is a contradiction that this is what the EU recommends in the report, at the same time as having fisheries agreements with countries in, for example, Africa. These third-country agreements contribute to overfishing of the oceans and impair many developing countries’ ability to build up profitable fishing industries themselves. A recently published report by the Swedish National Board of Fisheries criticises the EU’s third-country agreements. The criticism is based on the fact that none of these agreements promotes sustainable fishing and that they are also implemented in a way that does not comply with the FAO’s code of conduct. A number of non-governmental organisations share that view and have pointed out that the agreements predominantly affect coastal communities badly.</p>
<p class="contents">If the sustainable development of fishery resources really is a priority issue for the EU, the latter must not only advocate measures in the Mediterranean, as in this report, but also recommend and implement a radical review of its fisheries agreements with third countries. In this report, Parliament has altered the Commission’s proposal, which does not promote sustainable development, in favour of the fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should not work on issues concerning fishing. Issues of this type should be dealt with at regional and sub-regional levels insofar as that is possible. Those issues concerning fishing that presuppose international cooperation may usefully be dealt with within the framework of international bodies in which national special interests are not as marked as is the case in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Through a constructive dialogue, we have explored the avenues to finding some technical solutions to what before seemed to be intractable difficulties. I would like to underline that the aim of the proposal is to create a conservation plan for the Mediterranean. We achieved this through finding a balance and we have instituted measures to protect small-scale fisheries in particular. For example, fishing for bianchetto continues to be allowed in our proposal, but with selective gear, not with trawls.</p>
<p class="contents">With the advent of the new Parliament and when I took office, I had to decide what to do regarding the Mediterranean proposal. It was decided at that time that rather than withdrawing the original proposal, we would leave it on the table, but adopt a flexible approach. That is exactly what we did and, to this effect, we have worked very closely with the Fisheries Committee. We have taken on board the amendments proposed by the Fisheries Committee as a package. We have also taken on board a number of other amendments from individual MEPs. Consultations have been carried out in an extensive manner with representatives of the sector for the Mediterranean, both by the Fisheries Committee and by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We are discussing with the Member States with a view to having the proposal adopted as early as the June Council. We are making significant progress and we can accept certain other amendments to sensitise the regulation even further to the specificities of Mediterranean fisheries, but without forgoing the fundamental principle of sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">We, the Community, have a responsibility to set a credible and strong example. We will continue to work with our partners in the Mediterranean Sea to convince them of the need to adopt measures along the same lines as ours. We have set up the Medisamac as a forum, bringing together most Mediterranean littoral States. We have strengthened the GFCM to be able to use it as a tool to achieve common standards, and we are working to establish a regional advisory council for the Mediterranean, which will work further in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community has to set an example. It has to take the lead in the Mediterranean. Once the regulation is adopted, we will work within the GFCM and with individual third countries through our very good relations with them on all fronts, based now on partnership and neighbourhood, to adopt measures on the same lines as these and to have a level playing field for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, my appreciation goes to all of you, and in particular the rapporteur, for her tireless work. You have come up with a proposal that I will clearly defend in the forthcoming discussions in the Council.</p>

I would also like to thank the President and the members of the committee for its expeditious examination of this proposed regulation. This will enable the European Community to pass a clear signal to the AIDCP at its Annual Meeting beginning on 13 June 2005, that with the adoption by Parliament of this proposal from the Commission, the European Community is well on the road to completing the necessary internal procedures to becoming a full member of this organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to accept a number of amendments suggested by Mr Freitas, notably Amendments 2, 3, 5 and 6. In particular, these amendments will increase the transparency and simplify the understanding of the content and reasoning behind the need for this Council decision, which will enable the Community to fulfil its international obligations to become a party to regional fisheries organisations where they exist and to defend Community interests in the global fisheries. This will also enable the Community to be at the forefront of these organisations and enhance the leading role that it has constantly played in the operation of regional fisheries organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not, however, in a position to accept the remaining proposed amendments, with the exception of Amendment 4, which I can accept provided that the phrase ‘and its certification scheme’ is deleted. I will comment on the certification scheme later with respect to other amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I find difficulty in accepting the other amendments for the following reasons. This proposal relates to the approval of AIDCP, whereas Amendments 1, 9, and 11 focus heavily on a secondary issue of the AIDCP, namely, the tuna tracking and verification system, which is already EC law. Amendment 10 requires that future changes to the tuna tracking and verification system regulation follow a certain process, in contradiction to the appropriate comitology provisions within the regulation. This regulation is already in force and changes can be made to it as and when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 7, 8, and 12 relate to the issue of AIDCP certification and consumer information. Again, such amendments are not helpful in this instance since the issue of whether the Community accepts AIDCP certification is still being considered by the Member States and, pending such a consultation, the Commission has not adopted any fixed position. The inclusion of any reference to certification is premature and could prejudice the internal debate that still has to be concluded. Furthermore, the issue of certification is not one of the objectives of the AIDCP, nor is it included in the general measures of the AIDCP Agreement, nor in the application of the AIDCP Programme itself. This is a secondary commercial economic interest that is a consequence of the implementation of part of the AIDCP, and not a core element. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Duarte Freitas (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have suggested a balance that I believe can be struck between the conservation of eco-systems and the social and economic interests of the fisheries sector. Although such a balance will be difficult, it is often an attainable target, as evidenced by this compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur of this proposal for a decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme, I was delighted to see that it is possible to coordinate strategies that can meet the interests of fishermen and of all of those involved, while ensuring that eco-systems can be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme on which this Agreement is based, and which the Community intends to conclude, has three key priorities: firstly, to monitor the abundance of dolphins and levels of dolphin mortality linked to tuna fishing in the area covered by the Agreement; secondly, to study the causes of dolphin mortality during fishing operations, whilst at the same time promoting fishing techniques and gear capable of minimising these effects; and thirdly, to study the impact of various fishing models on various species of fish and other creatures in the pelagic ecosystem.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to accomplish the objectives, the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), which is coordinating this programme, is proposing to put in place a range of measures, among which I should like to highlight the implementation of sustainable fishing quotas for tuna caught in the Agreement area and the presence of on-board observers during each fishing trip. As they are aware of the importance of conserving fishing stocks, the vessel owners and fishermen have developed fishing techniques that are less harmful to the target species and to the by-catch concerned. It is important to emphasise that the efforts led to a reduction in the by-catch of dolphins in the Agreement area as a result of purse-seine fishing from around 150 000 in 1989 to 1 500 in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as playing an important part in preserving dolphin communities in this region, this Agreement has also helped to preserve the ecosystem as a whole by preserving communities of other species in addition to dolphins, such as sharks, turtles and other aquatic animals often killed, thanks to the use of different fishing gear specially designed to catch these species of tuna. This demonstrates the high level of selectivity achieved thus far and goes to show the value of this programme that the Community is seeking to sign up to.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the technical measures involved, the programme encompasses a ‘dolphin-safe’ certification scheme for products caught without any harm being done to dolphins. Let me stress the point that this certification can only be awarded to products where no dolphin – or other species not being fished – is harmed. The issue of certification has been extensively debated in the UN’s Committee on Fisheries and Food and Agriculture Association and in the European Commission, which, as I understand, is in the process of drawing up a communication on the issue of eco-labelling. This is a very important subject, which is worthy of debate, because in the case of tuna there are a number of non-governmental organisations that have, sometimes less than transparently, influenced the trade flow of processed tuna products in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel, Commissioner, that following discussion in the Committee on Fisheries, this was an important time to raise awareness among the Commission and all of the members of the Committee on Fisheries of the fact that the European Union needs to regulate the issue of eco-labelling, and it was to an extent with this in mind that some amendments were tabled. I feel that there must be a public body in charge of this process, although private firms and non-governmental organisations can be partners prior or subsequent to this process. For the entire certification process to have the highest possible credibility, however, there must be a public body in charge.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, and in line with the guidelines of the common fisheries policy, I believe that this programme deserves a favourable opinion from Parliament with regard to the conclusion of this Agreement by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that this report was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Fisheries, and I am grateful to the members of that Committee. I also wish to thank the scientists, the organisations, the Commission, of course, and non-governmental organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund, which attended a mini-hearing that I had arranged. I feel that this mini-hearing helped to convey the importance of this programme and to show that it is possible to have Agreement between fishermen, scientists and politicians on such an important issue. It might also serve to show the EU’s future role, as I said, in a good light, as regards this Agreement, by safeguarding its content, and throughout the eco-labelling process in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we know, it concerns the 2 billion dollar tuna industry. We all eat tuna and we are all familiar with the wide range of dolphin-friendly labels that appear on tuna cans and jars. These labels have, until now, been unregulated, confusing and often misleading. This initiative seeks to change that. The Freitas report shows why the governments of 15 countries in Latin America and Central America have joined with the EU and the US to support the Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme (AIDCP).</p>
<p class="contents">The eastern Pacific fleet targets large, mature yellow-fin tuna that swim beneath schools of dolphins, sometimes 20 000 strong. If any dolphins are caught in the tuna nets, up to half a dozen hardy fishermen with diving equipment jump into the nets to herd the dolphins to one end, where they jump to safety over the cork lines. Only when the last dolphin has been freed is the net hauled on board. There is no by-catch of any kind associated with this method of tuna fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Trained government observers are on board every tuna boat; vessels are licensed only if they have no record of violations; skippers must be trained and qualified; and by utilising that exhaustive system, dolphin deaths in the eastern Pacific have been dramatically reduced from 350 000 per year in the 1980s to fewer than 1 600 per year at present. Of an estimated population of over 10 million dolphins in the eastern Pacific alone, this is really insignificant. That is why Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund support this fishing method in preference to others where there is a large by-catch.</p>
<p class="contents">EU support for the AIDCP label has posed a significant threat to some NGOs, which have hijacked the international tuna industry and become its de facto regulators. One Californian NGO, in particular, has become enormously rich by receiving a payment for every can of tuna carrying its dolphin-friendly label. The fishing method that this NGO supports may well be dolphin-friendly, but it causes the death of tens of thousands of sharks as well as leatherback turtles and even young, immature yellow-fin tuna, which are tossed dead back into the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">It is outrageous that this organisation now holds the international tuna industry to ransom, threatening to blacklist on their website any supermarkets that refuse to sell cans of tuna carrying their dolphin-safe labels. Members of this House have even received hostile, threatening and aggressive e-mails from the organisation this week. Their days are now numbered. The AIDCP label received unanimous support in the Committee on Fisheries and I believe that it will be supported by the majority of Members of this House today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that dolphins would vote for it if they could!</p>
<p class="contents">The goal of the AIDCP is progressively to reduce incidental dolphin mortalities in the tuna purse seine fishery in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The aim is to reach zero levels through the setting of annual limits and the long-term sustainability of tuna stock in the agreement area.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that the WWF and Greenpeace are supporting and promoting the agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme because it is a legally binding instrument that consolidates the results of an effort of interested governments, the tuna industry and the environmental community that, in less than 20 years, has led to a dramatic reduction of the mortality of dolphins in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. More than 100 000 dolphins were killed in 1986 but thanks to this scheme fewer than 1 500 were killed in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The AIDCP has established two systems: the tuna tracking and verification system, and the dolphin-safe certification system. Many of us like to eat tuna and European consumers consume over 530 000 tonnes each year. Most consumers would like to know that the tuna we eat has not resulted in dolphin by-catch deaths. The accuracy of some supermarket dolphin-safe labels has been questioned and according to the WWF the AIDCP systems for tuna tracking and dolphin-safe certification together represent at present the only programme that can guarantee consumers that the tuna labelled as 'AIDCP dolphin-safe' has in fact been caught without killing or seriously injuring dolphins.</p>
<p class="contents">These outstanding results are obtained mainly through a system of independent observers on board, which is the only system that guarantees the coverage of 100% of the fishing trips by large tuna purse seiners in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and a set of stringent technical and operative requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The new label which will be introduced in the EU now guarantees consumers that no dolphins have been killed. People's purchasing power has won the day. The international fishing community has now woken up to the fact that consumers will not accept unnecessary deaths or damage to our environment in the food and fisheries industries. I urge colleagues to support this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Industrial tuna fishing threatens not only tuna fish stocks but also other species, of which the best known is the dolphin. The Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Programme came about because a very great many of our people wanted to prevent dolphins from dying as a result of bad fishing methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are making sure that the agreement is implemented in our legislation, it is important for these objectives to be attained. As my fellow MEPs have described, the work has so far been quite successful. Amendments 9 and 11 – tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the committee, where they were supported – are important for ensuring that consumers are not taken in by labelling. A reference to Article 3 of the Regulation of 2003 is important for also informing everyone who fulfils the conditions about the correct labelling requirements and ensuring that no one can fecklessly take advantage of these. This is something to which Mr Stevenson referred. We cannot forgo mentioning that, for this is Parliament’s opportunity to express its will to you as you continue to negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also evaluate the dolphin-safe methods, which can be improved so that they do not harm other species. Log sets kill sea turtles and many other species. I know that the AIDCP has embarked upon work to improve these methods. It is important for us constantly to monitor developments and use the best possible methods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us consider the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is the body whose common fisheries policy has created massive iniquities. Take the unfair treatment of United Kingdom fishermen, now, thanks to Brussels, struggling to survive, while Spanish fishermen, for example, seem able to flout the rules at will. Consider, too, the appalling depletion of fish stocks in EU waters as a direct result of the CFP. Then there is the fact that one million tonnes of dead fish are thrown back into the North Sea every year. Not only is it hugely wasteful, it is also damaging the ecosystem. Evidence, indeed, of the law of unintended consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has also concluded unfair and immoral fishing agreements with many third world countries in Africa, which allow European factory farming boats, not unlike the ones that pose a threat to dolphins, to come down and plunder African seas of all their fish. So badly has that hit the local economies that local fishermen have now turned to hunting in their hinterland, destroying local wild animal stocks. These debt-ridden countries have little option but to accept grossly inadequate sums of money for this presumed privilege. It is therefore no surprise to me to see the EU attempt to sign up to an agreement that has been condemned by dolphin conservationists. Why, after all, should the EU listen to experts?</p>
<p class="contents">Vessels participating in this programme are allowed a dolphin mortality limit. Explosives and speedboats are commonly used to scare dolphins and the programme even allows the deliberate killing of these animals, with over 1 400 observed dead last year, according to the Earth Island Institute’s ‘Dolphin Safe’ programme. If the EU were genuine about this sort of issue, it would adopt the position taken by the United Kingdom and ban pair trawling. After all, we in Britain have made some good decisions. We stayed out of the euro zone, our Prime Minister has probably dealt a mortal blow to the proposed Constitution, but, instead of following good practice, the EU seeks to sign up to a questionable agreement, simply to attempt once more to justify its own dubious international status. It shows, yet again, that if the EU is the answer it must have been a very stupid question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I also take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Fraga on her report on the Mediterranean. These are thorough reports which respond to the current situation, in order to ensure that we shall have seas with fish in them both now and in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also take this opportunity, while we are debating dolphins, to mention an incident which took place in my country. What happened is that, after a storm at sea at the end of May, a kilometre-long net was found abandoned in the northern Aegean, which had been tossed around by the storm for 10 days and which, when it was noticed, had already caught dozens of dolphins and dozens of rare cetaceans which are threatened with extinction. This was an ecological disaster which came to light and was discovered, because there are others which we know nothing about.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that the area of the northern Aegean is a rare and important marine habitat, because the River Evros flows into it, the waters come from the Dardanelles and, within the framework of protection for all seas, we must also pay particular attention to the Aegean.</p>
<p class="contents">This unfortunate incident proves yet again that the environment has no borders. Broken nets spread death and this should worry us. I should like to say that it is our duty to protect the environment and the report by our honourable friend moves in that direction, which is why we should all vote for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express to everyone a view which should prevail among us. It is our duty to protect the marine environment. Our children have a right to be able to fish in it also. We have an obligation to leave fish in our seas for future generations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would like to express a few humble opinions that may be a little discordant but which I believe may add some things that have not been said. Firstly, the main reason for the European Community to be involved in the IATCC and the AIPCD stems from the presence of the European or, if you like, the Spanish, tuna fleet in the Eastern Pacific, where it has been fishing since 1975.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this because, in the explanatory statement in Mr Freitas’s report, the justification appears to be based on other reasons and not on the presence of our fleet in the Eastern Pacific. Our fleet fishes in the Eastern Pacific and it has, of course, never fished with dolphins, because a Community Regulation prohibits it: Council Regulation No 850/98 of 30 March 1998, Article 33.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I believe it may be useful to this House, I would like to say that the AIPCD has been created as a result of a specific problem involving the United States fleet, and subsequently the Mexican fleet, the Venezuelan fleet and the Colombian fleet, the only ones which, together with El Salvador, currently fish with dolphins. I believe that this is something that we, as Europeans, can be pleased about.</p>
<p class="contents">We, who have been fishing in that area –– as I have said –– since 1975, participate in the AIPCD despite the fact that our activities have nothing to do with the true objective of this agreement, because we do not fish with dolphins. The EU signed this Agreement, the AIPCD, on 26 April 1999, it communicated that decision to the trustee of the AIPCD, the United States of America, by means of a verbal note on 8 June 1999, and at that time, the Council considered that signature and that provisional application to be the first steps to its subsequent approval by the EC.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, for technical reasons, the Community could not join the IATTC, the Council authorised the Kingdom of Spain to accede to the IATTC Convention on an exceptional basis. That accession took place in Guatemala in 2003. The decision foresaw that Spain would participate in IATTC decisions in line with the Community position and in close cooperation with the Commission, which guaranteed the Community’s effective participation in the IATTC.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore of the opinion –– and this is an opinion –– that the report must call –– perhaps the Commission could enlighten us in this regard –– for the definitive ratification of the AIPCD by the European Union, and not its accession to this Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a comment on Amendments 11 and 12. At no point does the Regulation talk about the ‘dolphin-safe’ label; that label, as such, does not exist. What Article 3 of the Regulation does contain is a series of definitions which include what is understood by ‘‘dolphin-safe tuna’.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and I believe that we perhaps need to be a little more realistic about the issue we are discussing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The objective is a shared one. It is important for the Commission to enhance its role in regional fisheries organisations in supporting conservation measures that are put in place not only in European but also in international waters. Membership of the organisation will help us attain higher standards as regards by-catches of cetaceans. Since the establishment of the AIDCP, the by-catch of cetaceans has dropped from 150 000 to 1 500. This in itself is a great success and worthy of support.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur and other speakers raised the issue of eco-labelling. Firstly, the option of the AIDCP ‘dolphin safe’ certificate by the Community is currently being examined by the Member States. In addition, the Commission will be adopting a proposal on eco-labelling within a couple of weeks, which will clearly feed into the process of considering whether to adopt the AIDCP certificate. The communication will set out three options for consideration: retaining the status quo, having a mandatory Community-wide label or setting minimum criteria. At this stage, the Commission is leaning towards the third option, and we look forward to a constructive debate with Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to assure you of the Commission’s and my own personal commitment to continuing to work towards minimising discards and by-catch, especially of cetaceans. I count on the support of this House, so that we can work together in achieving improvements in our current practices and methods.</p>

This is no coincidence. It is because we are barely a year into enlargement and there is no doubt that an increase in momentum, in both social and economic terms, would definitely be in the interests of the Union. In this regard, speeding up the process of social inclusion is by no means an issue of secondary importance; the facts show clearly that the new Member States lag behind, to a much greater extent than the old ones, in this area and therefore have a great deal of catching up to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we all agree that we do not want a two-speed Europe, a Union where the social protection system is highly developed and of a high standard in one half, while in the other half, it is as full of holes as an Emmental cheese and eroding further, year on year due to government financial difficulties, government budget constraints, restrictive measures and similar difficulties. If such a situation were to arise, then there really would be grounds for concern about social dumping, which we all regard as undesirable. This is why it is important in the period that lies ahead to make genuine progress, perceptible to everyone, in the field of social inclusion. This is the only way we can prevent other social groups in the new Member States from falling into social exclusion. If this were to happen, it would have negative consequences in terms of labour market stability, economic output and social cohesion and would give rise to a whole range of other problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is a kind of inventory of the prevailing problems and it paints a fairly accurate picture of the processes currently under way. As regards disadvantaged sections of society, it covers almost every social group affected, focusing particularly on the situation of older people, women, minorities that suffer discrimination – including the Roma – as well as homeless people, people suffering from addiction-related problems, people living with disabilities, children at risk and immigrants. It places particular emphasis on the close links between the provision of education and training opportunities and improved prospects for the disadvantaged citizens accessing them. In the short time-frame available to me, I would like to continue by highlighting just three of the cardinal issues of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The first key element is that it is crucial in terms of our future prospects of catching up to recognising the particularly close link that exists between job creation and the economic policies promoting it, and the social systems that represent the primary pillars of social inclusion. It follows logically from this that social inclusion policy can only be successful if it goes in tandem with, is based on and builds on, an appropriate economic policy. If we fail to ensure that the two are in harmony, failure in the social sphere will be inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">The second key element in fact is a structural problem. I am thinking here of the indebtedness of local authorities, which has recently accelerated to a dangerous degree and is closely connected to the fact that local authority finances have been unable to keep pace with the expansion of their social duties. This is not a problem that is exclusive to the new Member States; it is a familiar phenomenon in the old Member States too. Of course it is perfectly logical that governments, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, should try to address the majority of problems at local level and the reasoning that most information is always available at local level is perfectly valid. For this to work, however, financial resources need to be provided and this has unfortunately failed to happen in recent years. As a consequence, we now find ourselves in a situation where, for example – if I may cite an alarming case in point – the combined local authority debt of the four ‘Visegrád’ countries has now exceeded the psychological barrier of 10 billion euros. Debt on this scale certainly gives grounds for common reflection at the very least.</p>
<p class="contents">For my third point, I would like to refer to the matter of cooperation. It is true – and the report does not dispute this – that social policy is an area of national responsibility of Member States. And so it should be. However, the ability to exercise national competences is by no means impeded by exchanging good practice and sharing information; furthermore, it is in the fundamental interests of all of us. Alongside serious problems, we need to see that there are hosts of good initiatives, innovative ideas that point the way forward and successful projects. Why should we not share these with each other? Unfortunately, the situation at present is that the new Member States pay too little attention to each other and so in most cases, things that could potentially be common treasures, stay hidden and others are unaware of their existence. Appropriate institutional frameworks for this are lacking too. So, in my opinion, these are the three main areas in which we need to make substantive progress. Allow me once again to express my thanks to the political groups and to my colleagues for their highly constructive and helpful support throughout the process of drafting the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very timely and helpful report, which should significantly strengthen our efforts to promote social inclusion across the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the points and policy priorities recommended in the document are very much in line with, and reinforce, the Commission's own analysis of the situation. The report is also very useful as it draws attention to a number of issues that require greater emphasis and more effort from Member States and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of tackling poverty and social exclusion and building a more inclusive Union was reinforced in the conclusions of the recent European Council meeting in Brussels. The social inclusion process will operate in parallel with and complement the Lisbon agenda, focusing on economic growth and employment. In that way our efforts in the areas of economic growth, employment policy and social cohesion can reinforce each other.</p>
<p class="contents">The ongoing mid-term evaluation of the EU's social inclusion process will, towards the end of the year, lead to a communication proposing new integrated and streamlined common objectives and working methods for the open method of coordination on social protection and social inclusion. The points raised in your resolution are a very valuable contribution to the current evaluation of the process. We will take them into account when we prepare our communication.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been making significant progress on several issues raised in the report since the Commission and the new Member States prepared their joint memoranda on social inclusion in 2003. I should like to mention two of them: harmonisation of statistics and the exchange of learning.</p>
<p class="contents">You rightly emphasise the importance of harmonising poverty statistics and criteria defining poverty. There has been very good cooperation between the national statistics offices and Eurostat in developing our new statistical instrument, the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, EU-SILC. That will certainly help us monitor progress across the Union. As regards the exchange of good practice, the new Member States have been playing an increasingly active role in the current Community Action Programme on Social Exclusion. The proposed new Community Action Programme (Progress) will, from 2007, allow us to further extend the exchange of learning and good practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue raised in the report is increasing the resources available for social inclusion matters. In this regard responsibility rests primarily with the national authorities. However, the Commission put strong emphasis on ensuring that the use of European social funds is closely connected with the goals indicated in the national action plans on employment and social inclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">As clearly stated in the resolution, improvement is required in almost all the dimensions of social life. At the same time, most new Member States are undergoing difficult economic reforms and many are faced with high levels of unemployment. There are also significant budgetary constraints, which limit the room for manoeuvre for social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be realistic and bold in addressing these major structural issues. Ensuring economic and employment growth will certainly help to increase social cohesion, but investing in social inclusion and human capacity is an essential complementary element in supporting sustainable employment and economic progress.</p>
<p class="contents">The report will help ensure that we continue to have a strong social inclusion process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Parliament supports and upholds this step.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs calls in particular on the Commission to succeed in outlining a common policy in the form of a common theme, a clear policy shared by all of the Member States. In order to do this, the European Commission has to consider the appropriateness of choosing the open method of coordination, which is clearly unable to fully achieve the assigned objective; make sufficient funds available for the project, in order to make the citizens and residents of the new Member States more involved in the European project; carry out an evaluative across-the-board analysis, refocusing on the failure to respect civil liberties, access to fundamental rights and the fight against all forms of discrimination, and facilitate the task of preparing any sanctions that may be needed; highlight more clearly the problems relating to access to the law and justice, with a more detailed analysis of migration patterns, distinguishing between immigration of third-country nationals and the situation of other ethnic or cultural minorities; review the existing division of responsibilities between the Union, the Member States and the regions, and propose means of institutionalising the ‘best practice’ approach; ensure access to the legal system for vulnerable groups and minorities; unify, streamline and simplify the emergency procedures and resolve the remaining problems regarding stateless or other persons in difficulty who continue to be denied citizenship or the right of residence.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of these efforts concerning fundamental rights, the European Union can develop towards achieving a greater level of justice and shared civic values, which are the foundations of the social Europe that we all hope and pray for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has identified these challenges very clearly, and I would like to congratulate him on his excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty and the related problem of social inclusion have a specific dimension in the new Member States. This is not only because the poverty threshold is considerably lower in absolute terms, which means that poverty is ultimately more severe than in the 15 old Member States; it is also because poverty takes on special forms for the women of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">All sources indicate that single parents and older women are the most likely to face a greater risk. The opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality therefore highlights extreme forms of poverty and an absolute shortage of comparable and reliable data. However, there is a very dangerous phenomenon that seems to be emerging, and which has been overshadowed by data on the adult population, namely the high risk of child poverty. Although analyses indicate that poverty affecting children is often more severe and that the number of children facing the risk of poverty is increasing, exact figures are not available. University research conducted in 2001 estimated that the risk of child poverty in the old Member States exceeded that of the adult population by as much as 14%. A national report on youth policy which was published in my country yesterday states that the proportion of children facing poverty is 30%, or as much as 40% for those in single families. It is impossible to ignore the correlation between this figure and the alarmingly high number of early school-leavers: 14% of girls and 18% of boys in Europe in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, poverty is generally said to have a woman’s face. We should perhaps modify this generalisation: poverty has a child’s face. When considering implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the Social Inclusion Strategy, we should bear this in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report highlights some of the problems and some of the causes. It also pinpoints some of the solutions. However, what is so impressive is that this report does not come from an MEP from one of the old Member States, lecturing the newcomers on what they should do to catch up; this rapporteur comes from one of the new Member States. He writes with passion and knowledge about the problem, because he understands what needs to be done, because he is not afraid to pinpoint failings in his own country, and because he cares. He is a perfect example of one of the many talented MEPs who have joined this Parliament following enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">He is right to flag the need for better education and right to raise the importance of increased funding by central government in this regard. He is also right to talk about improving labour mobility, because unless there is more flexibility in the labour markets, the economies cannot fulfil their growth potential and the funds will simply not be there for governments to spend. There is a lesson here, too, for older Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the wisdom of the rapporteur and I congratulate him strongly on his report.</p>

I would remind the House that the report he has drafted on social inclusion in the new EU Member States, which we are today discussing together, was approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs by a majority of 32 votes to 4. The result of the vote is, then, a clear demonstration that we all, across the political spectrum, recognise and acknowledge the urgency of problems relating to social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we are not unfamiliar with this finding. We all know that representatives of European governments and countries came to the same conclusions at the Lisbon summit in 2000, when the war on poverty and social exclusion was made one of the central topics and conditions for modernising the European social model. Despite certain hesitations, this view was also confirmed at this year’s spring summit in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the results achieved during the last five years, it is clear that the war on poverty and social exclusion is nowhere near over, and that considerable efforts and resolve will be needed even after 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has undertaken a truly difficult task in comparing the state of social exclusion in the 10 new Member States. These countries differ not only from each other; fundamental differences also exist between the regions within them. Although there is still room for elaborating and harmonising common indicators that would most faithfully reflect the actual situation in these countries and, at the same time, enable us to discover examples of new practices, this action by the European Commission is undoubtedly a step forward. I would like to use this occasion to call on its representatives to cooperate as closely as possible in the future and to make use of the resources and knowledge of non-governmental organisations and social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the fact that although the report that we have before us today describes and endeavours to compare the situations in the 10 new Member States, we must not forget that the threat of poverty and social exclusion is faced by every EU Member State, albeit not to the same degree.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion is often expressed that social partners, and in particular trade union organisations, should be closely involved in all measures in order to help solve the problem of social exclusion; indeed, the question of whether they should take over the functions of state and local authority has even been considered. Such opinions are no more than an illusion, however, at least in the meantime. The restructured trade unions in the new Member States are in a difficult situation; they are subject to pressure, they lack the necessary structures and they do not have effective tools available to them. Mr Őry is well aware of this, as am I, since we have both worked in trade unions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer to the Constitutional Treaty and the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">An understanding of the most complex social problems faced by the Member States and a desire to solve these problems would render moot many of the arguments put forward by those who voted against the Constitution. The reason for this is that many issues relating to EU enlargement were either misrepresented to these voters or misunderstood by them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Őry report is thus concerned with solutions to problems that have a direct bearing on the EU’s future. Our debate on this issue, and the majority by which the House adopts the report, will prove that we are aware of the significance of this problem, and that we know it involves banishing the spectre of social dumping from the European Union. What is more, the fact that the goals of competitiveness and social cohesion as enshrined in the Lisbon strategy are complementary rather than mutually exclusive is emphasised. This was why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs underlined the importance of economic development in facilitating social inclusion during its debates on the report, and indeed the Commissioner also stressed this aspect of the issue a short while ago.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to congratulate Mr Őry on the way in which this report has been drafted. I am delighted that the aforesaid Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted it by an overwhelming majority. Improvements could perhaps have been made to the way in which the proposed amendments were incorporated. In fact a number of the amendments I tabled on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe were ignored, even though they would have improved the report without making any fundamental changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are debating today is an excellent one, and my group will vote in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to make some comments about the process of EU integration. In the majority of the new Member States, the only social stratum benefiting from EU accession is the national, economic and political elite. As can be seen in the report, the gap between rich and poor has become wider. For example, in my country, Latvia, a recent opinion poll showed that 84% of the population thought that their standard of living was much better ten years ago. The national, economic and political elite is mostly responsible for the current social disintegration in their countries. However, because they have ignored the unfavourable changes in the new EU Member States, the EU institutions must bear part of the blame.</p>
<p class="contents">The social instability in the new Member States is endangering political stability and economic growth not only in those states, but also in the EU as a whole. This is the result of a number of mistakes made by EU institutions during the enlargement process. One such mistake was to ignore the fact that in two Baltic States, Latvia and Estonia, a significant part of the population is stateless. These so-called ‘aliens’ belong to national minorities, and the fact that they are deprived of political rights promotes social exclusion and means that persons belonging to minorities cannot compete on equal terms in the labour market</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, yesterday, during the vote on the amendments to the report by Mr Moraes on the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies, the recommendations that these people should be given the right to participate in local elections and granted freedom of movement within the Community were removed as a result of the amendments tabled by some political groups. This totally ignores the EU's own recommendations made in 2004 as part of the enlargement process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the fact that this is the first such report to be drafted by a Member from a new Member State. Ladies and gentlemen, we are facing crises everywhere we turn in today’s European Union. The smaller countries adhere to the Stability Pact, while the larger ones adhere to other principles. All this affects the new Member States, which are still being called on to comply fully with a raft of often nonsensical measures, as the previous speaker rightly emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">Social problems principally affect poor regions, regardless of whether these are located in old or new Member States. Disabled people currently account for 10% of the population, yet only a few countries can be said to have legislation in place that makes at least partial improvements to the everyday situation of these people, including at work. Problems are faced by national minorities, school-leavers, women and the over-fifties. People from socially-disadvantaged backgrounds represent a major problem, and refugees are starting to become one.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the main problem faced by the European Union as a whole? The problem is a system that strives to leave everything to the invisible hands of the market. I should like to cite just three examples by way of illustration. The privatisation of drinking water sources and sewage systems has increased the price of a cubic metre of water more than a thousand-fold. My second example, the enormous pressure to liberalise the rental market, means that 50-70% of pensioners’ incomes in the new European Union countries is now spent on accommodation. And what about tomorrow? Few flats are being built, the mobile labour force often lives in critical conditions, and the situation for unemployed people, young families, disabled persons and pensioners is becoming critical. A third example is disabled people, who form an ever-greater proportion of the unemployed. In the Czech Republic, in northern Bohemia, say, the rate of unemployment among disabled people has risen from 8% 10 years ago to over 12%, despite the measures that have been taken. This is a stark warning.</p>
<p class="contents">People are being asked to join a society where public services have been shut down, public transport is expensive in spite of ever more threadbare networks, crèches are being abolished and the number of nursery schools reduced, after-school activities are being done away with or scaled down, which often involves high financial demands on parents, and the status of trade unions is worsening, as a result of attempts to abolish the labour code. All these are manifestations of extreme liberal tendencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, do you think that our citizens are blind to the extreme liberal language of the Constitutional Treaty? Do you know nothing of the topics discussed in the debate held prior to the referenda in France and Holland? Do you want statistical shortcomings to increase pressure on the new Member States, which are being forced into the ruthless privatisation of all state property? Do you not know that the new Member States are becoming an experimental terrain for the original 15 Member States, in order to test how much more people can take? Am I right, ladies and gentlemen, or is the ‘social state’ dead and we are heading in a completely different direction?</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be welcomed that we have before us a draft report on social inclusion. The fundamental questions are covered in it, as well as being scattered between the lines, even though our future direction, including basic social standards, is still missing. This is a step in the right direction, but a small and timid one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two thirds of these people live in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his accurate depiction of this complex problem, the solution to which is to slash the number of areas of poverty, unemployment and social exclusion. The latter are frequently interrelated, and are sometimes passed on from one generation to the next, which is a point I should like to stress. All our strategies and debates will be worthless unless they achieve certain goals. Firstly, they must make it possible for rapid assistance to be provided to those who need it. This is an important albeit short-term goal that requires appropriate funding. Secondly, they must eliminate poverty, which is the main cause of social disintegration, or at the very least greatly reduce it. This is a long-term goal, and in order to achieve it we will need to boost the economic regeneration of the new regions, thus mitigating the scourge of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I should like to pay tribute to all those working to achieve these goals throughout the EU, especially in the 10 new Member States. I should therefore like to thank local governments and NGOs, including in particular Caritas, as well as social welfare institutions and philanthropists for the work they do. I should like to thank those who create new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I should like to dwell upon just two issues in detail. The first of these is the family. Demographic indicators are causing alarm bells to ring, and assistance for families raising children is a necessity rather than generosity on anyone’s part. We need to find the right solutions. Secondly, there are over 45 million disabled people in the EU. They should at long last be made to feel that they have the same rights as any other EU citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is also a moral dimension to the issues under debate. It is far from easy for a man who has eaten his fill to understand a man who is hungry.</p>

The post-Communist countries have experienced so many changes and transformations over a short space of time that our heads are still spinning.</p>
<p class="contents">One-time Communists quickly found their feet in this new situation. After plundering state coffers, they metamorphosed into businessmen or remained in politics. The weakest in society, and by this I mean whole social classes, have been the least able to find their bearings in the new set-up. Workers have lost their jobs and found themselves in debt after being deprived of their means of production and their markets. Health care is no longer accessible to everyone. The welfare state has downed tools, and citizens have discovered they have been left to their own resources overnight.</p>
<p class="contents">Polish citizens do not have much faith in their own politicians. Instead, they place their trust in the EU and pin great hopes on it. More money is needed to achieve our ambitious goals of social inclusion, job creation and the promotion of entrepreneurship. This is a strategically important stage of the debate on the EU budget, and the Commission and the Council should not forget that every euro invested in the new Member States remains in the EU’s pocket and amounts to investing in the EU itself.</p>

The task facing the ill-equipped local authorities in the new Member States is huge: the low levels of economic activity and to an extent low levels of employment; the modest resources available for allocation to health care in nominal terms despite the fact that the amounts are not proportionally smaller; the particular shortcomings of the education system and social exclusion of minorities. They are supposed to give greater emphasis to activities aimed at the inclusion of disadvantaged social groups by means of their integration and indeed participation, as this area is the wellspring both of the problems that threaten our social cohesion and of the competitiveness we seek. Failure to do so will make it impossible to achieve the Lisbon objectives. In order to speed up the process of social inclusion, a change in attitude is needed; Member States, local authorities, the private sector and civil sector alike must all assume a share of the responsibility – without prejudice!</p>
<p class="contents">Much more funding needs to be allocated for this purpose. Inter-institutional cooperation needs to be better coordinated. Those who voted no to the Constitution were expressing their bitter disappointment concerning the question of Europe’s ability to confront its biggest challenge, namely increasing competitiveness while at the same time retaining the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing system of coordination is inadequate and so is the added value that we can expect from the economic research institute</p>
<p class="contents">In the social welfare sector, new projects are needed that reflect the European dimension of social policy, high-quality projects that provide regular information to those affected and seek to involve them. Later on, this could even take on the concrete form of a common research institute, an organisational expression of the essence of social Europe, examining the social and institutional conditions for enhancing competitiveness and exploring the management of social issues within an innovative paradigm.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the best social policy, without a doubt, is redistribution of employment opportunities across society and provision of labour market training.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak from experience when I say that this dimension has so far been completely neglected in the new Member States, where immigration is not yet reflected at the level of communication. Let them be able to draw pensions, too, irrespective of the applicant’s age, gender or origin, in all Member States of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council opted to place the emphasis more firmly on the ‘G’ of Growth than the ‘S’ of Stability, in light of the current economic recession that the EU is experiencing. The SGP thus became more politicised.</p>
<p class="contents">This review fell short of what was required, however, for a number of reasons, of which I shall highlight two.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, reform was only needed because some Member States chose, consciously or otherwise, not to observe its rules. Worse still, the EU laid down rules that, quite apart from not being implemented, led to a lax and scarcely credible sanctions process. The Member States are both the judge and the defendant, and would rather fail to implement the SGP than impose sanctions on one of their peers. Being responsible for monitoring the process, the Commission must be granted powers to impose sanctions in the event of non-compliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, any sanction must act as a deterrent and not solely as a punishment. Imposing a non-compliance fine on a Member State with budget difficulties is counterproductive. Other sanctions should be put in place, such as suspending ECOFIN voting rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Consideration of the facts makes it clear why this is so. Let us take note of the fact that Germany has at least 3.5 million Muslims living in it, some of them for 40 years, who can still scarcely speak any German. Let us also take note of the estimates according to which, in a few decades’ time, half the inhabitants of France and, quite possibly, one third of the population of German cities such as Stuttgart, will be of the Islamic faith. Let us perhaps give some thought to the regions of Italy in which illegal immigrants are responsible for one third or even one half of all criminal offences. Let us consider how, in Spain, home to over a million Muslims, calls are even now being made to allow Cordoba Cathedral to be used as a mosque again. All this is evidence that these immigrants are very poorly integrated. It is essential that they should not only learn the languages of the countries to which they come to live, but also assume as their own the culture and history of their new homelands. If they fail to do so, the European states will, in a few decades’ time, have no idea whatever of their own identity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Each country is responsible for its inhabitants’ healthcare. When the latter are temporarily in another EEA country, their European Health Card entitles them to unplanned treatment there. That is an arrangement of which we approve and that appears to operate well.</p>
<p class="contents">People are entitled to influence the way in which their tax money is used. If patients are freely to be able to choose healthcare in another Member State and have it paid for by their own country’s taxpayers, that principle is threatened. We fear, moreover, that such an arrangement would be very expensive and favour wealthy patients at the expense of the most vulnerable ones.

It is a document that points out a number of obvious facts: health care is a priority issue in the Europe of 25, since 10% of national GDPs is dedicated to it. Health care is, in essence, a national policy, the great fabric of social cohesion, which is today faced with two major challenges: ensuring that every citizen has access to treatment and managing the explosion in health care budgets in the majority of the Member States, such as Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific nature of health care services justifies, in my opinion, removing health care from what is known as the Bolkestein Directive on services, as provided for by paragraph 4 of the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Health care policy must naturally be extended to European level. That means that patient mobility must be promoted in the same way as that of citizen-tourists, students or businessmen. That justifies the implementation on the ground of the European Health Insurance Card. Launched in 2004 to replace the E111 form, this device is intended to allow citizens, in all cases, to assert their rights to health insurance in a simple and effective way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The need to act together to defend democratic and liberal values creates a new opportunity to renew transatlantic relations. Ms Rice made clear recently that the US needs and welcomes a strong, unified Europe that can speak with one voice. Nevertheless, this policy is not yet reflected in the US approach to EU citizens. Despite the fact that citizens of the new EU member countries in particular long strived for democracy and liberalism in Europe, and offered strong support to the US in its global pressure for democratisation, citizens of the new Member States are still perceived as a security threat to US home security. Therefore, I urge the Commission to start negotiations with the US authorities immediately, and tackle this issue as a matter of high political priority in its relations with the US. I urge the Commission to start immediately to negotiate the application of Visa Waiver programme for all EU citizens. I urge the Commission to use that call for strong, unified Europe and to ask the US to treat all EU citizens equally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a matter of certainty that Islamists are trying to turn this situation to their own advantage and that they will endeavour either to spearhead more popular uprisings or use terrorist attacks as a means towards their ends.

<p class="contents">The worldwide spread of Islamic terrorist activities makes it fundamentally important that this development be counteracted and a peaceful solution sought if at all possible. It is for precisely this reason that the brutal repression of the uprising and the prevention of any objective investigation into it risk transforming popular dissatisfaction into an ever more frenetic spiral of violence. Following the events with a USD 600 million contract to supply oil to China certainly sent out the wrong message.</p>

In actual fact – and one is well aware of this through the debates currently enlivening the old Member States – the fear of social dumping brought about by enlargement is omnipresent, and, in my opinion, unfounded if adequate elements of a response can be found.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first of all like, as is unfortunately the custom in this House, to point out to the Commission that, if funding is not made available immediately in order to implement the recommendations contained in this report, it will go unheeded, however comprehensive it may be. The fight against all forms of poverty and all forms of exclusion is the prerequisite for putting Europe onto the road to social progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We had agreed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs that the responses required on the issue of social inclusion were not simply limited to the field of employment, but that they had to include other major social matters: access to education for all, without ethnic or social discrimination, in order to guarantee a common core of knowledge necessary for people to integrate effectively in society; access to quality health care for all: the fact that, even today, people can recover from cancer in one part of Europe and die from influenza in another will never be justifiable; access to housing for all, which is another of the themes of this report: council houses will have to be geographically spread out in an intelligent manner, in order to prevent any form of ghettoisation; the fight against all forms of discrimination, whether sexual discrimination in the workplace, racial discrimination or discrimination linked to disability or social circumstances, will have to be encouraged and supported.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has now to offer protection: in order to progress, it must primarily be able to protect its people. The basic principles of employment, housing, training and health care are the very foundation of what ought to be the construction of Europe, a Europe that serves Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of the recommendations are valid for all Member States and not just the new countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the report in substance, but I think we should make a clear distinction between European and Member States’ responsibilities. The first weapon in the fight against social exclusion is of course jobs, jobs, jobs. We therefore need to revitalise our economy and reform our social security systems to lead people back to the labour market and not keep them in the poverty trap. The more or less permanent exclusion of 10% of our labour force from the labour market is an absolute disgrace to our civilised society.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur rightly states that combating social exclusion is best done at local level. It is therefore worrying that in many countries – new and old, including my own – the financial position of local authorities is becoming increasingly serious. Local autonomy is meaningless without the necessary financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">In fundamental rights policies and notably the fight against discrimination, the EU can and should play a key role. The EU has an outstanding track record on gender equality. It should be equally active in fighting racism and discrimination and it should be proactively defending and promoting equal rights and equal treatment for all.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the European Commission should be less timid. The European Union cannot turn its head and look away if blatant discrimination takes place, arguing that it is the responsibility of Member States. European values are universal.</p>
<p class="contents">The report highlights the importance of investing in children as the best way of promoting social inclusion. Giving children a good start in life and real prospects should be one of the key priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work and congratulating him on having made a distinction in the report between social inclusion and egalitarianism or corporatism.</p>
<p class="contents">When creating special conditions for certain social groups, we must never lose sight of the fact that all citizens must be considered equal. Positive discrimination is as worthy of condemnation as negative discrimination. It is a fact that certain social groups have more or fewer differences or problems. I fully support solidarity with these groups. I am convinced that the best way to achieve their social inclusion is to create equal conditions for all of them. Administrative exclusion and preferential treatment for individual groups is not a path towards social inclusion, but towards continued social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">If we take into account the number of disadvantaged groups mentioned, and rightly so, in the report – or in other words women, single parents, people entering the job market, older people, the poor, those suffering ill health, disabled persons, carers, disadvantaged children, children under threat due to a lack of parental authority, linguistic minorities, refugees, immigrants, Roma, other ethnic minorities, the homeless, alcoholics and drug addicts – it would not be much of an exaggeration to conclude that ordinary, non-disadvantaged citizens are a threatened minority in society.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that we will need to set up support programmes for those who have not succeeded in being included in a single threatened group. The report under discussion aims to fight exclusion, and I believe that – paradoxically – we have excluded 10 countries from the 25 Member States, all of which have equal rights, because they joined the European Union several years later. I firmly believe that, next time, the European Union will also tackle this type of exclusion, and that the next report on social inclusion will evaluate the situation in all the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft report refers to the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. I am aware that the rapporteur wrote his report at a time when it was not yet obvious that the Constitution had been killed off. Since the people of France and the Netherlands rejected the draft Constitution for Europe, these references are groundless and should be deleted from the report. I thank the rapporteur for his good work, which is of benefit for the European Union and for my country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To reiterate a point made by Mr Cabrnoch and Mrs in ’t Veld, however, the report’s exclusive focus on the new Member States is a glaring error, since the problems it discusses affect the EU as a whole. I should like to cite just one example, that being my own country, Poland. Over 60% of judges in Poland are women, and given that this is a profession of considerable social standing, it is hard to see how there can be any talk of exclusion. Similarly, women account for over 60% of doctors in the country, and Poland has more businesswomen in managerial roles than any other country in Europe. This begs the question of why a distinction has been made in the report between the old and the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to alert this House to the fact that events of the kind we saw a few days ago in France, when Perpignan became a battlefield between Arabs and Roma, would be unthinkable in either Poland or a great many other new Member States. In my opinion, the cause of the clashes was social exclusion. What is more, acts of anti-Semitism of the sort that occur regularly in France and Germany would also be unthinkable in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary cause of social exclusion is destruction of the social fabric, by which I also mean the weakening of the role of religion. Religion, the Catholic Church and other religious organisations play an enormous role in weaving the social fabric and preventing social exclusion. Once again, my own country is perhaps the best example of this phenomenon, as both the divorce rate and the suicide rate in Poland are among the lowest in Europe. This shows that social exclusion is not in fact one of the country’s most pressing social problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The modern-day state is taking on too many duties that it is incapable of performing. The report says that the Member States should mobilise non-governmental organisations, confessional associations and the Church to participate in combating social exclusion, and yet it must be stated quite clearly that the state cannot issue orders of this kind. The state’s primary task should be to avoid interfering in such matters.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I should like to make is that the term ‘social dumping’ appears in the report. This unfortunate phrase, which I find quite intolerable, now appears to have replaced the term ‘healthy competition’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my country, Flanders, there is now evidence to the contrary, for we see the Flemish transport industry being dealt heavy blows by cheap transport companies from Eastern Europe, and there are other examples I could mention. I am at any rate delighted that this report on social inclusion in the new Member States, maybe quite unintentionally, puts its finger on a number of difficulties, and indicates the immense structural social differences between the new Member States, many of which today are still struggling to come to terms with the catastrophic legacy from Communist times, and the fifteen Member States prior to enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite many sound proposals and suggestions – we all hope that the new Member States will achieve a level of prosperity comparable to that of their western neighbours as soon as possible – we should not be blind to the fact that social integration of the new Member States may also compromise the cohesion of the whole of the European Union. Consequently, when no protective measures are taken in order to avoid the risks to which our economies are exposed, and to which I have already referred, including social dumping, the reinforcement of social cohesion in the new Member States must go hand in hand with stringent measures that rule out unfair competition within the EU as a whole. If we do not do this, then the European leaders have not at all understood the protests by the Dutch and the French people over the past few weeks, soon, undoubtedly, to be followed by the Luxembourgers and the Danes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a problem that affects not only the old EU Member States, but all Member States, albeit obviously to differing degrees.</p>
<p class="contents">Although much research has been carried out into social inclusion in Western European countries, the scale of this problem still tends to be underestimated in the new Member States, and these countries lack the tools to measure this phenomenon in a genuinely rational and objective fashion. In part, of course, this is a legacy of Communism, which was a system that attempted to eliminate social problems and to bestow transient joy on all its citizens by means of decrees. We are still struggling with the consequences of Communism and its ideology today, and all the countries that were subjected to this system face similar levels of social problems and unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our countries are still lacking large-scale and complementary action plans to coordinate measures in the fight against poverty and social exclusion. The measures that are taken all too often resemble a chaotic struggle by public services to respond to problems that have emerged, and that have usually become urgent. There are a great many reasons why this is the case. Even if we leave those social groups that suffer social marginalisation as a result of non-economic factors out of the equation, the excessively high unemployment rate remains the most pressing problem, and its causes are deeply rooted in the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Unemployment in Poland affects several dozen out of every hundred people. The unemployed frequently cut themselves off from society, and so this phenomenon is one of the reasons behind the sharp rise in today’s most malignant social disease, by which I mean helplessness and passivity in the face of the simplest everyday problems. These are always early symptoms of addiction in the broadest sense of the word, whether it be to help from the state or from others, or even to drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the governments of the Member States can and must be called upon to take decisive steps to speed up the process of social inclusion and to develop instruments that make it possible to improve the living conditions of those most at risk. At the same time, however, we are all aware that substantial amounts of money will be needed to fund the majority of these measures. One can only spend the money one has, and not the imagined sums one would like to have.</p>
<p class="contents">Any debate on genuine social inclusion must therefore be preceded by a discussion on how economic growth can be boosted in the new Member States. Such growth would facilitate job creation, and more jobs and higher incomes would mean that social problems and poverty could be better and more effectively combated.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be unlikely to achieve our goals if we rely exclusively on public funding and social and welfare assistance. I therefore welcome the Commission’s assurances that it will cooperate more closely in the fight against social marginalisation. At the same time, I should like to encourage the Commission to be consistent in promoting greater liberalisation of the market in services. Such liberalisation will boost economic growth in Europe as a whole, or in other words in both the old and the new Member States, and hence reduce social problems. This is our only hope of effectively combating a problem that poses a threat to all of Europe, and I would stress the word ‘all’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report discusses social inclusion in the new Member States, yet it does not address the general social problems faced by Europe as a whole. Unemployment is a cruel fate for anyone, no matter where they live in Europe. It gives rise to many other related phenomena, be it mental stress, poverty or homelessness.</p>
<p class="contents">In one part of the report, the rapporteur draws our attention to insufficient workforce mobility. Yet Europe’s response to the mobility of unemployed persons is to impose what are known as protective or transitional measures. One of the serious reservations many old Member States had about enlargement was a fear of ‘economic migration’ and of the threat to jobs for their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have seen to date indicates that none of the countries that adopted transitional measures have so far filed any complaints regarding violation or avoidance of these measures. The countries that did not impose transitional measures on our countries, on the other hand, have not yet experienced any problems with an increased inflow of cheap labour. Moreover, many countries are benefiting from this cheap, well-educated and multilingual workforce, rather than complaining about it. One such example is the granting of ‘green cards’ to computer experts, or the massive recruitment of nurses for old people’s homes in the United Kingdom. Social inclusion should not only be high on our agenda during the debate on this report; we should also apply this principle with regard to other reports considered by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I should like to take this opportunity to mention the debate on problems relating to working time and compliance with the principle that all working time must be regarded as legal working time, and that all overtime should be properly remunerated. However we conceal overtime, we tolerate a situation in which one employee works from morning to night, while others have no chance of finding employment and become homeless. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Congratulations, Csaba!</p>
<p class="contents">In the new Member States, around five million people are out of work, and the number is increasing, particularly among older people, women, single parents and workers without adequate skills. People with disabilities are marginalised; their chances of employment and of a secure income are diminishing constantly. My colleagues Mr Cabrnoch and Mr Libicki are quite right to point out that such situations also occur in the EU’s old Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is apparent from analysis of the situation in the new Member States that the transition from an economy directed by the state to a social market economy makes major structural problems inevitable. There is work for all to do in ensuring that this problematic period is of only short duration. Unemployment and deficient education are among the major obstacles to inclusion in society. As the community of our Member States is founded upon social values, it must defuse this social timebomb.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs in 't Veld that job creation must have the highest priority; jobs, jobs, jobs, are what we urgently need. One way in which this may be accomplished is by decisive economic reforms that create favourable conditions for businesses. Financial incentives will have the same effect – tax breaks, wage cost subsidies and the cutting of social security contributions spring to mind. Small and medium-sized enterprises are in particular need of support, as is the case in all our Member States; they are potential creators of jobs and apprenticeships, for every single one of which we have to fight, for they are urgently needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The social partners have a crucial part to play in combating exclusion, supplementing the efforts of the public and private sectors, and dialogue between them must be stepped up. I see the foundation of trade unions and employers’ associations as a good idea, for both are needed. It is only when each has a large number of members that they will be enabled to take action, engage in dialogue and achieve a great deal. Exclusion is generally associated with inadequate education and training, and so these need to be improved, while, at the same, disadvantaged sections of the population need to be included. Let us use the experience we have already gained and involve businesses in this.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I would like to make is that the fight against social exclusion is made all the more effective the more the Member States and social partners share information – including both innovative and time-tested practices – with one another. Like our rapporteur, Mr Őry, I regard this as a priority objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we are to combat poverty effectively, we must create more and better jobs, and the quality of those jobs must be seen as no less important.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to highlight the need to use incentives to encourage local organisations to support efforts to integrate more people into the labour market. This activity is important, because as well as contributing towards economic growth, it will also help to ensure that development is characterised by solidarity. In many Member States during the change of regimes and systems, labour rules and the nature of the labour market have also undergone significant change.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, under a new social and political model, the fight against unemployment and for social inclusion also entail improving the quality of education and lifelong vocational training. Other important aspects of this debate are the notion that access to housing is a factor in social inclusion, and the need for effective support for bringing young people with degrees or other high-level qualifications into the labour market, in order to derive maximum benefit from the qualifications that they have acquired in the education system. Including young people in the manufacturing sector will also help to modernise the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hasse Ferreira and I would also like to highlight the proposal by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which urges Member States to attach special importance to eradicating poverty, which affects women, children and ethnic minorities in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to attaching importance to competitiveness, the Lisbon Strategy also encompasses the European social model. In this context, the promotion of sustainable economic development, including the creation of more and better jobs, within the context of social cohesion, is key to ensuring that people of all States of the EU can be in a single market within a developed Europe that is characterised by solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main factors contributing to social exclusion in many of the new EU Member States are high unemployment, almost no labour force mobility and problems relating to the social inclusion of people entering the labour market, women, older people, those suffering ill health, disabled persons and ethnic and linguistic minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Strong economic growth and more jobs are basic prerequisites for the permanent sustainability of social welfare systems. In order to boost such growth, I believe that the transitional measures in place on the labour market with regard to the new Member States must be abolished. No statistical backing has been found for the grounds upon which these measures, which are intended to protect the domestic labour markets of some of the 15 old EU Member States, were introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Education and vocational training systems that function effectively are further factors that boost growth. The number of people leaving education and vocational training early must be restricted, and it must be made easier to move from school to work, especially for those leaving school with low qualifications. Access to education must be improved for disadvantaged groups, and we must provide across-the-board support for life-long learning. A high-quality education system is one that is able to adapt effectively to conditions in a rapidly-changing labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States adopted measures to deal with the problems of poverty and social exclusion in the shape of seven key political priorities. Together with the implementation of this report, these priorities should contribute to an increase in the supply of labour. An accessible, sustainable and high-quality healthcare system will contribute not only to the fight against disease and vulnerability to social exclusion, but also to the maintenance of a productive labour force. Implementation of the content of the report on social inclusion in the new Member States can help improve quality of life in the EU Member States. I would like to join my colleagues in congratulating the rapporteur on his work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel that we share a common view on most of the problems you have raised. Poverty and social exclusion remain very urgent challenges for the whole Union. We have made significant, but not sufficient, progress since the Union’s social inclusion process was instituted following the Lisbon European Council in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure Mr Mann and Mrs in ‘t Veld that economic growth and jobs that promote social cohesion are among the priorities for Europe’s review of the Lisbon agenda. Furthermore, enlargement has increased the scale of the challenge. We have also been encouraged by the high level of commitment shown by the new Member States. The Commission fully shares the view that this process must be accelerated and is thus grateful to Parliament for the strong political support it has given to the Union’s social inclusion process.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mr Libicki, I should point out that from now on the new Member States will be fully integrated into the process. The current report relates to the period before the accession of the ten new members.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Őry and Mr Falbr highlighted the need for cooperation and partnership. I agree completely with this view. Member States are the key partners in implementing the Lisbon Strategy and their commitment to effective inclusion policies is a key factor for success. I equally share your view that the efforts of social partners and civil society are absolutely necessary in tackling the problem of poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Bauer rightly mentioned the poverty risk faced by women, in particular single mothers, and children. Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, as well as the Commission, strongly advocate the principle of gender mainstreaming, an approach which is very useful for addressing the specific problems of women, particularly as part of social inclusion policies. Hence I very much welcome the fact that many new Member States are already applying a gender mainstreaming strategy or including the gender dimension in some of their employment and social programmes. Even in those new Member States where this has not yet been achieved, the joint inclusion memoranda have highlighted the need to pay more attention in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Child poverty is an EU-wide issue which touches the whole range of employment and social policies. It very often occurs when parents are unemployed or good quality jobs are lacking, or – as some Members rightly pointed out – it may result from the exclusion of particular groups, such as the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is fighting against this phenomenon via the European employment strategy, as well as through specific policies, and rightly so. The fight will go on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Violent clashes between security forces and protestors, calling for economic reform and more rights for indigenous people, have been taking place in the streets of La Paz. The fear of escalating violence is growing by the day.</p>
<p class="contents">Such clashes should come as no surprise to anybody, since the causal factors have been in place for a long time. First, there exists a huge and unjust discrepancy in wealth distribution. Secondly, the indigenous population, peasants, and the long queues of the unemployed are largely excluded from economic and political life. Thirdly, about 85% of farmland is owned by only 15% of the population, and fourthly, although Bolivia is thought to have the second largest gas reserves in South America, this natural resource is not sufficiently used for the benefit of the people of Bolivia and is to a large extent taken advantage of by foreign multinationals and a small group of elite beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="contents">All the above, and much more, has led to the potentially explosive situation that we see today. The resolution before you mainly calls for continued efforts to deepen and broaden democracy in Bolivia and urges the EU and its Member States adequately to support the government to bring about a peaceful and just solution and avert a catastrophe of looming civil war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The collapse of the State institutions, the absence of authority and the disorder reigning in La Paz, in particular, make us fear the worst, if the worst has not already happened.</p>
<p class="contents">But what has happened in Bolivia to bring the situation to such extremes? There are many reasons: a succession of bad governments, the failure of fundamentalist neo-liberal policies, the despair of the impoverished masses excluded from the system, the predatory behaviour of the multinationals and — we must accept as well — the lack of understanding — or even worse, the indifference — of the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that, today, Bolivia is a failed, ungovernable and profoundly unstable State whose situation may get even worse, making any solution more difficult and more costly.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in La Paz and Santa Cruz de la Sierra just a month ago, sent by the Spanish Government to assess the situation and to propose possible initiatives. Having re-read the report that I wrote, I regret that things have evolved in the way I predicted, but I do not deserve credit for that, I was not being a visionary; it was already obvious, as it was two years previously, that Bolivia was heading for the abyss.</p>
<p class="contents">On that visit, neither amongst the traditional parties nor the so-called ‘emerging parties’ nor amongst practically any of the political leaders did I find the least shred of a sense of direction for the State nor any lucid or generous analysis of what may be good for the country. All of them, or almost all of them, were calculating what was best for them personally: electing a constituent parliament, prefect elections in the nine departments of the country, a referendum on the emerging autonomous areas such as Santa Cruz de la Sierra ...</p>
<p class="contents">At that time I only came across one fundamental exception: the President himself, Carlos Mesa, whom I found to be a man with good intentions, who is trying to find solutions by means of dialogue and negotiation. But he was, and still is, a lone man, without a party, without parliamentary support, faced with a multifaceted opposition that were demanding contradictory solutions from him. At that point his only asset was high popularity and an unquestionable domination of television communications. Since he was willing — and he has stood by his word — not to put down demonstrations and street protests, the pickets of the most radical parties and unions took over the streets and forced him to resign. Furthermore, they have denied the Presidents of the Senate and of the Congress access to the presidency, though constitutionally they should be the successors to a resigned Mr Mesa, and have forced the President of the Supreme Court, the third in the order of succession, to become Head of State, but only so that general elections may be called in three months time.</p>
<p class="contents">Paradoxically, Mr President, that may be the only and the best democratic solution. But not because of the demands and calculations of the most radical factions, not because that would give the citizens back their rightful role which has been seized from them in the street, because ‘the street ’ has been taken over by minority sectors that do not have the support of the immense majority of the 10 million people of Bolivia.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the international community doing in the meantime? Not much. The issue has therefore been raised in this Parliament: the European Union must be a global player; the European Union and its Member States are the main investors in development aid to Bolivia. Because we want governability and stability for Bolivia and because our interests are at stake, the Council must instruct its Ambassadors to ensure that Bolivia can find a peaceful, democratic and free solution. Never again must Bolivia's wealth, such as silver, rubber or wood, be channelled abroad or towards an internal élite, rather than being used for the benefit of the Bolivian people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Fernández, when it is a case of speakers delivering a speech on behalf of their group, their order of speaking is decided on according to the size of the groups: hence, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, followed by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and so on. When it is a case of giving the floor to authors or of debating resolutions, the sequence is decided on according to the chronological order in which the requests to speak have been submitted. It is therefore not a case of belonging to the largest group, but of being the quickest.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to your question regarding Monday evening, the order of the three groups was: the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. The PPE was not on the podium. That being said, there will be no problem with you, in your turn, taking the floor.

<p class="contents">We have been aware for some time that broad sectors of civil society, in particular the indigenous people, peasants, workers and the unemployed, have been marginalised from the country's political and economic life. But we in Europe cannot act as if what is happening there had nothing to do with us. Twenty-six of the recently privatised companies are in foreign hands, many of them European, but that has not helped to resolve the crisis and has not given the population greater access to gas and water.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that we in the European Union are constantly supporting privatisation processes in Latin America within international bodies, without any guarantees that the minimum principles of corporate social responsibility will be complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">So what happens? Companies receive credits, they invest, they want to make money, but when there are mobilisations by local groups that have been excluded or due to price rises resulting from privatisation, the European companies then decide to leave and furthermore demand compensation for it, which aggravates the crisis even further.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, if the European Union wants to retain a degree of credibility as a supporter of human rights in the world, it must investigate the actions of energy companies of European origin in Bolivia and in other places, and must be much more demanding in terms of compliance with the social responsibility rules by companies investing abroad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also alarmed at the attempts at separatism on the part of certain economic interests in Santa Cruz, which are seeking to monopolise the country’s energy resources.</p>
<p class="contents">As such we hope that Bolivian society can reach a consensus whereby the management control of the country’s natural resources, especially the energy and water resources, can be returned to State hands and can contribute towards its development and towards the people’s well-being. We also hope that the ruling by the Constitutional Court can be implemented, which stated that certain energy conventions signed by the previous government with multinational companies were illegal, given that they had not been submitted for consultation to the Bolivian Parliament. Similarly, the perpetrators of the massacres of October 2003 must be brought to book and we urge the Organisation of American States to take precautionary measures on behalf of the leaders of the social movement who have been threatened, such as Evo Morales and Abel Mamami.</p>

<p class="contents">The Governmental Palace, the home of the Presidency of the Republic, is known by the Bolivians as the ‘burnt palace’. It has been burnt down several times during the many popular uprisings in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Opposite the Palace, in the Plaza de Armas de La Paz, there is a bust of President General Gualberto Villarroel, who was murdered, hung from a lamppost, in 1943 during one of the many insurrections that have taken place there. Fortunately, according to the information I received just half an hour ago, the presidential palace has not so far suffered any damage and the resigning President has just made a dramatic call to avoid bloodshed and civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is my duty to acknowledge, on behalf of my group, that President Mesa has honoured his commitment never to use violence to put down protest movements and I regret that such an exceptional attitude, which is so unusual in a country with a history such as that of Bolivia, has not been reciprocated by the opposition leaders who, in my opinion, have been overcome by events and whose statements over recent hours have become more radical.</p>
<p class="contents">At this moment, in Bolivia, power is in the streets. At a time when the legislators are meeting in Sucre, because it has not been possible to access the Congress building in the capital, La Paz, due to the blockades, the foreign embassies have mobilised their emergency plans for evacuating the country.</p>

Arriving in the La Paz basin, one is immediately struck by the glaring discrepancy between the beauty of the country and the incredible depression that hangs over the people. Someone once described Bolivia as ‘a beggar on a golden throne’, a throne at one time mainly founded upon ore, gold and other minerals, but now, increasingly, upon crude oil and natural gas. In view of the obvious risk that the country could become helpless in the hands of political and economic powers, we are of course obliged to do what we can to help keep it stable. Its neighbours include such major countries as Brazil, in respect of which my colleague Mr Deß has done such exemplary work by ensuring that measures are taken to ensure stability, particularly for agriculture, small-scale farmers and independent farms, along with the slow growth of a small business sector. This is the approach we must take in Bolivia too, or else the country faces the threat of disintegration, with all the resultant consequences for the political map of Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that we must work with all the means at our disposal towards a peaceful transition by way of new elections monitored by the international community, but above all towards the country’s speedier recovery, which will involve strengthening small farmers and small and medium-sized businesses, failing which the country, long at the mercy of conglomerates and conspiracies, risks generating conflicts that would suck its neighbours, including Brazil – particularly its Mato Grosso state – into their maelstrom. It is for that reason that this House needs to finalise a strategy for Latin America. Our Christian Europe forged the two continents of North and South America; there may one day be a bitter price to pay for our present neglect of the latter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are following the situation very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Many countries in the Andean region have faced serious political and institutional crises in recent years, but events in Bolivia have shown it to be a particularly fragile and vulnerable state, not least because it is one of the poorest, least-developed and most unequal South American countries. The current increasingly anarchic climate, which culminated in Monday evening’s resignation of President Carlos Mesa, is deeply worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">At this delicate moment the Commission urges all Bolivian citizens, rich and poor, of all ethnic origins and from all regions of the country, to pursue their respective demands and aspirations peacefully, by means of dialogue, within the framework of democracy and the rule of law and in accordance with the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we are relieved to note that up to now, as far as we are informed, there have been few injuries during the recent unrest, it is now absolutely vital that Bolivia’s political leaders and civil society work together to extricate their country from its current difficulties in a spirit of peace, dialogue, tolerance and national reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The histories of both Europe and Latin America show that violence or non-democratic solutions do nothing to bring lasting peace or prosperity to their citizens. Their heartfelt but often conflicting demands and aspirations can only be tackled successfully by working together to generate consensus and unity. In that regard, the Commission hopes that the efforts of the Catholic church to organise a national dialogue and ensure a smooth constitutional succession will continue and will be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been making a real and practical contribution to supporting dialogue in Bolivia by using our rapid reaction mechanism to provide up to EUR 185 000 to the Club of Madrid to implement a six-month programme of high-level consultancy and support for consensus building and strengthening of leadership skills, which started in mid-April and will continue in the run-up to the long-awaited constituent assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council have also worked in close collaboration to prepare an EU action plan for Bolivia, which was adopted in mid-May. It provides a framework for coherent and structured common action by EU institutions and by the Member States jointly and individually. The action includes engaging in constructive political dialogue, providing support for the constituent assembly, respect for the rights of indigenous peoples, exchanges of experience with different models of regional autonomy and providing constructive input and the benefit of EU experience in securing the benefits of foreign investment for all Bolivians.</p>
<p class="contents">Bolivia has also been included in the list of eligible countries for the European initiative on democracy and human rights for 2005-2006. In the Bolivian context, projects related to training, monitoring and consciousness-raising in the fields of democracy and human rights, projects that promote the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples and projects that support the role of civil society in conflict prevention are all eligible for support. There is, unfortunately, only limited scope for such support to be implemented while Bolivia is gripped by its present crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament, which would underline the need for full respect for democracy and the rule of law and would add a further very important EU voice to the calls for dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In Algeria, President Bouteflika’s Government continues, through judicial procedures lacking in any credibility, independence or justification, in its attempt to silence journalists who are considered by the governing regime to offend or attack the President or the government. In fact, these so-called attacks are no more than the ordinary independent criticisms by political journalists we see on a daily basis in all free democratic countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of this war on the free press, numerous journalists are being dragged before the courts and many have been imprisoned or savagely fined. The list is long and the cases of the editor of the daily newspaper <span class="italic">Le soir d’Algérie</span>, Mr Fouad Boughanem, and the cartoonist, Mr Hakim Laâlam, who were sentenced by a court in Algiers to two months in prison and fined 250 000 dinars for defamation, are recent examples. As indeed is the case of publisher Mohammed Benchicou, already in prison for libel offences, whose transfer to hospital for much needed treatment – requested by the prison doctor – the courts have refused to approve, even on humanitarian grounds.</p>

Since the early 1990s, journalists and intellectuals in the country have suffered constant pressure, attacks and arrests. I need only mention the fact that around 60 journalists were murdered during the civil war of the 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, the main problem is that the Algerian state authorities are openly hostile to the private press, and the international community must respond to this threat. A number of Algerian publications are the target of frequent and routine persecution. Official censorship is imposed, and the state is the sole owner of the printing houses. Publishers are constantly in debt to the latter, which means that the state gains even greater control over both the press and the media market as a whole. Journalists face huge problems, as it is inordinately difficult for them to work under such conditions. They have no official status, no employment contracts and no regular wages, and in practice their trade union is not yet worthy of the name. Lawsuits against many journalists are in progress, while a great many others have already been sentenced to prison. It is not hard for the authorities to put pressure on the press and to control and curtail its freedom under such circumstances, and yet the press is a key source of information and a powerful tool for shaping public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to promote democracy and respect for fundamental civil liberties in Algeria, which after all is one of the EU’s neighbours, we should take firm action to boost the status of the independent media and to foster the provision of information that is both pluralistic and diverse.</p>
<p class="contents">I would call for the EU to give priority to freedom of the press, the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights in Algeria when pursuing its neighbourhood policy in the Mediterranean region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Wide-ranging economic interests are involved, and not only for France. Millions of people come from there to work in the European Union. There have always been several linguistic and cultural groups in the country, but alongside this wealth of languages and cultures there is still a sharp divide between the purely Islamist, hard-line Arab and quasi-European approaches, particularly since independence was gained. The European approach is connected with the use of French as a second official language in public life and in schools. Unfortunately, it must be taken on board that the Arab approach is often associated with suppressing traditional democratic freedoms. The question now is how democratic tendencies can be supported in Algeria.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, before voting on the report I would ask you to give priority to promoting democracy. From what I know of everyday life in the Czech Republic, a country where over 80% of the press is in the hands of two foreign owners from one of its neighbouring countries, I can say that, in certain circumstances, press freedom is crucial for countries. The Confederal Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance naturally supports the motion for a resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The country was liberated after a very violent war of independence against the French colonial power, which lasted for many years, only for its budding democracy to be toppled by Boumedienne’s <span class="italic">coup d’état</span>. After years of stagnation that resulted from that, elections were called; had they not been cancelled, they would have been won by Islamic fundamentalists.

<p class="contents">The Neighbourhood Policy that the European Union intends to develop cannot be indifferent. It would be a big mistake if we turned a blind eye to such fundamental rights as the freedom of expression of opinion and information.

<p class="contents">With the assistance of our delegation in Algiers, we are following events in the country very closely, particularly as regards fundamental freedoms, media and freedom of the press. All these issues must be seen against the background of a political dialogue with Algeria that has been relatively neglected in the past. So far, in the absence of a legal framework, the Commission has had somewhat limited scope for raising these issues with the Algerian authorities. Even under those circumstances, however, in bilateral encounters with Algerian official counterparts or at EuroMed ministerial meetings, the Commission has always urged respect for fundamental values such as democracy, observance of human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the EU-Algeria Association Agreement has recently been ratified by all EU and Algerian partners. It is expected to enter into force on 1 September 2005. The ratification of the Association Agreement has created political momentum for a renewed political dialogue on all sensitive matters, including those related to the enforcement of Article 2 of the Agreement regarding the promotion of democracy and the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The first Association Council should meet by the end of the year, under the UK presidency. On that occasion, the Commission will wish to establish links and contacts with its Algerian counterparts with a view to working on key issues relating to the implementation of the Association Agreement, including human rights and democratisation. Once the key issues and links have been established, we intend to set up technical subcommittees as quickly as possible to implement the most important aspects of the Association Agreement, including human rights and democratisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Once Algeria is ready to enter a new phase in the reinforcement of its bilateral dialogue with its European partners, this preparatory work will be the basis for finalisation of a joint European neighbourhood policy action plan, in which issues such as human rights, democratisation, political and institutional reform will feature prominently.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the Commission will use all the means at its disposal to pursue a constructive dialogue with Algeria on those issues and will continue to encourage the Algerian authorities to abandon their attempt to criminalise defamation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 21 May, the police and paramilitary forces beat up and arrested participants in a peaceful opposition rally in Baku. The official excuse was that permission to hold the rally was denied and this despite an apparent order of 12 May from President Aliyev, instructing government authorities to respect freedom of assembly. Dozens of civilians were arrested in that incident and many journalists were beaten up by the police.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth noting that the purpose of the rally was to voice the need for amendments to Azerbaijan’s election laws, in order to prevent the authorities from falsifying election results, to ask for the creation of an independent public broadcasting authority, and to demand the prosecution of the murderer of the independent journalist Elmar Huseynov, who was shot dead outside his apartment last month.</p>
<p class="contents">In other police operations, scores of known opposition activists, including the heads of youth organisations, were rounded up and mistreated. Parliamentary elections are due in November and it seems that a repeat pattern of violence instigated and carried out by the State is starting again, as it did before the 2003 elections.</p>

They have carried out privatisations and major cuts in the public sector, resulting in a large group of new poor people. This led to anything but European-style parliamentary democracies. The one-party states were replaced by small dictatorial profiteering cliques regarding themselves as answerable to nothing and nobody. In Ukraine and Georgia, popular movements against such authoritarian leaders received support from the West, and rightly so. In Belarus too, where such a revolution has not yet been successful, the opposition, though weak, can count on much external sympathy. This is in contrast to former Soviet Republics, including Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, where America has now gained major military and economic footholds, but where there has, to date, been no such external support for popular uprisings. The regimes’ opponents risk jail or the death penalty, and there is no chance of free elections.

The final decision regarding the location of the rally was taken after negotiations between the Baku mayor and opposition leaders, who have now warned of dire consequences if falsification is used again in the November elections.

<p class="contents">The main reason is the growing dissatisfaction, not to mention downright disillusion, with President Aliyev’s authoritarian regime. Worryingly, this popular discontent is finding an increasingly Islamic expression. Suffice to say that at the moment, 20% of Azerbaijanis favour the introduction of <span class="italic">sharia</span>, the Islamic law, and Azerbaijan does not have a Western outlook either. This significant internal dissatisfaction can be attributed to several causes. For example, the true unemployment rate, despite the oil and construction boom, is very high, being estimated at 20% to 30%. Furthermore, the current presidential government owes its dire popularity ratings to its practice of silencing the opposition in the electronic media, obstructing, where possible, the opposition’s public manifestations, and to a hardly representative voting system characterised by ballot-rigging. The latter is, in fact, a national tradition, which is taking on ever more refined forms these days.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the European Union, as one of Baku’s official partners, do anything at all to help Azerbaijan develop peacefully and democratically? What is called for in any event is clear language from Brussels about how reprehensible its government’s repressive practices are, as is close, European observation of the ballots in the parliamentary elections planned for November. I hope that the Council and Commission will be firm in calling President Aliyev and his political entourage to account about the enormous political risks of repressive policy not merely in a national, but also in a much larger, regional, context. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is no doubt even more difficult for some of the former autonomous republics of the Soviet Empire: the conflicts taking place at the moment in the three countries of the South Caucasus are largely due to the ghastly legacy of Stalin who, in his ‘divide and rule’ strategy, had reattached Ngorno Karabakh to Azerbaijan.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, the deadlock over Ngorno Karabakh is one of the main reasons for the stagnation of the region. As long as it remains unresolved, no prospect of development can be hoped for in that region, which is, however, a natural bridge between the European Union and Asia. Azerbaijan’s difficult economic, social and political situation is a direct outcome of this tense status quo, if only as a result of the large number of refugees and of displaced persons from within the country itself, who are a heavy burden on the country. Whilst there are renewed hopes of an improvement in the overall situation in the country, thanks to the opening of the Baku–Tbilissi–Ceyhan pipeline and the dividends accrued from extracting oil from the Caspian Sea, that in no way excuses the repressive attitude of the authorities towards the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan voluntarily made the decision to turn towards Europe by requesting accession to the Council of Europe. Europe laid down the rules of democracy for guidance. By first of all signing an initial Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in 1999 and by integrating it in its new Neighbourhood Policy, the European Union then indicated its willingness to support Azerbaijan in its democratic process. Today, the Union has a right to expect progress along those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst there is reason to be very pleased about the release of political prisoners and the presidential decree calling for international laws to be enforced with regard to respect for citizens’ democratic rights, the events that took place in Baku in May – the ban on meetings held by opposition parties and the arrest and imprisonment of opposition activists – are not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that we wish above all to support our friends in the South Caucasus, in general, and in Azerbaijan, in particular, we call on President Aliyev and his Government to make every effort to ensure that the forthcoming legislative elections in November 2005 are conducted in a legitimate and transparent manner and that the opposition candidates can freely conduct their campaigns, in complete safety and with fair access to the media. That will be a powerful token of the government’s willingness to make a more in-depth commitment to the road to democracy, to which it had made an official commitment during the meeting with our parliamentary delegation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Azerbaijan, then, we have a relatively demanding programme; it is on the basis of our principles, our values and our rule of law that the Azerbaijani state, too, is to act.</p>
<p class="contents">The country report that the Commission has drawn up, which is intended to result, over the coming months, in plans of action, offers us the opportunity to give a shot in the arm to the process of democratisation and establishing the rule of law. While not using the same language in every instance, we should weigh our words when articulating criticisms and denounce really serious human rights violations for what they are.</p>
<p class="contents">Nothing of what I have just heard from my fellow Members about the increasing number of arrests, about the absence of free elections – as Mr Meijer said – or the introduction of sharia law in Azerbaijan, which really is a tragedy – gets to grips with the reality of what is going on there. We have to bear in mind in which region the country is situated. This week, we have been discussing Uzbekistan, a country where the government had between 400 and 500 civilians shot for going on a demonstration, and here we are talking about what happened on 21 May, when a few demonstrators were arrested and then released after a few hours, and then on 4 June, when the government gave permission for a demonstration by the opposition. That may well be nowhere near our idea of what democracy and the rule of law are like, but I think we have to bear these things in mind in our assessment of these events and in the language we choose when describing them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed the case that we have to observe these elections. They are due to be held in November, and the European institutions must not make the same mistake that they did in Ukraine, where we did not at first take the elections at all seriously and did not follow their progress. Mr Solana, the High Representative, woke up to the situation only when the Ukrainian people took to the streets to demonstrate against the electoral fraud that had been going on.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that we in this House should, over the coming weeks and months, keep an eye on how this process progresses. We should send a delegation of observers and make use of the action plans now coming into force as a means of helping a country that is in a very difficult region, and parts of which are under occupation, yet which is determined to move towards democracy and towards becoming a good European neighbour. In so doing, we will be serving our own European interests, as well as democracy and the rule of law and human rights, better than if we were simply, with words of harsh criticism, to lay into countries with whose circumstances we are insufficiently familiar. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I visited the region last month with Scottish Parliament colleagues, because we are keen to reach out to these countries with our experience of social democratic and civic nationalism. In that region, the events in one country all too often have serious ramifications in another. In that vein, I would commend to you in particular paragraph 10 of the resolution and the reference to the fragile civil society in Azerbaijan, because that is the key to a long-term solution for the region’s problems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not for us to tell Azerbaijan, Georgia or Armenia how to run their affairs, but with the benefit of our experience we can reach out to a region that is looking to the EU for help, inspiration and perhaps even leadership. I hope this resolution will give an added impetus to the Union’s dealings with this troubled region and the positive experience that we can bring to its future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The country’s huge wealth is in stark contrast to the growing poverty among its population. As mentioned by one of the previous speakers, those currently living as refugees still have no home, in contrast to the situation in Armenia, for example. The logical result of this social tension is the undemocratic measures taken by the government that are criticised in the resolution under debate. Of course, the aspect of the political system that has been the target of harsh criticism is the fact that it is possible to arrest large numbers of people for having participated in demonstrations or unrest, without any clear individual charges. That they were released is another matter. Journalists and opposition politicians were present among those arrested, and this is something that must be roundly rejected anywhere in the world. Releasing them, however, does not solve the problem, in particular when the country in question is a member state of the Council of Europe.</p>

This country is the latest in a series of Soviet republics to fight for independence, following Georgia and Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">At least several dozen protesters calling for democratic reforms in the country were arrested during the recent demonstration in Baku. Even prior to this, over 100 people had been sentenced to prison for expressing their political opinions and opposing the government, following the rigged presidential elections of 2003. A great many opposition activists, journalists, teachers and casual bystanders have been caught up in the wave of violence unleashed by the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan is turning out to be a typical example of a country that has undergone superficial transformations. Its much-trumpeted democracy is nothing other than a facade behind which the totalitarian leaders of the Communist party have exchanged their party membership books for cheque books. They have amassed fortunes at the expense of society by manipulating people who have been deprived not only of their rights, but also of their property. As Pope John Paul II once said, the warped idea of freedom as entirely unencumbered liberty and licence still poses a threat to democracy and free societies.</p>
<p class="contents">We are in favour of justice and truth, so we support the opposition’s demands that democratic principles and freedom of speech be respected and that there be no more intimidation or violence. We also support their calls for the punishment of those who murdered Mr Huseynov and Mr Djalilov, those members of the opposition who died in unexplained circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If only it could! The situation in this country is worrying. Not long ago a leader of the democratic opposition died in mysterious circumstances, following the death of another opposition leader earlier this year. At the same time, however, even tragedies of this kind and other forms of persecution, such as the arrest of 29 opposition activists in mid-May, do not alter the course of history and cannot reverse its tide. The 70 000-strong crowd of demonstrators last Saturday in Baku was well aware of this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight for democracy in Azerbaijan is also a fight for stability, of which there is an urgent need in the country. To put it bluntly, Azerbaijan is a major centre of Caspian Sea oil production, particularly since the opening of the USD 4 billion pipeline between Baku, Tbilisi and Ceyhan in Turkey, which will reduce Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil. The pipeline’s target capacity is one million barrels of oil per day.</p>
<p class="contents">Five days ago, following the recent demonstration, the leader of the opposition party Musavat said that Azerbaijan deserved democracy and was out to get it. He was speaking the truth, and the European Parliament should help ensure that this is what happens.</p>

However, the new economic challenges which are arising must be followed by a series of reforms at political and social level. Otherwise, they will lead the country to results which are the opposite of those anticipated, such as even greater unemployment and a wider social gap.</p>
<p class="contents">Azerbaijan must make good use of these developments and move towards democratisation. We urge the Azeri Government in the motion for a resolution to respect democratic values, including the right to a different opinion, and to start an open dialogue with the opposition, in accordance with the undertakings which it has given within the framework of the OSCE and the Council of Europe. A political environment needs to be created which will foster political pluralism, in order to ensure that the elections next November are conducted democratically.</p>

We are following the events in the country very closely, particularly as regards fundamental freedoms, the media and the right of expression and assembly. We are also closely monitoring preparations for the November 2005 parliamentary elections and urging the Azerbaijani authorities to ensure that they are conducted in full compliance with OSCE commitments and other international standards for democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members have asked if we should send a team of observers to the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Azerbaijan. In line with standard practice in the OSCE region, a European Union election observation mission will not be deployed for the elections in Azerbaijan. Instead, support will be given to the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission that is to be deployed. The Commission will also consider whether, in line with recent actions and in connection with the elections in Ukraine, Moldova and Kyrgyzstan, financial support can be provided to the OSCE/ODIHR fund in order to widen participation in election observation missions, to enable more observers from central, eastern, south-eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to participate.</p>
<p class="contents">All these issues and activities must be seen against the background of Azerbaijan’s inclusion in the European Neighbourhood Policy, as decided by the Council in June 2004. At its meetings with the Azerbaijani authorities, the Commission has always stressed that the European Neighbourhood Policy necessarily implies sharing fundamental values such as democracy, respect of human rights and the holding of genuinely democratic elections.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, on 25 April 2005 the General Affairs and External Relations Council decided to offer Azerbaijan the opportunity to develop an ENP Action Plan with the European Union and I hope that will be finalised before the end of this year. Human rights, fundamental freedoms, genuinely democratic elections and democratisation will be amongst the main priorities of this document, which will provide overall guidance for future relations between Azerbaijan and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission is assisting Azerbaijan with its institutional, legal and administrative reforms through the TACIS programme. This whole range of issues is one of the two main priorities chosen for the TACIS National Action Programme 2004-2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the Commission is also providing financial support through its European initiative for democracy and human rights. Five regional projects are currently being funded in the southern Caucasus for a total amount of over EUR 5 million. The Commission will continue to use all the means at its disposal to pursue effective protection of human rights in Azerbaijan and to make sure that the democratisation of the country progresses smoothly in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur has given a detailed account of the basic challenges faced by the new Member States in fighting poverty and social exclusion. It was mostly MEPs from the new Member States who presented arguments highlighting the seriousness of this topic during the debate. Their speeches centred on the theme of poverty, which also involves the social inclusion of children, or in other words has an impact on the prospects of the new generation. By way of example, statistics indicate that in my country, Slovakia, as many as 21% of citizens live below the poverty threshold, mostly in less-developed regions of the country. This report provides a basis for addressing the tremendous challenge faced by the EU in achieving the ambitious Lisbon goals of employment growth, social cohesion and sustainable development. The EU’s progress will depend on its approach to the fundamental rights of the EU citizens who are most at risk, and who mainly live in the 10 new Member States. This approach should be guided by social inclusion and the fight against all forms of discrimination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Both reports contain general recommendations on how the EU Member States should conduct their economic policy. Even though we are able substantially to support quite a few of the proposals, it is not for the EU to lay down such policy. Through institutional competition, countries should of their own accord find suitable solutions as to the way in which economic policy is to be shaped.</p>
<p class="contents">Those countries that introduced transitional rules governing labour mobility in connection with the ten new Member States should be entitled to retain these. It is a good idea, however, to revise the rules because the problems arising from the free migration of labour from the new EU countries have been dramatically exaggerated.</p>

<p>(FR)The European Union is a community of values founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. Like every Council Presidency, the Luxembourg Presidency has endeavoured to respect and promote European Union policy on and the positions that the Union has taken in the field of human rights.</p>
<p>The Council has also reaffirmed on many occasions that it attaches priority to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p>To that end, five years after Tampere, the European Council has adopted a new multiannual programme for the Union, to be known as the Hague Programme, the objectives of which include the improvement of the common capability of the Union and its Member States to attain the Union's objectives in that area.</p>
<p>On 3 June 2005, the Council adopted a Council and Commission Action Plan which includes the specific measures that will be referred to the European legislative body with a view to the implementation of the Hague Programme.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the European Union, meeting in Council in December 2003, advocated the conversion of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia into the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency to which the honourable Member refers.</p>
<p>The Commission has said that it will draft a proposal for a regulation on this issue. The Council will give full and in-depth consideration to such a proposal.</p>
<p>Finally, the attention of the honourable Member is drawn to the fact that, on 27 April 2005, the Committee of Permanent Representatives (Part 2) approved the establishment of an ad hoc working party with a remit to consider the proposal for a decision establishing, for the period 2007-2013, a specific programme on fundamental rights and citizenship (as part of the general fundamental rights and justice programme), which the Commission submitted to it on 26 April 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0391"></a>

<p>(EN)The Council is aware that an alarming number of people is still subject to forced labour, a phenomenon that indeed should have no place in this world.</p>
<p>In order to raise awareness and combat this and related phenomena, the EU regularly raises these issues in its relations with third countries, both at a bilateral and at a multilateral level, as well as with international governmental and non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p>For instance, as part of its efforts to promote effective multilateralism in the world, the EU puts a lot of effort in promoting ratification and implementation of the key international human rights instruments, many of which include provisions on labour standards and the protection of children.</p>
<p>These efforts include actions undertaken in the field of trade and development (for instance, the Generalised System of Trade Preferences (GSP), the international commodity agreements where the EC and its Member States are parties and most Partnership Agreements with third countries include human rights clauses) and justice and home affairs (combating crime and trafficking in human beings).</p>
<p>As an example, the preferences provided for by the GSP may at any time be temporarily withdrawn, in whole or in part, in cases of practice of any form of slavery or forced labour as defined in the Geneva Conventions of 25 September 1926 and 7 September 1956 and International Labour Organisation Conventions No 29 and No 105. In application of this provision, the benefit of the tariff preferences applicable to Myanmar has been withdrawn since 1997, following a report by the Commission on forced labour in that country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0393"></a>

<p>(FR)As has already been pointed out in answers to similar questions, it is important to draw attention to the importance which the Union, and more particularly the Council, has always attached to the issue of child protection in Romania.</p>
<p>In its 2004 report on the progress made by Romania on the road to accession, the Commission noted that regular progress had been observed as regards the reorganisation of child protection, in particular through the closure of the large, old-fashioned institutions and the establishment of alternative facilities. The Union, for its part, has provided financial support for the efforts made by Romania in improving the quality of state-run child welfare facilities.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the new legislation on children's rights and adoption, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, complies for the most part with the standards set by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the practice followed by EU Member States.</p>
<p>Although there is still some progress to be made in developing administrative capacities with a view to the proper and effective implementation of these new provisions, all the evidence shows that conditions have on the whole significantly improved and that the Romanian authorities have undertaken to continue their efforts to fully implement the reform of the child protection system.</p>
<p>The Council can assure the honourable Member that the Union will continue to closely monitor Romania's efforts and the outcome thereof.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0395"></a>

<p>(FR)The Council is well aware of the alarming situation facing millions of children in developing countries, and in Africa in particular, owing to their vulnerability vis-à-vis famine, violence, conflicts and disease. The Council would point out that children are directly or indirectly mentioned in the 8 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) whose implementation will be the subject of an initial report on the occasion of the United Nations Summit in September 2005.</p>
<p>The Council believes that it will not be possible to achieve these goals by 2015 unless a coherent policy is adopted with regard to children in the developing world.</p>
<p>Specific attention needs to be given to children in the implementation of the European Union's development policy. The Council has taken a series of recent initiatives to this end:</p>
<p>1.	The Council and the representatives of the Member States meeting within the Council approved, in their conclusions of 24 May 2005, a set of measures aimed at speeding up the progress towards implementation of the MDG.</p>
<p>The Council welcomed the fact that the Member States are well on the way to achieving the 0.39% of official development assistance objective contained in the Barcelona commitments by 2006.</p>
<p>The Council also took a crucial decision regarding a collective and individual increase in the volume of official development assistance by 2010, as a further step towards collectively contributing 0.7% of Community gross domestic income by 2015.</p>
<p>To this end, the Council decided that the European Union would collectively contribute 0.56% of its gross domestic income to official development assistance by 2010. In concrete terms, this is equivalent to a EUR 20 billion increase, which the EU will effect each year from 2010 in order to support the world's poorest countries. In making this collective commitment, the agreement has taken account of the specific situation of those Member States which joined the Union in May 2004.</p>
<p>In addition, the Council decided that the Member States would undertake to reach the 0.7% figure by 2015 and those which have already reached this figure have undertaken to remain above this rate. Those Member States which joined the EU after 2002 will endeavour to reach 0.33% by 2015. This is the first time that a clear timeframe has been set for achieving the 0.7% collective threshold.</p>
<p>2.	At the same meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, the Council expressed its firm support for the European Action Programme to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculoses through external actions, submitted by the Commission at the end of April 2005. This programme provides for special attention to be devoted to children's rights and the needs of orphans and vulnerable children, as well as safety at school, especially for girls. A joint action by the EC and the Member States, in cooperation with the main international organisations in this area (UNICEF and UNFPA), together with teachers and parents' associations in the partner countries, is also planned.</p>
<p>3.	The process of revising the joint declaration of November 2000 on the European Union's development policy is in progress. A Commission communication on future EU development policy is expected for the end of June. Many subjects were identified during the extended consultation process as possible thematic priorities, including child protection in particular.</p>
<p>Child protection is a vital aspect of EU development policy and the Council intends to ensure that this priority is adequately reflected both in the context of preparations for the September 2005 summit in New York on the implementation of the MDG and in the process of formulating future EC development policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0397"></a>

<p>(FR)The Council is aware of the work in progress at the World Bank to prepare a Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF). A recent meeting of the International Task Force on management of commodity risks, held in Interlaken, Switzerland, in May 2005, considered this proposal from the World Bank, on which we are expecting a concept report. According to the information available, index-based (for example, rainfall index) insurance for weather-related risks will be covered by the Facility proposed by the Bank. This Facility will be aimed at linking the demand in developing countries for insurance against risks relating inter alia to natural disasters with the world insurance market.</p>
<p>In the proposals concerning the use of the conditional billion from the 9th European Development Fund (EDF), the Commission proposed that the Council set aside an indicative amount of up to EUR 25 million to help finance the management of commodity risks.</p>
<p>This initiative followed on from the Council's approval (Doc. 8972/04) in April 2004 of an EU action plan proposed by the Commission (Doc. 6454/05) on commodities, which includes a proposal to improve producer access to commodity risk insurance and trade finance.</p>
<p>This funding could contribute to the establishment of the Facility proposed by the World Bank and the participation of other donors to supplement the amount put forward by the Bank, which is EUR 100 million. Its aim would be to help ACP countries to gain access to available market instruments for the management of commodity risks through temporary co-funding of their premiums. This would help to reduce the vulnerability of beneficiary ACP countries to fluctuations in commodity prices and natural disasters and to set up and eventually adopt instruments to manage commodity risks. A joint EU-ACP committee on agricultural commodities would supervise arrangements for the establishment and implementation of the programme.</p>
<p>As with all decisions regarding the use of EDF resources, such a contribution will require a decision from the ACP-EC Council, whose next session is to be held in Luxembourg on 24 and 25 June 2005. The EU Council is continuing its work to reach a position on all the Commission's proposals regarding the conditional billion with a view to this joint ministerial meeting. The ACP side is also due to establish its position at a ministerial meeting due to take place in mid-June.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0401"></a>

The Court held that Öcalan had not had a fair and impartial trial in Turkey, ruling that various articles of the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated and suggesting that Turkey hold a new trial.

It is not for the Council to express an opinion on the substance of this ruling. Obviously, Turkey is, however, expected to respect the Court’s ruling and to comply with it. The Constitutional Review of May 2004 established the principle of the primacy of international and European conventions in the field of human rights and therefore confirmed the capacity of the Turkish judicial system to give direct effect to the rulings of the ECHR. The need fully and quickly to implement the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights was, moreover, recently pointed out again by the EU in the position it adopted for the EU-Turkey Association Council of 26 April 2005.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a candidate country for accession to the EU, Turkey is also expected generally to pursue the reform process and to implement it effectively in all its aspects, particularly with regard to fundamental freedoms and full respect for human rights. The European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004 clearly indicated that the full and effective implementation of the reform process will continue to be monitored closely by the European Union. </p>

<p>(FR)The Resolution to which the honourable Member refers, which formed part of the 2002-2004 work plan on culture, was intended to enhance synergies with areas and activities other than cultural ones, as laid down, moreover, by the Treaty.

<p>(EN)On 10 February 2005 the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) stated officially that it possessed nuclear weapons and it suspended its participation in the “Six-Party” multilateral negotiations for an indefinite period of time. Subsequently, it also announced that it did not feel bound by the 1999 moratorium on ballistic missile testing. The Presidency clearly stated the EU position in a declaration, as well as in a letter subsequently sent (jointly with the HR and the EC External relations Commissioner) to the DPRK Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>The EU stated its strong disappointment and concern at these announcements and urged the DPRK to refrain from any additional decision which would further undermine confidence. It also reasserted its strong support to the process of the Six-Party talks as the best means to resolve the nuclear issue. It welcomed and supported the recent calls by the international community for a rapid and unconditional resumption of the talks and encouraged the DPRK to take advantage of this opportunity and to return to talks as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The EU also renewed its appeal to the DPRK to comply with the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It reminded the DPRK that respect of international obligations, both on nuclear and human rights issues, is an indispensable condition for the EU to develop its bilateral relations with DPRK.</p>
<p>The EU continues to exercise pressure for an early resumption of the talks, including in the bilateral contacts with the DPRK. In the meantime the Presidency also keeps in close contact with the parties of the Six-Party talks, in particular the United States, Japan and China.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0413"></a>

<p>(FR)It is important to emphasise that establishing an area of freedom, justice and security requires information on convictions and disqualifications to be properly shared among the Member States’ judicial authorities.</p>
<p>The obligation to provide information on convictions already exists on the basis of Articles 13 and 22 of the 1959 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, supplemented by Article 4 of the Additional Protocol to this Convention, dated 17 March 1978.</p>
<p>It is also laid down in the draft Council Decision on the Exchange of information extracted from the criminal record, which is in the process of being adopted.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that, in adopting the Hague Programme, the European Council of 4-5 November 2004 prioritised the issue of the exchange of information on convictions between Member States and called on the Commission to draw up fresh proposals.</p>
<p>Consequently, on 25 January 2005, the Commission tabled the ‘White Paper on exchanges of information on convictions and the effect of such convictions in the European Union’. On the basis of that document, meetings were held to look into the feasibility of setting up an effective and complete system of exchange of information between national criminal records. Whilst the results of the feasibility studies demonstrated that setting up the exchange system is a complex process and that it places extra burdens on the national authorities in the Member States, such a system is an indispensable means of guaranteeing security, justice and effective cooperation between the national judicial authorities in the European Union.</p>
<p>The exchange of information and the interconnection between national criminal records were the subject of the deliberations of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in April. Following the orientation debate, there was broad agreement in the Council on the need to base exchanges of information on bilateral communication between criminal records.</p>
<p>As regards Community nationals, exchanges of information on convictions should be conducted via the Member State of which the convicted person is a national. A ‘European index’ will, moreover, be set up to identify the Member State of conviction in the case of third country nationals.</p>
<p>The new legislative proposal concerning the creation of a complete system of exchange of information between national criminal records, taking account of the above-mentioned conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, will be presented by the Commission at the end of the quarter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0419"></a>

<p>Since the Commission endorses this line, thereby seriously contradicting the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 12 May 2005 on the end of the Second World War which emphasises that 'there cannot be reconciliation without truth and remembrance', what is the Council’s view of truth in the light of our European past?

<p>(FR)As the honourable Member correctly points out, at the end of May the Commission tabled a proposal for a regulation on a multiannual funding for the action of the European Maritime Safety Agency in the field of response to pollution caused by ships. This proposal is to be analysed jointly by Parliament and the Council within the framework of the codecision procedure, and forms part of the thrust of the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013. The instrument that is finally adopted will therefore reflect the outcome of proceedings on the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p>The Council has yet to analyse this brand new proposal and cannot therefore yet issue an opinion on the adequacy of the financial resources proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Council is already in a position to indicate that it welcomes in principle measures for ensuring efficient mobilisation of the necessary anti-pollution equipment (including clean-up vessels) to assist a Member State faced with a pollution problem.</p>
<p>Since as early as November 2001, the Council has also been calling on the Commission to carry out a study into the technical feasibility of enhancing the detection of illegal discharges of polluting substances at sea, inter alia by developing satellite technology aimed at implementing an oil-spill monitoring system which, in tandem with the new Automatic Identification System, could become a highly effective instrument for detecting oil spills and identifying their sources.</p>

<p>(FR)The eradication and prevention of torture is one of the human rights priorities of the European Union as is evidenced by the EU Guidelines on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which were adopted by the Council in 2001. In that context, numerous measures have been taken to this end, including the following:</p>
<p>In line with the Guidelines the EU has raised in the past, and will continue to raise the issue of torture and ill-treatment with third countries, including the US, during political dialogue meetings at bilateral as well as at multilateral level.</p>
<p>In its external relations, the EU systematically recalls that states should abide by their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law when countering terrorism.</p>
<p>EU Heads of Mission have drawn up reports on the occurrence of torture and carry out demarches with regard to individual cases of concern and general policies and practices in many countries in the world.</p>
<p>The EU also asks countries to cooperate with the UN Special Procedures, including extending an invitation to the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and to follow up on his recommendations.</p>

<p>(FR)Action taken by the Council and its General Secretariat in the area of transparency and public relations is governed by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents and by the decision of the Council General Secretariat of 25 June 2001, establishing a code of good administrative behaviour for the General Secretariat and its staff in their professional relations with the public.</p>
<p>Under Regulation 1049/2001, the Council made 11 067 documents public in 2004 following 2 160 access requests, out of a total number of 12 907 requested documents.</p>
<p>As regards information disclosed to the public under the code of good administrative behaviour, the Council’s ‘information to the public’ service dealt with a total of 9 227 requests for information in 2004, of which 8 529 were received by e-mail and 698 by letter.</p>
<p>Consequently, pressure groups and lobbying groups can, should they wish to do so, follow the Council’s decision-making process using this provision, along with other measures aimed at Council transparency, such as:</p>
<p>debates and proceedings open to the public</p>
<p>direct contact with officials under the code of good administrative behaviour governing relations between Council officials and the citizens</p>
<p>briefings arranged by the press office on the day after Council meetings</p>
<p>the chance for representatives of professional organisations to attend press conferences during ministerial meetings in the Council, subject to the availability of seats in the press room.</p>
<p>Given that, on the one hand, transparency is an integral part of Council proceedings and that, on the other hand, the decision-making process should be carried out effectively, the Council, as an institution, is not planning to introduce its own accreditation system for pressure groups and non-governmental organisations along the lines of the system that Parliament has in place or of the one that the Commission might put in place.</p>
<p>In this regard, it should be emphasised that the positions held by the delegations represented in the Council and its preparatory bodies are established in the capital cities, on the basis of the practices and the national regulations of the Member States.</p>
<p>Let us not forget, moreover, that when it acts as a legislator in areas relating to the first pillar, the Council is only called upon to give rulings on the proposal of the Commission. It would thus appear appropriate that talks with the interested parties should be conducted by the Commission in accordance with its own rules.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Council will study with the utmost interest any measures proposed to it by the Commission, aimed at improving transparency and, where applicable, dialogue with pressure groups.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0444"></a>

<p>(FR)As the honourable Member is aware, the European Council stated clearly in Helsinki in 1999 that candidate countries must share the European Union’s values and objectives as set out in the Treaties. In this respect, the European Council stressed the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the United Nations Charter and urged candidate countries to make every effort to resolve any border disputes and other related issues.</p>
<p>The European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004 reiterated the need for unequivocal commitment to good neighbourly relations, whilst welcoming improvements in relations between Turkey and its neighbours. It also took stock of the situation regarding ongoing disputes and welcomed the exploratory contacts that have taken place to this end. Against this backdrop, it stated its opinion that unresolved disputes affecting the accession process should, where necessary, be brought before the International Court of Justice to be settled. The European Council stressed that it would be kept informed of progress, which it would analyse as appropriate.</p>
<p>In line with the conclusions of the above-mentioned European Council, and in the same spirit, the Council has consistently monitored the progress of relations between Turkey and its neighbours, especially those it maintains with a Member State, namely Greece. This issue has been, and will be, the subject of debate in the political dialogue meetings that are held regularly between the EU and Turkey and in the bodies set up as part of the Association Agreement. This was the case recently in the EC-Turkey Association Council of 26 April, during which the Presidency, on the Union’s behalf, urged Turkey to defuse any source of friction with its neighbours and to hold back from any action liable to have a detrimental effect on the process of settling border disputes peacefully.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0388"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission considers that there is a vital need to protect the integrity of sport. At all levels, appropriate measures must be taken with a view to promote fairness and anti-racism in the run up of such an important sport event as the Football World Cup. All actors are called upon to contribute to this work within the framework of their particular roles and competences.</p>
<p>Within its competences, the Commission has been active in promoting the positive values of sport. Along this line, the year 2004 has been designated as the “European Year of Education through sport” (EYES 2004). Learning from each other, promoting educational values of sport, using sport in general and football in particular to fight racism and discrimination were the key messages spread during the EYES 2004.</p>
<p>Other initiatives have been taken in this field, supported by the Directorate General of Education and Culture, like the project: "FOOTBALL AGAINST RACISM IN EUROPE - Using football as tool for intercultural dialogue and to promote European integration" that started on 1 September and will end on 30 June 2005.</p>
<p>In addition, the European Monitoring Centre On Racism and Xenophobia is continuing its work on football and racism, particularly by joining other actors such as the FARE network and the Committee of the Regions to raise awareness about the broader dimension of football in the community and encourage greater involvement of local authorities in following up the Braga Declaration. Cooperation with both actors includes undertaking public awareness raising activities in 2006 in the context of the FIFA World Cup in Germany.</p>
<p>Concerning the second question, even if there are no specific activities planned in the youth field at European level to accompany the World Cup – which does not exclude national initiatives by the hosting country or other countries - there are a number of other activities ongoing on the fight against racism and xenophobia in the youth field.</p>
<p>The fight against racism and xenophobia is a priority of the Commission’s White Paper “A New Impetus for European Youth”. In this context, the Commission has supported:</p>
<p>the creation of an Internet platform promoted by and for young people ;</p>
<p>a conference on youth and the promotion of diversity and mutual respect ;</p>
<p>cooperation with other services and institutions on initiatives such as the EU’s awareness-raising campaign “For Diversity-Against Discrimination” and the Council of Europe’s “All Equal-All Different” campaign.</p>
<p>It also is a priority in the calls for projects in the framework of the Youth Programme. In the framework of the Youth Programme projects of young people against racism and xenophobia are supported. Some of these projects relate to sports activities and promote diversity and mutual respect in sports.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0394"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission shares the view that regular and active sport practice is essential to the physical and psychological well-being of Europe’s youth.</p>
<p>The importance of sport, and indeed any kind of physical activity, for keeping fit is well-known and well-documented. In today’s industrialised world the rampant obesity crisis has added a new dimension to this. A Commission-sponsored study conducted by a consortium led by the Universities of Paderborn and Duisburg-Essen, which was published on 3 January 2005, indicated that physical activity is urgently needed to avoid obesity, and that obesity presents an alarming health hazard to our children and young people, including typical old-people’s diseases like type 2 diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases.</p>
<p>Likewise, there is an increasing focus on the importance of sport and other kinds of physical activity for the psychological well-being of the individual. The Commission study referred to above concluded that fit children are happier and more balanced. Additionally, research results point to a correlation between possibilities offered for exercising physical activity and sport in school settings, on the one hand, and the level of academic results on the other.</p>
<p>The Commission recently launched a special initiative which aims to create links between all types of actions necessary to combat obesity, “Diet, Physical Activity and Health – a European Platform for Action” which may be of interest in this context.</p>
<p>In 2004, in the framework of the European Year of Education through Sport (EYES), funding was available which could apply to projects related to the issues discussed here. Unfortunately, there are presently no specific sport-dedicated funding possibilities due to the lack of legal basis in the current Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0411"></a>

<p>(EN)The study conducted under the Portuguese Presidency in 2000 focused on the conditions for the creation of a complementary funding scheme to be adopted at national or European level with a view to covering the additional costs of student mobility. It concluded that a loan scheme might be established to support the real additional costs of studying abroad with repayments related to the graduate’s future income. It suggested that the scheme could be financed by the European Investment Bank and administered by a “European Student Mobility Support Agency” established for the purpose. The study concluded that the scheme could be established either at European level or, in view of subsidiarity and proportionality, in interested Member States separately.</p>
<p>The Commission examined the recommendations of the study with the representatives of the Member States in the Socrates Higher Education Sub Committee in March 2001. While the interest of the idea was acknowledged in principle, concerns were expressed about subsidiarity, the feasibility and coverage of the proposed scheme, and the future of student mobility grants.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal for a new Integrated Lifelong Learning Programme, adopted in July 2004, proposed a significant increase in the volume and level of Erasmus student mobility grants (a tripling of the annual volume, and an increase in the average value of the grant from EUR 150 per month currently to EUR 250 by 2013). It did not consider it appropriate to propose at the same time the establishment of a Europe-wide student loan scheme for mobility. This does not of course preclude the establishment of such schemes in individual Member States.</p>
<p>The European Investment Bank has supported two pilot projects within Member States on student loans:</p>
<p>A Higher Education Student Loan Facility for students in three polytechnics (Bari, Milan and Turin) launched in December 2003.</p>
<p>A loan of € 100 million to the Hungarian Student Loan Centre (Diákhitel Központ Rt.), awarded in May 2005, for students studying in Hungarian universities.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that these projects are not, however, comparable with the scheme outlined in the 2000 study. They target the needs of students studying in their home country rather than the additional costs of study abroad.</p>
<p>For the time being the Commission has no plans to establish a Europe-wide system of complementary student loans for student mobility.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0415"></a>

<p>(EN)The questions raised by the honourable Member refer to the future implementation of the Commission’s proposal for a Recommendation of the Council and of the Parliament on further European cooperation in quality assurance in higher education. This proposal was adopted by the Commission in October 2004<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and is currently being examined by the Parliament and the Council. Most of the issues raised by the honourable Member will depend on the discussions taking place within the legislative process. However it has to be underlined that the ENQA (European Network on Quality Assurance) approach does not lead to legally binding rules. The ENQA standards and procedures have been conceived in a context of intergovernmental cooperation based on confidence. They can be considered as political commitments.</p>
<p>Furthermore it should be stressed that the European Ministers of Higher Education met in Bergen on 19-20 May 2005 for a mid-term review towards achieving the European Higher Education Area (Bologna process – intergovernmental cooperation). They have adopted the standards and guidelines for quality assurance proposed by ENQA. They also committed themselves to introducing the proposed model for peer review of quality agencies on national basis. They welcomed the principle of a European register of quality assurance agencies based on national reviews and they asked for a further report on the practicalities of implementation.</p>
<p>The aims of the Bologna process are very close to those that the Commission has for the Higher Education field and the above mentioned Proposal for Recommendation will build on the achievements of the Bologna process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The search for knowledge has always been at the heart of the European adventure. Knowledge, in the broadest sense, has helped to define our identity and our values, and it is the driving force behind our future competitiveness.</p>
<p>In Europe, we need to overcome existing geographical and intellectual fragmentation, we need to become much better at producing knowledge through research, at diffusing knowledge through education and at using and applying knowledge through innovation.</p>
<p>This requires the knowledge triangle of research, education and innovation to function within favourable framework conditions, which reward the knowledge that is put to work.</p>
<p>The Commission is already working hard to develop such framework conditions for knowledge and innovation, for example through its proposal for the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research, technological development and demonstration activities.</p>
<p>But there are also other initiatives aimed to reinforce Commission’s commitment to knowledge as a key to growth, particularly within the context of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p>Within this context; the Commission has recently suggested to establish a European Institute of Technology which would act as a pole of attraction for the best students, researchers and professors from Europe and from around the world.</p>
<p>The Commission has also transmitted a preliminary note of reflection on this to the Member States.</p>
<p>It stated that attempting to create a new institution in Europe would not be the right solution and that such an Institute should be based on a network approach which would itself have to be connected to further, subsidiary, networks in order to ensure that the scientific excellence and knowledge it creates would benefit the whole union.</p>
<p>We should not forget that Europe has a certain number of world class research centres, universities with good quality and leading industries in the field of technology. However, what does not seem to work in Europe is the knowledge transfer between them feeding into economic capacities.</p>
<p>This potential must be mobilised and shared and this is where the European Institute of Technology could add value: an entity that combines the essence of the knowledge triangle with a clearly world-class reputation and with a European identity.</p>
<p>The challenges for creating such an Institute are manifold. In order to explore with the Member States and public and private stakeholders on how best to take this idea forward and on how to define the role, nature, organisation and governance of such an Institute the Commission will launch in September this year a public consultation process.</p>
<p>Consequently, the outcomes of this consultation will be duly taken into account by the Commission when preparing its proposal for such an Institute.</p>
<p>That is the reason why the Commission is not yet able to take any position on the nature or location for such an Institute but it would like to invite the Parliament to actively take part in the consultation process and to share its ideas about this with it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0443"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission indeed considers research and development a top priority for the EU. This is reflected in its proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme and its request to double the budget for Community research. In the Seventh Framework Programme, the European Research Council (ERC) is the new major feature. It will be created under the “Ideas” programme and will fund investigator-driven, frontier research, selected on the basis of scientific excellence and competition between individual research teams at European level. This was the wish of the scientific community in Europe, as reflected also in the Kok report.</p>
<p>According to the Commission’s proposals, the ERC will consist of a scientific council and a dedicated implementation structure. The scientific council will be a group of eminent scientists, which will, inter alia, oversee decisions on the type of research to be funded and act as guarantor of the quality of the activity from the scientific perspective. Its task will cover, in particular the development of the annual work programme, the establishment of the peer review process, as well as the monitoring and quality control of the programme’s implementation from the scientific perspective. The dedicated implementation structure, in the form of an Executive Agency, will be responsible for all aspects of implementation and programme execution, as provided for in the annual work programme.</p>
<p>The timetable for the approval of the ERC will follow the timetable for the approval of the Framework and Specific Programmes. The provisional timetable foresees an adoption of all the legal texts by September 2006. Meanwhile, the Commission has already taken the necessary steps to prepare the ERC structures:</p>
<p>It has designated an “identification committee”, chaired by Lord Patten and charged with identifying potential members of the scientific council. The committee is expected to conclude its work by the end of June 2005. The Commission intends to appoint the scientific council, once the process for the identification of its members is completed. This will allow the timely implementation of the “Ideas” specific programme and will give the opportunity to the scientific council to establish its modus operandi.</p>
<p>In order to be able to make an informed decision, and also comply with the relevant legislation, it has also launched a cost-benefit analysis for the establishment of an Executive Agency. The final report of this analysis is expected in July 2005.</p>

<p>(EN)There is no doubt that the Research Framework Programme (FP) has allowed important investments in “neglected diseases” in the past decade through its international scientific cooperation activities.</p>
<p>The Commission published a call for projects for 2004 and another for September 2005 to support new research on how to prevent diseases which mostly affect people so poor that they will never represent a sizeable market for the pharmaceutical industry. The Commission is convinced that the number of projects it is funding or hopes to fund this year represents a substantial investment towards broader international efforts in this area. The Commission would also like to stress the fact that we are not only supporting high quality research but also high-quality partnerships over long periods of time, thus contributing to the countries’ capacities to design and implement new strategies for prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member knows, our proposals for “collaborative research” in FP7 have a high international dimension. The Specific Programmes are under preparation and each theme should have a component of international cooperation. Third countries can participate in the European programmes and in the specific international cooperation activities which are actions of mutual interest and which reply to the needs of third countries, including developing countries. The Commission is confident that the field of health research will encompass specific international cooperation actions and priority areas will be adapted to local needs. It is also convinced that we will be able to implement these research activities by keeping up our tradition of partnership building.</p>
<p>It has been shown on a number of occasions that the research on drugs that we fund is excessively oriented towards discovery and not towards difficult product development steps. The honourable Member knows about our efforts to create structures allowing for better and faster clinical development in Africa via the EDCTP (European and Developing Countries Clinical Trial Partnership) and the Commission is aware of the problems we will have to expand these efforts towards other diseases.</p>
<p>Directorate General for Research and technological Development has been working in collaboration with other Directorates General on an alternative incentive to research grants to support more and better partnerships with industry, where most of the drug development capacities are located. The Commission will continue to explore a series of models and scenarios but we need to see a clearer position of these incentives from industry itself.</p>
<p>The recently adopted European Programme for Action to Confront HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis through External Action (2007-2011) foresees that the EU undertakes studies to establish a priority list of “pull incentives”. The objective is to engage private industry in the research and development of new tools and interventions, based on a cost-benefit analysis and on their feasibility. The studies should, in particular, analyse advanced markets mechanisms, cash premiums, an international financing facility for vaccines, and transferable privileges – such as Intellectual Property Rights extensions or fast-track approvals. The EC will also support a selected number of public-private partnerships and global initiatives. The aim will be to establish the coordination and synergy that are necessary and the appropriate level of resources required to accelerate R&amp;D efforts, to estimate the health, social and economic benefits that could be derived from the development and use of new diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic technologies, and new tools. The EU will enhance cooperation within Europe to ensure the viability and progress of innovative research initiatives towards the development of priority products.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0426"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission has been addressing the issue of improving the participation of women in European research since 1999.</p>
<p>In its recent proposal for the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Research Framework Programme, the Commission gave a strong signal of its intent to continue the efforts concerning the participation of women in research and to give more weight to gender research. It is clearly said that due regard will be paid to the role of women in science and research with a view to further enhancing their active role in research.</p>
<p>A major problem identified over the years is the discrepancy between an increasing number of female students and very slow progress for women in decision making positions in research.</p>
<p>In Europe, female students are still significantly underrepresented in engineering studies (less than 25%). Women are generally better represented in natural sciences, though some disciplines such as physics remain largely unpopular with women.</p>
<p>Thus the “Education and Training 2010 Work Programme”, agreed by all Member States, sets as one of its key objectives increasing the number of young people choosing careers in the fields of mathematics, science and technology, and in particular reducing the actual gender imbalance in these sectors.</p>
<p>As a result of this Work Programme, the Education Council adopted in May 2003 a European benchmark: the total number of graduates in mathematics, science and technology in the European Union should increase by at least 15% by 2010 while at the same time the level of gender imbalance should decrease. The first part of the target will be achieved well ahead the deadline, probably within 2005. In spite of an overall improvement throughout the European Union, the gender balance remains an issue for most Member States.</p>
<p>Women all too rarely occupy posts of full professors in Europe. They represent only 14% of all professors and even in the most “feminised” scientific fields they remain in the minority.</p>
<p>At the Competitiveness Council of 18 April the Ministers adopted a European target of 25% of women in leading positions in research in the public sector- e.g. full professors. The Commission fully supports this target.</p>
<p>Also important is the regular collection of recruitment data and reporting in Europe to closely monitor progress. The Commission welcomes the Council conclusions in this respect.</p>
<p>In March, the Commission adopted a Staff Working Document entitled “Women and Science: Excellence and Innovation - Gender Equality in Science”. This document lists the main ongoing and foreseen Commission activities to improve the participation of women in science and technology.</p>
<p>It is clear that Europe should eliminate the remaining discrimination against women in research and needs especially to work on the disadvantages linked to maternity or care duties. Provisions for maternity leave should be included in research funding schemes, both nationally and at the European level. The European Charter for Researchers and Code of conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers could give guidance to Member States in this respect.</p>
<p>Europe has also to pursue the debate on gender bias and scientific excellence. Findings from a recent study indicate that existing methods of defining and evaluating scientific excellence, both in basic and applied research, are not as gender neutral as are claimed. More attention will be paid to ensure that research bodies, funding institutions and the scientific community at large think in a more general and systematic way about promoting a research environment free of gender bias.</p>
<p>There is also a need to improve the understanding of new challenges raised by EU enlargement and the changing roles and life plans of women and men in Europe, and their impact on the creation of the European Research Area, through more gender research.</p>
<p>Eventually, more attention has to be paid to women in industrial research. The Commission is defining specific activities for the coming years aimed at increasing their total number (currently 18% of the workforce in private research).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0427"></a>

<p>(EN)Knowledge is indeed at the core of the Lisbon Agenda and underpins all its elements. Research and technology are, together with education and innovation, the components of the “Triangle of knowledge”. Alongside Member States and in close cooperation with them, the EU must mobilise its legal and financial tools towards the goal of becoming the “most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world”, starting with the research Framework Programme.</p>
<p>Amongst others in its Communication “Science and technology, the key to Europe's future” (June 2004), the Commission has underlined the principle that, in order to achieve the Lisbon Agenda, Europe needs to realise the full research potential of the enlarged Union.</p>
<p>The integration of new Member States into the European Research Area is and will be facilitated through a variety of policies and instruments. Beyond the measures that were in place at the pre-accession stage, the new Member States now not only have full access to the RTD Framework Programme, but also - in a complementary way- to the Union’s Structural Funds.</p>
<p>Past and existing dedicated Community measures in research have already successfully explored ways of mobilising the research potential in the economically less developed regions. Examples of proven and successful measures are:</p>
<p>In Framework Programme (FP) 5: European Centres of Excellence in Acceding and Candidate Countries, to help to restructure the science and technology sectors in these countries and to support their economic and social development;</p>
<p>In the current FP6: “Marie Curie Host Fellowships for Transfer of Knowledge-Development scheme”, directed at the reinforcement of the research potential of research entities in need of new knowledge and competences, with a dedicated objective of 70% of the means for the scheme to be directed at research organisations in the Less Favoured Regions;</p>
<p>In the current FP6: Return (since FP4) and Reintegration Mechanisms, supporting the reintegration of researchers after a period of mobility, in particular in Less Favoured Regions and Associated Candidate Countries;</p>
<p>In its legislative proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme, adopted on 6 April 2005, the Commission has proposed to step up the Community research effort considerably in the period 2007-2013, doubling the expenditure from € 5 billion to € 10 billion a year on average. In order to strengthen excellence and raise the average level of research in Europe, the basic principle is to stimulate, organise and exploit all forms of cooperation in research, from collaboration in joint projects and networks to the coordination of national research programmes, competition at European level as well as the joint implementation of large technology initiatives and the common development of infrastructures of European dimension and interest. It is clear that research entities throughout the EU-25 and more, will be able to engage in and benefit from the full spectrum of these proposed Community actions.</p>
<p>As part of the FP7 proposal a dedicated budget, named “Research Potential” to the amount of € 554 million, is envisaged to help to unlock and develop the research potential in the EU’s convergence regions, and assist in strengthening the capacities of their researchers to successfully participate in research activities at European level. By focussing on the reinforcement and expansion of the collaboration of such research groups with other EU research centres, an important contribution will be given to unlocking their potential and with that to their long term sustained development. Through optimising their international exposure and recognition, leadership potential and high quality of their scientists, the visibility of these research groups will be increased and their participation in and crucial contribution to the European Research Area facilitated.</p>
<p>Like for all current and future Community research actions, the basic selection criterium in the RTD FP’s is excellence and high potential. This is what distinguishes measures in the Community research policy framework from other measures, which are key to developing education, research and innovation capacities in new Member States, based on other Community policies, like the Structural Funds. These Funds are really geared to development and cohesion. The new Member States are already using the current intermediate period of the Structural Funds (2004-2006) to reinforce their position in the European Research Area, by integrating a high proportion of their national or regional R&amp;D and innovation efforts in the Structural Funds Operational Programmes. This possibility will be enhanced in the new Programming period 2007-2013, since the Funds have made support to the Lisbon Strategy a centre-piece of their approach, especially in the convergence regions (ex Objective 1). The draft Regulations of the Funds, adopted by the Commission in July 2004 have indeed placed support to R&amp;D, innovation and knowledge economy at the heart of their priorities in all 3 new Objectives (convergence, regional competitiveness and territorial cooperation).</p>
<p>Special efforts are and will be made by the Commission’s services to achieve synergies between the RTD FP and the Structural Funds, for example for the creation of new infrastructures. For this to happen, Member States’ research communities and those planning authorities responsible for the Structural Funds must take the necessary steps to coordinate their input on R&amp;D in the future Structural Funds Operational Programmes. For its part, the Commission will take all the necessary steps to make this planning as efficient as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0429"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission is fully aware of the impact that rheumatic diseases have on the European population, the healthcare systems and economic competitiveness, and agrees that multidisciplinary research into these diseases needs to come up with more knowledge and insight on the fundamental, clinical and public health related questions raised by these diseases.</p>
<p>The Commission would like first to mention that, although these diseases are, as such, not specifically earmarked as major diseases in the current 6th Research framework programme, a number of projects, related to chronic inflammation, rheumatic disease models, and to the development of adequate therapies, are already being funded in this field under the current Framework Programme.</p>
<p>The Commission has also met with organisations representing interests and patient groups such as, the European League against rheumatism, EULAR, which have provided very useful position papers on the needs and perspectives of future research. These exchanges have constructively fed into the discussion about specifying research areas in FP7.</p>
<p>In this context, as the honourable Member is aware, the Commission has adopted on 6 April 2005 its proposal on the 7th Research Framework Programme. In this proposal, under the “health” theme in the “Cooperation” part, the Commission specifically puts forward to undertake transnational research in major diseases, including chronic diseases. The fact that osteoarthritis is explicitly mentioned as an example of such chronic diseases, proves the importance given to this type of research.</p>
<p>Furthermore the section on rare disorders might also give opportunities for research on rare rheumatic and autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p>Finally it must be stressed that the “Health” theme contains two other strategic issues that will be addressed horizontally across all activities, being “child health” and “the health of the ageing population”.</p>
<p>As such the Commission trusts that its proposal provides sufficient prospects for research into rheumatic diseases.</p>
<p>On the budget question, the Commission can inform the honourable Member that an indicative budget figure for collaborative research in “Health” of 8.373 million € is proposed, but that specific allocation of funds to particular activities is still under discussion, and that therefore at present no figure can be provided for the research on these chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would also like to add that, besides research, complementary activity in the Community public health programme regarding health monitoring for this disease group and in the field of rare diseases are also relevant.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0435"></a>

<p>BONUS is a project funded under the ERA-NET scheme of the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for RTD. The main goal of BONUS is the coordination of the national Baltic Sea Research Programmes.</p>
<p>The project includes research funding organisations from all Baltic coastal states, including from Russia, as well as ICES, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.</p>
<p>The coordination of these programmes affects several tens of research projects with an accumulated annual research budget estimated to around € 20 million.</p>
<p>According to the rules of the ERA-NET scheme, the EU financial contribution only covers the coordination costs of some € 3 million over 4 years, while the research funds are national funds.</p>
<p>ii) Article 169</p>
<p>Currently, the Commission is preparing the Proposals for the Specific Programmes of the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for RTD. In this context, Member States around the Baltic Sea are preparing a proposal for a joint programme of research on the Baltic under the terms of Article 169 of the Treaty. The current BONUS project (which is an ERA-NET project) contributes to this preparatory work.</p>
<p>Article 169 allows for the participation of the Community in jointly implemented national research and development programmes. As such, Article 169 can be used as a funding scheme for implementing the Framework Programme.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal for FP-VII indicates that a dedicated implementation structure will be set up for each joint programme under Article 169. It is to this dedicated structure that the Commission would give the EU contribution. This contribution can be used both to fund research activities and to cover costs of the implementation structure.</p>
<p>Because of the geography and the environmental issues in the Baltic the involvement of Russia is highly desirable should a joint programme on the Baltic Sea be established under Article 169. This involvement would be done via the implementation structure and would be in line with the principle that the Framework Programme allows for participation of Third Countries.</p>
<p>Any joint programme under Article 169 is to be decided by both the Council of Ministers and the Parliament under the co-decision procedure. Hence, Members of Parliament will be fully informed about all aspects of the issue, scientific and financial.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Meanwhile, the Spanish Government has once again changed the criteria governing the extraordinary regularisation programme currently under way in Spain.

<p>(EN)Firstly, as a general rule, the Commission does not comment on the actions taken by individual Member States in the field of regularisations, as these decisions are still within their national competences. However, previous regularisations in some Member States have made it very clear that there is a strong need for a common EU approach in managing migration.</p>
<p>The Commission has carefully examined the Spanish Royal Decree 2393/2004 which contains, in its third transitional clause, the rules governing the regularisation procedure. The Commission is therefore fully aware that one of the requirements irregular migrants had to fulfil in order to obtain a residence and work permit under the regularisation procedure was to be registered in a municipal register (‘padrón’) before 8 August 2004.</p>
<p>Under existing Community legislation, Member States are not obliged to inform the Commission of national measures they take within areas of their competence. As no Community rules exist yet in the area of regularisation of irregular migrants, this is still an area of national competence, and therefore the Spanish Government was under no obligation to communicate to the Commission the actions it intended to undertake.</p>
<p>This situation may change in the future since the Commission will soon present a proposal on the establishment of a mutual information procedure on Member States’ measures in the areas of asylum and immigration. The objective of this proposal is to set up a compulsory mechanism by which Member States must inform other Member States and the Commission of planned national measures they intend to undertake in the areas of immigration and asylum.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0380"></a>

<p>The Spanish Government’s regularisation programme for immigrants ended on 7 May. The programme was a great success, with around 700 000 applications being made. The aim of the programme was to end illegal employment by integrating illegal immigrants into Spanish society. To achieve this, employment contracts were required for regularisation. The programme was backed across the board by trade unions, management and civil society. In addition to ending illegal employment and integrating illegal immigrants, the programme has put Spain in the perfect position to participate in and promote the establishment of a common European policy on immigration.</p>
<p>Does the Commission support the successful Spanish regularisation programme as a way of ending illegal employment and integrating illegal immigrants into society by granting them full rights?

<p>According to the information available to the Commission, Spain faced a particular problem caused by the presence of about 1 million irregular migrants, who were registered at municipal registers but who did not have residence or work permits delivered by the Ministry of Interior.

<p>(EN)Widening the scope of reduced rates was considered at the time the Commission was drafting its proposal on reduced VAT rates<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. As part of that consideration, the Commission decided to propose the extension of the option of applying reduced rates to the categories for which a significant number of Member States were already authorised to apply reduced rates under specific derogations and where, therefore, a common need had already been established.</p>
<p>Currently, housing is subject to a reduced rate in 14 Member States, while the restriction to social housing is applied in a variety of ways or not at all, by virtue of specific derogations granted to some Member States.</p>
<p>As far as the Commission knows, no Member State applies reduced rates to any other building services. They usually subsidise building services concerning schools and this can compensate VAT costs. This is also the case for other buildings such as places of worship, listed buildings, hospitals and other public buildings. This is a national issue outside the scope of VAT rules. In these circumstances, the Commission proposed reduced rates for the whole housing sector, including renting, but not for other buildings.</p>
<p>After several meetings at ministerial level, no agreement could be reached in the Council because some Member States are strongly opposed to any extension of the scope of the reduced rates. The Luxembourg Presidency has now proposed a compromise with a restricted category for housing<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. At this stage, this implies that school buildings would not be covered.</p>
<p>With reference to the Lisbon strategy, the Commission would like to emphasize that adequate tax policy is an indispensable means of achieving the Lisbon objectives whereby the EU is pushing for accelerated economic growth, job creation and improved competitiveness. Therefore, the Commission is ready to examine with an open mind any compromise solution that the Council of Ministers could reach on rates.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has already recognised the need to inform third countries about REACH and is already devoting sizeable resources to this. Furthermore, the Commission has recognised the need for clear guidance for stakeholders to ensure consistent, cost-effective and smooth operation of the system, explaining the many flexible elements in REACH available to companies. It has therefore started a major programme of work to develop such guidance, in co-operation with stakeholders. The Commission intends that appropriate guidance will be available at the time each part of the REACH system comes into force. The guidance will be available to domestic EU producers and importers alike.</p>
<p>The REACH proposal also recognises the need to improve international cooperation Under the REACH proposal there will be established a new European Chemicals Agency to manage the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of the REACH system. One of the tasks of the Agency will be at the Commission’s request, to provide technical and scientific support inter alia to improve cooperation between the Community and third countries, as well as active participation in technical assistance and capacity building activities on sound management of chemicals in developing countries’ (art. 73 (2) (i) of REACH).</p>
<p>The European Communities recognises its obligations under Article 11.3 of the TBT Agreement to provide adequate assistance to allow developing countries to comply with legislation such as REACH. In addition to the provision of extensive guidance material (as mentioned above), the Commission aims to do its best to help developing countries to familiarise themselves with REACH. This will be achieved in part through technical assistance and capacity building but also through training and provision of information by the proposed Chemicals Agency.</p>

<p>Various European industrialists have now drawn attention to the scale of the milk sales involved. Has the Commission given this any consideration?

<p>(EN)The Commission is well aware of the emerging markets for agricultural products in South-East Asia and in China and it has at various occasions encouraged Community producers and exporters to exploit those new markets while providing technical and political support.</p>
<p>With specific regard to milk and milk products it is clear that the potential in China is substantial, particularly against the background of the size of population and the increased standards of living. However, in real terms only milk powder seems to be an appropriate product as it is easy to transport, handle and store. The European producers and exporters of milk powder are no doubt aware of this potential market but whether actual exports will take place depends on their evaluation of the economical circumstances e.g. whether export refunds can be obtained or not. In that context, it is worth recalling that firstly the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement has fixed a quantitative and budgetary ceiling for subsidised milk powder and, secondly, that export refunds are likely to be phased out at a pace which remains to be negotiated.</p>
<p>Technical assistance, promotion, trade fairs etc. seems to the Commission to be far more appropriate tools than legislation in the effort to open up and exploit the market in China.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0371"></a>

<p>(FR)The Commission is indeed aware of the European Parliament’s stance, adopted on 14 April 2005, and became aware of it prior to the Transport Council of 21 April.</p>
<p>Following the latest discussions between the European institutions, the industry and the other parties affected, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>The common position issued by the Council on 9 December 2004 to which the Commission gave its agreement on 14 December 2004, has set 5 August 2005 as the date when tachographs will be brought into use in all new vehicles. The Commission is keen to see this provision enter into force at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>During a technical meeting on 14 April 2005 between the Commission, the Member States and representatives from the industry, the participants declared themselves ready to introduce digital tachographs.</p>
<p>However, information was also brought to the Commission’s attention, suggesting that it would not be possible to deliver the tachographs, on a broad scale, before 5 August. The Commission asked to meet those players likely to be most affected and is in the process of analysing the information. It will be sure to raise this point at the next Transport Council, if the problems are confirmed.</p>
<p>The implementation of European legislation on digital tachographs requires close collaboration between the tachograph manufacturers, who are to deliver the equipment to the car makers; the Member States, which are to deliver the driver cards; and the vehicle manufacturers, which are to install the equipment in all new vehicles. Lastly, suitable training programmes for drivers and vehicle operators must be set up by the tachograph manufacturers, in close cooperation with the relevant authorities in the Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission feels that the availability, in due course, of the new tachographs should be a prerequisite for the implementation of European legislation on digital tachographs.</p>
<p>Given that vehicles already on the road can continue to be driven using analogue tachographs, both types of tachograph will be used simultaneously for a certain amount of time. The two types will record the same driving times and rest times, however, and are to be supervised by the national authorities in the same way.</p>
<p>In order not to distort competition, the authorities of the Member States will be required to implement the rules on driving time properly and effectively.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The question relates to restructuring aid granted by the Spanish authorities in favour of Babcock Borsig España S.A. (“BBE”), engineering and construction undertaking active in the sector of capital goods in Galindo, Spain. The Commission authorised the payment of restructuring aid in favour of BBE for a total amount of € 294.66 million by means of a decision adopted on 3 July 2001 (OJ L 67, 9.3.2002). By letter of 19 November 2003 the Spanish authorities notified an amendment of the restructuring plan in favour of BBE, which was also approved by Commission’s decision on 16 December 2003 (OJ C 65, 13.3.2004, p.6). A new Commission’s decision was necessary because the initial buyer of BBE withdrew and the restructuring plan was amended by the new acquirer of BBE, i.e. Austrian Energy &amp; Environment AG.</p>
<p>It should initially be noted that contrary to the statement in the first question BBE is not a beneficiary of a Community subsidy, but a beneficiary of aid granted by the Spanish state. Also, the amended restructuring plan, adopted by the Commission on 16 December 2003 and which is to be implemented in five years and foresees a return to viability of BBE by the end of 2008, includes among other features the scaling down of some activities of BBE with parallel substantial reduction of employees.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the paragraph 45 of Community Guidelines on state aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission must be put in a position to make certain that the restructuring plan is being implemented properly, through detailed regular reports communicated by the Member State concerned.</p>
<p>Following the Commission’s decision of 2001 the Spanish authorities submitted the reports on the state of advancement of the restructuring plan of BBE in December 2001, July 2002 and November 2003. After the adoption of the Commission’s decision in 2003 on the amended restructuring programme, the Spanish authorities have not yet submitted a report on progress of the restructuring. The Commission has sent a reminder in this respect to the Spanish authorities, which promised to send a complete report shortly. In the meantime, the Commission has been informed by the Spanish authorities of the current stage of payment of the authorised aid until the end of 2004. According to this information only 1/3 of the total authorised aid was paid out. The payment of the aid is closely linked to the advancement of the restructuring plan of BBE, which shall be fully implemented by the end of 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to closely follow up the development of the restructuring plan and systematically monitor that the strict conditions of the restructuring plan of BBE are fulfilled as laid down in the Commission’s decisions of 3 July 2001 and 16 December 2003.</p>
<p>(FR)The Commission is aware of what is at stake in terms of employment and economic development in the case of restructuring raised by the honourable Member. In general, and without prejudice to the rules on State aid, it intends, as far as possible, to promote the search for solutions that combine all the economic and social aspects in a partnership process. Its recent Communication on ‘restructuring and employment’ forms part of this objective and organises the coordination of Community activities to this end.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)At EU level three legislative instruments provide for rules on the setting up of joint investigation teams: the Convention on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations, the 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the Framework Decision on joint investigation teams.</p>
<p>The Convention on mutual assistance and cooperation between customs administrations adopted on 18 December 1997 has been ratified by 22 Member States (lack: IT, PL and MT). The 2000 Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters has been ratified by 11 Member States (AT, DK, EE, ES, FR, HU, LT, LV, NL, PT and FI) and it is not yet in force. The Commission has no power to force Member States to ratify a Convention.</p>
<p>The Framework Decision on joint investigation teams was adopted on 13 June 2002. The content of the Framework Decision reproduces Articles 13, 15 and 16 of the 2000 Convention dealing not only with the setting up of the teams but also with the criminal and civil liability regarding officials.</p>
<p>According to Article 34 TUE, framework decisions are binding upon Member States as to the result to be achieved but leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods. However, framework decisions shall not entail direct effect.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 4 of the Framework Decision, Member States were supposed to take the necessary measures to comply with it by 1 January 2003. In order to enable the Council to assess to what extent Member States have complied with the Framework Decision, the Commission evaluated the implementation measures taken by Member States in the report adopted on 7 January 2005. Only one Member State has been considered as fully compliant with the Framework Decision.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, whereas the Commission has under the Community Treaty the authority to start infringement proceedings against a Member State, this possibility does not exist within title VI of the TEU, concerning provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0381"></a>

<p>(EN)Regulation 998/2003 on veterinary rules applying to non-commercial movements of pets provides that rules relating to rabbits and rodents should be established through the Regulatory Committee procedure.</p>
<p>To this end a proposal has already been drafted by the Commission, discussed in an expert working group and at the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health which is the Committee in charge of these issues.</p>
<p>The objective was to propose a simple system, easy to implement and taking account that these animals are usually kept at home.</p>
<p>The main lines were the following:</p>
<p>No difference between Member States as they are all equivalent with regard to the health risk associated with these species;</p>
<p>No conditions and no document requested for movements inside the European Union and from most of the European Third Countries;</p>
<p>A “home quarantine” of 30 days with a clinical examination was the only requirement for movements from other third countries.</p>
<p>However, as often happens with issues relating to pets, some Member States considered the draft proposal as too strict whilst others considered it as too liberal.</p>
<p>The Commission is now considering all the remarks and requests for amendments received from the Member States in order to find an acceptable compromise.</p>
<p>A new proposal will be submitted as soon as possible to the Committee.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes it will be favourably welcomed and that “bunny rabbits” will travel in accordance with simple and harmonised rules.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0383"></a>

<p>(EN)One of the objectives of the REACH proposal is to protect human health and the environment, including animals. It was triggered by the general lack of information about the dangerous properties of chemicals. Unfortunately, closing this knowledge gap without using test methods involving animals is currently very difficult.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the REACH proposal has been designed so as to keep animal testing to a minimum and avoid any unnecessary or redundant tests on animals.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the Commission’s interim strategy for REACH, much of the preparatory work is currently being conducted as part of the REACH Implementation Projects (RIPs). One of these projects (RIP 3.3) aims to develop guidance for all stakeholders on information requirements and aims in particular at developing intelligent testing strategies which should allow minimal use of test animals. The activities within this RIP project will actively use the information that will become available, for example, through actions in the field of computerised methods (e.g. a (Q)SAR (Quantitative and Qualitative Structure Activity Relationship) and in the field of alternative test methods.</p>
<p>Since 1985, the European Union has been promoting alternative methods through framework research programmes. So far under the 6<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Research Programme (2002-2006), the EU has funded projects to promote alternative methods, to an amount of 39 Mio Euro. According to the recently adopted Proposal for a 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Research Programme, alternative methods are to be promoted as research priorities for 2007 - 2013. In addition the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) has made a so-called catch-up validation possible in order to speed up the validation of alternative test methods.</p>
<p>The Commission remains committed to further promoting alternative methods at national, European and international level. It is proposed to hold a conference on alternative methods in autumn this year with the objective of bringing together leading experts to discuss those issues and to provide advice on how best to accelerate our goal to reduce animal testing to the strict minimum, and at the same time maintain the competitiveness of enterprises.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0389"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission thanks the honourable Member for her continuing interest in the issue of environmental protection in Romania’s mining area Rosia Montana.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the persistent concerns of the Parliament as recently expressed. The Commission ensures the honourable Member that it pays the highest attention to these interventions and concerns.</p>
<p>The Romanian authorities have informed the Commission that an application for an environmental permit has been submitted by the mining company in December 2004 and that following this application, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), compliant with the EU directive on Environmental Impact Assessment and with the transboundary requirements of the ESPOO convention, is being undertaken. The Commission has been informed that any further exploratory activities have been halted. The Romanian government has repeatedly confirmed that it will strictly respect the environmental acquis and that the decision-making process will be based on precaution and transparency.</p>
<p>No EU funds are or will be involved in the Rosia Montana project.</p>
<p>As regards Natura 2000, Romania has no obligation to classify sites before accession. According to the Commission’s information the Rosia Montana region is heavily mined since a very long time and the Commission would not expect that such an area could be classified under the Natura 2000 sites. It is important however to note, that the EIA procedure will have to include considerations about whether the Rosia Montana area would potentially fall under the Natura 2000 network.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0392"></a>

<p>(EN)The honourable Member refers to the seminar and workshops on “Multi-Agency Alternative Strategies for Targeting the Proceeds of Criminal Activity- A European Union Perspective” which took place in County Monaghan, Ireland on 24<span class="sup">th</span> to 27<span class="sup">th</span> April of this year. The conference was organised with financial support from the Commission’s AGIS Programme and the Irish Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
<p>The purpose of the conference was to bring together Member States police investigators and prosecutors with expertise in criminal asset identification, tracing, freezing and confiscation with a view to consider how to ensure most effective cooperation and information exchange in these areas. In addition to Member States experts, the conference was also attended by Europol, Eurojust, the Commission, Interpol and the International Monetary Fund. The conference was a useful contribution to promoting cooperation among practitioners in criminal asset forfeiture and a very worthwhile use of Commission AGIS funds.</p>
<p>The Commission gave a key note address at the conference, outlining the essential role of criminal asset confiscation in the fight against organised crime and indicating those areas the Commission believes are important to ensure that confiscation policy is implemented and operated in the most effective way. In addition, the Commission representative outlined possible options as to how the legal framework for the EU confiscation regime could develop in the future such as the possibility of requiring an offender to show the lawful origin of alleged proceeds of crime, including by reversing the onus and/or lightening the standard of proof. These issues will be addressed in a forthcoming Commission Communication on “Developing a strategic concept on tackling organised crime” which should be adopted by the Commission in June.</p>
<p>As regards the honourable Member’s question whether the Commission will take account of any proposals resulting from the above-mentioned conference, a Steering Group has been established to evaluate the workshop discussions and will meet to produce its conclusions in mid June. As the Commission made clear at the conference, it would strongly welcome the expert input of practitioners to the EU policy development process in the area of criminal asset confiscation. The Commission therefore looks forward to receiving the Steering Group conclusions and to the prospect of future conferences on criminal asset forfeiture that will build on and develop any conclusions resulting from the April 2005 conference.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0396"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of the existence of “ghost fishing” off the western coasts of Ireland and Scotland, and is currently looking into the feasibility of retrieving lost or abandoned gillnets in these and other areas.</p>
<p>However, ghost fishing is only part of the problem. In the fisheries referred to by the honourable Member, relatively few vessels are fishing with more nets than they can manage, which means that soak times are sometimes excessive and a large part of the catch is consequently unfit for consumption by the time it is retrieved.</p>
<p>The Commission is concerned about the impact of these deep-water fixed gillnet fisheries on the marine environment and considers that they need to be properly regulated. This is with reference to the damage done by certain vessels referred to by the honourable Member. This practice is in actual fact not illegal so far.</p>
<p>In the longer term there are a number of possible measures that might be considered, such as limitations on the number or total length of nets that any one vessel is allowed to work, limitation on maximum soak times, and an obligation to mark each net with the identity of the owner and the time of deployment. However the Commission also recognises that introducing such measures would take some time, and that they may be difficult to enforce because of the distance from the shore at which the fisheries operate.</p>
<p>Given the urgency with which action is needed, the Commission is currently consulting with the Member States with a view to introducing emergency measures under Article 7 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 that would constrain these fisheries until they can be properly regulated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0399"></a>

For any deviation from the original use of such projects the EIB needs to be informed and, when necessary, agree. On that basis, to the extent that schemes financed by EIB are directly affected by the new bill, which also covers installations not financed by the Bank, the State must accordingly inform the Bank, seeking the necessary consent if required.

<p>On 12 May 2005 the European Court of Human Rights delivered its judgment on the conditions of arrest and forced transfer of former PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan, the conduct of his trial and ill-treatment inflicted on him (application 46221/99 to the ECHR). The Court held that Öcalan had not had a fair and impartial trial in Turkey, ruling that various articles of the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated and suggesting that Turkey hold a new trial. It also established that there had been serious violations of Öcalan's right of defence, with further substantial violations of the European Convention in this case.</p>
<p>What overall conclusions does the Commission draw from the ruling of 12 May 2005 of the European Court of Human Rights? Does the Commission agree, in particular, that Öcalan must be given a new trial before 3 October 2005, and does it not consider that the holding of this second trial is of essential importance if Turkey is to show that it adheres to the principles underpinning the rule of law?

Chronic fatigue is an 'invisible' illness owing to the difficulties involved in diagnosing it and the meagre resources allocated to research into and treatment of the illness. This scientific vacuum needs to be filled by improving the training of health professionals, developing agreed diagnostic protocols and facilitating access to the health system by sufferers. Effective solutions also need to be found to the problems that the illness causes sufferers at work. Most sufferers are women. In Spain, for example, it is estimated that 90% of all those suffering from the illness (between 3% and 5% of the population) are women.

<p>(EN)Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome have been, for sometime, controversial disorders. There are many experts within and outside the world of medicine who believe that these disorders may not exist and others believing in their reality. This situation has given rise to major differences of opinion concerning the ability of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome patients to work, and to their entitlement to social security benefits. In this context of scientific controversy, it has been difficult for the Commission to promote actions related to monitoring and prevention these diseases.</p>
<p>Nowadays it appears, more and more, as an established and accepted fact that these syndromes are genuine, severe and incapacitating disorders, even if controversy remains, and even if there are always discussions in relation to the most appropriate terminology. The United States CDC case criteria definition for chronic fatigue syndrome now seems accepted as an international standard.</p>
<p>In this favourable context, the Commission Decision adopting the work plan for 2005 for the implementation of the Public Health Programme has stated as a priority the work on information and definition of indicators on neurodegenerative, neurodevelopment and non-psychiatric brain diseases in relation to prevalence, treatments, risk factors, risk reduction strategies, best practices, cost of illness and social support.</p>
<p>Unfortunately no proposals in the area of fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome have been submitted to the Commission in 2005. However the possibility of support to networking activities for these diseases will stay as a Commission priority in future Work Plans.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0405"></a>

<p>(EN)The honourable Member is perfectly right in that more than ever before the European Union needs to explain its aims and policies clearly and comprehensibly. That is why the Barroso Commission has made communication one of its strategic priorities. The foremost responsibility of the present Commission is connecting with citizens. But this is not just the Commission’s responsibility – it is the responsibility of all players – the Parliament, the Council, the Member State governments. The Commission will therefore put forward a White Paper on Communication which will address the role of all involved and which will give the other institutions the possibility to define and organise their input.</p>
<p>As for the Commission, it has already started to put its own house in order and professionalize its communication activities: This involves improving research, planning, coordination and evaluation of communication activities and a better use of the excellent communication tools the Commission has at its disposal:</p>
<p>A daily press conference attended by hundreds of journalists</p>
<p>A team of Spokespeople</p>
<p>TV recording and broadcasting facilities</p>
<p>The largest multilingual website in the world</p>
<p>A call centre which can respond to questions in all 20 official languages</p>
<p>The possibility to conduct opinion polls</p>
<p>A wide range of printed publications</p>
<p>Representations in the 25 Member States.</p>
<p>In order to interest Europeans in European politics, the Commission’s new communication approach will be more “demand-driven”, involving a better understanding of target audiences and of those who act as ‘multipliers’, a better use of modern and effective communication tools and techniques and a more professional attitude to all its communication work.</p>
<p>Communication will be integrated into the Commission’s working culture and into policy formulation from its very beginning. This needs to be maintained throughout the whole political process.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of its mandate, the present Commission has put an important stress on communicating Europe. Currently, an important part of the Commission’s efforts lie with the ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. While respecting the fact that the ratification of the Constitution falls primarily under the responsibility of the Member States, the Commission has been an active partner in informing European citizens about its content and its importance for the future of the European Union. In this it has enjoyed the support of the Parliament. The Commission has developed a strategy consisting of ten initiatives which form an integrated concept and which support and enhance each other:</p>
<p>the wide distribution of the text of the Constitution for free,</p>
<p>a Constitution web site,</p>
<p>trainings for national and regional journalists,</p>
<p>roundtable discussions with civil society organised by the Commission’s Representations,</p>
<p>information actions targeted to universities and schools (such as "European Spring Day"),</p>
<p>support for the production of radio and television programmes,</p>
<p>targeting the use of the EUROPE DIRECT call centre,</p>
<p>mobilizing the Commission’s networks of multipliers in various policy areas,</p>
<p>undertaking detailed opinion poll analysis and focus group research,</p>
<p>and, last but not least, supporting the information campaigns in the Member States.</p>
<p>Moreover, as from the 1<span class="sup">st</span> of May 2005 the new generation of EUROPE DIRECT information centres network comprising 393 relays is operational. This network replaces the former one of Info-Points Europe and Carrefours under one single name. At the same time, it is being enlarged within the old Member States and extended to the new ones.</p>
<p>The Commission has kept the Parliament regularly informed on the development of the communication strategy, which has been discussed in the plenary on the occasion of the debates on the Herrero report on the 12<span class="sup">th</span> of May, in the Parliament’s Culture committee on 14<span class="sup">th</span> of March, and at the last Inter-institutional Group on Information on the 8<span class="sup">th</span> of March.</p>
<p>The Commission will invite the Parliament and the Council to comment on its White Paper.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0406"></a>

<p>On 12 May 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution (<a href="/doceo/document/TA-6-2005-0187_EN.html">P6_TA(2005)0187</a>) calling for steps to be taken to alleviate the effects of the unprecedented drought and frosts experienced in Spain this year, which have destroyed millions of fruit trees, olive trees and annual crops of all kinds in large parts of the country. I understand that on the same day, on the heels of Parliament's resolution, the Spanish Government sent a letter to the Agriculture Commissioner, Mrs Fischer Boel, requesting that a raft of measures be implemented to tackle the disaster suffered by Spain. However, in its letter the Spanish Government simply asked whether the Solidarity Fund could be harnessed, without making a formal request which, moreover, should have been addressed to the Commissioner for Regional Policy, Danuta Hubner, and not to the Agriculture Commissioner.</p>
<p>Could the Commission indicate whether it intends to place at Spain's disposal a share of the resources available this year under the Solidarity Fund, as called for in the European Parliament resolution, and whether it has now received a formal request from the Spanish Government, addressed to the appropriate services?</p>

<p>The Commission adopted a Decision on 10 May 2005 allowing the use of set-aside land for feeding animals in nine autonomous communities in Spain.</p>

<p>According to Council Regulation (EC) n° 2012/2002, the European Union Solidarity Fund can only be mobilised on request of the affected Member State within ten weeks of the first damage caused by the disaster and under specific criteria which apply to qualify for the aid.

<p>(FR)The Commission thanks the honourable Member for drawing its attention to the rulings of the Portuguese national courts, especially that of the Azores Supreme Court of 20 May 2005, regarding precautionary measures sought by an operator from mainland Portugal against the shipment to the mainland of sugar from the Azores.</p>
<p>The issue of the legality of sugar shipments from the Azores to the mainland was referred to the Court of Justice by the Ponte Delgada Court and was the subject of a preliminary ruling on 15 March 2003 in case C-282/00, ‘Refinarias de Açúcar Reunidas (RAR) versus Sociedade de Indústrias Agrícolas Açoreanas SA (Sinaga)’. As far as the Commission is aware, the Ponte Delgada Court has yet to issue a ruling, following the Court of Justice’s interpretation given two years ago.</p>
<p>Although the Commission is ready to carry out a thorough examination of the rulings to which the honourable Member refers, it considers from the outset that, due to the nature and the objective of the infringement proceedings at the Commission’s disposal as Guardian of the Treaty, these rulings do not constitute a decisive factor in the ongoing infringement proceedings. As current Community law stands – according to the Court of Justice’s interpretation in its aforementioned ruling – the Commission considers that to re-dispatch to the mainland quantities of white sugar derived from the processing of raw sugar in the Azores introduced into the Azores under the specific supply arrangements laid down in the Poséima programme runs counter to the ban contained in regulations (EEC) Nos 1600/92 and 1453/2001, insofar as the re-dispatches cannot be considered traditional shipments to the rest of the Community, for which a derogation has been provided. On the face of it, it would appear, incidentally, that neither the ruling of the Lisbon Court of Appeal, following examination of the shipments to the mainland in the light of the criteria laid down by the Court, nor the ruling of the Supreme Court, is at variance with the principle of the ban on re-dispatching in the case concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0432"></a>

<p>(EN)The legal base for collecting tourism statistics in the European Union is the “Council Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism”.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Directive, the data to be collected shall relate to:</p>
<p>the capacity of collective tourist accommodation establishments;</p>
<p>guest flows in collective accommodation establishments and;</p>
<p>tourism demand.</p>
<p>To measure tourist flows, both monthly and annual data is collected on arrivals of residents and non-residents as well as on nights spent by residents and non-residents.</p>
<p>These statistics allow a comprehensive understanding of tourist flows. On what concerns the better understanding of the situation related to tourist products and services, the Commission has undertaken the Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSA) initiative to facilitate international comparisons of tourism and to evaluate EU tourism’s performance in internationally standardised statistical/macro-economic terms. The Commission will continue to support the Member States for the development of the TSA within the EU-25. Already two rounds of calls for proposals have been arranged, with 14 Member States taking advantage of these grants. A third round is going to be published in the near future and Greece’s participation would be welcomed.</p>
<p>For analysis and study purposes the Commission uses, in addition to the above mentioned directive generated data and other statistical data provided by Eurostat, relevant international data available, for example from the World Tourism Organization.</p>
<p>Actions and work currently carried out in the Member States to implement the Directive can now be considered as fully operational and fairly advanced. Generally, data availability and timeliness have increased considerably since the adoption of the Directive 95/57/EC.</p>
<p>In particular, Greece is slowly catching up with data transmissions but is still about one year behind schedule. Annual data is now available for 2002 and quarterly data for the 2nd quarter of 2003.</p>
<p>According to these latest figures available, resident nights decreased between 2001 and 2002 by around 2.9% (compared to a decrease of 2.3% in the EU as a whole), while non resident nights decreased by 19.8% (mainly due to greatly reduced nights spent by visitors from the UK and Germany) in the same period (compared to a decrease of 2.7% in the EU as a whole).</p>
<p>It is noticeable that arrivals by non-residents to Greece only decreased by 7.1%, which means that the reduction in nights spent by non-residents is due to shorter stays rather than reduced numbers of foreign visitors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0433"></a>

The success of country strategies depends to a large extent on their ability to overcome stigma and discrimination and to ensure that vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, get access to adequate services, such as information, prevention, treatment and care. Information needs to be made available in accessible formats. Prejudice around issues such as the sexuality of people with disabilities has to be addressed.</p>
<p>The new European Community policy framework to confront HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis through external action <a href="#defann_63_1" name="refann_63_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the recently adopted Programme for Action<a href="#defann_63_2" name="refann_63_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> put more emphasis on promoting human security and protecting human rights as key aspects of the response to the three diseases. Issues surrounding stigma and discrimination will be addressed in dialogue with governments, donors and other stakeholders. The Commission will encourage the participation of vulnerable groups and their representatives in the design, implementation and monitoring of country programmes. Unfortunately, the needs of people with disabilities are not sufficiently addressed in all countries where the Commission supports HIV/AIDS programmes. Through dialogue, and by promoting civil society participation the Commission tries to ensure that the specific issues are addressed and the resources needed are allocated. The Commission does not, however, foresee earmarking resources specifically for this purpose.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission states that restrictions on gaming activities must meet certain conditions: in the words of its most recent answer, this means that such restrictions must be consistent and systematic. Does the Commission consider that Denmark meets with these conditions, and can it clarify its answer with a concrete example?</p>
<p>In its same answer, the Commission states that a study has been commissioned to review all the national rules applicable to the differing forms of gambling services and the development of the market in gambling services.

<p>(EN)In response to the honourable Member’s first request for clarification as to whether restrictions on sports betting services in Denmark are justified by imperative requirements in the general interest and suitable for achieving those objectives, the Commission can only refer to its press-release relating to an on-going procedure, dated 30 March 2004 (IP 04/401). This press-release describes the key elements of the letter of formal notice that was sent to Denmark by the Commission. The Danish authorities responded to the Commission’s letter of formal notice and the Commission is currently evaluating that response. It is therefore not possible to provide further information on this issue at this stage.</p>
<p>As regards the second request relating to the study, the Commission wishes to clarify two points:</p>
<p>First, the study will not only focus on sports betting services but on a wide range of different gambling services.</p>
<p>Second, the study will provide the Commission with facts and figures relating to the identified gambling sectors (including national laws and jurisprudence). The Commission is not seeking the advice of the contractor on whether or how it should regulate any gambling sector. The Commission’s intention is not to liberalise this sector but – where cross-border problems have been identified - to seek solutions consistent with the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to point out that the Court has specified that restrictions on gaming activities may be justified by imperative requirements in the general interest, such as consumer protection and the prevention of both fraud and incitement to squander on gaming. It has also ruled that restrictions based on such grounds and on the need to preserve public order must be suitable for achieving those objectives, inasmuch as they must serve to limit betting activities in a consistent and systematic manner. Therefore, although it has not explicitly ruled about the maintenance of a betting monopoly, it has ruled that such a regime as for any other limitations to betting activities must comply with these conditions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0440"></a>

<p>On 11 May 2005 the European Parliament adopted an own-initiative report on the simplification of the common organisations of the market in fruit and vegetables, in which it expressed firm opposition to the delay in the reform of the sector which had been announced by the EU Agriculture Commissioner, Mrs Fischer Boel.</p>
<p>In its report, Parliament takes the view that it is both unreasonable and unacceptable for the Commission proposal to be put back by one or two years, in view of the fact that the market crises (which cannot be overcome by means of the management instruments available) need to be resolved as a matter of urgency. The European Parliament has asked the Commission not to turn a deaf ear to a sector which makes a significant contribution to EU final agricultural production (accounting for 17% of the total) and which is at risk of being marginalised in the negotiations on the new financial perspective.</p>

<p>(EN)The Presidency Conclusions of November 2004 on possible reform of the Fruit and vegetables sector are twofold: firstly, they recognize that the path undertaken with the major 1996 reform should be continued for the fresh sector. Secondly, on the processed sector, the Commission is called on by the Council to carry out the appropriate impact analysis on a possible shift from the current regimes to an approach based on objectives and instruments already used in the 2003 Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reform.</p>
<p>For the sake of coherency, the Commission decided to present a global proposal covering both the fresh and processed sectors, because such a solution should allow presenting a better-balanced proposal.</p>
<p>As regard timing, due to the need to take into account the requirements of the impact assessment, the opportunity to launch an external evaluation on the aid schemes for processed products and the need to proceed to extended inter-service consultations, a global proposal can not be adopted before September 2006.</p>
