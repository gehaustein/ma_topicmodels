<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herman Van Rompuy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the European Council. </span>– Mr President, the European Council meeting of 16 September was convened primarily in order to focus on the Union’s external relations. We also had a short scheduled discussion during lunch about the task force on economic governance, and an unscheduled discussion about the Roma situation. Allow me to address each of these in turn.</p>
<p class="contents">First, regarding foreign affairs. When I took office eight months ago, while visiting our capitals, I noticed a degree of frustration following the Copenhagen Summit. There was a perception that the European Union was sidelined. Our economic outlook was not good, whereas other economies in the world were growing rapidly. Moreover, we started to realise how the economic strength of emerging countries is being transformed into real political power. The G20, although created at the instigation of the European Union, is also a sign of this trend, as is the debate about representation in the International Monetary Fund. This affects us: new players do not always share our interests and our world views.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Treaty requires the European Council to define the Union’s strategic interests and give strategic direction to the work of other institutions. I am glad the Heads of State or Government all agreed to take this up and deepen their involvement in the Union’s foreign policy. They want more ownership by the European Council. They want to assume their responsibilities as members of this Union institution.</p>
<p class="contents">What did we discuss? Well, it seemed urgent to me to address our strategic partnerships first. The issue was to link general objectives to concrete means, to make progress on the ground. We therefore briefly talked about how to make the best use of the Lisbon Treaty, with the new External Action Service. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for its work in securing agreement on this.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we make sure that what is done in Brussels and in the capitals is going in the same direction? How can we coordinate better between the different actors in Brussels? How can we bring together the different aspects of our relationship with partners – for instance, during summits – in areas such as the economy, climate, values and security?</p>
<p class="contents">The proof of the pudding is in the eating. How do we deal with our partners, one to one? We set priorities on a number of pressing matters. Our key messages for summits with third countries have to be underpinned by some specific negotiations and trade-offs. I retain from the discussion in the European Council the following other points:</p>
<p class="contents">First, this is the beginning of a process. Second, our key messages should be mandated by the European Council, prepared and implemented by the Foreign Affairs Council, the Commission and the High Representative, just as we are already preparing the G20 meetings in the European Council. My third point is that, with our partners, ‘reciprocity’ is a key word. We can also speak about ‘identifying mutual interests’. The general feeling is that this is not the case yet. We all insist on deliverables and leverage. We must turn objectives into concrete results. We have strategic partners but we need more strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have developed ideas on how to position ourselves vis-à-vis China and where to fine-tune them further. Thanks to the European Council discussion, when the President of the Commission and I meet the Chinese Prime Minister in Brussels two weeks from now, we will not speak just for ‘Brussels’. We can also speak on behalf of the 27.</p>
<p class="contents">We touched upon other upcoming meetings as well: the G20 summit in Seoul and the EU-US summit, both to take place in November, both crucial for global economic prospects. We will further prepare these meetings at the European Council of 28 and 29 October. The French President, as incoming chair, outlined some of his ideas for the G20 in 2011. He received our full support for creating a new dynamic for the G8/G20, underlining that they should become a process, not just an event.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Middle East: the success of the Middle East peace negotiations is of strategic interest for the European Union. We adopted a specific declaration on this issue in line with our common position of December 2009. We are involved in the process via the Quartet.</p>
<p class="contents">Our neighbourhood, for instance, the Western Balkans and their European perspective, and the Eastern Partnership, are of the highest importance. Our reputation in the world starts with stability on our own continent. If we want to be a global player, we have to be a regional player.</p>
<p class="contents">From now on, we will discuss foreign policy in the European Council in this spirit. We can only be credible and strong if we are united. We showed our unity in the position of the 27 on additional sanctions on Iran, which was not self-evident, and in the very important UN resolution on the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo, extremely important for the Western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides discussing strategy and our overall approach, we also reached a conclusion on two specific issues: South Korea and Pakistan. We thereby showed immediately that the European Union can deliver on issues of huge strategic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The free trade agreement with South Korea is an issue of great external importance. It concerns a vital relationship with our eighth largest trading partner and, beyond that, with the whole of the Asian economy. It has been close to agreement for three years and we are delivering it now. It will save European exporters EUR 1.6 billion in costs annually, so this is good news for our export industries and therefore for jobs and growth in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On Pakistan, we want to give maximum support to this country after it was so severely struck by devastating floods. More aid and more trade; we want Pakistan to recover now and to develop economically. We will grant significantly increased market access. Catherine Ashton helped us to reach agreement on this important declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Second point: the task force. During the European Council lunch, we talked about the economy, the basis to gain political clout. In the first half of the year, the European Council had to involve itself in pressing economic issues. Our economies are in better shape now, but the work is not over yet.</p>
<p class="contents">During the lunch, I briefed my colleagues on the progress in the task force on economic governance. I did it yesterday here in the Parliament. All Heads of State or Government want to continue the work and to keep the momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a large consensus on some of the most important issues, like the macro-economic surveillance framework. This will monitor and correct imbalances, risks of bubbles, and divergences in competitiveness. There is also agreement on strengthening national fiscal frameworks, on enshrining European budget rules in national legislation and on the principle of what has been called the European Semester. We also made progress on sanctions, even if more work is needed. As I explained in detail to a meeting with seven of your committee chairs and the leaders of your groups yesterday, this amounts to a strengthening of the economic pillar of our Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Although some have claimed that our work on this is slow, we have in fact covered an enormous amount of ground in a very short time. Compared to negotiations establishing the Stability and Growth Pact in 1997 and its revision in 2005, we are proceeding very quickly, despite the complexity of the issues. I will submit a draft of the global report to the task force on 27 September. We will finalise the discussions in the middle of October so that the European Council can reach a conclusion at its meeting of 28 and 29 October. The Commission intends to present legislative proposals by the end of September in line with its right of initiative – proposals which will, of course, come before your Parliament for consideration and adoption under the legislative procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Those proposals by the Commission may positively contribute to keeping the momentum. This spring, we won the battle of the euro. I am confident that next month, we will draw the final right lessons from this crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Third topic: the Roma. During lunch, we discussed a topic that interests you particularly. Around the table there was consensus on five points, which was not interpreted as a formal Council conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">One, a Member State has the right and the duty to take action to uphold the rule of law within its territory. Two, the Commission has the right, and indeed the duty, to ensure compliance with Union law by Member States and has the right, and indeed the duty, to conduct investigations. Three, we took note of the declaration that the Commission President made on the eve of the European Council. Four, respect is the essential rule in relations between the Member States and the Commission. Five, in a future meeting of the European Council, we will discuss the issue of integration of the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">The prohibition of all forms of discrimination based on nationality or ethnicity is the founding principle of the European Union. Respect for human dignity is one of our core values.</p>
<p class="contents">Meetings of the European Council should not be considered as summits but as regular – even routine – meetings of a Union institution. Indeed, allow me to emphasise, at this time of renewed debate in your Parliament about the Community method, that the European Council is an institution of our Union, not another summit in the manner of the G8 and the G20. It is embedded in the institutional framework of the Union but it brings to the Union inputs from the highest political level in the Member States and it gives the Member States a sense of ownership and participation in the Union and reinforces their commitment to its success.</p>
<p class="contents">It comprises not only the Heads of State or Government but also the President of the European Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs. It is often attended by the President of the European Central Bank. Since the Lisbon Treaty, it is being chaired by someone who is not simultaneously representing one of the Member States but who must work both inside the European Council and in close cooperation with the other institutions to find agreements in the general European interest. That is why I am investing time and energy in maintaining regular contacts with the Presidents of other institutions, not least the President of the Commission, the rotating Council Presidency, the Central Bank, the Euro Group and, of course, yourself, Mr President, along with leaders of the political groups and chairs of the parliamentary committees, well beyond what is provided for in the treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We do indeed work in the general European interest. The efforts made by all European institutions over the last months have started to produce results. Our economies are recovering at an unexpected pace. Confidence is coming back, slowly but surely. I thank the European Parliament for its cooperation in restoring confidence through the legislation on financial surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Member States are engaged in reform programmes. I pay tribute to those national governments who are taking courageous measures in very difficult political circumstances. In most of our Member States, the crisis is not over, in particular, not on the employment front, although there is improvement. We are in better shape now than before the summer. A lot of work remains to be done. Dear colleagues, we will do it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maroš Šefčovič, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, Parliament has always been very clear that one of the main goals of the Lisbon Treaty is to make the EU stronger on the international stage, and the Commission shares this goal to the full. Maximising the EU’s voice is good for Europe and, I believe, it is also good for the world. It allows us to promote our interests, to uphold our values and to make our contribution to worldwide efforts to address common challenges, from climate change to security, and from a shortage of resources to pulling out of the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">We have opportunities and we have responsibilities, and the Lisbon Treaty has given us the tools to secure our goals in both. As we all know, this is work in progress; at home, we need to learn how to use the Lisbon structures to the best effect. With our partners, we need to show that the EU is a convincing interlocutor. This does not happen overnight, but last week’s European Council was an important stepping stone towards that objective.</p>
<p class="contents">In the nine months since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, we have made important progress. Baroness Ashton is now established as a voice for Europe in the global arena and, with the support of this Parliament, I believe we will soon have the European External Action Service up and running. The EU institutions have gradually taken over the functions of the rotating Presidency for representation and coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council identified the next steps, both on procedure and on substance. In particular, there was recognition that the EU had to do more to achieve a more consistent and coherent policy towards strategic partners. It may start looking specifically at China. It was very important that the European Council will come back to the task of building a common approach on a regular basis. We all know some of the problems faced: that the lack-of-privatisation, Christmas-tree approach suggests to our partners that we cannot really agree on what we really want and that the discordant messages between the EU and the Member States undermine the message.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />We need to reach a position in which, when President Van Rompuy and President Barroso speak for the EU at the summits, they do so with the authority which comes from a genuine consensus – a combined commitment of the EU and the Member States – to a shared agenda. So the Commission believes that it was an important first step to recognise the need to identify specific interests in our relations with each of our strategic partners and, now, to know how to deliver the same, consistent message to our partners worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to start applying this spirit to the key summits this autumn, with China, India, Russia and the United States, as well as for the G20, the Asia-Europe meeting and the EU-Africa summit. All these events need the democratic dimension brought by the interest of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Trade was recognised as a key issue. It was a powerful symbol that, in the margins of the European Council, agreement was finalised on the EU’s far-reaching free trade agreement with Korea. This shows what is possible: an agreement which was not easy but which holds out the prospect of huge commercial benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also agreed that we should find ways, through trade, to help Pakistan. We are already doing a lot in terms of humanitarian aid and development aid, which will be crucial for the reconstruction of this country. But it is also right to say that we should help the long-term prospects of the Pakistan economy through trade measures, and the Commission will be making specific proposals next month.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming French Presidency of the G20 and G8 was also identified as a particularly good opportunity to ensure that European objectives were prominent. The Commission is committed to using this as an important platform for the EU for the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say a few words on two other subjects. On economic governance: the work of the task force chaired by President Van Rompuy and the preparation of detailed proposals by the Commission mean that we have come a long way since May. The Commission will put proposals on the table next week. Now is the right time for us to launch the codecision phase to start detailed examination of legislative proposals with a view to having the new system in place by the middle of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that Parliament is fully conscious of the desirability to start quickly on your examination of these proposals. The package will have three objectives. First, to reinforce Member States’ compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. Second, to broaden economic surveillance to tackle imbalances; and third, to make economic surveillance work better through incentives for compliance and financial sanctions which are progressive, fairly applied and applied early enough to work effectively. These add up to a major reinforcement of the credibility of our economic governance of the euro area in particular. This agenda will be deepened still further when the Task Force makes its final report to the European Council next month.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the issue of the Roma. I simply want to make one point: the Commission has the responsibility here as the guardian of the treaties. We are quite clear about our responsibilities. We will not compromise on respect for Community law and we will defend our European values in full. We have been working to determine whether EU law on free movement and on anti-discrimination has been respected and are now in the phase of legal analysis. Very soon, this analysis will be looked at by the College itself.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not forget what is a very important – I would say an essential – part of this discussion: the alleviation of the plight of the Roma and their better integration. Therefore, at the same time, we are looking at how to follow up on our April proposals to use EU funds to give real help to the integration of the Roma. We have set up a task force to look at how we can take tangible steps to support inclusion. The task force meets for the first time this morning and will present its first findings by the end of this year. I know Parliament will want to be kept informed about progress on a regular basis, and the Commission will do this.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, this European Council discussed how we can reinforce our capacity to act externally and internally and to deliver better results for EU citizens. On all these subjects, the Union’s institutions and instruments have been shown to be working as the treaty intends. The Commission looks forward to cooperating with this Parliament, deepening this work, and assuring the effective delivery of our policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Joseph Daul, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr Buzek, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Šefčovič, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council has discussed the Union’s relations with its global partners and economic governance. Above all, however, public opinion has been interested in the debate on the Roma. I want to repeat the position of my group on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">First, each Member State must respect European law, and the European Commission, the guardian of the treaties, must make sure of this in the most impartial way possible. All the Member States of the Union are equal before the law. That is Europe’s strength. In these conditions, we respect the decision of the Commission to ask for clarifications from France on the measures that it has taken, and we do not doubt that France will respond with the greatest care.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) regrets the linguistic gaps that have emerged because of this affair, and hopes that, on such an emblematic subject, the values of responsibility and solidarity that are conveyed by the European Union, as well as impartiality and mutual respect, will continue to be the code of conduct in relations between the Member States and the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my group once again calls for European solutions – Community solutions – to be defined and implemented in order to integrate all the minorities in Europe, because, as we well know, the current crisis has revealed a deep unrest in relations between these minorities and the populations in their host countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, while all of our fellow citizens must be able to enjoy their rights, they must also observe their obligations. Yes, the movement of people is a right, and this Parliament has argued for it too much to give any of it away today. On the other hand, respecting the law, integrating into your host country, registering your children in school, making sure they attend, and respecting the welfare of others are also obligations from which nothing, absolutely nothing, must be taken away.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the issue, and that is the position of the PPE Group, a position which is founded on principles and values, and which goes beyond the partisan criticism which, I have to say, some have indulged in these last few days.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two minutes left to address two subjects – crucial ones, however – which were discussed at the European Council last Friday: our place in the world and economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first point, how can we accept any longer the fact that, although Europe is one of the principal global powers, perhaps the most respected in its approach to human rights and multilateralism, it no longer holds any weight on the global stage? I repeat: we are the biggest donors to Palestine, but we are not at the negotiating table. Mr Van Rompuy, we have to make sure that this changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s conclusions contain some interesting avenues of exploration, but, as we know, we need a real review of our modus operandi in order to make the quantum leap expected. I am thinking here of the political will to exert influence as a single force, rather than as an aggregation of 27 contradictory diplomacies. That is, the Community method; and on this, Mr Van Rompuy, we are counting on you. This is not a bad word; it is a way of making the European Union powerful and recognised in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking here of our human resources, which must be rationalised, and the external service is a first step in the right direction. Finally, I am thinking of our financial resources, particularly in the areas of security and defence, which must be better spent, and this requires us to make greater efforts to pool resources. We are far from achieving that – very far. I would encourage the Member States, in the coming months, to implement at least some of the objectives contained in these conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">On economic governance, finally, my group is in favour of the initial action taken by the Van Rompuy task force and, in particular, the rigorous application of the rules of the Stability Pact along with the deterrent of sanctions.

There are no problems in the Council. I admit that you were there and I was not. You witnessed the discussion at close hand and I did not. Nevertheless, I had a somewhat different perception of the European Council to the one you have presented here.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that what we witnessed was – at least in two cases – the rebellion of the Heads of Government against the European reality. The four freedoms that have been guaranteed since Maastricht are the free movement of services, capital, goods and people. I have the impression that, in the European Union, we need to attach the same level of importance at least to the free movement of people as we do to the free movement of capital. I sometimes also wish that capital could be dealt with with the same level of intensity as the free movement of people is dealt with in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">However, what we are actually seeing – and you hinted at this, although you did not say it explicitly – is that in this post-Lisbon process in which we currently find ourselves, the institutions are fighting for their positions of power. What we are seeing in the Council is the new institution represented by you, as the European Council consisting of the Heads of State or Government has only existed as an institution since Lisbon. This new institution is trying to secure its position of power. That is not dishonourable; all institutions do the same, but in association with what is happening in the European Council, there is a huge risk that, in the post-Lisbon process, the competences that have been transferred to the EU, the competences that are bestowed upon the Community institutions in the treaty, will be made subject to the approval of the European Council – in my last speech here, I described this as a type of directorial government. That is precisely the wrong way to go about it. You cannot, on the one hand – as you have done – proclaim that we need joint European statements, joint European action and a European united front, for example, in international policy, international diplomacy and international trade, while, on the other, saying: but only when it suits me in terms of my national interests. If it does not fit in with the national interests, if it is not appropriate in terms of domestic policy, then we do not want it. However, that is exactly what is happening right now in the European Union, and, I might add, it is not specific to one particular government. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) has most of the governments; the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament also has governments. All the governments respond in the same way. It is not an ideological response, but an institutional one. This institutional danger spells danger for Europe as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The task of the European Parliament – and this is therefore an appeal to all groups – is to say, with a large majority, that we want what Mr Daul described as the Community method, which is nothing other than the transposition and implementation of joint competences for solving problems, to be applied in a concerted manner at European level. Can anyone here imagine us still being able to solve any sort of monetary policy problem at national level? The answer is ‘no’. Could any climate challenges be solved at national level? No. Could a global trade policy problem be dealt with by an individual Member State alone? Of course, we can have talks with China as the EU – as the EU with a population of 500 million and the force of 27 combined national economies. That is one option. We could also divide ourselves into smaller units with the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Latvia, Cyprus and Malta all acting separately. That is also possible. I do not think that China would be very impressed by that if you went there, Mr Van Rompuy. We therefore need the Community method, and, in my opinion, it is the task of this Parliament to ensure that this Community method is applied. The Commission has shown for the first time in the form of Mr Barroso’s statement in connection with the Roma issue that it is prepared to fight. We will, and indeed must, solve the problem of the Roma. This Parliament will solve it just as we have all said here: human dignity is inviolable. That also applies to complicated minorities. Therefore, we will not let up on the issue of the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our next challenges are coming from somewhere completely different – the Financial Perspective – and I can tell you now that, in this regard, the renationalisation strategy will be met with broad resistance from the whole of the European Parliament.</p>

I therefore agree one hundred percent with people who say: when there are problems in individual cases with individual citizens – regardless of which country they come from – in an EU Member State, that Member State and its authorities are obliged to deal with these problems, and if these problems are criminal in nature, then they are obliged to pursue criminal proceedings in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, that also applies to the enforcement of our common European Union law.

I want to start with the last part of his intervention, on the Roma issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say very clearly and personally to my colleague in the PPE Group, Mr Daul, that the Commission has acted in the right way on the Roma question and we should not criticise it. We have to help the Commission in this fight. I call on the Commission to stick to its point of view, because what we are facing today is a fundamental question.</p>
<p class="contents">Values are as important as market rules in the European Union, and it is important that everybody sees too that the Commission treats every Member State equally – be they small or big Member States. When it comes to values, there is no difference between small and big Member States. They all have to apply the same rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it is true that the European summit has been a little bit hijacked by this issue, but that happens in politics. Certainly, in Europe, matters are often hijacked by the issue of the day. That is naturally a pity because, on the issue of economic governance, we have no time to waste. We cannot afford to face a new economic and financial crisis without these new instruments on economic governance in place.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that a monetary pillar cannot work without an economic pillar. If you look at the spreads today, the spreads between the German interest rates and other interest rates are still very high. We need a package on economic governance on the table as soon as possible, and I hope that the Commission will come forward with this, as it has promised, on 29 September.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, to be credible – because that is the most important thing – this package has to respond to and fulfil three primary conditions. President Van Rompuy, the first condition, which you have always defended, is that this is not only about enforcing fiscal surveillance but also about improving macro-economic surveillance, because that is the lesson of the Greek debt crisis. It is not only about the Stability Pact, it is also about the state of the economy in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The second condition is that the package should contain effective sanctions. I personally think that the best way to do this is, firstly, through progressive sanctions; secondly, there must be a combination of financial penalties and political penalties – not a choice between one or the other but a combination of both; thirdly, in some cases, this can also mean suspending the voting rights of those who are breaking the rules. That is so in normal life and that has to apply also in political life, I should say.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final condition, in my opinion, is that the trigger has to be in the hands of the Commission and the ECB. I believe – and I have said this a few times already – that surveillance by Member States simply does not work. It did not work with the Lisbon Treaty, it did not work with the Stability Pact, and it will not work in the future. We have seen this with Germany and France, who did not apply the Stability Pact in 2005 and simply changed the Stability Pact at that moment. This will happen again in the future, so the trigger has to be in the hands of the Commission. I hope that on 29 September, based also on the work of the task force, a credible package will be on the table both of the Council and of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even the public report makes me think that you and we live in different galaxies. What I expect when Heads of State of the European Union gather in Brussels together with foreign ministers during a continuing and precarious crisis is rather different to what you have presented. However often you preach about the success of this summit, which we are only allowed to call a Council meeting, I would still say that you have not actually achieved anything. Your role in particular, Mr Van Rompuy, as the one to guide the task force to ways out of the economic and financial crisis and to more economic governance in Europe, is something you ought to reflect on.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to hear that the Commission is no longer participating in this game of shifting power and influence to the Member States, but that, even this month, the Commission will be presenting proposals for the shape that common economic governance in Brussels could take. I have the impression that, among other things, your near obsessive concentration on penalty mechanisms, which would not have been possible at all without an amendment of the treaty, has actually only led to the situation that we have today among the Member States where we are agreeing to disagree – but progress towards the goal of ‘more common governance’ is not something that you have to weigh up.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you to stop the pretence, because that is extremely damaging to the perception of European policies in times of crisis. In your role, you have a particular responsibility for the image of European policies. Even if it is a difficult role that you have been lumbered with as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon and its vagaries, my impression is that you will not live up to this claim of making a genuine effort to achieve more common policies.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Roma, I do not agree with the fact that there has been a one-sided apology from Mrs Reding. I am still waiting for the French to explain how they can openly present the Commission with lies these days. I really cannot understand why that is not worthy of an apology.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased – and, for me, this is the best thing to come out of the summit – that Mr Barroso showed support for Mrs Reding. These treaty infringement proceedings must be initiated. They can also be comprehensively initiated. Just to take up the idea that actually guided Mrs Reding: what concerns me is the fact that in times of great uncertainty, of economic crisis, financial crisis and uncertain prospects and increasing poverty in the European Union, Heads of State like Mr Sarkozy and even Mr Berlusconi – I could name others, but these are the leading state-level protagonists in this matter in the European Union – are turning their domestic policy problems and their incompetence into policy during the crisis. They are hiding behind a policy that is returning to a repertoire of racial intolerance and xenophobia.</p>

Firstly, I should like to congratulate the Council on its concentration on improving economic governance in Europe. Secondly, on the Roma, I want to make it clear that we have been pressing very hard to get a very clear legal statement from the guardians of the treaty, the Commission. Until we do, I must say that attacks on the French from some political quarters, just for the sake of it, are not very edifying or very helpful to European unity.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this morning I want to talk about the declaration on Pakistan, a Commonwealth partner of three of the European Union’s Member States and a strategic ally of the Union. We welcome the progress that has now been made to provide emergency aid for Pakistan and we are pleased that the Council agreed that a comprehensive package of measures for Pakistan’s recovery and future development is required.</p>
<p class="contents">Development aid for Pakistan, as elsewhere, is vital, and the new UK coalition government is proud of its commitment to spend 0.7% of GNI on overseas aid by 2013. And yes, Mr Schulz, the coalition government in the UK comprises Conservatives and Liberals – just to make the record complete.</p>
<p class="contents">But aid is only one side of the coin. The long-term future of the developing world rests on the ability of each nation to create a robust, dynamic trading economy. I believe the intention to grant to Pakistan increased market access through the immediate reduction of duties on key imports to the EU is an important step, even though I regret that the policy will need to be time-limited rather than becoming the rule.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the call to establish a major new trade partnership between Europe and Pakistan was a bold proposal by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron, which has been pursued with determination by the coalition’s Trade Minister, Ed Davey. I fear though that the need to take into account industrial sensitivities, referred to in the declaration, will turn a dramatic initiative into something of a timid half measure. Given the plight of the people of Pakistan, such a betrayal would be a disgrace. We in my group will therefore be watching closely to ensure that the ambition of the declaration is not thwarted by any selfish protectionism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the name of universal values, the universal values of human rights, the French Government – but others too – must immediately stop this stigmatisation and these appalling expulsions. Likewise, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left demands that the so-called Returns Directive of June 2008, nicknamed the Directive of Shame, as well as the partnership agreement allowing the expulsion of Pakistani refugees, be repealed.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, which specific European initiatives do you intend to take, Mr Van Rompuy, to finally bring the Roma population out of poverty and misery? This policy against migrants is destroying the moral and political influence which Europe could have in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that anti-European populism demeans politics and encourages xenophobia, nationalism and fundamentalism, impregnating what Bertolt Brecht called ‘the foul beast’. Moreover, at the European Council, you have once again come up with conclusions which are very unfavourable to the European people and to the European idea itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention a few examples. At the very moment when ultraliberalism is pushing the world into crisis, you have decided, and I quote your text, to allow ‘ambitious free trade agreements’. You have decided to accelerate the construction of the transatlantic market: that is, the alignment of our standards with those of the United States and a greater engagement in NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Rompuy, the free tradeism, the submission to the United States and the militarism that you propose will destroy Europe. You mention, in relation to foreign policy, the plan, and I quote, for ‘clear strategic direction’, but what exactly is this about? Should not a good foreign policy involve, as the GUE/NGL Group argues, committing oneself to action against poverty and famine, debt cancellation, establishing food sovereignty, disarmament and peace? Should it not involve energetic action to make sure that the Cancún climate summit is successful?</p>
<p class="contents">Why, even though your text points out that we are the principal commercial area, do we not commit ourselves to taxing financial transactions? What do you intend to do, aside from produce this vapid text, to make sure that the dialogue between Israel and Palestine is successful? I note that you are not talking about the 1967 frontiers, nor of East Jerusalem as the capital, and that you are incredibly benevolent towards Israeli colonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you have decided to apply the iron heel of austerity through what you call the European Semester: surveillance with the threat of sanctions against the Member States. Why do you hide the fact that the Member States’ debt has increased not because of excessive social spending, but because of constant support for the forces of money? Why are there no large industrial, services or agriculture projects, on a new basis and in cooperation, which could encourage employment?</p>

It lies in the inhumane conditions under which the Roma live in most countries in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, therefore, of being judgmental at this point, we should – given that the Roma are an ethnic minority in every country in Europe – pull together and propose a pan-European plan and a pan-European programme for the Roma as part of our action on social exclusion. Deportation is just one aspect of the problem. It is the conditions under which the Roma live that are the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, as far as the conclusions of the European Council are concerned, you have set European foreign relations on the basis of mutual interests. Without doubt, China, which has a reserve of USD 2.5 trillion and is seeking to invest in Europe, offers a very interesting alliance. Do you therefore intend, in the run-up to the EU-China summit, to smooth over the obstacles which Europe has raised in its relations with China, especially human rights and relations with Iran? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It was high time that the European Commission was put in its place in this regard. Member States <span class="italic">do</span> have the right, indeed not just the right but also the duty, to take action against such an unacceptable nuisance, against actual child labour and child neglect and against illegal immigration. They have the duty to protect their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Pretending that the Roma/Gypsies are not a problem is not going to do anything to solve our problems. I would like to know what the European Commission would say if a Roma camp installed itself at the esplanade of the Berlaymont building. The Belgian Presidency of the European Council and also Mr Van Rompuy, the so-called President of the Council, once again kept trotting out meaningless statements, blowing hot and cold and using particularly woolly language, but they were completely spineless in the debate. We have actually got quite used to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only conclude – and I seem to be in a very small minority in coming to this conclusion – that, thanks in particular to France and Italy, the last European Council summit was one of those rare occasions when opposition was expressed to the seizing of power by politically appointed officials of the European Commission.

<p class="contents">There are always different ways of presenting things. One can let oneself be guided by perceptions, or one can let oneself be guided by achievements and facts. I am the type of person who prefers sticking to achievements, realities and facts.</p>
<p class="contents">What have we done, during these first eight months of the year, with a new Commission and new institutions following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon?</p>
<p class="contents">We have succeeded in agreeing on important financial supervision – on an extremely important reform – with Parliament’s cooperation, of course. We have agreed, after long negotiations, on external action, on the External Action Service, a new ministry for foreign affairs, a new diplomatic service for the European Union. These are two extremely important achievements in the context of a complicated institutional architecture, but one which we wanted.</p>
<p class="contents">We have agreed on an important package for helping Greece to survive. We have agreed on a package of EUR 110 billion, combined with an extremely important programme of reform which is now being implemented, despite the major difficulties that are being encountered by the Greek Government. We have agreed on a package of EUR 750 billion of financial support for contingencies – subject to certain conditions, of course – which has appeased the markets and created new perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">On the initiative of the Union, major reforms are being made, and I certainly know that there are objections to them within countries and beyond them. Important reforms are being carried out in quite a few European countries. Without the pressure exercised by the institutions, this would not have happened so quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">On foreign policy, I repeat, following the Security Council, we came to an agreement among the 27 on the sanctions against Iran, on the additional sanctions, which was by no means easy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have agreed on a resolution among the 27 concerning the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo – and, as you well know, five European countries do not recognise Kosovo. This dialogue is extremely important for stability and peace in this area, which is also a European area, and which must have a European perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have agreed on a commercial agreement with South Korea. We have agreed on a package of support – not just financial, but also commercial support – for Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">We have agreed on a global approach for the Middle East. In December 2009, we developed a common position of the 27 on one of the most contested regions in the world, the Middle East. We added a new statement which was adopted by the Quartet a few days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this has been done. These are achievements; these are facts; and I stick to the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the task force: no, we are not working too slowly. We started in May, and we are now in September. In a few months, we have made some big steps forward. Furthermore, we will finish our work not in December, as predicted, but at the end of October. I assure you that I will be able to report here on the qualitatively important conclusions coming out of the task force. There is no problem between us and the Commission. We are working hand in hand to obtain good results. There is no institutional rivalry.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the problem of the Roma, I would repeat the five points, which are not the Council’s conclusions as such, but on which there is a very broad consensus. We are now awaiting the Commission’s inquiry. We must not prejudge it. I would also note that, as was requested at the European Council, the Commission has started work on developing a plan for better integrating certain minorities, including the Roma, into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I will add some words in Dutch, which is a minority language, of course, but we can let it be heard now and then. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> I think that, despite everything, the record of those first few months, in what were extremely difficult circumstances, has been a positive one. We never expected economic growth to pick up so soon. It might be fragile and this might only be the beginning, but if anyone had said a few months ago that one Member State would achieve economic growth of 3.5% and that the European average would be approximately 1.5%, then no one would have believed him.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of countries are setting up reform programmes in extremely difficult political and social circumstances and what we are doing is setting up a new sort of economic governance for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Today – and I say this cautiously – the economic situation, and even the situation in the labour market, is better than it was a few months ago. That has not happened by accident, but we have made it happen by dint of joint effort. However, our work is far from over. In my opinion – and that is the last thing I am going to say – very few European citizens today are that interested in our spats about which method is the best. My own thinking on that point is that, while the Community method might, of course, be the most appropriate method, our citizens are, first and foremost, waiting to see the results of our policy. Above all, they are waiting for a future. If that future is better, then we should make a public pronouncement to that effect, so that European citizens can once again have more confidence in us. That will prove a major contribution, not only to support of the European idea, but also a major contribution to economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">I am someone who sticks to the facts and does not get distracted by subjective impressions. The facts prove that, in the last eight months, we and all our institutions have made progress through joint efforts and that we are heading in the right direction. Our task in the coming months will be to steer a more definite course in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, the issue of the Roma: here again I would like to assure this Parliament that the Commission will pursue its work according to two strands. The first is very thorough, precise legal analyses of the situation and the second is support for Roma integration.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, we have all been calling for a European solution for a long time and the Commission did a great deal of work with the Spanish Presidency. We organised a special ministerial summit on this issue in Córdoba, though we all know that the attendance was not the best.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us therefore use this opportunity, this debate, to reinvigorate the whole process, to restart the thinking on how we can make better use of our resources and instruments in future. It is quite clear that we need European consensus on this issue; we need the support and commitment of European institutions, of national and local authorities, of civil society as well, and we need to pull with all our strength in one direction. Only in this way will we be able to approach a positive solution to the plight of the Roma in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On proposals on economic governance, I would also like to assure the political leaders that our proposals will address the issue of macro-economic imbalances through greater surveillance. We will propose strengthening national fiscal frameworks and reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact, in particular, by focusing on debt reduction and sustainability and by paying more attention to prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">So, altogether, on 29 September, we are going to propose a package of five proposals for a regulation and one for a directive. The priorities mentioned by the political leaders here will be substantially reflected in the package of proposals that will be presented to you very soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Pakistan, I think we did a lot. We became the major international contributor to Pakistan. Our role there is very much recognised, but it is very clear that it represented only the first steps in helping Pakistan. We need to be involved more, we have to be more consistent, and we have to combine humanitarian aid with development aid, with improving trade access to the European market for Pakistan’s products.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have to concentrate on the measures that we can take as quickly as possible, and for that they need to be compatible with WTO rules and we need the support for our WTO partners. We are also looking for ways as to how we can evaluate Pakistan’s eligibility for GSP Plus for 2014. This would then be a measure for the long term that I believe would help Pakistan and would help its speedy and successful recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the Middle East, it is very much recognised in this House, in the Council, in the European Council and in the Commission, that this is absolutely a top political priority on the global political scene. I would like to assure all of you that Baroness Ashton is clearly and very much involved in the process. She regularly briefs the College on how we can cooperate and take even more action in the future, and she is in daily contact with all the principal leaders in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Daul has said, the EU’s role in accelerating this process is essential. I can assure you, on behalf of the Commission – and I am sure on behalf of Lady Ashton – that we will do our best and that we will play an important role in this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first precondition for that to become a reality is to speak with one voice, certainly in light of the forthcoming summits with Asia and President Obama over the coming weeks. When it comes to speaking with one voice, you are the person who can act as the necessary mouthpiece.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, one of the absolute priorities over the coming months will be the climate debate. We, as the European Union, should have the courage to put new initiatives on the table. Here, I am thinking first of all of the common approach to financial transactions known as the Robin Hood approach. You could be the new Robin Hood! That should give you the wherewithal to invest in renewable energy and energy savings, not just in Europe, but in Africa, too, because you know as well as we do that we have committed ourselves to dramatically reducing poverty in Africa. Investment in sustainable energy could be one of the most efficient instruments in achieving that objective. Besides, in Africa, we should not leave the field open only to the Asians, the Chinese.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, you have completed a flawless first lap. One year ago, some people said that they expected very little from you because you were an unknown quantity in their eyes. Today, I think that we could say – and those who wrote you off then share this view – that in recent months, the European Union has made significant advances and that we have weathered the economic and financial storm. I would say: the best is yet to come! Ultimately, that is what we expect of you. Thank you and good luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that we expected a Council on economic governance, but what we actually got was the Roma issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already spoken at length about the incident concerning Mrs Reding, but I would nevertheless like to add something. We support her statements, both in form and in content. With respect to form, I would like to explain what I mean. We cannot consign the Second World War to history, because we will not learn any lessons from it. After all, it should be remembered that gypsies, just like Jews, homosexuals and Communists, were in the camps. They were exterminated.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Reding is right to say that it was from that moment, from that point in time, that we decided in favour of Europe and peace, and never again to discriminate on the grounds of race. That is what we stand by. We support the Commission, we appreciate its role as guardian of the treaties, and we also say, as others have said: ‘the large and the small countries’.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to say to you that, following this Council, seeing the resurgence of nationalism has been an all but terrifying experience for me. It is a persistent echo of the 1930s. We will have to be careful of that tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">On economic governance, very quickly, you said to us, Mr Van Rompuy, that the task force is making progress and we will have conclusions in October. I would say one small thing: you are going to implement supervisory mechanisms in accordance with the most stringent policy of financial orthodoxy, but you said to us: ‘Yes, but social aspects, pensions, and social parameters within that are all matters for the Member States.’</p>
<p class="contents">That is not the opinion of my group. The opinion of my group is that we must think about supervision while introducing social parameters into it. We cannot make a Europe against the citizens. That would also be dangerous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At almost the same time, in the United Nations General Assembly, China and numerous developing countries voted against granting special status to you, Mr Van Rompuy, and also to Baroness Ashton. This ought to be addressed with China at the summit on 6 October and it needs to be discussed in no uncertain terms. However, it demonstrates quite clearly the reality of the situation: the European Union still has a long way to go to achieve political power. We are currently an economic power and, for that reason, citizens expect us to do something in this area to combat the economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the task force. Mr Van Rompuy, you said there was broad consensus. At the end of the month, this consensus will be put to the test. On 29 September, the Commission will present its documents. You have already said that you will present a draft on 27 September. I hope that these will be in line with each other to some extent. Incidentally, I would recommend that you speak Dutch more often; I very much enjoyed your statement on the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards macro-economic surveillance, there is apparently consensus in the task force – great! Monitoring of national fiscal policies within the European Semester – that is a good thing and something that we expressly welcome. As regards the sanctions, you say that more work is needed. We all know what that means: there is no consensus. The test will therefore come at the end of the month.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, as Parliament, do we insist so strongly on the Community method? Mr Schulz has just mentioned this. We are still in the process of weighing up the Lisbon machinery. However, the crucial point is this: the European Council is now a European Union body. What that means in terms of its understanding of itself, we do not yet know exactly. If often appears to us to be a gathering of Member States representing only their national interests. One national interest is very clear: that of the United Kingdom, which is to have as little regulation as possible in the financial sector. The Community method represents our only chance of getting the interests of Europe as a whole to prevail over individual national interests. That is why this House insists on the application of the Community method. In light of your Dutch statements, I am pleased that you view this in the same way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a curious situation where the European Parliament put itself in the place of judge and jury. Then came Commissioner Reding making comparisons with the Second World War, even before the facts were known.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something fundamentally wrong with the European Union when the legislative and executive powers sideline the judicial powers and start passing judgments without knowing the facts of the matter. The Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) had hoped that European institutions would respond to the expulsion with a little more awareness of legal and democratic mores. What is ultimately at the heart of the matter here is the legal question of to what extent EU Member States are allowed to expel EU citizens and the institutional question of who has the right to police this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As the guardian of the treaty, the Commission has taken on the policing mantle, but that authority belongs to the local courts and, ultimately, to the European Court of Justice, the Community courts. The Roma who were voluntarily deported with EUR 300 in their pockets therefore have the option of going to court. Until such time, the European Parliament and the Commission should simply not interfere.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal question is not about expulsion or deportation, but about the limits of hospitality and the extent to which you can accept someone entering your home, tearing the place apart and taking away your possessions. It is crazy that we are in a situation where we obviously have no clear rules laying out how to deal with EU citizens who behave inappropriately in another EU Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The answer to that, of course, is that any Member State should be able to throw out any EU citizens who are out of work, scrounging benefits and who break the law. I hope the Council will pick this up because the European Commission and Parliament are failing to serve the public and the public should not, therefore, count on them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will, of course, see later what tangible results remain. However, as regards the assessment of the economic situation, you somewhat prematurely said – exactly like Mr Barroso – that the economy has recovered to a considerable extent. As long as we do not have the United States on board, we will not bring the economic crisis to an end. It is certainly good that you see progress, and we all hope that this progress will be realised. However, if the claims made by Mrs Lagarde were true – and the discussions have been continuing right up to the last few days – that Germany has improved its competitiveness to the detriment of the other EU Member States, we would not have had this economic growth. Without the driving force, this economic growth following the crisis would not exist. Anyone who applies the brakes to the locomotive providing this driving force will not succeed in ever getting the train to arrive at its destination.</p>
<p class="contents">You did not say anything about the excessive debt or the solution to this debt problem. However, that is important in this regard. It is not enough to introduce the European Semester. It is right and proper for it to be implemented, but without a higher level of automation – and, indeed, based with the Commission, not the Council of finance ministers – we will not be able to implement the stability pact measures that are being discussed.</p>

<p class="contents">Sound public finances are very important, but at any point in time we must get the balance right between potentially conflicting policy objectives. This is being ignored. What is proposed for the 24 million unemployed across Europe? The answer is fiscal consolidation and a gradual reduction in social protection. That is not good enough. We need economic governance that can achieve a balanced policy mix, with sound public finances and high quality full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The two objectives must go hand in hand. The reform of the current system will be a missed opportunity if the policy focus remains solely on balancing budgets and reducing public debt. That strategy is wrong, from both an economic and social standpoint.</p>

<p class="contents">The first regards the rationale behind the development of the External Action Service: I was particularly struck by the fact that, among the appointments made by Baroness Ashton, there is the appointment of a Dutchman in South Africa, a Frenchman in Chad, a Spaniard in Argentina and an Italian in Albania. There are those probably further to the left than me who would have no hesitation in describing these appointments as being based on neocolonialist ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Where is the European approach to the organisation of this service? This is a sincere question, since I believe that we have great ambitions for Europe’s role in the future, and if Europe’s role is merely to satisfy the regional policies of the various Member States, then we are getting it all wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question concerns the Roma issue. Now, it is true that for political reasons, one government or another could be criticised for the solutions it has adopted, but the fundamental problem remains: do we or do we not wish to communitarise the issue of the Roma and the solution that we must find to Roma-related problems, and also communitarise Europe’s efforts to address the epic immigration flow arriving from the South?</p>
<p class="contents">If we fail to answer this question, we will clearly continue to quarrel among ourselves without understanding the genuine difficulties in which our fellow citizens live. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This motto – unity in diversity – must also apply to the Roma. Let us respect the diversity of the Roma and then let us implement the strategy that we have just established. In the 2020 strategy, we have defined the fight against social exclusion and poverty as one of our major objectives. What is the need to go looking for new strategies? Let us implement the one we have just defined. Let us give it the financial resources to succeed and we will have taken a big step where integrating the Roma is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">On economic governance, Mr Van Rompuy, everyone is talking about what a great success establishing a European Semester is. So be it. Up to now, though, I have not fully understood what role the European Parliament would play in this European Semester. If it is simply about organising a debate here – of which we have many – I believe that we will not have fulfilled the objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, let me put something to you. When you came to meet the ministers of employment and social affairs, you heard what they had to say to you. Economic governance which would today turn its back on the objective in terms of employment would not be up to the challenges that we have to face. We are counting on you to establish a form of balanced economic governance; that is, with employment as a priority objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am afraid that the present debate on the EAS will bring exaggerated expectations if this new instrument is not accompanied by more common EU policy. It is just an instrument, not an end in itself. We need more policy convergence and we need to bring the positions of the Member States closer together. I see here a great role for the President of the Council, who brings together the Heads of State or Government, to bring more convergence to the Member States’ positions. The same goes for the European Parliament and national parliaments, in order to bring about more convergence. Then the instrument may work.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need more competent foreign policy, and there is great room for improvement. More competent means more geographically representative for the Union of 27, because competence is not geographically neutral. We can afford richer, better and more competent foreign policy, drawing competence from the experience and wisdom of all 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to define strategic partners. I am afraid that our list of strategic partners is too long, and we put all the important or big ones on the list. For me, the list is too long. We need to define it. It should not be synonymous with important partners. Only those who converge with us on policy – and possibly share values and want to share with us responsibility for global strategic issues – merit being called partners of strategic importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, if we do not defend the principles of European integration, how will we be able to agree on strategies to emerge from the economic crisis?</p>
<p class="contents">The forces on the ground, Mr President, have had their say.

We are in a new world, which is multipolar from an economic point of view and increasingly from a political point of view, with a smaller number of significant players. Moreover, the challenges that we face are global ones. No country can face them alone, including the countries of the EU. As the President of the Commission said a few days ago, in a global world, size does matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be one of those players. I therefore regret the result of the vote in New York last week on strengthening the EU’s position in the United Nations. What happened is very concerning.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it would be very good for careful preparations to be made in future for summits with the other major players. As well as tackling the way that the other players voted on 14 September in New York, they are also needed to tackle important bilateral and multilateral issues. Among other things, we need to govern globalisation, adapting the institutions that were established after the Second World War and strengthening more recent forums such as the G20.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing all these things, I also think that we need to be working in harmony with the United States. We share many values and interests with them, and I trust that sound preparations are being made for the summit on 20 November.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the new instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union’s external action will have more continuity and consistency. However, along with the internal strength of the Union, the political will for joint action by the 27 is also essential, particularly among the most significant Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This process of uniting will inevitably be a long and difficult one. It is necessary, however, if we want to prevent Europe from being irrelevant and prevent what is beginning to be described as the advent of a post-Western era. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU has all the potential to be a great power, as we have been for years in the economic and cultural field. Yet in the political field, we have not yet lived up to our potential, because Europe often remains divided, even when common action would be more efficient. Europe already has a phone number, but it has no real common voice. The CFSP and the ESDP are currently non-visible policies from a political point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether we like it or not, a common voice means that we will need greater foreign policy and defence policy coordination. Common policies like that go right to the heart of the matter of national sovereignty, but what members get in return for parts of their national sovereignty is greater influence in world politics. That is why I welcome President Van Rompuy’s initiative and why I encourage the Council to continue the coordination it began last weekend, and eventually to broaden and deepen it.

This Parliament has been the propelling force behind developing a common European programme for Roma inclusion and, after the announcement of the representatives of several Member States, I sincerely hope that the Council will also support the next EU Presidency in providing a common European solution for a common European problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary cause of the social exclusion of the European Roma is not mainly racism or discrimination, but the interdependence of several historical and economic factors. Therefore, the strategy must define its target audience not by ethnicity but on the basis of its common economic attributes, and must focus on alleviating geographically-concentrated deep poverty that affects Roma and non-Roma alike in certain disadvantaged micro-regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This strategy must permit an EU-coordinated chain of complex development programmes, based on clear and unambiguous indicators like the Laeken indicators, with proper Community monitoring, and taking advantage of multilevel governance. In the short run, the pan-European action plan must prevent the reproduction of deep poverty through generations, and in the medium term, it is necessary to equalise the regional lack of the underdevelopment of micro-regions.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption from the President)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the long run, as I said, the hopeless poverty stricken masses of today must become the equal taxpayers of tomorrow. This will require a sustained, enhanced and shared effort by all the stakeholders, the EU institutions, the Member States, NGOs and also the Roma themselves. Europe cannot afford politics as usual: not at the moment, when the demographic and the social challenges we are facing are so great and the consequences of inaction are so dangerous. We must act quickly and we must act boldly to transform our entire approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As someone who, on behalf of the group, heavily criticised the Commission, Mr Barroso and Mrs Reding for their weak position on the Roma issue last time, I would like to say that I am grateful for the clear position that has since been found. A lot of what was said was perhaps not always very carefully considered. In the fury and anger over the fact that the wool had been pulled over our eyes, Mrs Reding perhaps did not always make the right choice of words. However, we fully and wholeheartedly support the substance of the Commission’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to direct three questions to Mr Van Rompuy. I appreciate your good intentions, but there are three things that I am not clear about.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, you said that you are now able to speak with the Chinese Prime Minister on behalf of the 27. However, what will you say to him? What is the common line in respect of China? I have not been able to find this in the minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you said that you will develop foreign policy strategies. In this connection, you made absolutely no mention of the Commission, or indeed of Parliament. However, for foreign policy strategies, particularly trade-related strategies, you also need this Parliament. Will you involve Parliament in the development of the foreign policy strategies, and if so, how?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, carrying on from what Mr Graf Lambsdorff said, I agree with him: we cannot accept the UN’s decision. We cannot once again – in this case, too – be the ones footing the bill, but not be allowed to have our say or speak before the UN. What went wrong there, and what are you going to do – including as the Council and with the Heads of Government – so that we finally come into our own and can present ourselves and speak at the United Nations as the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, let us not forget that the current problem facing Europe’s citizens is the economic situation. I am pleased that an agreement has been reached on a European Semester, but unless the European Commission is provided with an implementation mechanism which will also include sanctions, this agreement is useless.</p>
<p class="contents">Sanctions are needed, but they must not allow citizens to be punished twice: once through ineffective governance and a second time through reducing the support from the European Union. The measures proposed must help prevent deficits and ending up in a situation which will already have an adverse impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Roma issue, all European citizens are obliged to abide by the law. All Member States are obliged to abide by European legislation. Anyone who fails to do this, be they individual citizens or a Member State, must face the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the current case, I believe that punishing citizens – or Member States – does not resolve the fundamental problem. The Roma’s situation can only be resolved by a European policy. I firmly believe that all Member States, whether countries of origin or transit, can produce a list of different measures for supporting Roma integration. I think that a European policy means a single list of measures and programmes which will be applied identically and simultaneously in all Member States. I also believe that the implementation of this idea does not require more responsibilities or more money, but simply political will. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is important because we need to be more ambitious when it comes to sanctions, but also – and, to me, that is even more important – when it comes to how the Council will ultimately deal with the European Commission’s recommendations concerning various national plans. Should these plans prove insufficient and should the European Commission come up with recommendations, will the Council then be prepared to act on those recommendations, one by one? Even if those recommendations are addressed to Paris and London? That is ultimately what counts, because that would undermine the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore be curious to know your thoughts on that score because, in this case, the Council will ultimately have to conform to the European Commission’s independent role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not for the first time, the Council meeting was dominated by a matter which, officially, had not been anticipated. This time it was about the removal of Roma people from a certain European Union Member State. This confirms earlier fears that, following adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union’s Member States would continue to be occupied with problems of an internal nature rather than external relations. The directions of foreign policy which were outlined during the Council meeting do not go beyond defining the strategic interests and objectives of the Union and the use of assertive methods.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council announced that it wants to give new momentum to transatlantic relations. It is to be hoped that during the summit planned for November this year, which will be attended by US President Barack Obama, the current anti-American phobia will be replaced by a pragmatic settling of common interests. One of these should be the question of finally lifting visa requirements for all Member States of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, on the other hand, I must say that I am rather disappointed by the fact that almost all the attention has gone to budgetary discipline and that the issues were not discussed more comprehensively.

It wants to be the greatest power in the world and puts itself forward as the great defender of human rights, but some governments, like the French, carry out hateful actions that smack of state-sponsored racism and xenophobia, as they have done against the Roma. Meanwhile, as regards capital, they delay adopting measures that would prevent its free movement and speculation, and only worry about threatening states that are unable to fulfil the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact. As regards the people, the mass expulsion of European citizens is designed to hide the utter disaster of neoliberal policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the solidarity that the European Union must offer to the flood victims in Pakistan and to increasing support for cooperation must not be given at the expense of vulnerable industries in countries and regions facing serious difficulties and where unemployment is already high, as is the case of the textile and clothing industry in Portugal. It is time, therefore, to change policies and prioritise the fight against poverty. It is time to focus on production, on the creation of jobs with rights and on social progress. In that way, we can give some real content to the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maroš Šefčovič, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, you have been very generous in allocating me the time. I shall try to be very brief and just react to the four major topics that have been discussed here this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I think we can clearly see that there is strong support for the new strategic approach towards our key partners, that we need to make much better use of the Lisbon framework and that we need to make better use of EU positions and the projections of EU powers in foreign policy. We can achieve this by making better use of foreign policy synergy and we need to work on Member States and the European institutions singing from one hymn sheet with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appreciate highly the importance President Van Rompuy placed on ownership of EU foreign policy, not only by the institutions, but also by the leaders of the Member States, because only in that way, when we speak with one voice, not only multilaterally but also in our bilateral contacts, will we achieve the necessary results.</p>
<p class="contents">A couple of words on economic governance. Here again, I see strong support in Parliament for maintaining the momentum of the change we started this spring. There is very clear support for building up a new and better system and I would like to assure the honourable Members of this Parliament that we are not going to look critically only at budget deficit. We are also going to take a very close look at the issue of debt – how to manage it better and how to monitor it better in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament will have the chance to discuss this issue annually because Commissioners will be coming every January for the annual growth survey which will start the so-called European Semester, and where you will see the complex picture of the European economy and the economic state of the different Member States. This will be a very welcome opportunity to have a deeper debate on this issue at the beginning of every year.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would like to assure you that we have not forgotten the importance of growth and employment. For that, we need to use the EU 2020 strategy tools, because we would like to set the European economy on new bases, on new wheels, and we want to pursue the smart inclusive green – meaning healthy – growth of the European economy. Therefore, we need to focus more on employment, on better education, on high quality youth policies and, of course, on the reduction of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">These two strengths – better surveillance and smarter economic policies – must go hand in hand, because only in that way will we achieve the necessary results. So if the Commission is for something, it is for smart consolidation.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the External Action Service, I think that Baroness Ashton made it very clear that she is fully committed to building a professional European External Action Service which will reflect European values, strength and also the European landscape. Therefore, geographic and gender balance, as well as an agreed balance among the sources for the European External Action Service from our institutions and Member States, as has been agreed, are very important in building up the new professional staff of the European External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">Cathy Ashton undertook to inform you regularly about progress in building up the service. I believe that the progress achieved in the transitional period to 2013 will answer present concerns, which I fully understand.</p>
<p class="contents">For my last point, let me thank you all for your insistence on respecting European law, cherishing European values and undertaking to look for better ways to alleviate the plight of the Roma people and for their integration. More than EUR 17.5 billion have been allocated to measures benefiting Roma and other vulnerable groups by the Commission and 12 Member States, mostly from the European Social Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we have to look at how we use our means and the instruments which are at our disposal. I would call for these to be used more efficiently. For that, we will need to take a new fresh look at how to do this in the future. If we do this together, it will definitely be much more efficient, and will bring much better results than in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herman Van Rompuy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the European Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, first of all, thank you to all the speakers in the debate. I know that it is a difficult task to respond, but I know that it is also a very hard task to synthesise, in one minute, the points of view that we want to develop. I will therefore not be able to reply to all of the remarks. I would like to make a few comments on just two important topics.</p>
<p class="contents">The first topic is foreign policy. We have travelled a long road. We have had the important work of Mr Solana. We forget it too often. I have given you a list, just for the last few months, of the common positions that we were able to develop, with the European Union, on Iran, on the Middle East and on certain trade matters.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we also took a step forward, particularly with respect to our position at the G20, the biggest annual global conference. When I came in as a Prime Minister at the European Council, there were still, a year ago, separate meetings of all the Member States which were part of the G20. They would establish a common position among themselves. I asked, demanded in fact – as we have done since then – that there should be a common position of the 27. Even if not all the countries are present at the G20, Mr Barroso and I represent the Union as a Union, and we therefore have a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that, during the G8 and G20 meetings, the Member States and the representatives of the Union carry the same message. We also sometimes have positive things and progress, and I would like to stress that, in this respect, there have been such things. I am talking here about the biggest international global conference, the G20.</p>
<p class="contents">Are there still problems? Of course! Furthermore, we are still suffering from the effects of the Copenhagen trauma. We had a common position. We had a common message. However, we did not succeed in imposing this, in getting the others to accept our position. The result: everyone loses, because the results are totally unsatisfactory. So, on various points, progress has been made, but we must work more in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">People have asked me: what will your messages be during the summit with China? I would invite you to read attentively – not in a superficial, but in an attentive way – what was contained in the European Council conclusions. I advise you to do so. Of course, we will not say in the European Council conclusions what strategy we will develop and what balances we will present to our strategic partners, such as our Chinese partners. However, if you read the text, you will notice that there are actually new emphases, and that we will introduce the notion of reciprocity. It is not just us who are reacting in relation to the message of others. We have become ‘askers’ in our relations with a good many of our partners, and so we need this concept of reciprocity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is involved – even more so since the Treaty of Lisbon – in trade agreements, and completes colegislation with regard to international agreements and international trade agreements. So there is also progress, but we must have more of it. The summit with the US President will be prepared at the October Council. We will agree on the messages that Mr Barroso and I will give to the US President. We will agree in order to be able to speak on behalf of the Union, on behalf of the 27. So, once again, we will go in the right direction, step by step.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation concerns economic policy. In these last two years, we have followed an intelligent economic policy, much more intelligent than in the past. We wasted 10 years. We could have acted in time on the budget and on competitiveness, but we did not do so. It is precisely because of this that we have problems today.</p>
<p class="contents">What have we done since the financial crisis? Apart from saving the banks and others, we ran a very risky expansionist policy in 2008 and, in large part, in 2009. It was a risky policy because it added to budget deficits. However, since we have had an upturn in growth – which we believed to be slow at the start of the year – we have initiated a policy of budgetary consolidation, of gradually reducing budget deficits, not immediately, but gradually.</p>
<p class="contents">Even this year, we still have a slightly expansionist effect. We have followed an intelligent monetary policy. The markets have always been liquid, so there have been no ruptures of liquidities as in the 1930s. We have followed an interest rate policy where the rates are low enough to ensure that the recovery can take place and that the Member States’ budgets do not suffer too much from very high interest rates.</p>
<p class="contents">On budgetary and monetary matters, we have followed a prudent, wise and gradual policy. Why? Not for the pleasure of proceeding – as we are going to do now – with serious budget cuts, not for the pleasure of reducing the debt, but to have lasting economic growth, to have an employment policy which bears fruit. All of these efforts are to bring about employment, to reduce unemployment. There is an eminent social aim in all the efforts that we are making. We are not doing it for the pleasure of reducing debts and deficits. This is only an instrument: the objective, of course, is employment and the reduction of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Vice-President of the Commission has just said, in order to do all of this in a more social manner, we have integrated the objective of poverty into our objectives for 2020. We had to fight to obtain it. We have integrated an education policy and we are maintaining a cohesion policy. We are maintaining the structural funds, and I hope that we will also maintain them in the financial perspective that we develop, so that living standards can be as balanced as possible within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal behind all our actions is therefore an eminently social one; all the rest is only instruments. I wanted to say this to you at the end of this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the only way to understand the insistence on liberalisation and deregulation of world trade both within the World Trade Organisation – with the call to conclude the Doha round – and in new bilateral agreements. That creates a situation in which even greater pressure can be put on the most vulnerable productive systems and on the workforce, cheapening it. The result is more unemployment and less job security. The Council thinks it is time to reap the benefits of the Treaty of Lisbon and to ‘promote Europe’s interests and values in the wider world’. The road ahead has been clearly laid out: greater alignment with NATO and the United States, growing external interventionism, and a worrying military build-up in international relations. As for the ‘financial supervision package’ mentioned in the conclusions, the message is clear: the main financial speculation mechanisms remain untouchable. Speculation will continue to have free rein, as it has had until now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe is in need of a comprehensive strategy to facilitate the social integration of the Roma. The expulsion of Roma from France immediately brought into focus the problems of the largest minority group on the continent, making it a European issue. I trust that the disturbing events of the past few weeks will add momentum to joint actions. The decisions made at the EU summit last week bring hope. The European Parliament has been pressing for the development of a European Roma strategy for quite some time now. Such a strategy would prevent Member States from passing the responsibility for rectifying the situation of this community to one another. I am curious to see what the Hungarian Government, as the next Presidency of the European Union, will do to move forward with this strategy. I do hope that the European Commission will complete its investigation of the legality of the French Government’s measures very quickly and, if necessary, take prompt legal steps to eliminate practices which violate the fundamental rights of the European Union. I find it unacceptable that the French Government, a representative of one of the founding Member States of the European Union, has so far ignored the European Parliament’s opinion and the warnings of the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need a new financial supervision architecture for Europe. Reaching consensus on the macro-economic surveillance framework is a crucial step in the long-term prevention of future crises. However, the Commission has a decisive fight ahead to counter the still prevailing short-term approach of first trying to restore economic growth and considering budgetary discipline not that important in the foreseeable future. All Member States need to realise that budgetary discipline (a balanced budget) is the only precondition for reliable macro-economic stability. Therefore, the new EU rules and control mechanisms will help Member States in restoring self-discipline. Also, long-term crisis prevention needs robust structural reforms. Are the Member States ready for this effort? I welcome President Van Rompuy’s concept of reciprocity in EU relations with its strategic partners. Such an approach means balancing what the EU wants and values and what our partners would like to get from us. At present, up to 56 different dialogue sectors are numbered in EU-China relations. To overcome such a grotesque situation, political will giving preference to common policies over bilateralism is needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without trying to play down the gravity of these problems, I consider that this approach to issues based on cyclical crises or situations is superficial and ineffective. Admittedly, the positions on this issue were balanced and geared towards finding solutions. However, in order to overcome the problems linked to the Roma communities living in the European Union, long-term measures with vision are required, not merely EU level summits. Putting this difficulty to one side, I must say how pleased I am that Europe’s institutions have realised that in this debate, they will be playing their active role as guardians of the treaties and EU law, which is one and the same for all citizens of the European Union, regardless of the Member State they come from and their ethnic origin.

Europe’s new economic governance, however, must take into account not only the level of government debt, but also its sustainability in the medium to long term. Private debt and the sustainability of social security systems are just as important as government debt as such for the stability of public finances. Indeed, countries which had controlled government debt have plunged into a deep crisis precisely because of the serious indebtedness of families and companies, while countries with high government debt, such as Italy, have come through well. Sovereign debt must be placed under control by means of obligations and more incisive and effective monitoring. We do not need, however, new mechanisms to tackle debt that are excessively automatic and pro-cyclical, which risk failing to meet the objective and, if anything, hindering actions to boost economic growth. We do not need sanctions when we are still trying to prevent overruns: it would be almost like passing sentence before the trial.

There are currently 84 million European citizens, 16% of the EU’s population, who are exposed to the risk of poverty. Against the background of the economic and financial crisis, the main concern that European citizens have is about losing their jobs. At this juncture, the European Council should examine the main challenges facing the EU and identify solutions and priority areas where the European Union will invest in order to retain its global competitiveness and ensure a minimum employment rate of 70%. I believe that areas such as energy security and efficiency, investments, innovation and climate change should be on the European Council’s agenda. I welcome the fact that, during the European Council in October, the EU will reaffirm its strong commitment to the battle against climate change and will agree on the EU’s position for the Cancún conference. Free movement of persons is one of the EU’s fundamental principles, also advocated by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Consequently, we ask the European Council, Member States and the Commission to respect EU law and its enforcement. As a reaffirmation of the importance of the Eastern Partnership in promoting EU values, I call for an EU Black Sea strategy to be devised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It stressed the need for a pan-European approach in dealing with the Roma problem. It also proved that the pervasive clichés of the left will only serve to leave unsolved or to even aggravate this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Three main ideas emerged form this robust debate: 1) the Roma problem is not owned by one Member State or another. It is a European phenomenon that requires coordinated European policies; 2) the right to free movement should not amount to the limitation of the right to security; 3) minority rights should not preclude legal responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council debate has proved wrong the assumption that Romania and Bulgaria are not pursuing integration programmes for the Roma. Finally, the Council position was a clear rejection of the suggestions that linked the Roma question to the Schengen accession of Romania and Bulgaria. I am convinced that France and Romania will maintain a high level of cooperation and set a model in the field. The Roma question was systematically distorted and used for political reasons. This sad precedent should be replaced by appropriate and energetic policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need, at long last, to strengthen the economic and monetary union and, in so doing, learn the necessary lessons from the economic crisis – in other words, we need to strictly implement the Stability Pact and precisely define the financial transaction tax. However, this must not be at our citizens’ expense. The new European External Action Service could be a significant achievement for the European Union, provided the basic idea behind its enshrinement in the treaties can be put into practice. We must look for, find and use existing synergies in order for Europe to be able to act as a unit on the world stage – and this will certainly also significantly increase the EU’s influence in the world. With regard to the climate, we can see that here, too, it is important to learn the necessary lessons and to prepare accordingly for the summit in Cancún. Human rights violations must not be tolerated in the EU. Human dignity must remain sacrosanct – populism in any form inevitably leads to nationalism and this is in no way conducive to the European ideal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a collection of texts which introduces a particularly important reform in the Union and which responds to several challenges. The first challenge – the President of the Council has just spoken about it – is the response to the crisis. The decade which is just coming to a close has seen the introduction and deployment of the Lamfalussy architecture in all the financial sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The committees of supervisors have, in some way, begun to make their presence felt. They have contributed to the development of European financial legislation and to a process of progressive convergence of prudential supervision. This process was an important and positive first step towards a European approach, but, in the light of the crisis, we really must say that this process did not, in the end, turn out to be ambitious enough.</p>
<p class="contents">It did not allow us to prevent or contain the financial crisis or to coordinate rapid and efficient responses on the ground, particularly relating to cross-border cooperation. It is for this reason that we are aiming to create an operational European Systemic Risk Board, with all the administrative support of the European Central Bank, which, under the leadership of its president, is more than ready to work on the implementation and introduction of this board.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not doubt that Mr Trichet will bring all his competence and authority to it, including in following up potential warnings or recommendations made under his Presidency. It is for this same end that we also want stronger, more responsive and much better equipped supervisory authorities to prepare the Community technical standards and ensure their full implementation, including in times of crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">In the event that a national supervisory authority fails to act, these authorities will have the legal means to make financial establishments conform to the standards. They will help establish a true European supervisory area, which is indispensable for strengthening the internal market. They will thus be involved in the functioning of the colleges of supervisors and will help resolve any disputes between the national authorities while, of course, allowing them to conduct prudential everyday supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">Have no fear of words; the introduction of these authorities is an historic agreement, as some have already mentioned many times in this Chamber. The Belgian Presidency made this its main priority in the area of financial markets, but also in a global manner. Let us make no mistake: in this way, we are continuing to build an original supervision model – I will come back to this – but we must also take account of the evolution of the supervision structures of our main partners. This is the second challenge: to show that the European Union of 27 is capable of reforming its financial supervision structures without allowing itself to be left behind by the United States in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">With the de Larosière report in February 2009, which the European Council welcomed very warmly, incidentally, the debate in Europe moved in promising directions, but we had to make these hopes of reform succeed. The United States has meanwhile undertaken a large-scale revision of its supervision with the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act. In voting today, I hope, in favour of the legislative package, which is the fruit of a year’s investigation, negotiations and cooperation between the different institutions, the European Parliament will show that the European Union is not being left behind, and that it is also a leader in the reform process supported at the G20.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we can only be a true leader in the long term. Today’s historic vote aside, we will have to ensure that our new system keeps going and evolves. This is the third challenge. What we are aiming at, firstly, is a model of micro-prudential supervision which is largely decentralised, where the authorities support and coordinate the national supervisors without taking their place.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what we also want is a system which becomes ever stronger, not one which stands still. With the European Systemic Risk Board, we will introduce an essential organ of debate and macro-economic decision making, including at a transatlantic or even a global level.</p>
<p class="contents">With the European supervisory authorities, we will have effective actors of risk prevention and treatment if we give them the powers to carry out their actions. This is partly the case with the Omnibus I Directive, on which Parliament is being asked to give its opinion today. However, other legislative measures will have to follow as part of the revision of existing texts.</p>
<p class="contents">It is on this point, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that I would like to conclude. Today, we are coming to the end of a crucial first step and, while hoping for a positive result from your vote just now, I would like, in particular, to thank the Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Bowles, the various Parliamentary rapporteurs, Mrs Goulard, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, Mr Skinner, Mr Giegold, Mr Sánchez Presedo and their shadow rapporteurs, as well as Commissioners Rehn and Barnier, who are present in this Chamber, and, of course, all their collaborators too. There have been fruitful exchanges – and, I think, constructive ones – between us on the package of amended texts put to the vote today.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I hope that the will to achieve results which has inspired us will continue to lead the negotiations on future texts to complete and modernise this system further. I think I can say, on behalf of those who will succeed me as President-in-Office of the Council over the next few months, and in view of recent negotiations, that I am confident that this will be the case. I hope that we will be able to come here soon with new agreements – particularly regarding investment funds – and that together, we will be able, with Commissioner Barnier, to support a whole range of actions to implement new legislative texts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the European Union has reacted at international level. It initiated the G20 process launched at the Washington Summit in November 2008. The working group led by Mr de Larosière learnt the first major lesson from this crisis and immediately afterwards, the Commission drew up its proposals. Allow me to pay tribute to Mr de Larosière’s intelligent work, to which we owe a great deal at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">With this agreement, we will have, if you wish, a framework in which, from now on, all initiatives will be situated, product by product, market by market, player by player, to implement what we committed ourselves to and what I committed myself to when I spoke to you on 13 January: intelligent regulation and effective supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">This framework that we will adopt is the foundation which gives credibility to all the sector-based initiatives that we want to take. We owe this agreement to the personal commitment and competence many of you have shown. Allow me, in turn, to thank your rapporteurs, Mr García-Margallo, Mr Skinner, Mr Sánchez Presedo, Mrs Goulard, Mr Giegold, Mr Tremosa i Balcells and Mr Balz, as well as the shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank Mrs Bowles, who led this negotiation with great determination. I would like to thank the President of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN), Mr Reynders, for the proactive role he played with his teams – which was decisive – building on the good work that the Spanish and Swedish Presidencies had done before him.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me in a rather unusual manner perhaps – I will tell you why – to say a word of thanks on behalf of the European Commission to the person beside me, Mr Wright, because in a few days, he will step down as Deputy Director-General for the Internal Market and Services. I would like to say that I believe that this man is a credit to European public service.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the value added by Parliament is undeniable. It was decisive. In particular, I am thinking of the strengthening of the competences of the European supervisory authorities: mediation, emergency measures, drafting of legal and technical standards with a consumer protection role – which we will come back to – along with prevention of, and protection from, certain toxic financial products and the cross-border nature of the institutions which will be taken into account to a greater degree.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) for which we owe much to Parliament, in particular, as regards its Presidency, and here, I would also like to thank my colleague and friend, Mr Rehn, and his staff.</p>
<p class="contents">All of that is, of course, a compromise. Some would have liked to go much further. On many issues, the Commission itself has made dynamic compromises and concessions. We regret, for example, the solution ultimately accepted concerning the drafting process for technical standards, which, in our view, must not serve as a precedent for other sectors, and what is more, I will confirm this in a statement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on the whole, after the unanimous vote of the Council, after your vote today if you want it, from the beginning of next year, Europe will rely on a supervision model adapted to its needs and the reality of its financial industry. In most European countries, most of the banks belong to another country. This is what defines the transnational dimension, both of the financial establishments and the risks that they can bear.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have a supervision model that is adapted to prevent crises more effectively. We will be able to show citizens who are concerned and who wonder whether Europe has reacted that it is drawing concrete lessons from the crisis and that it is doing this at the same time as the Americans, and hopefully other continents, in the framework of the decisions of the G20.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the authorities, there is a huge amount of technical and budgetary work ahead of us – ahead of me – that we are committed to, so that the authorities effectively see the light of day on 1 January 2011. With the agreement of the European Parliament, we will have to appoint the future presidents and director-generals of these authorities. I would like to say before you that the only criterion that will govern these appointments must be that of independence and competence to make these new authorities succeed, and I am confident that the future President of the ESRB who, thanks to you, is the President of the European Central Bank, will have this concern for independence and this competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, ladies and gentlemen, we will determinedly fill the framework that we have on 1 January. The European Securities and Markets Authority will quickly gain power thanks to the role reserved for it in decisions that are taken or that will be taken: the proposal to put the supervision of credit rating agencies at European level, the draft regulations on over-the-counter derivatives and short-selling, and then the Credit Default Swaps, adopted just a few days ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not stop there. This is a whole integrated programme to consolidate and stabilise our financial system and make it more transparent that we will follow with you, step by step: the regulation of the hedge fund and private equity sector that we are working on at this very moment; the implementation of the Basel III Accord on bank capital; the review next year of the directive on financial markets; the strengthening of sanctions within the framework of the revision of the directive on market abuse; and the introduction of a European framework for crisis management and resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these measures must allow us to avoid the repeat of serious crises, to protect consumers, who are also taxpayers, and feed the sustainable and fair growth we are calling for.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have always thought that in the area of financial sectors, as in the area of the environment, prevention is always cheaper than cure. I would like to remind you that during this financial crisis, in one way or another, we mobilised 17% of European GDP to save the financial system. It is the banks that must pay for the banks, not taxpayers. Prevention will always be cheaper than cure.</p>
<p class="contents">We will present all of these measures in the framework of the agenda adopted by the Commission and supported by the ECOFIN Council on 2 June and our aim is for them to be implemented and presented with determination, voted for if you wish, in any case, adopted and proposed by the Commission, by the end of 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, I would like to say on a personal level that the quality of relations that we have had and the confidence without complacency that has driven our debates are, to me, an encouraging sign for the whole of this very rigorous and demanding agenda. On behalf of all the services of the Commission, I would like to thank you for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In December, we had a poor agreement and now, thanks to the cooperation between Parliament, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, we have a good agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good agreement that is going to establish genuinely European authorities that are strong and subject to the democratic control of Parliament: authorities that are going to be designed to ensure that all the banks are subject to the same rules across the European Union. They will be able to impose their decisions on the national supervisory bodies and, if they do not comply with them, on the private banks, in order to protect families and businesses. This will enable them to combat the banks that could cause systemic risks and prevent taxpayers from having to pay once again for the irrational exuberance of some financial institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson that we can learn from this debate is that Parliament is not like a dog whose bark is worse than his bite that will back down at the slightest gesture from the Council: it holds firmly to its positions. Nor is it a dog in the manger: it is a good ally of the Council and the Commission for moving forward in the process of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to my fellow Members, Commissioner Barnier and Mr Reynders, we now have an excellent agreement on which we should congratulate ourselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank David Wright very much for his activity, as well as my colleagues around the room. We have been quite successful.</p>
<p class="contents">However, you are either captured by the moment or you capture it. A financial crisis has given life to new agencies, which are much needed and very welcome at this time across the European Union and perhaps even across the globe, but the power invested in these institutions also has to be a responsible power. Ambition, therefore, must have a purpose, in order for there to be any fulfilment, and that purpose must be shared by our citizens whose jobs and livelihoods depend upon us getting it right.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the discussion between Member States and Parliament has often led to tensions during this debate, but none of us have completely got our way and all of us have been successful in delivering what will, I believe, be a success.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has pushed for greater powers at European level. Of course, this has been against the background of being against the wishes of Member States. Some in this House will want to go further in creating direct supervision, particularly in the area of central counterparties, for example. We all have to caution against adventure over ambition, but let us have proper measured responses when we get to fill in the blanks which will come later.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial stability at this time depends upon the years – and sometimes decades – of experience of thousands of nationally-based people who have experience of financial services. They have been the first front line in preventing problems. The national governments have proved that they can also bail us out when it comes to meltdown. However, this has been about fortune rather than design. These new institutions give us the chance to have design. That is what has been missing and that is why it is so important to have it fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">The agencies do have practical issues involved. We will have a joint committee, which I have been very proud to help champion. The joint committee should be a vehicle for coordination, exchange of information and joint decision taking. It will be the platform for focusing; these agencies work on eliminating systemic risks. We have also insisted on giving the Head of the ECB control over monitoring risk at the aggregate level, but if we have to ask Mr Bernanke whether his reputation was enhanced, I think he might say ‘No’ about having such powers.</p>
<p class="contents">So, avoiding the casino-style financial operations of the past – yes – but being responsible ourselves as regulators, we have to be very measured as well. There should be regulatory ambition, but this is also about people’s pensions, their savings, their houses and their jobs. I welcome the supervisory infrastructure that we have. It is young, but it will have to grow up very quickly indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a good day, and it proves false all of the claims that, following the financial crisis, nothing would happen. It also proves wrong all those who believe that a new phase of renationalisation is now starting. Instead, Europe is drawing the necessary conclusions. However, it must be made quite clear that this financial market legislation naturally still contains things that must now continue to happen. Parliament has achieved and secured something important. This has already been mentioned. We succeeded because the various forces here in this House worked together and, in so doing, resisted the attempts by many Member States not to take heed of the lessons that can be learned from the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Some important questions still remain unanswered, for example: how many members of staff will these authorities be given? What would be the point of having these authorities with these new competences if they are not provided with sufficient staff and an adequate budget? What we have heard in this regard is still not clear; we need to work together on this. The next question is: what is going to happen as regards the president of this financial market authority? This is another area where we need to ensure that the right people are appointed. For us as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, an important step was our desire finally to have transparency with regard to the relevant accounting requirements of the large transnational undertakings. In this regard, the Commission has, thankfully, now announced that there will be a communication with regard to the country-by-country reporting. We look forward to this. In this connection, we also look forward to working together.</p>
<p class="contents">At long last, we have a joint declaration from four coordinators in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to the effect that we want the market infrastructures and also the central counterparties to be placed under direct European supervision. There is still more to be argued out here in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, on the issue of economic governance, we will get the same level of coherence here in this House as we did on this issue of supervision. Otherwise, Parliament will lose its influence on these issues. We must not allow any re-ideologisation of the debate in this regard. If we do, then the Council will, unfortunately, not take sound decisions according to the Community method. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The banks, the financial markets, governments and corporations are feeling this uncertainty daily, and in order for our economies to show signs of recovery, we need to ensure that this uncertainty is dispelled. One of the main uncertainties since the spectacular failures in the financial sector has been uncertainty regarding regulation, including who will do the future regulating and which institutions will enforce them.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has been instrumental in debating this issue and has, over the past few months, discussed the minutiae of regulation and supervision in terms of who, what, where and when. The result delivers balance: balance between Member States’ responsibility for supervising institutions and a new European authority setting a common rule book, thereby progressing the single market in financial services whilst elevating the role of peer oversight; balance between safety in the system as monitored by the new ESRB and the need for financial companies to take risks; balance between ultimate protection of the taxpayer and provision of capital to fuel the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We all have a strong interest in establishing new mechanisms to underpin the single market in financial services, including: the monitoring of global risk at our European Banks; ensuring a coordinated and ordered procedure across all Member States in a crisis; ensuring stronger arrangements for mediation between supervisors; and ensuring the enforcement of the rules in all financial centres and by all financial players.</p>
<p class="contents">This supervisory package as it now stands delivers the balance required. However, the recruitment of high calibre, financially competent staff will be critical to its future success.

It is a tremendous achievement by the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs to have managed to do what they have done. They achieved the best result that it was possible to negotiate.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I do not want to hold back on the criticism that my group has, either. There are three points in particular that we are not happy about. On the one hand, the competences that have been granted to the supervisory authorities are, in our view, inadequate. We would have liked these competences to have been more extensive. We believe it is also wrong for the supervisory authorities to be split over several locations. We advocated combining them as far as possible in one location. That would certainly have made cooperation easier and more efficient. Mr Giegold has already mentioned that the staffing could, and should in fact, be improved in the long term. These are our main points of criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we believe this to be a right and important step in the right direction, a right and important step towards a new regulation of the financial markets that is urgently needed. However – and this is simply our assessment – we still need to take some further steps in order to arrive at a truly effective new regulation of the financial markets, to get to a point where, through European regulations, we can prevent another crisis like the one we have just experienced. Our group will contribute greatly to this. There are, of course, a few more legislative initiatives on the way. We hope that these will bring more substance to this matter. If so, something truly effective and good could come of this. However, we really do still have a few more steps to take in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very important to the United Kingdom. Indeed, it picks up most of the tabs. The GBP 45 million a day we send to this place to support the rather suspicious European Union project, which has not given any of our electorate an actual say, is one of those tabs. In fact, you must understand that big salaries and big pensions do not grow on trees.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I also mentioned to you that we could learn something from the old dominions – Australia, Canada – who have not suffered from this problem, and you rather charmingly, and in a very Gallic way, suggested that Australia was a long way away. I hope, now that you have been in office for a little while, you will understand that perhaps such a parochial approach will not do.</p>
<p class="contents">I still worry, Commissioner. I still fret that we will have regulation from the usual mishmash of ignorant bureaucrats, parliamentary committees with their usual complement of cryptocommunists, anachronistic socialists, journeymen politicians, fringe greenies, a sprinkling of well-meaning housewives, and grandmothers exploring their new third age. The outcome will be the same as all the other EU projects: fishing, agriculture, energy, employment, immigration and, horror of horrors, the ticking time bomb of the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an astonishing litany, is it not, of failure? You would think the European Union would get something right once by accident. I am sorry, but I am not satisfied. I am desperately cross that the British Conservative Party has given away the City of London regulation. If Dave Cameron had been the Admiral at Trafalgar, it would be Admiral Villeneuve on the plinth in Trafalgar Square now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It took a financial crisis of huge proportions for Europe to wake up. However, an opportunity has been lost, in part, to strengthen the joint institutions of Europe, because, on the one hand, these new supervisory authorities have a limited scope of competence compared to similar authorities in Member States. Moreover, it is a shame that progress has not been made on similar integration to that which took place with the European System of Central Banks.</p>

<p class="contents">As far as the future is concerned, Mr Reynders, before the end of this period and perhaps even before the end of this month, I would like us to be able to reach an agreement on one of the subjects that concerns us to which you have dedicated yourselves, and not in vain I can assure you. In the coming days, thanks to the great minds of the Belgian Presidency, we will find a satisfactory solution on hedge funds and private equity.</p>
<p class="contents">To repeat one of the Commissioner’s analogies, I think that we must add bricks to this framework that has just been outlined that will ensure that financial regulation is intelligent and affects all products. It is not about regulation for regulation’s sake. It is about trying to ascertain the effectiveness of regulation that is intended to limit as far as possible the risks inherent in the financial system.</p>

European supervision was a long-held aspiration in European integration and an essential instrument for moving forward with financial integration, making monetary policy more effective and improving competitiveness. It was also something that we needed to achieve in order to put an end to the financial hypertrophy and close the gap between global finance and national supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">The current crisis has confirmed the insufficiency of the market and of nationally based solutions. We need to correct the defects that have been detected in regulation and supervision. In our case, supervision is a priority in financial reform because, while European regulation has been deficient, supervision has been non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">European supervision lays the foundations for a complete, thorough and credible reform. This first transnational experience is a step towards a consistent system of international financial supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has worked together to ensure that the package has three focuses. The first focus is that it is more balanced, in order to achieve security and solvency for the financial institutions, financial inclusion and protection for consumers, savers and taxpayers. The second is that it is more prudent in order to respond to systemic risks, act in emergency situations and be able to temporarily ban toxic products. The third is that it is more sustainable, promoting competitiveness, the internalisation of costs and the prospect of a European crisis management system based on contributions from the financial entities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Omnibus Directive makes it possible to launch the authorities by incorporating them into sectoral legislation, specifying their powers and setting out rules for how they will operate. It increases transparency in the exchange of information and cooperation and, at the same time, establishes a deadline for reform in the development of legislative implementation to be completed before 1 December 2012 and for transposition to be done with correlation tables.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by thanking all those who made it possible for this package to move forward for their work. Today, we are offering the first fruits, but this agreement marks a watershed in the development of European finance and democracy, because democracy means legislating, supervising and ensuring that the laws are effective. It has also been demonstrated that if we want better finances, we need to follow the path towards greater democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ordinary legislative procedure cannot consist – as was the case with the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in December – in concluding an agreement unanimously, and then coming before Parliament saying: ‘You know, it is a shame, we have reached an agreement, and furthermore, you must move very quickly because the markets are waiting’. The deadlock was broken, and Minister, we thank you for this, when the Belgian Presidency opted for a little more commitment and dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I just wanted to tell you that, as far as economic governance is concerned, we intend to work as a team, as we did on supervision. Mr Reynders, if possible, I would therefore like to ask you, like Mr Barnier, to pass a short message to the Commission and to ECOFIN, telling them that we really want to be completely involved from the start and to play our role as regards the ordinary legislative procedure. Do not block us in the Council. Do not block us in the task force, and even try perhaps to explain to Mr Van Rompuy that we would be very pleased to see him in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as we asked him to attend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can be proud of ourselves for this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my thanks to the Belgian Presidency, because we had the feeling – and I can endorse what Mrs Goulard said – that the Council was not making much of an effort in this regard at the beginning. Although the Council adopted a unanimous resolution at first, it did not solve the problems. It was thanks to the European Parliament that a solution was found across the group divides which is truly viable and which will ensure that we have stable supervisory structures as well as a range of instruments that can be used in crisis situations to stem excesses and thus help to stabilise the financial sector. I would like to thank you most sincerely, Mr Reynders, as you have personally shown a great deal of commitment to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission, which ensured that, in a fair dialogue, the two positions represented by the Council and Parliament, which were very far apart to start with, could be brought together.

It is a very satisfactory result, not because this House stood up to representatives of the States. This compromise is really good because it is meaningful. We had to give the package a more European tone for the sake of its effectiveness and credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why Mrs Goulard and I – as shadow rapporteur of my group – fought so hard to ensure that the President of the European Central Bank should automatically be the President of the European Systemic Risk Board is because we are fully aware of the significance of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In a landscape that will remain very fragmented between national authorities, we need a European body that is strengthened by indisputable competence and legitimacy. Perhaps even the British understand that! By virtue of his authority and prestige, the President of the ECB will be able to impose the authority of the European Systemic Risk Board when faced with its numerous negotiating partners – in the first instance, the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, it is not excessive power that we should fear; rather, it is excessive weakness that we had to fight, and finally, I would like all the authorities to settle in as quickly as possible and for a climate of confidence to be established between all partners concerned. The bet has not been won. Once again, the European Union was slow to move, but in the end we are laying the interesting foundations for a model that is expected to evolve in the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have not just created a toothless tiger, but agencies that are also able to bite at the crucial moment. In crucial situations in future, there is to be no more bickering among the national supervisory authorities over powers, but a clear, binding statement from a European authority.

Furthermore, I am very pleased to see the interest that many MEPs have shown in this subject and in financial supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, I would like to tell you that, as several people have reminded us, it is a question of the first real lesson learnt from the financial crisis. We have had much debate on a large number of texts, but the implementation of the new supervision package and the European Systemic Risk Board is really the first lesson that we in Europe are all learning together from this financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The second element that I would like to underline is that it is a question of the beginning of a process. As Mr Barnier has just mentioned, we are going to implement a whole series of other elements within the framework of this process. Regulation must continue to be strongly reinforced and several people have referred to this. In the same way, we will pursue the work between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. The Belgian Presidency is, in any case, utterly determined to be involved in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in the next few days, we will really be able to move forward as far as the directive on investment funds, hedge funds and other investment funds is concerned. Soon, we will hold debates on rating agencies. I would like to reassure you of the collaboration that Mrs Goulard referred to. We have already proposed, and all of this has been agreed, that during the informal Economic and Financial Affairs Council, Mrs Bowles, the chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, will join us to take stock of the state of progress of our work.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not wish to speak any longer because I know that there are important procedures that will take place, but I really hope that we will be able to help in what many have described as an historic vote. In any event, I will see you in the next few days and weeks to promote, in the same way and with the same determination, some other texts that once more will be put to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks anyway to those who have done what they could over the last few months to move forward with this dossier which, as I said, is really the first important lesson learnt from the financial crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If Brussels were viewed as over regulating banks and stock markets, financial services would face two options – fall behind international competitors or move their headquarters to countries free from any limitation whatsoever. The former would keep European investors stuck in the dark ages of recession as the rest of the world takes huge strides out. The latter could lead to a cowboy banking market overseas beyond reach where everybody’s money would be at risk. The majority of EU regulation in other sectors has been an unmitigated disaster. We have put the city of London, one of the UK’s largest industries, responsible for 80 per cent of European hedge funds, into the hands of the Commission. If this follows the rest of Brussels’ erroneous lawmaking, the UK, and the rest of the world, could rue the day such a power transfer was allowed to take place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The uniquely European financial supervision package is one of the steps in this direction. With the package in place, Europe of the 27 would finally be able to work more coherently and with more solidarity within the framework of economic governance decisions taken at global level. More importantly, the only way that Europe can reduce systemic transnational risks and subsequently prevent or mitigate the negative impact of future financial crises is to have an integrated network that funnels and coordinates the expertise and efforts of actors of all levels to establish and maintain a sound, stable and transparent financial system. Such a system serves as a prime example of the accountability of Europe to its citizens. I support this package because I believe in the future of Europe – a Europe where our financial industry no longer needs to suffer from its own excesses, and where our citizens no longer need to suffer from the devastating, unnecessary consequences of preventable crises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also ask the Commission and Council to focus on the following issue arising from the efficient operation of the European economy: how can most industries be achieving low levels of profitability or verging on losses, while the banking sector is reporting increased profits again, following the crisis? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The need to activate plans to bail out the economy and families was a decisive factor in the marked increase in government deficits.</p>
<p class="contents">The package we are debating today is the concrete result of a new financial supervision architecture in Europe, based on the creation of institutions and mechanisms designed to provide both macro-prudential supervision – that is to say, supervision of risks affecting the entire European financial system – and micro-prudential supervision of banking, insurance and the property markets, in coordination with the network of national supervisors.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also other areas where it is hoped that the European supervisory authorities will contribute to financial stability, in particular, by centralising in one institution the supervision of EU-registered credit rating agencies, the promotion of mandatory technical standards and the mediation of conflicts between national supervisors.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, this new supervisory architecture may also contribute to the success of new Union mechanisms for economic, budgetary and social planning, coordination and supervision within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

True to the key elements of the Larosière report, the European Parliament has secured sufficient clout for the new European supervisors. They will be able to impose binding measures on financial institutions where national regulators fail to take adequate action, provide greater alignment between national authorities and settle their mutual disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, with this agreement, we have been able to go much further than the non-committal coordination between national watchdogs that many Member States initially preferred. In the meantime, we have witnessed what a lack of European supervision can lead to. The new supervision structure will better protect not only the bank’s customers but also the taxpayer.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a downside to this agreement. I regret that Parliament’s call for the supervisors to be headquartered in one place, in Frankfurt, close to the European Central Bank, was rejected. Fortunately, Parliament was able to incorporate a review clause, so that in three years’ time, we can assess whether or not the European supervisors require more powers and whether or not dispersal of the authorities is appropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The creation of the supervisory authorities is a major step towards European integration and the furthering of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the implementation of this new architecture begins. It is true that the new supervisory authorities will act in a coordinated manner, together with the national supervisory bodies, and not by replacing them. But it is equally true that the fragmented response of the Member States during the financial crisis prevented the EU from showing more efficiency, more coordination and more leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is quite obvious to me that advisory powers and non-binding recommendations are not enough. Binding rules, harmonised application and coordinated supervision are needed for a more efficient single market. These are the requirements that have to be fulfilled by the new ESAs to constitute the institutional foundation of the new European financial supervision architecture. The same requirements are necessary to best serve the interests of European taxpayers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the following aspects are important. Firstly, the European budget will still manage without having to obtain credit, and that is the way it should stay. Secondly, the Financial Perspective – in other words, the seven-year financial framework – will provide the Member States with greater planning certainty. Thirdly, we and the Member States will have to get used to the fact that there is less financial leeway. In my opinion this means, fourthly, that when the Member States transfer additional tasks to the European Union, the principle we should follow in future must be that the Member States must also provide the necessary funding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have always thought that a ravening shark would make for a better simile – it has to keep swimming lest it choke – but we will leave that aside.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us examine the question of why that is the case. The truth is that the European Union has become a mechanism for the redistribution of money. It has to keep sucking in more and more funds in order to reward its favoured client groups. If it stops doing that, then the bicycle indeed topples and the shark drowns. That is why we have this extraordinary spectacle, at a time when every national government is looking to constrain spending, that the one budget that keeps rising is that of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country, every departmental budget is looking for savings of between 25 and 40 percent, but one budget is increasing by 60 percent, namely our net contributions to the European Union. Far from stimulating the economy, we are taking money out of the productive sector and taking people out of the productive sector and putting them in the bureaucracy. This will simply confirm people in the view that the European Union has become a racket. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It also takes due account of the need for control without creating too much bureaucracy, and the central procedure for authorisation of medicinal products, in particular, will be more streamlined.

The creation of the new European medicines safety web portal will allow citizens better access to clear and understandable information on safety issues.</p>

<p class="contents">When we look at the financial crisis, it is very easy to fall into a trap – the trap that this Parliament and all the institutions are falling into – that more regulation is the solution. We forget the role that regulation actually played in creating the sub-prime crisis in the first place, telling banks to lend to uncreditworthy customers. When one in ten of those customers defaulted, we had the sub-prime crisis. We also need to understand the difference between regulation and supervision. It could be argued that regulators had the tools at their disposal but did not use them properly.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the advantages we hear is that this will create a single rule book for Europe. That is very interesting, but the problem we have got, as we know, is that many EU countries often ignore the rules and do not pay their fines. How can you create a level playing field when many of the players will not obey the rules? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No report has proposed such necessary and balanced regulation of intellectual property. Mrs Gallo’s report deals with piracy in digital networks in a one-sided manner, and overlooks measures against counterfeiting which are truly ruining our industry, although the viewpoints of the IMCO and ITRE committees proposed practical measures. Furthermore, it proposes some kind of harmonisation of criminal sanctions for violation of intellectual property, rather than addressing the fact that the professional public understands criminal law as the exclusive domain of Member States. However, I do appreciate the fact that the report emphasises prevention and an educational campaign. I appreciate that the draft resolution of the ALDE Group more carefully addresses rights and responsibilities, especially of Internet service providers, but it was presented at the last minute. It is clearly inspired by the proposal from the PPE Group but unfortunately, did not bring any innovative initiatives into the debate. The draft resolution, presented among others by Mrs Castex, is more complex and current with regard to the meeting on ACTA. I also appreciate the more targeted measures against counterfeit drugs. However, I do not agree with the limitation of the mandate for the European Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy. Ultimately, therefore, I did not support any of the three draft resolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

None of the reports that have been put to the vote in this Chamber today are good ones and I have therefore voted against all three of them. There are numerous problems with them. For example, trademark infringement is confused with copyright, people are calling for regulation and surveillance and an unreasonable compensation system is encouraged, while, at the same time, there is the admission that the effects of existing legislation need to be investigated first.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that fundamental rights and the free market can, instead, be combined. If the principle of a ‘mere conduit’ is threatened, we would jeopardise the dynamic nature of the Internet that we know today. If Internet service providers were to be made liable for the legality of the content, it would force them to minimise the risk by monitoring and filtering the traffic. This would lead to cautious companies that are unable to grow or take on staff and to problems for new companies in obtaining access to the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">Abolishing the principle of a ‘mere conduit’ would extend the role of Internet service providers to make them supervisors as well. Nowhere else in society is the messenger responsible for the content. Neither is there anywhere else where we instruct our citizens not to break the law every time they use a service. Imagine, for example, if, whenever stamps were sold, it was mandatory to provide information stating that it is prohibited to send letters containing anthrax bacteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, my wholehearted support goes to Commissioner Kroes and her digital agenda. Her flagship initiative demonstrates an understanding of how the market perspective could be combined with respect for fundamental rights, including on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">China is an example of how the Internet has been ruined by interference in the freedom of expression and by surveillance. Let us not go down the same route. Countries in northern Europe have shown the way by means of voluntary agreements and effective competition. We need to look to the north, not to the east. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very important that we now establish pan­European, common rules for intellectual property rights, because the truth is that when we consider Europe in this situation, what we need is innovation. We need creativity. They both produce genuine added value. For us to be able to guarantee the flow of innovations and creativity, resulting in creative solutions, it goes without saying that they have to be protected and developed. It is perfectly obvious that we cannot accept infringements of intellectual property rights. At present, this is a problem in industry, in many creative sectors and in sport.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the fact that this report by Mrs Gallo is the first step in the right direction. As legislators, there is no possible way we can condone piracy or theft, whether it takes place online or wherever else. We have to ensure that the creative sectors are left in peace. They can create and innovate, and, as a result, we can act against the continued infringement of intellectual property rights and impose sanctions when it occurs, and that way, we can achieve European added value by means of the creative sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To start with Gozo, it is a pity that while the Maltese Government included Declaration 36, whose objective was to safeguard Gozo’s future, during Malta’s EU accession negotiations, the specific funds never materialised. However, Gozitans should feel reassured by this resolution which demands a European-wide framework for mountainous regions and islands; not simply a policy measure, but a number of Union policies which have an impact on the development of islands. Specifically, this resolution asks the Commission and Member States to ensure that islands benefit from specific funds within a new financial framework for the budgetary cycle 2014-2010. Above all, mountainous regions and islands in the Union share common factors which are unlike those of other regions, sometimes even within the same state. I am very pleased that this resolution requests Union programmes and a policy which would enable islands to become competitive and to adjust to the challenges they are facing. I am also pleased that this resolution says that Member States, including Malta and Cyprus, which are located in the southern part of Europe, deserve regional programmes for their development. This resolution is making a declaration of intent to protect the interests of Member States, particularly of islands like Gozo.

Whereas the Treaty of Lisbon gives new prerogatives to the European Union, and large-scale European projects are called for and announced by Member States, the Commission and the Council refuse to reconsider expenditure limits, which does not make any sense and reveals their narrow vision of the European project. The recession requires more Europe: to achieve that, the European budget should be strengthened by replacing the current financial framework, which is restricted and unsuitable. It is time to comply with our treaties, which stipulate that the Union should have resources commensurate with its objectives. Together with a very large majority of MEPs, we back the need for own resources such as Eurobonds. Member States should acknowledge that the added value of European policies is an essential tool to contain national expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has brought with it new areas of action, one of which is the European External Action Service. I believe, therefore, that a mere reallocation of resources or redefinition of priorities within the scope of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) will not be enough to meet the new needs of the EU. This means that a revision of the MFF and the flexibility mechanisms included in the interinstitutional agreement is crucial. The EU needs greater flexibility to allow it to create reserves and room for manoeuvre so that it will be able to react quickly and effectively to urgent or unforeseen situations.

Important projects such as Galileo, the Food Facility and the European Economic Recovery Plan have only moved forward in the last four years of the current MFF through using up existing margins or by using the instruments provided by the interinstitutional agreement. The remaining margins for the current financial framework are insignificant for the rest of the period. The margin available under heading 1a (Competitiveness for growth and employment) will be less than EUR 50 million per year, and the overall margin available under all the headings will be limited to EUR 436 million in 2012, and EUR 435 million in 2013. However, this margin will be further reduced due to existing commitments which have not yet been included in the budget. The Treaty of Lisbon has brought with it new powers and bodies, and the EU 2020 strategy, which has already been adopted and which advocates intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth, should now begin to be implemented using the necessary financial resources.

<p class="contents">The creation of a budget line allowing for the EFSM guarantees to be mobilised this budget year has the advantage of endowing the Union with the ability to show solidarity and respond more quickly to any problem that has arisen in the meantime. It also sends out a message of confidence to the financial markets as to the EU’s collective commitment to market security and stability and to helping resolve situations of financial breakdown.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite these advantages, I believe a serious and very thorough assessment is required of its impact on the Union’s accounts, which is likely to be considerable. If necessary, speed should be given up for the sake of soundness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We recall that the EFSM was created in May 2010 by a Council Regulation adopted on the basis of Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), without Parliament’s participation, and it consists of a mechanism providing for the possibility for the Union to borrow funds in the capital market to loan to Member States in financial difficulties. The European budget will only be called upon to intervene if the Member State receiving the loan is not able to reimburse it. Therefore, this amending budget for the 2010 financial year encompasses the creation of a new budget item 01 04 01 03 for the guarantee provided by the EU, and, correspondingly, a new Article 802 on the revenue side. A token entry (p.m.) is proposed for commitment and payment appropriations, as well as revenue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, Article 136 does not provide a basis for giving credit to Greece since it only allows measures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the treaties. Not only are these not provided for in the TFEU; they are actually explicitly banned. The provision does not therefore authorise more extensive measures. The finance ministers of the euro area decided to assist Greece by providing credit at an average interest rate of 5%. This means that credit was granted at a politically motivated interest rate that is below the market rate and thus represents an illegal subsidy. Hence, the assistance given to Greece was extremely controversial from a legal point of view, if not downright unlawful. As far as the actual consequences are concerned, I fear that if the euro area countries continue to be answerable for the debts of other Member States, then in 10 years’ time, the euro will no longer exist.

Preservation of the taxpayer’s right to the deduction of VAT has become particularly important and pertinent in the European Union’s current economic climate.

The implementation of measures to facilitate and lighten the bureaucratic burden on European companies operating in different Member States, along with the standardisation of procedures, is crucial for consolidating the internal market and contributing to European economic recovery. The delay in implementing measures concerning the electronic refunding of VAT by some Member States is regrettable. It is clear that, given the current economic situation, the delay in refunding VAT has serious financial consequences for companies operating within the internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has made the correct decision to replace the existing Pharmacovigilance working party with the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee (PRAAC). Most experts have confirmed that the existing working party system works in a rather ad hoc manner, focusing only on drugs authorised through the central procedure and lacking the status to ensure that its findings are acted on by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, which oversees the whole system.

A total of 197 000 people die in the European Union every year due to adverse reactions to medicinal products. Achieving a good pharmacovigilance system, based on healthcare professionals, companies and patients themselves reporting any adverse reactions, is therefore a priority. The rules regulating the centralised procedure are set out in this regulation, which relates to new medicinal products or those that combat cancer, HIV or degenerative diseases, while the centralised system is provided for in Directive 2001/83/EC. I therefore advocate strengthening cooperation on pharmacovigilance, which allows for a more comprehensive ‘pool’ of adverse drug reactions to be obtained, and avoids duplicate monitoring of the same adverse reactions in other Member States. I welcome the measures proposed to encourage healthcare professionals to voluntarily report adverse drug reactions to their competent authority. I would particularly like to highlight the creation of a web portal for each Member State (Article 106 of the directive), where all relevant information relating to medicinal products will be available to everyone who wants to consult it.

However, in spite of the existing legislation, it is estimated that there are approximately 197 000 deaths in the EU every year caused by adverse reactions to medicinal products. Given these premisses, it is vital that there is consistent, sound and sector-oriented legislation. The prime objective of this proposal is to improve the authorisation and monitoring procedures for medicinal products for human and veterinary use so as to prevent people and animals from being affected by side-effects of medicinal products, as has happened in the past.

In other words, it makes pharmacovigilance more effective. A related point to be emphasised is the fact that the new system proposes that all adverse drug reactions be reported to the European Medicines Agency.

Under current EU legislation, medicines can be authorised in two ways: a) through a central procedure where an application is made by a pharmaceutical company to the EMEA (European Medicines Agency), as stipulated in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, or b) through a system of mutual recognition where one country leads on the assessment of the new drug and coordinates with other Member States through mutual recognition. I support the report because consumers and healthcare professionals should also have full access to the central European Eudravigilance database in order to prevent the repetition of adverse drug reactions which could have been avoided by making validated information easily available.

A total of 197 000 people die in the European Union every year due to adverse reactions to medicinal products. Achieving a good pharmacovigilance system, based on healthcare professionals, companies and patients themselves reporting any adverse reactions, is therefore a priority. The rules regulating the centralised procedure are set out in Regulation No 726/2044, which relates to new medicinal products or those that combat cancer, HIV or degenerative diseases, while the centralised system is provided for in the present directive. I therefore advocate strengthening cooperation on pharmacovigilance at EU level, which allows for a more comprehensive ‘pool’ of adverse drug reactions to be obtained, and avoids duplicate monitoring of the same adverse reactions in other Member States. I welcome the measures proposed to encourage healthcare professionals to voluntarily report adverse drug reactions to their competent authority. I would particularly like to highlight the creation of a web portal for each Member State (Article 106 of the directive), where all relevant information relating to medicinal products will be made available to everyone who wants to consult it. These national web portals will be linked to the European web portal, which will be managed by the European Medicines Agency (Article 26 of the regulation). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Biocidal products and substances in our society are indispensable, for they help fulfil stringent health and hygiene requirements. A whole series of micro-organisms have already become resistant to the original products, so current biocidal substances are becoming more and more dangerous as a result of their increased effectiveness. I fully support the aim of the rapporteur to take into account not just the practices of manufacturers, but especially protection of consumers and the environment as well. Regulations governing biocidal products should also be extended to manufacturers outside the EU. It is unacceptable for us to demand higher values for consumer and environmental protection from our producers at the price of increasing costs, and to demand nothing from other producers outside the EU and outside of Europe who import these goods into the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers who purchase biocidal products on the territory of the EU must be sure that the goods meet minimum standards without regard to whether they are purchased in Poland or Germany or whether they originally come from the EU or from China. The report is clearly formulated. It requires concrete and feasible legislative changes and takes into consideration the environmental impact.

Consumers should be able to assume that the products that they purchase meet uniform minimum standards for the EU internal market, irrespective of the Member State where the product was purchased. That means that clear labelling of treated materials and products is as vital as the corresponding authorisation for the biocidal products, irrespective of whether they come from inside or outside the EU. The European biocidal products market is estimated to be worth approximately EUR 890 million per year, which equates to approximately 27% of the global market. Three large companies hold about 25% of the European market. It is therefore necessary to establish a balance between the interests of the large companies and those of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs need to be given more help in an industry dominated by several large industrial producers. This can be done by exempting SMEs from paying an annual tax for putting biocidal products on the market. In addition, Member States should create national helpdesks to complement the guidance documents provided by the European Chemicals Agency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to increase safety in connection with the use of biocidal products and to establish a system of scrutiny, it is logical for these substances to be subject to the same tests and standards throughout the EU. As a representative of farmers in the European Parliament, I am committed to the responsible use of biocides. This proposal represents a good basis for uniform regulation in the EU. In the interests of fair competition, I am especially in favour of all planned new biocide provisions also applying to imports from third countries. However, agriculture must continue to be able to do its job of producing safe food and feed at a reasonable cost. Proposals that have a direct effect on production and production costs need to be evaluated particularly carefully. The use of suitable measures to combat harmful pests must not be made more difficult or expensive by making them uneconomic.

The exclusion criteria for dangerous active substances (carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic for reproduction, persistent, bio-accumulative) may be considered when a substitution plan for them is already available. Consequently, when a biocide containing an active substance which is a candidate for substitution is authorised, the time limit will be restricted to three years and there will have to be alternatives available which are not harmful to the environment or human health.

<p class="contents">Of course, several demands from manufacturers have to be met concerning these products for use against vermin, such as access to the European market, time taken for the approval procedures, non-duplication of tests and consistency with legislation on pesticides. That in no way constitutes a blank cheque for manufacturers. The principle of substitution for the most harmful substances is clearly recognised.

<p class="contents">It is recognised that responsibility rests with all those involved, including manufacturers who place on the market articles treated with biocides. Let us not forget the toxic sofas affair! I have one regret, however, and that is the rejection of an amendment which stipulated that manufacturers should pay an annual fee, at reduced rates for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), so as to make it possible for the Chemicals Agency in Stockholm to fulfil its brief. One thing is clear: with limited resources, it will be difficult to carry out reliable tests and so to reduce health risks for users. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has tabled a series of proposals with the intention of instituting a more efficient, integrated and sustainable system of financial supervision in the EU. The basis for this approach is a European System of Financial Supervisors. To that end, the Commission proposes the creation of three new European decentralised agencies: the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, and the European Securities and Markets Authority.

Models of supervision have had a national perspective and have not adapted to the globalisation that has occurred within the financial system, in which various financial groups conduct their operations across borders, with the systemic risks that this entails. There has, therefore, been no cooperation, coordination or consistency whatsoever in the application of EU legislation. Hence, the aim of this directive is to improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring a high level of supervision and prudential regulation, and by protecting depositors, investors and all beneficiaries. It is therefore crucial to safeguard the integrity, efficiency and smooth running of financial markets, to maintain the stability and sustainability of public finances, and to strengthen international coordination and cooperation in the field of supervision. The creation of a European authority for the insurance and occupational pensions sector is essential in order to achieve an effective supervision model, alongside many other monitoring mechanisms, to be decided on and implemented as a matter of true urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recently, for example, an online insurer went bankrupt leaving its customers with claims out in the cold. Waves of complaints also revealed serious shortcomings in the advice given, where customers had been sold risky financial packages as secure arrangements for their occupational pensions. If we want to take the supervision obligation seriously, it will be necessary to deal with these sorts of problems that have surfaced in the EU and to create fair conditions. We need more stringent financial supervision.

It was imperative for us to review the European System of Financial Supervisors. The lack of coordination between national supervisory bodies increased the future risk of financial institutions failing. By establishing three new European authorities responsible for supervising how banks, financial markets and insurance and pension companies operate, we have set up a comprehensive framework for financial supervision. In this way, banks will be regulated by the European Banking Authority in a standard and coordinated fashion. With real coercive power, the latter will have the last word in the event of a disagreement with national bank regulators. Ensuring financial institutions are solvent and enabling more transparency in financial markets and products will also guarantee improved protection for investors, businesses, savers and consumers.

The need for regulation was excessively promoted over the need for a free market environment for banks and the financial sector. The authorities of the national and European regulator are defined quite unclearly and the boundaries between them are significantly blurred. In the best case scenario, this could lead to legal uncertainty on the part of all players in the financial market, in the worst case, to the misuse of authority on the part of the European regulator, against which it will be practically impossible for players to defend themselves effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of a single EU financial market, the existence of strong supranational supervisory bodies endowed with the authority to decide on individual subjects of the financial market in Member States is of questionable legitimacy. If we are so obsessed with regulation in the EU, as we are now witnessing in the case of financial markets, we will have nothing left to do except to stand by while China pushes us from the global playing field. So while we criticise unfair competitive behaviour, for some time, China has not only benefited from generous state subsidies, cheap labour and a failure to maintain environmental protection standards, but has also promoted itself thanks to innovations and modern technologies. And that should be a concern and a warning for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament, aware of its responsibilities and making use of the new powers granted to it under the Treaty of Lisbon, must be called on to play a key role in improving the EU’s supervisory framework. As it is impossible to resolve the weaknesses of the existing supervisory structure, which the current financial crisis has underlined, it has become even more pressing to create mechanisms for macro-prudential supervision that are capable of guaranteeing the stability of European financial markets. It is also important to safeguard the unity of the single market as well as equipping the EU with instruments that will enable it to defend the euro and other international currencies at global level. I would also like to stress the important contribution that the ESRB introduces through the proposal for it to take on macro-economic analysis at European level so that it can analyse potential systemic risks. With the weaknesses in micro-prudential supervision at Member State level exposed, I believe that close collaboration between the ESRB, central bankers, supervisors and the ‘real economy’ will not only legitimise the actions of the ESRB but will also make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of those actions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such an institution could, in my view, have a certain justification. The Union needs a strategic authority of this type. Moreover, I believe that by its very nature, there is no danger that this institution would be a rampant bureaucratic structure. However, I have a completely different viewpoint on the European System of Financial Supervisors. It is obvious from the proposal that a robust and complex bureaucratic juggernaut is being built, and it is unclear at the present time whether its extensive powers would be implemented at the expense of the powers of Member States. If the European System of Financial Supervisors is not to extend beyond its original intentions, its powers must be formulated so precisely that not even the slightest doubt would arise that daily oversight of the financial markets will remain in the hands of Member States and their independent domestic oversight authorities, and all of this done while preserving the fiscal responsibility of individual Member States.

Supervision models have not adapted to the globalisation that has occurred within the financial system, in which various financial groups conduct their operations across borders with systemic risk. There has, therefore, been no cooperation, coordination or consistency whatsoever in the application of EU legislation. Hence, the aim of this directive is to improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring a high level of supervision and prudential regulation, and by protecting depositors, investors and all beneficiaries; in truth, its only fault is that it does not go far enough. It is therefore crucial to safeguard the integrity, efficiency and smooth running of financial markets, to maintain the stability and sustainability of public finances, and to strengthen international coordination and cooperation in the field of supervision. I believe that the creation of the European Systemic Risk Board is essential in order to achieve an effective supervision model, and in order to avoid the systemic risk caused by the cross-border nature of large financial groups. However, many other steps need to be taken to prevent a recurrence of the truly immoral situations of the recent past, which have damaged economies, shareholders, depositors, taxpayers and the credibility of the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must establish an effective European system of supervision to monitor, assess and avert potential risks to financial stability. The report clearly highlights the importance of preserving the unity of the European single market. However, it is also very important to protect the internal market from goods from those countries that do not foster values like democracy, ecology and social guarantees, which is why goods and services from those countries are becoming cheaper and our European companies will be unable to compete under such circumstances. I agree with the observations made this month by President Barroso: ‘We have the people. We have the companies. What they both need is an open and modern single market’. The internal market is Europe’s greatest asset, but we are not using it to its full potential. Only 8% of Europe’s 20 million SMEs engage in cross-border trade. Still fewer engage in cross-border investment. The European Systemic Risk Board would be the main pillar of the EU supervision structure and, in this way, would help make the internal market function more harmoniously. Along with the values mentioned, the European single market was one of the main reasons behind the accession of Lithuania and the Member States of other fellow Members to the European Union. Any significant split or misunderstanding would undermine the decade-long efforts to remove borders and barriers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the G20 has also committed to take action to build a stronger, more globally consistent supervisory and regulatory framework for the future financial sector, the EU’s response must be ambitious, dealing with particular cases, providing answers on both macro and micro supervisions as well as on global regulation, and focusing on harmonisation and cooperation at global level on systemic risks.

This has highlighted the shortcomings of the instruments for supervising the market and the vulnerability of Europe’s citizens, specifically depositors, investors or contributors. They need to be given greater protection. One of the ways of doing this is to supervise insurance and occupational pension institutions, with particular attention, which I believe is necessary, being focused on cross-border agencies. I support the report from my colleague, Peter Skinner, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, especially as the European Parliament warned a long time before the outbreak of the crisis about the superficial nature of the control over certain increasingly integrated financial markets. I believe that the text tabled by the European Parliament is more appropriate to the need for prevention and better management of other possible crises, especially through the measures aimed at increasing transparency on the financial markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite having laid bare the weaknesses of the financial market, the current situation of the European and world economies is a good opportunity for the EU to develop a stronger framework for supervision and regulation that is more consistent with the needs of a globalised economy. The Union’s responses to the crisis must be bold, both at the level of macro-prudential supervision and regulation, and at the micro-prudential level. I think that the new supervision architecture should be based on the precautionary principle, because I recognise the underlying complexity of its design. It is also important for the ESAs to have the effective capability of going beyond monitoring the systemic risks of national financial institutions, and to also be able to assess cross-border and systemic risks at European level, as well as international systemic risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Supervision models have not adapted to the globalisation that has occurred within the financial system, in which various financial groups conduct their operations across borders with systemic risk. There has, therefore, been no cooperation, coordination or consistency whatsoever in the application of EU legislation. Hence, the aim of this directive is an overall improvement in the functioning of the internal market by ensuring a high level of supervision and prudential regulation, and by protecting depositors, investors and all beneficiaries. It is therefore crucial to safeguard the integrity, efficiency and smooth running of financial markets, to maintain the stability and sustainability of public finances, and to strengthen international coordination and cooperation in the field of supervision. The creation of a European System of Financial Supervisors and the definition of its powers are essential in order to achieve an effective supervision model in all sectors. However, many other steps need to be taken to prevent a recurrence of the truly immoral situations of the recent past, which have damaged economies, shareholders, depositors, taxpayers and the credibility of the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our crystal clear demands – two years after the start of the global financial crisis – characterise an ambitious project. The future European Banking Authority (EBA) will combine the controlling bodies of the national financial service providers. This is an essential prerequisite for getting the closely intermeshed financial markets under control. Mandatory technical standards must be developed in order to create a uniform European body of legislation. The goal is to prevent distortions of competition on the financial markets in an effective manner and to put a stop to excessive speculation. Financial market transactions must become more transparent. For this, we need to monitor risk products such as derivatives and short selling. For the sake of consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises, it is not acceptable for players to largely conceal, unchecked, their activities from financial market supervision. We MEPs have made good use of the political weight that we have had since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December 2009. We have shown cross-group unity and have found solutions that make European added value clear. No crisis can be solved by states going it alone. It is time for effective banking supervision that at any time prevents – as Commissioner Barnier said – a crisis becoming a disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Models of supervision have had a national perspective and have not adapted to the globalisation occurring within the financial system, where different financial groups conduct their operations across borders, with the systemic risks that this entails. There has, therefore, been no cooperation, coordination or consistency whatsoever in the application of EU legislation. Hence, the aim of this directive is to improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring a high level of supervision and prudential regulation, and by protecting depositors, investors and all beneficiaries. It is therefore crucial to safeguard the integrity, efficiency and smooth running of financial markets, to maintain the stability and sustainability of public finances, and to strengthen international coordination and cooperation in the field of supervision. I believe that the creation of the European Banking Authority is essential to achieve an effective supervision model. However, many other steps need to be taken to prevent a recurrence of the truly immoral situations of the recent past, which have damaged economies, shareholders, depositors, taxpayers and the credibility of the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of regulations, which are part of the financial supervision package, have been brought into force today. The financial crisis revealed a series of weak points in the global financial system, including a lack of appropriate supervision of financial institutions in Europe. In response to those deficiencies, we have adopted proposals which are intended to strengthen the supervision of financial markets in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">From the outset, Poland was in favour of appointing strong and independent supervisory bodies which would have the ability to issue binding decisions at supranational level. It was important for us that the supervisory bodies, which are going to be European in character, should be very strong bodies and should have a very broad range of competences.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been able, in large measure, to achieve this objective. It should also be noted that the solutions which have been found are satisfactory. They are solutions which reconcile the national interests of the 27 Member States. Credit for this is, to a great extent, due to the European Parliament.

I probably do not need to remind you that Lithuania is one of the countries worst affected by the global financial crisis. At one time, Lithuania’s growth was based almost entirely on loaned funds driven by cheap credit, mostly from foreign lenders looking for a quick profit. Business had barely got on its feet when the crisis began. It is self-evident that there is absolutely no point in continuing to apply mechanisms whose ineffectiveness was exposed during the crisis. Now we need a strong and ambitious policy to create a more effective, integrated and sustainable European supervision system. I am pleased to see the amendments submitted in relation to the Commission’s proposal, which was mostly drafted from the banking perspective, regardless of the position of those seeking loans.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for us to include small and medium-sized enterprises because their business is more dependent on bank financing than large enterprises. I hope that we will be able to establish a reliable European institution with clear powers and a crisis management mechanism which will ensure that it is not Europe’s taxpayers who will face the greatest burden following any short-term change in the financial system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was imperative for us to review the European System of Financial Supervisors. The lack of coordination between national supervisory bodies increased the future risk of financial institutions failing. By establishing three new European authorities responsible for supervising how banks, financial markets and insurance and pension companies operate, we have set up a comprehensive framework for financial supervision. In this way, banks will be regulated by the European Banking Authority in a standard and coordinated fashion. With real coercive power, the latter will have the last word in the event of disagreement with national bank regulators. Ensuring financial institutions are solvent and enabling more transparency in financial markets and products will also guarantee improved protection for investors, businesses, savers and consumers.

We had already regularly called for the creation of such conditions and pointed out some of the faults in financial market supervision. I therefore urge the European Commission to examine the best possible way to move towards a more-integrated supervision structure, in parallel with the delicate process of building an increasingly vigorous, integrated single market for financial services.

However, the new feature of this authority is not that it will receive centralised supervision powers because, in this respect, we can include all the other authorities which make up the European System of Financial Supervisors, but that, for the first time, a European authority is being granted responsibilities for supervising the actors in a market directly, which also presupposes being involved in granting authorisation, carrying out investigations and imposing sanctions.</p>

Supervision models had a national perspective and did not adapt to the globalisation that has occurred within the financial system, where various financial groups conduct their operations across borders, with the systemic risks that this entails. There has, therefore, been no cooperation, coordination or consistency whatsoever in the application of EU legislation. Hence, the aim of this directive is to improve the functioning of the internal market by ensuring a high level of supervision and prudential regulation, and by protecting depositors, investors and all beneficiaries. It is therefore crucial to safeguard the integrity, efficiency and smooth running of financial markets, to maintain the stability and sustainability of public finances, and to strengthen international coordination and cooperation in the field of supervision. The creation of the European Financial Markets Authority is essential to achieving an effective supervision model. However, many other steps need to be taken to prevent a recurrence of the truly immoral situations of the recent past, which have damaged economies, shareholders, depositors, taxpayers and the credibility of the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today’s vote not only establishes EU-level financial supervision, it also represents a landmark for the creation of a new EU financial architecture and stronger regulation of Europe’s financial markets. Europe-wide regulation is the only viable response to the financial challenges we face and to preventing a return to financial chaos. This underlines the relevance of the EU at a time when renationalisation is raising its head. The supervisory authorities will be more important than originally foreseen and have real teeth due to the insistence of the EU Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">A cross-political alliance of MEPs worked to ensure the authorities were given real powers in the face of opposition from some Member States that refused to acknowledge lessons from the financial crisis. Unfortunately, it seems Parliament will have to continue to fight to ensure the new authorities are able to provide meaningful supervision. This means ensuring that the new authorities are sufficiently staffed and that they will have direct supervisory powers over market infrastructure (such as central counterparties and trade repositories). The Greens are already working with the other main political groups to this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this way, artists, writers, composers, authors and creators of all kinds should legitimately be able to receive remuneration for the use of their works, while consumers should have access to a legal and diverse range of content on the Internet. Mrs Gallo’s report, which was put to the vote today, Wednesday 22 September, makes one thing clear: the phenomenon of on-line piracy, against which holders of intellectual property rights appear to be powerless, is becoming widespread. A system for the protection of literary and artistic copyright is therefore required which takes into account the rights and obligations of users, fundamental freedoms and which encourages innovation within a framework of legal clarity as much for the benefit of consumers as of rights holders.

I am also an opponent of criminalising Internet users who exchange files for private use – I think that, as is the case with consumers’ organisations, this is the result of the lack of an option which is clear and legal and which would be easy for Internet users to use. It would be better if we facilitated legal Internet access to protected material, for example, via a platform operating throughout the EU and offering such material free or for a token payment, with advertisers covering the cost of licence payments. Thinking creatively, we need to adapt the law to the realities of the 21st century. In our resolution, which was, unfortunately, rejected, we proposed supporting new economic models which would enable realistic financing as well as clear principles for the distribution of income among authors. The Gallo report is restrictive in its approach to the phenomenon of downloading files from the Internet, penalising this on a par with the production of counterfeit drugs or car parts, which is grossly disproportionate.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed non-legislative measures for improving enforcement of the law are a cause of some concern to me in connection with fundamental rights. I think that in adopting Mrs Gallo’s resolution, Parliament has given a very bad signal to public opinion about how it understands the balance between intellectual property rights and fundamental rights. I hope common sense will return when we discuss proposals for specific legislative acts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While it is true that the alternative resolutions tabled by members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament were not entirely satisfactory either, they had the virtue of ruling out wrong and ill-suited solutions. To be constructive, I nevertheless supported some provisions in favour of combating counterfeiting (in particular, in the area of medicines), of raising young people’s awareness of intellectual property issues, and of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises.

My socialist colleagues and I defended an alternative position which supports an approach that is adapted to current realities, thus protecting consumers’ fundamental freedoms.

It is therefore necessary to appreciate the fact that the Commission pays appropriate attention to this issue in its communication. However, I have several basic objections to the content of the report proposed by Parliament. In contrast to the report, I concur with the view of the Commission, which is of the opinion that the current framework for the promotion of civil rights in the EU is effective and harmonised to the necessary degree for the proper functioning of the internal market and that it is not necessary to adopt any further legislative measures in this respect. I am implacably opposed to any call to create a European legal framework enabling the establishment of possible measures against intellectual property violators. In this matter, I believe it is correct to respect the instruments of Member States. If France has created its instrument in this area embodied in the digital guillotine, I fully respect that. However, I simply do not want to extend such a controversial instrument to the all-European level. I also have numerous reservations about the creation of new institutions such as the Observatory on Counterfeiting and Piracy, just as I have my reservations about the contribution of the multilateral Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) without involving those states that are the greatest source of violations of intellectual property rights.

Without the possibility of reasonable incomes for artists, writers, composers, film-makers, photographers and musicians, we will have a culturally and intellectually poor society, a long way from the green, cultural growth potential that I believe is a basis for a green ideology. I would also like to emphasise that European organisations representing over a million cultural workers in Europe supported the report, including the European Federation of Journalists and the European Writers’ Council. I have been a member of the Union of Swedish Journalists in Sweden for nearly 25 years and have received help many times to protect my copyright from misuse and from being both commercially and artistically violated and taken out of context. During this time, I have also been a member of the organisation ALIS (the Administration of Literary Rights in Sweden). My first choice prior to the vote was to support the alternative report submitted by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, which did not call for common criminal measures and, overall, was more balanced than the Gallo report.

<p class="contents">Intellectual property rights (IPR) deserve no less protection than other rights. Creators and researchers, as well as the companies that market them, are entitled to such protection. The European economy is also based on creativity, research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The acquiescence that certain anarcho-leftists show towards IPR infringements, on the pretext of Internet freedom, cannot be justified. Like libel, defamation or racial hatred, they do not stop being unlawful just because they are carried out on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">IPR infringements must not become acceptable either. The right to private copying already provides adequate safeguards for an individual to hold copies of protected works. We should not, however, accept the voidance of intellectual creators’ rights over their works, not least because piracy and counterfeiting often endanger the health and safety of consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group has therefore also drawn up a counter-resolution. This introduces a better thought-out and more balanced approach to the debate. In my opinion, the relentless criminalisation of Internet users – in the case of music downloads, it mainly concerns children and young people – poses a real danger. One of the significant aspects that is missing in Mrs Gallo’s report is the distinction between non-commercial file sharing and infringements of copyright for commercial purposes. Of course, the ideas of the creative professions must be protected and appropriately remunerated, and those who profit illegally from these ideas must be punished. I believe it is necessary to move away from old-fashioned legal ways of thinking and to find a balance between equal access to knowledge and fair remuneration for services in the fields of music, literature and film. The resolution tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament takes this approach – the report by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), however, does not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While this report is not legally binding, it does lay the foundations for a European reflection on intellectual property in the digital age and emphasises various aspects that I would like to reaffirm. Piracy and file sharing, on a scale of millions of users, have an adverse effect on the cultural economy, on creative industries and on jobs. While the figures we have got are the subject of debate, the issue remains. Therefore, the report is asking the European Commission to provide us with reliable figures. Some claim there is a market failure between the price of cultural works in the legal system and their ‘free’ availability on the Internet. However we must show responsibility. Illegal downloading cannot become legal just by a ‘fundamentalist-right’ sleight of hand for protecting individual freedoms.

Innovation and creativity are encouraged through respect for IPR. Implementation of the Digital Agenda requires both protection for consumer rights and respect for copyright and associated rights. European legislation needs to adapt quickly to technological progress and the evolution of the information society. I believe that Directive 2001/29/EC needs to be reviewed in order to ensure that the legal framework for copyright protection in the information society is harmonised at EU level. This review is necessary as cases have been observed in Member States where the provisions of Articles 5, 6 and 8 in Directive 2001/29/EC have been implemented differently, which has led to different interpretations and decisions from courts in Member States. The Commission and Member States must quickly address the need to develop an internal market by establishing a simple, accessible EU-level licensing framework. As part of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I called for the promotion of facilities offered by digital television, such as subtitling, which enable licensees for a particular work to distribute it in several languages, thereby making it available across the whole EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The cohesion policy is the most effective model for developing regions experiencing difficult conditions, supporting their socio-economic progress directly.</p>
<p class="contents">Although mountain regions and islands have some problems in common, such as difficult access or dependence on a small number of economic activities, these territories do not have the same development constraints. For this reason, I believe that EU support must be adapted according to the specific features of each region. Such targeted strategies would make it easier to achieve real convergence with the rest of the EU and would improve living conditions for a large number of European citizens, 10% of whom live in mountain regions and 3% on islands. It is also important for regions with natural handicaps to make the best use of the financial support granted by the EU through the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund. Some Member States, including Romania, must tangibly improve their system for accessing and implementing European funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a representative of France’s South-West constituency in the European Parliament, and being particularly sensitive to the problems faced by areas in the Pyrenees, I voted for the resolution on the European strategy for economic and social development of mountain regions, islands and sparsely populated areas. In particular, the text calls for the establishment of a specific European policy framework to deal with the problems that these areas face in order to enable them to better overcome the permanent disadvantages and to adapt their development model by making the most of all their assets. It also calls for better coordination of the four structural funds, the Cohesion Fund and the other European financial instruments in order to maximise their effectiveness and thus facilitate the economic development of these areas. I support these objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One such opportunity might be to promote sustainable tourism in the mountain regions, thus creating an important subsistence base for the inhabitants of these areas.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olivier Chastel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of Catherine Ashton (Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy). </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed on behalf of the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, that I have the honour of taking the floor before you.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like straightaway, on her behalf, of course, to assure you that the European Union is concerned about the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, just as, indeed, it condemns the deterioration in the situation facing the country’s human rights activists, as evidenced by the recent attacks and assaults on them. In the context of these concerns, the issue of sexual violence assumes a particularly alarming dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the Democratic Republic of Congo has been on the precipice and is still, moreover, in the grip of conflicts, which, although contained, are very tragic for the people. It must, in fact, undertake a considerable amount of work in order to rebuild itself successfully. Obviously, all of the issues facing this country can be set back in their difficult context, but it remains impossible to justify them all.</p>
<p class="contents">In their report of 8 March, the seven independent United Nations experts thus condemned the lack of progress made as regards the human rights situation in the country and, more specifically, noted that the government should step up its efforts. Protecting the rights and safety of the people, in the broadest sense of the term, is a country’s core responsibility. They must therefore be the main priorities in the drive towards reconstructing and consolidating the rule of law in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">A few weeks ago, in Luvungi, the people from the North Kivu Province, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, were once again witnesses or victims of disgraceful gang rapes perpetrated over a period of days by criminal gangs, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and their local allies, the Mayi-Mayi. The latest figures in our possession, and confirmed by the United Nations, record at least 500 victims.</p>
<p class="contents">This tragedy, which is, unfortunately, only one of many, absolutely must lead the authorities to step up their efforts in order to better protect the civilian populations, reach political agreements that will bring stability to the region, and thus eliminate the harmful elements that terrorise the Kivu Province. This tragedy also highlights, in the worst possible way, the extent of the work to be done before progress is ultimately made on the basic issues, such as security reform, without which the rule of law cannot be consolidated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is indeed inconceivable that the Congolese Government can regain control of its territory without an army, police force or judicial system that is well trained, well regulated and well remunerated. If the Democratic Republic of Congo must assume its responsibilities – and do so at all levels – then the international community must also do the same. The UN Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon, has fully appreciated this, since an investigation has been launched into why MONUSCO failed to act, given that its mandate is focused on the protection of the people. We must hope that MONUSCO becomes stronger as a result of this, because it still has a vital role to play over there.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the following question must be asked: what can the European and international courts do? Mrs Wallström, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, calls for the culprits to be brought to justice. We fully support this appeal in line with the joint declaration of 27 August by the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, and the European Commissioner for Development, Andris Piebalgs.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, if there is one general issue which the tragedy in Luvungi has raised, it is that of impunity. Indeed, the rebels are not the only ones committing crimes. We have discovered equally reprehensible behaviour among the law enforcement authorities. Therefore, the real challenge in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the functioning of its judicial institutions. It is obvious that most of the efforts to be made can only be conceived in the framework of long-term action. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that in the fight against impunity, as in all other cases, people generally expect examples to come from the top.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, and to mention just one case, the investigation currently under way into the assassination of the human rights activist, Mr Floribert Chebeya Bahizire, is undoubtedly a test case, because it is symbolic of the internal contradictions sometimes facing the DRC.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that the European Union is following this case very closely and, in the wake of the death of this human rights activist, the Union, through the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, called for the Democratic Republic of Congo’s authorities to shed light on what happened.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to point out how much the European Union is supporting, and will continue to support, the Democratic Republic of Congo in this fight for justice and against impunity. To this end, the support of the international community, and especially of the European Union and its Member States, in the electoral process, which will take place between 2011 and 2013, will be particularly important for establishing a political environment based on democratic principles and on the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have formally supported within the United Nations the appointment of a Human Rights Council independent expert to support the Congolese Government’s efforts along these lines. Unfortunately, our efforts have not yet come to anything. We hope to be able to continue talks with the Congolese authorities to make progress on this front.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the European Union will continue to be involved in cooperation efforts in the areas of justice, policing, defence, human rights, and also, of course, victim support. The European Union is ready to step up this operation within the framework of a genuine dialogue with the Democratic Republic of Congo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapes committed at the end of July and the beginning of August, although horrific in themselves, are just one episode in a whole series of tragic events. Every month, over 1 000 women become the victims of rape in Congo, and tens of thousands of children are soldiers. Sexual violence is a method which is intended to terrorise and punish the people living in Congo who do not support the right side in the conflict. Sexual violence is so widespread that the organisation <span class="italic">Médecins Sans Frontières</span> says that 75% of all rapes worldwide are committed in eastern Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem also involves the fact that the largest UN peacekeeping force in the world – MONUSCO – is doing very little to control this phenomenon. The disputes over when MONUSCO learned of these recent rapes – if it was five days, two weeks or one week after they occurred – are lamentable. There was a MONUSCO base 10 miles from the site of these rapes, and the main method of preventing sexual violence in use by the UN is to put notices on buildings saying that rape is inhuman. We will not put an end to this phenomenon by this method. To make matters worse, UN soldiers were themselves involved in a sex-related scandal several years ago, and were, for example, accused of forcing young girls into prostitution. It may be that the problem goes even deeper and that, in fact, MONUSCO does not have the will to fight this destructive phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be resolute in this matter. It must concentrate on giving help to the victims. The matter is urgent, because at the beginning of December in Kinshasa, we are going to have an ACP-European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and this singular culture of impunity and helplessness – I agree with the Belgian Presidency – must be ended, because we are going to have to look each other in the face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is impossible to speak on behalf of those children who have been recruited into militia and forced to club to death adults and children like themselves, and who have become veritable sex slaves too. The sexual genocide, which continues to take place behind the scenes in Congo, with tens of thousands of victims every year, today is beyond mere words. We really are beyond words.</p>
<p class="contents">What is clear, however, is that all the instruments – legislative texts, reform projects for the armed forces, international missions, financial support and the mobilisation of the whole Community – are in place. And the impunity continues; appalling impunity when a criminal such as Bosco Ntaganda, far from being punished, lands an important job within the Congolese administration. We demand that justice be served. This culture of impunity cannot continue just for the sake of appeasement.</p>
<p class="contents">What exactly does it mean to judge these crimes? It means carrying out investigations, reforming the judiciary, paying soldiers properly, and prosecuting the guilty parties, including those who have instigated the massacres, no matter how high their position. For our own countries, it also means not supplying the rebels and their mercenaries with weapons and not participating with them in dubious dealings in illegal minerals. This is why we support Mrs Wallström and call for the Commission to examine the possibility of a European law that would be based on the new US law, the Congo Conflicts Mineral Act. This means that we will no longer stand for our mobile telephones, our computers and, tomorrow, our hybrid cars being manufactured with minerals sold illegally and derived from conflicts. These minerals are blood minerals, just as there were blood diamonds. Moreover, our relations with the Congolese Government will depend, Presidents, on the way in which the zero tolerance policy on violence against women is applied – a policy which, I might add, was introduced by the Congolese Government itself.</p>

I am sorry to say that, in view of the little progress that has been made in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), we must condemn the serious setbacks and failures. Everything, or almost everything, remains to be done in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than being in a position to guarantee stability in that crippled country, the United Nations representatives in the DRC are having to report extremely serious human rights violations. In this case, it is not a question of a few exceptional acts of violence perpetrated by a few exceptional individuals, which, in itself, would be absolutely reprehensible; no, what is happening in the DRC cannot be limited to a few exceptional citizens who are exposed, without any defence, to the perpetrators of sexual violence. I am afraid to say that, here, we are dealing with a phenomenon that extends beyond individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the corroborating information concerning the events that took place in the DRC between 30 July and 4 August put these crimes on another scale. Atul Khare, United Nations Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, has confirmed that some 500 people – women, children and babies – have been victims of rape.</p>
<p class="contents">We can no longer simply condemn these odious crimes. We have to go even further and identify those responsible, bring them to justice, deter potential criminals, but also tackle the causes and tackle the backdrop against which many more of the incidents we condemn may occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Tackling the causes cannot, under any circumstances, be interpreted as a mitigating circumstance for the perpetrators of sexual violence. A military and police response is certainly needed to deal with all these challenges, at least in the short term, but other responses are needed too. In fact, we are dealing with a state crisis. I choose my words carefully – we are dealing with a crisis in a country that no longer manages to exercise its sovereign functions including, notably, the guarantee of security that citizens of all countries can enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">The response must come simultaneously from the DRC, the African Union, the United Nations and the international community. With regard to all the elements that may constitute solutions to the problems facing the Congolese population, nothing whatsoever can replace the responsibility of the DRC authorities. However, at the same time, we must stand by them and support them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that all the reports say the same thing. They are all unbearable, intolerable, both individually and, most of all, collectively. Moreover, all these acts of violence are clearly aimed at purging, humiliating and, ultimately, eradicating a population, by depriving it of its dignity and its reason for living.</p>
<p class="contents">So, for all these reasons, I think we have to be able to react even more forcefully. It is true that the situation in Congo is now even more difficult on all fronts, not only as regards the acts of violence perpetrated against women, but on other fronts as well. Mr Chastel, you talked about the daily lives of countless Congolese, about the issue of human rights in general, not just the rights of women, and about human rights defenders. I would like to say that I see a direct link, obviously, between this violence against women and a series of crimes which are also still going unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">The pillaging of natural resources still largely goes unpunished. Reference was made, in fact, to US legislation, from which inspiration could be drawn here in Europe. However, I also believe that the issue of impunity for the pillaging of natural resources is absolutely crucial. It is crucial because today, even the undertaking made by the Congolese President, Mr Kabila, to prohibit their export is ultimately very harmful, particularly for all the small diggers who live on nothing but that. It is harmful because it actually serves no purpose; it is something of a smoke screen, since we know full well that the Congolese armed forces, or at least some of them, are linked not only to the rape of women but also to the pillaging of resources and the corruption organised around it.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters, then, are not just the laws or decisions of a government but also the capacity to apply them and to implement them. It is important for a government to be able to exercise its powers.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think, by way of conclusion – and many of us will soon be in Kinshasa to meet with the ACP countries – that, in order to both assist and support the useful, positive forces within Congo, be they governmental, community, human rights or other forces, we will send out a double message: a message of support to those who want to develop the culture of justice and of combating impunity, and also a message concerning the political forces and their capacity to equip themselves with the means to ensure real governance at all stages: when establishing security, applying laws, implementing a series of decisions and, quite simply, establishing the credibility, ultimately, of those elected. Indeed, four years after the elections we all wanted, financed and supported, it is important not only to condemn, but also to encourage any action that will enable the real, specific exercise of government authority and democracy in general. Moreover, I think that violence against women and violence against human rights defenders are two extremely important aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that the trial of those responsible for Mr Chebeya’s death will, in principle, take place in September. In view also of his family’s suffering, I think that we really need to pay a great deal of attention to ensuring that this trial is truly symbolic of the desire to solve this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">But the DRC’s fragility as a nation state is also due to decades of corruption, political repression and sporadic armed conflict, both internally and with neighbouring states, where atrocious crimes such as mass rape have been carried out. The deterioration began under the kleptocratic and murderous regime of President Mobutu and has continued to the present day. President Kabila has at least held a general election to give the impression to the outside world of instituting democratic reform, but in reality, he controls all the levers of power and, in particular, access to the country’s vast natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The increasing interest of some countries, particularly China, in exploiting these resources has emboldened the Kabila regime to neglect its responsibilities regarding human rights and the rule of law. China itself has a lamentable human rights record and, at the UN, actually defends the actions of countries like the DRC with which it does business. It is therefore no surprise to me that, of the three trials under way at the International Criminal Court, all involve nationals of the DRC.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this alarming situation, the African Union refuses to condemn or pressurise Kabila to live up to his constitutional obligations. The EU, to its credit, has no such qualms, and I welcome the tough approach taken by the High Representative, Baroness Ashton.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to reiterate the call I have made several times already in this House for the Kimberley Process to be extended to cover other key natural resources in Africa. Human rights abuses in Africa, which are all too common regrettably, are often linked to competition for the control of mineral resources. The Kimberley Process has been hugely successful in curtailing the trade in conflict or blood diamonds, and I believe a similar approach should now be considered for other extractive industries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In June, we adopted a resolution to condemn the murder of Floribert Chebeya and expressed concern about the disappearance of Fidèle Bazana Edadi. Since then, another human rights defender, Salvator Muhindo Vunoka, has been assassinated. Minister, you can add him to your list. This summer, it took the gang rape of several hundred people for the UN to decide to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said that the MONUSCO peacekeeping force, which is in Congo to protect civilians, humanitarian personnel and human rights defenders, and to help combat impunity, was just a few kilometres from where these rapes were being committed, and it took no action.</p>
<p class="contents">Ban Ki-moon himself took exception to the passivity of the MONUSCO troops. The Congolese Government has finally been challenged by UN officials. A new report was due to be published in early October on the violence committed, but on the violence committed between 1996 and 2003. What a waste of time! How many more victims must be killed, raped and tortured? How many more children must be forcibly conscripted before the international community takes note of the situation and acts accordingly?</p>
<p class="contents">I feel like asking: what is Europe doing? Huge sums have been invested in Congo. EUSEC and EUPOL missions are there. In addition to humanitarian aid, one of the European Union’s most important objectives is, on paper, to train the security forces there and to help reform the country’s security.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the results of these policies? The DRC is a large country; it is Africa’s third largest country in terms of population. It is a country with enormous wealth potential, but 80% of its population lives below the poverty line. What is worse, it is becoming ever poorer due to rampant corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">There is just one thing I would like to ask you: how long are we going to allow this situation to continue with complete impunity? As you said, Minister, we know that the security forces are also involved in the violence. Do you not think it is time to take a different stance?</p>
<p class="contents">I imagine that things are not straightforward in the Council of Ministers, where a few big European countries, or at least their political representatives, whose commitment to human rights we are all aware of, are not really open to genuine intervention because they are able to roll out the red carpet for Mr Kabila.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, you can count on the European Parliament to take the measures that are needed, and please stop allowing the economic interests of the few to prevail, without a thought for the civilian populations that cannot take any more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we look back, we can see that these last 50 years have been disgracefully besmirched with blood right up to the present day.</p>
<p class="contents">The horrific events in the North Kivu region this summer simply corroborate this. When we read that 25 soldiers from the UN mission should have prevented it, this also raises the issue of logistics. Twenty thousand UN soldiers, with the professionals and experts saying that at least 60 000 would be needed to maintain some form of order: what a problem!</p>
<p class="contents">I have the following question for the Council and the Commission. Exactly what efforts have the EUSEC and EUPOL missions in North and South Kivu been making to increase security for the local population and to prosecute the perpetrators of this summer’s atrocities?</p>
<p class="contents">The troubles are taking place exactly where the DRC’s richest resources are located. The Congolese mines have a potential of USD 24 billion, recent sources claim. According to a press report from the Congolese Government at the beginning of September, mining operations in Kivu had been shut down immediately because armed groups had been exploiting the mines illegally, sometimes backed by government authorities. On the surface of it, this is a good start, but how is this being enforced? However, there are also rumours going round that the Congolese Government is expropriating foreign investors’ mining projects, only to sell them on to its own foreign business partners.</p>
<p class="contents">My questions to the Council are these. What influence can the EU missions on the ground wield to curb illegal mining? Also, can you confirm that the illegal exploitation of mines has been stopped, and how can this be enforced, possibly with the aid of the EU missions on the ground? I sincerely hope that the European Union will work on the vital reinforcement of the UN mission there, since this is something that is urgently needed. If I am not mistaken, and to read the press reports, the Congolese Government is currently making efforts to bring this to an end, which would have a dramatic impact on the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither is the case: if only it were.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember the independence of the Belgian Congo in 1960, when I was still at school. I recall the kidnapping and arrest of Patrice Lumumba within months of independence. I still remember vividly the coverage of him being thrown roughly into the back of a lorry, never to be seen again. Decades of fratricidal instability, dictatorship and civil war have followed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Congo has not been a special case in Africa. A peaceful democracy would be more difficult to find. If I were to follow the prescriptive, ‘nurture’ explanation, I would have to say there must be something in the water. However, there is another explanation.</p>
<p class="contents">In Africa in general, if not particularly in the Congo, when the colonists drew straight lines on the maps of Africa, they ignored the differences between different tribes and peoples. Each country, on independence, contained enormous vertical ethnic, linguistic or religious divisions in the body politic, which always inject political instability.</p>
<p class="contents">This is as true of Belgium as it is of the former Belgian Congo. The only difference is that Belgium has escaped the political violence. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Bosnia and Croatia where there have been as many killings, if not the same gratuitous sadism.</p>
<p class="contents">If vertical divisions in political states lead to instability, and sometimes to violence, why are we creating the same vertical divisions in Europe by uncontrolled immigration from the Third World in general, and Africa in particular? We were not content to leave Africa with unworkable political societies. We are busy recreating the same problems in the European heartlands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking, today, about violence against the weakest, in particular, against women, who are being raped, and against children, who, among other things, are being forced to join an army – an illegal army. We are talking about rape, torture and murder. We are talking about violence whose perpetrators, worst of all, are going unpunished, and we are talking about violence which has become so commonplace that it is difficult even to speak of any kind of cultural or other kind of consent. We are talking about rapes which are being committed by partisans, but also by soldiers of the army and by civilians. We are talking about women who do not have anyone to defend them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget the fact that – paradoxically – we are debating a region which is one of the most unfortunate yet also one of the richest in terms of natural resources in Africa and the world. These resources should be more than enough to meet the needs of all the people who live there. We must not forget that this is a further stage in the misfortunes which, according to estimates, have cost the lives of tens of thousands of people in the last ten years and have also involved around two hundred thousand instances of rape. We can only guess at how many rapes have gone unreported.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is the subject of profound concern, not least at meetings of this Parliament’s Subcommittee on Human Rights. The question arises as to the effectiveness of the work of the United Nations and about the way in which crimes committed both by partisans and by others are going unpunished – crimes which must be brought before a court. The judicial system must take action. I think the meeting of the ACP and the European Parliament is also the perfect occasion to cut short this inhumane situation. Since we are dealing with a crisis in the state of Congo, it is the international community which must take the initiative. It is also our role – the European Parliament’s role – to be speaking about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation is indeed dramatic and drastic, and I think it was very well described by my colleague, Véronique De Keyser, in her speech. Despite this, I would also like to draw attention in this context to the highly alarming reports from international non-governmental organisations. These actually talk about systematic organised attacks on communities under the control of armed units with the aim of raping local women. Just over a month ago, more than 150 civilian women were raped in 13 villages. All of this, ladies and gentlemen, took place only a few months after the UN Security Council renewed the mandate of its mission in the Congo with the aim of helping the government to protect civilians from human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">Another paradoxical aspect of this situation is that sexual violence is perpetrated by all sides in the conflict, including government forces, which is absolutely unacceptable, and I would therefore like to ask the representatives of European institutions one more time to exert all possible diplomatic and other pressure, including pressure via the United Nations and its mission in the Congo, to put an end to these practices. You should be in no doubt that you have the full support of the European Parliament in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is particularly alarming that violence and a readiness to resort to violence are continuing to increase despite the presence of the European Union and the United Nations. We have been engaged in various missions in Congo for many years. We therefore also bear a certain amount of the responsibility, particularly in the case of acts committed or tolerated by groups that we formally support. There is a Congolese saying that goes: a cat can enter the monastery, but it nevertheless remains a cat. Applied to the security apparatus, this means that you can put a uniform on criminals, but that does not mean that they will not commit any more crimes – far from it, in fact. That is exactly our problem. We need to make it unequivocally clear to the Congolese Government that we will not tolerate this behaviour and the covering up of such behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone in this House agrees that the situation in Congo is deteriorating. I would point out that we carried out an election observation mission there in 2006. Since then, there can hardly be said to have been any progress in the country’s democratisation process. The Council and the Commission should consider carefully whether or not we should send a new full mission there and monitor this election process differently this time. I believe that the prerequisites for a full election observation mission are anything but favourable. That would also be the wrong signal to send to a government that systematically disregards the rules as well as the recommendations of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Countries in Europe have never had a need for, or envisaged scope for, a law that challenges responsibility in the supply chain. What is so remarkable at this point in time is that the United States have, finally, done just that. We have done nothing – simply because we were afraid of competition from China and the United States. Yet what did we see last summer? A law in the United States that calls for transparency, that requires companies to notify the use of precious metals from the DRC or neighbouring countries. The Hewlett-Packards and the IBMs of this world are having to adapt to this. We should follow the United States’ example and introduce our own version of this law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, when we look at development in some of these countries after those fifty years, unfortunately, we do not have many grounds for optimism. The same holds true for the Democratic Republic of the Congo. If it wants to be a partner of the European Union fifty years after winning independence from the former Belgian colonial power, and to be a fully fledged member of the international community, it must be actively committed to the prevention of the appalling crimes committed there in recent weeks; it must maintain human rights and provide for the rule of law on the entire territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">In cooperation with the UN, as well as with the African Union, the EU should pay its respects to the victims of violence in the Congo. It should do so, amongst other measures, by contributing to the disarming of military groups which carry out attacks on the Congolese population from neighbouring countries, from Rwanda, southern Sudan, and Uganda. We should also demonstrate that we are able to take action and here, I call on the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Baroness Ashton, to present a concrete EU action plan in the fight to maintain human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the occasion of the session of the Mixed Parliamentary Assembly of the ACP-EU in Kinshasa in December. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the 21st century, it is an inadmissible fact that killings, rape and child abuse are commonly used as a weapon of war while UN forces are present in the area. In the last five years, the number of just the documented cases has grown 20 times in the Congo. Women’s and children’s lives are in danger; their human rights are totally neglected and they are deprived of human dignity. Moreover, they can no longer integrate into their traditional community, which leads to the destruction of social infrastructure as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community has to admit officially that mass rape in the Congo is a war crime against humanity. There is a need for a concerted response to maintain pressure on the perpetrators of these rapes and to bring them to justice at local level or in the International Criminal Court. I welcome the fact that the EUSEC RDC has just been extended until 30 September 2012 and, hopefully, EUPOL RDC will be renewed as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Specialised personnel should be deployed to assign criminal investigation. Further support should be ensured by the European initiative for democracy and human rights. Further action should be taken, such as the provision of peacekeepers with mobile phones, the improvement of communication between the MONUSCO peacekeeping force and the local population, and a strengthening of the commitment to tackle rebel groups. Humanitarian agencies must be supported so they can reach the civil population in need of assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the government should bring into effect its own recently declared zero tolerance policy and should establish the National Committee of Human Rights, as laid down in the constitution.

<p class="contents">Little did we know that but a few weeks later, within twenty miles of an international peace keeping force in the area of Luvungi, the town would be put under siege and some 500 women and children subjected to repeated and horrific sexual violence.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Parliament, where we have decried the failure to offer protection in Rwanda and Srebrenica, we cannot and must not stay silent. We should commend the UN Assistant Secretary-General for accepting that the UN had failed and is partially responsible. But we should also challenge the UN to investigate why local warnings in advance, delivered by motorcycle taxi drivers, went unheeded; why the UN base did not have access to local language interpretation; and how the rules of engagement continue to hinder the effectiveness of its peacekeeping force.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, I would ask all Member States of the United Nations and every Member State of our European Union what has happened to the fine words we all voted on concerning the UN’s responsibility to protect. I commend what Mr Chastel has said this afternoon about bringing the perpetrators to justice, but in the report imminently to be produced by the UN itself, we need a meaningful justice system for a decade of crimes in Eastern DRC.</p>
<p class="contents">President, I also express agreement with the others in this debate who have condemned the corrosive corruption which afflicts the plundering of the DRC’s rich mineral resources. But most of all in this debate, we should say that there are no explanations, no excuses, no extenuating circumstances which can in any way justify sexual violence as a weapon of war, and that our foremost concern should be for those 500 women victims who all of us failed to protect.

Nevertheless, it is to be welcomed that the newly established position of Special Representative for Sexual Violence in Conflict at the UN, taken up by Mrs Wallström, has already articulated this responsibility, and we can still hope that the crimes will be unequivocally cleared up.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you of the fact that in February this year, we had an exhibition in Parliament presented by Medica Mondiale, which maintains a network of mobile gynaecological clinics in eastern Congo, and a woman came here from eastern Congo who had experienced many terrible things but who had nevertheless found the strength to organise the women there. She later called for the local EU embassy to also go to eastern Congo, for it to work with the NGOs and the women there in the witness protection programmes, and for crimes to be prosecuted, and she told us that they desperately need support in connection with income projects, medical aid and aid for victims of trauma. She also called on the EU to help in the building of prisons, because when people are arrested, it is not possible to imprison them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every society protects their weak and most vulnerable, so to hear such horrible news must be devastating to every decent human being. The rape of least 179 women and children is truly a crime on a massive scale and must not be repeated ever – certainly not as a weapon of war as was the case in the DRC.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must assist in bringing all the perpetrators to justice. News of severe punishments has to penetrate every community in the DRC and go beyond its borders. Indeed, such news must travel globally so that these horrible acts of mass-scale rapes, used as a weapon of war, can be successfully eradicated.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that developed countries have fewer crimes and that some heinous crimes simply do not exist in them. One way in which the EU can assist is through well-functioning economic partnership agreements in the region. These should help the whole of Africa grab their reasonable share of global commerce. At the same time, accelerated development will begin the process of eradication of poverty and, most certainly, that of the type of crime that happened in early August in the DRC to at least 179 defenceless victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The actual number is far higher than we know, because the women are unable to assert their rights and therefore often do not report what has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">Rape is a seriously traumatising crime which results in deep psychological and often physical harm. If rapes remain unpunished, they become a permanent fixture in a violent daily life in society, even in post-war times. The mass rapes that took place between 30 July and 4 August 2010 in North Kivu demonstrate that the developments in the DRC are too low on the international community’s agenda. However, these crimes cannot be allowed to remain unpunished. We owe that to the victims and also to the future of the DRC as a whole. The Congolese Government needs to make every effort to bring the perpetrators to justice, and a certain amount of doubt would not be misplaced. Impunity must not be allowed to become the norm, however.</p>
<p class="contents">This drama also makes it painfully clear that the relationship between the UN mission and the local population leaves a lot to be desired. It is essential that the presence of MONUSCO in the region be evaluated. It has remained passive in this drama. An independent enquiry is now called for to investigate the facts surrounding these mass rapes. The presence of the mission is and remains necessary, but it is essential that MONUSCO carry out its full mandate and offer the local population the protection it so desperately needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The shocking events of the last two months and the rapes of hundred of women and children – both boys and girls – show that Kinshasa is not coping with the systematically organised rebel aggression. Rape has become a common weapon of war in Congo. The recent rapes were committed by fighters not far from international UN forces who are stationed in the area and who are, in reality, the only effective stabilising force in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Kinshasa must put an end to the prevailing impunity and must guarantee the security of the civilian population, mount an effective fight against spreading corruption and finally establish a true army with properly trained soldiers. Congo is rich in mineral deposits, but unfortunately has fallen victim to its own wealth. In this country of ten million people, three quarters of the population earn less than a dollar a day, while the country has become a part of Africa where natural riches are being looted. The illegal race for natural resources is driving Congo into poverty, chaos and humanitarian disaster. The international community must bring about a dramatic resolution to the conflict, and international concerns must guarantee that the natural resources they use are legally sourced.

Instead of handing him over to the court, the Kabila government promoted him to a top position in the Congolese army.</p>
<p class="contents">This behaviour by the Congolese authorities, which is in breach of their obligations as a signatory to the Cotonou Agreement, encourages a sense of impunity and accounts for the barbarities that continue to take place in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). These include the mass rape of 500 women and children, including babies, in the mining district of North Kivu in August this year, when MONUSCO, the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in the DRC, shamefully failed to take any action, as Atul Khare, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations, has confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">The corruption and impunity in the DRC account for the appalling conduct of the rebels – who are in the service of neighbouring governments – and of the government authorities and UN forces. We will not effectively fight corruption and impunity in the DRC until we tackle head on the issue of illegal mineral extraction and trading, which funds the armed groups and feeds the conflict and the human rights violations, as shown by the murder of Floribert Chebeya.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the UN Security Council urgently need to adopt measures along the lines of those proposed in the recent US law on conflict minerals, identifying Congolese, European, US, Chinese and transnational companies that thrive on the exploitation of the rebel-controlled mines, as well as those abandoned by the government.</p>
<p class="contents">Naming and shaming is not enough, however. It is vital to ban and clamp down on the marketing and use of those minerals in technical equipment, jewellery and other products in common use throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, we must also reinforce our EU advisory and assistance mission for security reform (EUSEC) and our European police mission (EUPOL) in the DRC and give them the means to make a real difference in the area of security. To achieve that, the gender perspective must be prioritised in terms of training and action through the involvement of female members of the Congolese Parliament and Congolese women’s organisations, not only in victim protection and assistance, but also as decisive actors in building peace, fostering respect for the law and fighting corruption and human rights violations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, a conflict that has lasted as long as the conflict in Congo, an army partly composed of children, and rape used as one of the chief weapons of war, all show that we are facing the utter denial of the rule of law. The most recent example dates back to 28 July, when gang rapes were perpetrated in North Kivu.</p>
<p class="contents">For years, the psychological, physical and social destruction of women has been part of everyday life for thousands of Congolese. It is time to sound the alarm, because what is happening now is that the rape of civilians outside conflict zones is becoming widespread and the norm. Combating the culture of impunity must be a priority. At local and national levels, there needs to be better communication with the people because, without the genuine participation of civil society, the decisions and measures taken will be constantly met with distrust by the people. The Congolese must, at all costs, feel that they are agents of change.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it must be ensured that, in the security forces and state institutions, the former perpetrators do not become the new judges. The next elections in 2011 are an opportunity for new projects to be launched. Establishing a parliamentary commission on human rights, continuing the reform of the judiciary by putting particular emphasis on the protection of victims, combating corruption, and paying special attention to the profit reaped from the extraction of, and trade in, minerals, represent major challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">At European and international levels, and in the light of recent events, there must be a reassessment and a re-examination of the human, technical and financial resources deployed within the framework of the EUSEC and EUPOL missions. An in-depth review of the instruments to support the restructuring of the institutional, legal and economic systems, as well as improved coordination with the United Nations’ instruments, will help to stabilise the country in the long term. Without defending human rights and the rule of law, a Republic has no democracy. Let us ensure that this situation does not continue because, in the final analysis, it is democracy itself that is under attack. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a sign of major concern about this issue, but we have to admit, of ineffectiveness as well. We condemned back in 2008 the use of rape as a weapon of war. Now we have the UN estimating that the average number of rapes reported during the first quarter of this year was 14 a day. At the end of July and the beginning of August, more than 500 women were added to this sinister tally, as victims of mass rape in just five days.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that UN troops from the most expensive peacekeeping force in the world found out only two weeks after these atrocities took place, even though there is a military base just 30 kilometres away, speaks volumes about the UN mission’s failure to put an end to this violent conflict with huge regional implications.</p>
<p class="contents">This worsening of the atrocities preceded, by a twist of fate, the report from the UN’s High Commission for Human Rights. Since then, however, millions of Congolese have been victims of harsh violations of basic rights, while the impunity of the perpetrators has generally continued with a vengeance.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that an extensive investigation is needed which will determine the responsibility for the mass crimes, including those carried out by neighbouring countries also involved in the conflict, particularly Rwanda. Genocide took place in the Great Lakes Region in 1994 and some of the culprits are answering for their actions in front of the International Criminal Court for Rwanda. I believe that imposing the force of law is one of the key requirements for halting the conflicts and massacres. Peace is not possible without justice. This is also borne out by the experiences in the former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone and Cambodia. This is why I believe that the UN report must provide a springboard for creating an International Criminal Court for the Democratic Republic of Congo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that women and children are the most vulnerable population groups in conflict zones, and that women are the ones suffering the most from the devastating consequences of the current events.</p>
<p class="contents">Rape is becoming uncontrolled in Congo, as my colleague says. It is used as a weapon of war to terrorise, attack, destroy and humiliate the civilian population. It would simply be unacceptable, a moral failure on our part, to close our eyes and ignore the situation. We have been talking too long without any efficient action.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that the EU and Member States will be able to specifically address this issue in their future action concerning the situation in Congo. We should prioritise help and support services at local level by means of the EU’s humanitarian and development assistance. Unfortunately, the use of rape as a weapon of war is a shameful crime that is not only happening in Congo. I firmly believe that combating sexual violence against women and girls in conflict zones has to be a top priority of our EU foreign affairs and humanitarian policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I spoke of extreme urgency, combating impunity and reassessing the MONUC mission. The same statements are being made and repeated, as are calls for the international community and the Congolese authorities to take action. In the meantime, nothing has changed. Tragically, the violence is getting worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Are we aware that there are reports of hundreds of innocent victims being sacrificed, people humiliated, assaulted, and sometimes even mutilated? The situation is deteriorating and the failures are mounting: the failure of a state whose primary responsibility is to protect its people, the failure of MONUC and now of MONUSCO, which does not seem to have taken any preventive or reactive action in response to the mass rapes perpetrated this summer in North and South Kivu.</p>
<p class="contents">How much longer will the international community allow this to happen? The acts perpetrated today are the result of a war that has gone on too long. It is true that the next mapping report of the United Nations High Commissioner on the human rights situation between 1993 and 2003 will confirm what we all know: the enormous scale of the crimes committed in the DRC in the past. However, what is important today is the present. It is high time that account were taken of all the crimes committed in the DRC, including sexual violence, which has also been committed on an historic scale. The zero tolerance promised by Joseph Kabila must go hand in hand with zero impunity. All those responsible for human rights abuses must be held to account and, in certain cases, brought before the International Criminal Court. With regard to earlier events, like Mrs Creţu, I urge once again that an international criminal court be established for the DRC. It is our responsibility and that of the international community to ensure that justice is obtained for the hundreds of thousands of victims, past and present, whoever they are, who have fallen over so many years in that long-suffering country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Sexual violence against women is often used as a weapon of war and spares no one. The figures are disconcerting: approximately 1 100 cases of rape are recorded every month. We have just recalled that during last July and August, 500 women were raped, in evidence of the fact that the actions carried out by the UN peacekeeping force are proving inadequate, as my colleague, Mrs Matera, pointed out just a little while ago.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation must end. The number of victims is only increasing, day after day. The culture of impunity and the reality of a terribly weak, if not non-existent, legal system are the reason for the scant importance attributed by the government to the problem of sexual violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that there are more silent victims than those who have the courage to tell the facts. The atrocities that accompany sexual violence make victims incapable of carrying out many of their daily activities and the tools of social integration are still lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">This spiral of violence must stop, and we must all do more to ensure this.

It is actually true that if we look at the figures made available to us by various organisations, we can only see barbarity, horror and unacceptable suffering. Fourteen women a day have been raped during the first quarter, several hundred women and children were subjected to torture between 30 July and 2 August, and there have been 200 000 victims of acts of sexual violence between 1996 and now.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, there is unbearable suffering behind all these figures, all the more so as we are 10 years on since UN Security Council Resolution 1325 was adopted. I believe that we must think about imposing sanctions against the leaders of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Rwanda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like, too, to thank them for describing the situation in the Congo in such concrete terms, because we need to remind ourselves of how difficult the situation in that country still is.</p>
<p class="contents">A very clear message has been sent to the Commission that the stabilisation, consolidation and further improvement of the rule of law and handling of the human rights situation in the DRC must remain a high-level priority for the European Union, for the High Representative, and for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue its support to the Congolese authorities and the Congolese population through the different instruments that we have at our disposal, including development cooperation and the European Initiative for Human Rights and Democracy, to name just two.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, the Commission will pursue its intervention in structural justice reform, where 40 million euros have already been allocated and where we have been working since 2003. Various other programmes are also being developed to strengthen even further the capacity of the judiciary to achieve a strong and accountable justice system which will contribute to ending impunity, which we all agree is totally intolerable for the future.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />The Commission is following closely the situation with regard to human rights defenders in the country through our experts on the ground, and will continue to do so. We are also, notably, supporting different civil society organisations working in this domain. We therefore appointed a specific liaison officer in Kinshasa to follow up the implementation of the EU guidelines on human rights defenders.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the terrible crimes and sexual violence, the Commission will continue its action to fight against this violence and globally support implementation of the Congolese national strategy against sexual violence. I fully agree with you that we have to determine if this strategy is working and see how we can engage our international partners to achieve better results in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, today’s debate has proved that, despite the enormous efforts of the European Union, terrible violence in the DRC still continues, and we are all aware that the problem is enormous. Therefore, we must work more efficiently in the future; we must look for ways to better encourage African and international partners to focus on this issue so that we will not have a repetition of this very sad debate in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, as regards MONUSCO, many of you have referred to its role, or rather its passiveness. We have warned against the premature withdrawal of MONUSCO on several occasions in order to avoid a vacuum and the possibility of even greater deterioration of security in the areas affected by the conflicts. Generally speaking, beyond the atrocities committed, we can only welcome the way in which the United Nations has handled the issue of extending the mandate of the UN mission in the DRC. As you know, while the new mandate was being discussed in the United Nations, for its part, the Congolese Government was insisting on a partial withdrawal. The Security Council therefore agreed to reduce the mission by 2 000 UN peacekeepers on 30 June 2010, bringing the number of soldiers on the ground down from 21 500 to 19 500, but resisted pressure from Kinshasa to commit to a further decrease.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of today’s debate, we think that responsibilities need to be established and we welcome the fact that the United Nations is taking a long, hard look at its own failings. However, we need to understand the difficult context in which MONUSCO works and, in all likelihood, call for better coordination between the DRC authorities and the UN. We believe that abolishing MONUSCO at this time would significantly aggravate the situation of the people and compromise the stabilisation process in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns what the European Union is ultimately doing to support reform of the judiciary and the fight against impunity and, especially, against sex crimes. Commissioner Šefčovič spoke about this a few moments ago. It is true that the European Union is taking action at several levels, including through EUPOL and EUSEC. I have something more to add, because I think that the means developed by our institutions are neither meagre nor minimal, but there is probably scope to assess how they are used. Moreover, on this point, the Political and Security Committee, the PSC, which is chaired by the Belgian Ambassador, Walter Stevens, will travel to the DRC in the coming weeks to evaluate these two missions.</p>
<p class="contents">The third, and final, point is that Mr Tarabella and other Members have quite rightly stressed the importance of tackling the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the DRC because of its link with the violence there, since this traffic helps to finance certain rebel movements. It is an issue that the EU is monitoring closely. Moreover, as a number of you have suggested, we are going to analyse the US legislation recently adopted on this subject, which has been mentioned a great deal in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still a little too early to analyse the decision taken by President Kabila to stop the exploitation of the mineral resources in Kivu, in particular. The only thing that can be said at this stage is that the closing of these sites is to be welcomed, as it shows that the DRC’s highest authorities are, in fact, committed to combating the illegal exploitation of the country’s natural resources. It is, however, clear that this measure can only be analysed in the light of the effect it will have not only on the financing of the rebel troops but also on whether the authorities can regain effective control, and on the socio-economic well-being of the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In terms of human rights violations, particular attention should be paid to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Troops of the Congolese army are linked to the deaths of many civilians, and their violent actions and sexual violence against women and children are used as a tool to put fear into society while rape is used as a weapon of war. Therefore the European Parliament’s draft resolution on the protection of human rights and justice in the Democratic Republic of Congo aims to take all possible coordinated actions in order to stop these terrible crimes. It is important to promote peace and stability in the region and to cooperate closely and regularly with the media and society at national level in order to reduce the level of crime and help to bring further crimes to light. I would like to stress that we must combat impunity and ensure the protection of civilians, in particular, women and children, from violations in the areas of international human rights law and humanitarian law, including all forms of sexual and gender-based violence. The gender equality aspect must be integrated at all levels of cooperation between the EU and partner countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rapid implementation of international measures to oppose the violation of human rights is imperative. In this region, slaughter, rape and murder have been going on for years. The fighting between tribes is getting worse. At the moment, everyone is fighting everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">The highest price, as usual, is being paid by the civilian population, and this includes millions of children. In Congo, one child dies every minute. Most children die of disease or malnutrition. We are all aware of the problem and need to send help to the people who live there. However, we are also demonstrating an amazing helplessness and ineptitude. In Poland, in 2008, over 650 schools took part in the ‘Save the Children in Congo’ campaign. They managed to collect PLN 470 000, and this sum was sent to needy children in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p class="contents">A Eurobarometer survey published on 13 September shows that 89% of Europeans definitely support giving aid to developing countries. Despite the efforts of particular countries and world organisations, no improvement in the situation can be seen. Our resolution must not be another manifestation of good wishes, but a clear plan of essential and urgent action which the Union will take to defend human rights and justice and which will bring us closer to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 15 000 rapes recorded in 2008 and 2009, as well as those committed at the end of July and the beginning of August this year, testify to the sense of impunity for crimes of this kind which is deeply rooted in the culture of this country. Sexual violence is being used as a combat weapon, and should, in relation to this, be punished as a war crime and a crime against humanity. I call upon all sides of the conflict in the region to put an end to all forms of sexual violence and other violations of human rights, and also to enable humanitarian organisations to have access to those in the civilian population who are in need of help. I demand that the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in cooperation with international institutions, continues its efforts at combating impunity, and that it immediately conducts an investigation into the recent attacks and ensures that the perpetrators are brought to justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite extensive pressure from the international community, the situation has not improved in the slightest. Testimony to this are the continued reports bringing information of brutal violations of fundamental human rights by all the sides in the conflict. Murder, torture, sexual violence, oppression of the opposition and human rights defenders, along with numerous arrests, instances of persecution and cases of cruel torture, continue to be common practice. Not even child soldiers – forced to join the ranks of the combatants in huge numbers – are being spared. Extremely savage acts of sexual violence, perpetrated without distinction against little girls, elderly people and men, have become an integral feature of combat tactics on a huge scale. The international community, including both the United Nations and the European Union, has not, to date, been able to control the situation and bring about an end to the massacres in Congo. A situation like this is absolutely unacceptable. Emphatic steps should be taken to bring effective influence to bear on the Congolese authorities. The Congolese Government needs to convict people. It should ensure that the perpetrators bear responsibility for their deeds and should guarantee appropriate security measures for its citizens. Those who have already become victims need help and the restoration of order. Good medical care is essential. Many years will pass before they will be able to recover from the numerous cruelties inflicted upon them, and some of them will always be excluded from normal social life. Their welfare should become a priority, both for the Congolese authorities and for the international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olivier Chastel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again, I have the honour, this afternoon, of speaking on behalf of the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, and not on behalf of the Council, as it says on the screen.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the United Sates attach a great deal of importance to ensuring that their citizens can travel easily from one side of the Atlantic to the other. Transatlantic mobility can be facilitated, to a large extent, if people can travel without obtaining a visa and without paying a fee. While US nationals can enter the Schengen area without having to obtain a visa, the same cannot be said of EU citizens wishing to enter the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Four Member States are still excluded from the benefit of the US Visa Waiver Programme: Bulgaria, Cyprus, Poland and Romania. However, we can celebrate the fact that Greece was included in this programme on 5 April. This happy outcome can be attributed to the Commission, which is doing its utmost to ensure that all Member States benefit from the exemption programme, and to the efforts of successive Presidencies to take this matter forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, every year since 2006, the Commission has produced a report on all third countries that continue to require visas from our citizens in violation of the principle of reciprocity, since the European Union attaches a great deal of importance to the existence of total reciprocity in this area. As the European Union exempts certain third countries, they should do the same for our nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, for security reasons which we fully understand, in early 2009, the United States decided to introduce the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA), which can be used only for passengers from a country covered by the visa waiver programme who enter North America. Since 8 September, every one of these passengers has had to pay a USD 4 fee to cover the administrative costs generated by the implementation of the ESTA. This amount is in addition to the USD 10 that these same passengers already have to pay under a law on the promotion of tourism. To this end, a body has been tasked with developing tourism, and it is financed by a fund into which these USD 10 fees are paid.</p>
<p class="contents">Following these latest developments, you asked the Commission to adopt a position without delay. Back in December 2008, it produced a report on whether the ESTA should be considered equivalent to a visa or not, and its conclusion – a provisional one at that time – was that no, it should not. Once the final rules concerning the ESTA have been published by the US authorities, the Commission will present us with its final report on this subject. It is clear that the payment of this fee will be an important element in its evaluation. This report will be taken into consideration by the Council, which will then take the necessary measures and make any recommendations it considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will have gathered, the introduction of this additional fee is to be deplored. Moreover, the Presidency shares the concerns that have been expressed by Parliament on this subject on several occasions, notably in paragraph 18 of its resolution of 22 October. Although this fee may seem small at first glance, one should not forget that it has to be paid by every single traveller, which may, at times, prove to be very onerous for families.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that this policy is contrary to the United States’ declared will to facilitate mobility between the two continents and will be a real obstacle for EU citizens wanting to travel to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by confirming that the Presidency will do everything in its power to help the Commission obtain full visa waiver reciprocity with the United States. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regarding the position of the Commission on the ESTA fee, I have to underline that it was immediately following the publication of this fee on 6 August that my colleague, Commissioner Malmström, issued a statement in which she expressed the understanding that this decision is taken in accordance with the Travel Promotion Act’s obligations, but regretting very much the introduction of the fee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission made very clear its concerns that this fee is inconsistent with the oft-repeated commitment by the United States to facilitate transatlantic mobility and that it will be an additional burden for European citizens travelling to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has raised its serious concern vis-à-vis the US Congress and the US Administration on numerous occasions during the process of passing the Travel Promotion Act. Numerous démarches were made by the Commission, both with the Council Presidencies and with third countries. In its démarches, the Commission also criticised the fact that the fees apply only to travellers under the US visa waiver programme and that therefore it is discriminatory. Moreover, it seems peculiar that foreigners are requested to pay for promoting tourism to the US, as this may possibly lead to less, and not more, travel to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently examining further possible measures that could be taken vis-à-vis the United States in the framework of the EU reciprocity mechanism. The Commission will issue formal comments to the US in the framework of the public consultation launched by the US on the interim rule. A final assessment of the present ESTA will be issued once the final rule on ESTA is published in the USA Federal Register, taking into account any possible changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has requested that this issue of concern be discussed with all Member States at the upcoming Justice and Home Affairs Council on 7 and 8 October. Subsequently, the ESTA fee will be raised at the next EU-US JHA Ministerial in December. The Commission will, of course, continue to keep Parliament informed at all stages of this process and on the démarches undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">Minister Chastel also reiterated the importance of equal treatment on the part of the United States vis-à-vis all EU Member States in relation to the visa obligation. Here, I would like to remind you that significant progress has been achieved in the visa reciprocity mechanism over the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the Commission’s efforts to achieve full reciprocity with the US, eight more Member States have joined the US visa waiver programme – seven Member States at the end of 2008 and Greece in April 2010. The Commission continues to raise with the US at political and technical level the importance given by the EU to the admission of the four remaining EU Member States – namely, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Poland and Romania – to the visa waiver programme as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Commission, in cooperation with the Council and the High Representative, will insist on putting this issue on the agenda of any future EU-US meetings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must not be content with the reports we have heard. I must say, quite openly, that, as regards this matter, regret is not enough. Stating that this is discrimination is not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, President Van Rompuy said himself that one of the basic principles for working together as partners is reciprocity. I do not now want to demand that we treat the Americans in exactly the same way that they are treating us. However, the point has to be made very clearly that an unequivocal response from Europe is needed here, and this is something that we also need to demand from the Commission and the Council in the form of tangible measures. I call on you to come up with tangible proposals and to discuss with Parliament how you intend to approach this matter. The Americans need to recognise that we are serious about this matter – as we are about other matters, too – and that we want to be treated as a partner and not as someone who, when the other one says ‘jump’, simply responds ‘how high?’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament does, however, need to note that the United States has made a decision. It is a decision that goes against the desire for transatlantic dialogue to continue making progress in strengthening not only commercial exchange but also the whole extent of social and human exchange, based on mutual trust and reciprocity.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot give way by applying a discriminatory charge that clearly goes against the promotion of those exchanges, that creates dividing lines between the Member States of the European Union, and directly impacts on the public. Moreover, it goes against Europe’s attitude towards the United States and towards its fellow citizens, an attitude which has not always been respectful of the desire to strengthen human and trade links, but which has always promoted the issue of transatlantic mobility in relations between people from the two hemispheres.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe it is very important for Parliament to send a clear message that expects the Commission to fiercely defend the European position and, if necessary, to exercise the reciprocity clause. This is obviously not good news for transatlantic dialogue but it would send a clear message that we are not prepared to just accept a lack of reciprocity in the promotion of the human and social exchange that takes place through the link provided by European and US airlines, not to mention, of course, the economic impact that this would have on the serious crisis already being suffered by the air transport sector on both sides of the Atlantic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, it is a bit bizarre – and the Commission has pointed to this as well – to introduce a tax to promote tourism. If it becomes more expensive to travel to the United States, you will probably get fewer people who are going to travel to that country; for a family of four, we are talking about USD 40 – that is real money for many people. Also, it seems a bit absurd that the United States, of all countries, should tax people who are not represented in the debate. Taxation without representation has, I believe, played a certain role in American history, so I believe they should look at this again.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, will America become more attractive by making people pay more? I do not think so. The United States are an attractive destination; there are household names like Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, the Everglades, Chesapeake Bay, Boston, New York, Washington, and San Francisco. People are coming anyway; they do not need to promote tourism in the way they are suggesting.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, beyond those points, there are several serious issues, political issues, which we believe need to be addressed as well. I believe it is completely unacceptable that to pay the cost, you can only use credit or debit cards of companies which are registered in the United States of America. I do not believe that is acceptable. Furthermore, saving and verifying these data in the United States <span class="underline">might</span> be okay if this was limited to the specific purpose of controlling travel, but the Department of Homeland Security is authorised to give these data on demand to other American authorities, to foreign authorities, and even to businesses that deal with transportation. From the point of view of data protection privacy, this is simply unacceptable as well.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />The Commission and the Council have to find appropriate answers now. I believe that the upcoming EU-US summit should address this issue. I believe that reciprocity is good, although regrettable in this case, and I believe that both sides should work to increase people-to-people contacts and not make them more difficult. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, it seems a bit contradictory to have, on the one hand, a visa waiver programme to facilitate the travel of persons between the European Union and the United States and, on the other hand, to have an obligation for all European citizens to transfer their personal data through ESTA and to pay an additional fee when travelling.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we have to respect the decisions of our American partners, and especially the Congress, but this does not look like a sign of trust and cooperation. When it comes to the protection of borders and efficient security measures, the EU side has shown time and again that it is willing to make things work, sometimes with big difficulties in respect to our own values and citizens. What about the right to free movement when it comes to border controls? What about the right to the presumption of innocence when it comes to security measures? And what about data protection and redress rights when it comes to the collection of personal information?</p>
<p class="contents">If it were only about paying USD 14, it would not be such a problem, but the US Department of Homeland Security does not only get the ESTA data collected from travellers, namely numerous contact and identification details, including sensitive information. They also want access to the Passenger Name Records (PNR) in the travel agencies’ reservation systems, which almost includes information about who is sleeping with whom! It is more than unsatisfactory that Commissioner Malmström has not yet got the point that this use of PNR data collection seriously interferes with the rights of citizens and cannot be justified under EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">It gets even more problematic when we recognise that the USD 14 fee has to be paid with one of the four major credit cards, whose companies are all based inside the US. I ask myself how you will ensure that those huge data collections will not be the subject of investigations not related to travel operations, at least throughout the duration of the Patriot Act? And I ask you, Commission and Council, whether you are aware of the fact that existing EU law is already undermined by the way we accept US regulation imposed on European citizens?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and Council, and you also dear colleagues, have an obligation to protect the rights of EU citizens and European law. This is also true for transatlantic relations with the US. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am referring to the fact that in the European Union, and also in Parliament, we endeavour to ensure that all Member States of the European Union are treated equally.

I think the role of Parliament, but also of all other institutions of the European Union, is to ensure that all Member States, regardless of when they acceded to the Union, are treated equally.

We are looking at reciprocity which is asymmetrical. Well, then, if it is asymmetrical, it is not true reciprocity. We are looking at registration which is redundant. Ultimately, however, we already ask Europeans for their passenger name record data and SWIFT data, and now we are also asking Europeans who travel to the United States to register first; and we are looking at a tourism tax, which, as Mr Lambsdorff has just said, runs completely counter to the aim of increasing tourism links with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no point, however, in our criticising the United States for doing this. In the end, the United States – which, incidentally, is a country I know and admire greatly – does what its elected representatives decide must be done. I believe the problem lies much more on our side than on the US side.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is, first of all, a problem of mentality in our diplomatic service. Recently, when we went to Washington in the delegation on the SWIFT affair, we saw that the European mission in Washington spent more time trying to cover up and apologise for the European Parliament’s vote on SWIFT than explaining the reasons affecting 500 million European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a problem of lack of solidarity, because if one Member State does not enjoy the visa waiver, the other Member States should fight alongside it. It is also a problem of reciprocity, but in a different sense from the sense it has been used in here.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, we have been talking about reciprocity as if it fell from the heavens, as if we had to ask for it. All right, but we can also give reciprocity. Other countries do that.

I am, as you know, Chair of the Delegation for relations with the United States, and we have talked a lot about abandoning the visa. We have also talked about abandoning it for Romania and Bulgaria and other such countries. In its place, a new type of visa has been created, in connection with which we are so kind as to make our citizens’ data available to the Americans in an unbelievably comprehensive manner, and on top of that, we are now paying fees for this, too. These fees will also be used to create advertising for the American tourist industry. I believe it is a unique business model that the Americans are presenting here, namely, to make consumers also pay directly for advertising. I will also suggest this as a business model to the tourist offices in my home region. I find this an unbelievable way to go about things.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this also has something to do with the fact that there is still not enough contact between the European Parliament and Congress to be able to avoid this sort of thing by having a sensible dialogue. It may also be that the Council and the Commission are not approaching these matters in a courageous manner, and I believe – in this regard, I agree with the view expressed by other Members – that sometimes even just the mention of reciprocity can help.</p>
<p class="contents">It weakens our position for us to come here and bewail the fact that we do not like this and that we have made many démarches, because then no one will take us seriously. It then really is as if we started out a tiger, but ended up a bedside rug. I therefore call once again on the Council and the Commission, as well as the High Representative/Vice President of the Commission, to address this matter in such a way that Washington can also see that this European Union is a genuine power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You do not want to make definitive statements because a definitive arrangement has not yet been worked out, but in the meantime, our citizens are already paying this levy. This is, of course, unacceptable. You must intervene, and in a very active manner.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said many times by my fellow Members before me, it is astonishing to discover that the US authorities have found no better answer to the question of how to attract more visitors than by making these selfsame visitors pay an additional levy of USD 14. USD 4 of this is effectively to cover the costs of the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA). In other words, they do not want to offload regular costs onto the US taxpayer: instead, they are passing them on to the Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a first major departure from all the various aviation charges or airport taxes we, too, have introduced in a number of Member States, such as very recently in Germany. I regret these unilateral measures by a number of Member States; in fact, I am in favour of a European approach to this matter, which should ideally take on board aspects such as the external costs of the flights in question as well. However, this is about something else entirely. In Europe, there is no question of discrimination: everyone pays the bill, whereas in the case of the US, it is only we who pay it. And there are 900 000 of us Europeans who re-register every month via ESTA.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to take an in-depth look at whether the measure does not contradict the letter and the spirit of the Visa Waiver Programme. This programme essentially means that people on both sides do not need to apply for a visa, with all the associated costs. ESTA is gradually becoming synonymous with a visa. This is also what Mr Brok has just said. I would therefore ask you not to treat this lightly, not to procrastinate, but to send a very strong signal to our partners in the United States that this is unacceptable; that this is no way to deal with each other. All options should therefore be looked at, and if there is no flexibility forthcoming on the part of the Americans, we will naturally have to think about reciprocating.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context, I can refer briefly to the efforts being made by Mr Tajani to get a European tourism policy off the ground. The Treaty of Lisbon has given us more say on this on a European level. Perhaps it would not be a bad idea to exchange thoughts on this over the coming months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like, from here, to appeal for action to be taken on this matter, because it is a serious matter. However, treating visas as just a procedural question, treating the problem of visas and these other strange unjustified fees as an opportunity for a little flexing of the muscles in Parliament in protest against the United States, is not, I think, the right approach either.</p>
<p class="contents">If people treat visas only as a procedural question or as a reason for political jostling, they do not understand what visas mean in today’s world. No instrument of cooperation could have greater political significance. Therefore, I would appeal both to the Commissioner and the Members of this House to improve relations with Congress. We are entitled, as Members of the European Parliament, to appeal to Congress and to exert pressure so that they adopt an altogether different approach to visas. Visas are a barrier between citizens and, in reality, are one of the greatest political barriers hindering transatlantic cooperation.

This was at a time when, at the end of the 19th century, my grandfather also sailed over. When I want to visit the United States today, I pay some kind of strange fee. There must be some justification for this charge, but I suspect that I am paying it so that I can be monitored. This suspicion is all the stronger the more vehemently negotiators from the United States demand the transfer of often sensitive data about persons coming from the European Union. Verbally, it is not a question of any screening, checks, or visa issuance. In reality, a person thus finds himself among the millions who are monitored without adequate protection for the information which is transferred. What then happens with this sensitive data? God only knows! It is just the normal state of affairs between two so-called equal partners. </p>
<p class="contents"><br />The United States takes some measures and the European Union finds it difficult to surmise whether and in what manner it should react at all. As a rule, the results of these negotiations are not generally satisfactory and, for example, the open skies agreement with the United States is highly one-sided. I understand that the economic interests of both partners are often quite directly reflected in the agreements which are or are not concluded in different sectors. However, I do not understand why there was no proper consultation beforehand about the measures taken, and I rarely understand how such measures would benefit the citizens of the European Union. I trust that as a result of the negotiations, there will be no introduction of visas or questionnaires examining in detail the marital status of my forebears. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We know that freedom to travel and mutual awareness help people from different corners of the Earth, different civilisations and different cultures to overcome prejudice and lose their fear of the unknown, encouraging the development of trust between nations. I do not know what has happened with our American friends. They have always stood up in defence of freedom and democracy, but perhaps they have gone crazy. On their southern border with Mexico, they have started building the sort of fences that we Europeans managed to remove only recently. They introduce ever more administrative and technical barriers against visitors to their country. Where is this heading, ladies and gentlemen? Perhaps President Obama does not realise it, but from the outside, it looks as if the American administration is trying to turn the US into a sort of fenced off, fully enclosed garden, full of dutifully happy people, like the regime of Kim Jong-il in North Korea. I would like to believe that this is not the case, and we should therefore perhaps explain to our American friends that the fee and the personal data for snooping which they request in return for a visit to their country are simply an enormous shame for a superpower of freedom and democracy such as the United States of America. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just a short time after the lifting of the visa in several countries, we are witnessing another visa, under another name, being introduced by the United States – a visa by the name of ESTA, for which people are still required to pay. Initially, we were told it would cost ten dollars; now we have been told it costs fourteen dollars, but there is no guarantee that this amount will not increase further. This is not acceptable because this is another visa. I hope the European Commission will realise that this is a visa and will treat it as such. However, there is a second reason why this was a negative decision and development: it came at a very bad time. It came at a time when, in this Chamber, we had just voted in connection with a SWIFT agreement, and extended the hand of cooperation to the United States. I believe that the United States’ reaction, rather than being positive, turned out to be a negative one given this arrangement and fee. I would like to point out that there are a number of topics, like PNR and the general agreement about data protection, which are still before this Chamber. I think it is important that any cooperation between us and the United States should be built upon trust; unless it is built on trust, we cannot achieve satisfactory and positive results for the citizens of both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a measure which contradicts the United States’ commitment to make transatlantic mobility easier. However, I do not believe that the European Union will respond with a reciprocal gesture against US citizens. Two wrongs do not make a right. This is why I believe that the solution must be found by stepping up the bilateral dialogue. With this in mind, it is the European Commission’s duty to make greater efforts to improve relations with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this unfair fee comes on top of another discriminatory measure imposed unilaterally by the United States against some European Union Member States, which affects transatlantic cooperation and trust. Citizens from four EU countries still need visas to travel to the United States: Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and Cyprus. Citizens from our countries cannot, regrettably, travel freely to the United States. It is especially unfortunate that the US legislation in force since July 2009 has depressingly removed the prospect of including some of these countries in the visa waiver programme at a time when the rate of applications being refused remains the main obstacle to eliminating the compulsory visa requirement. Given that this proportion of rejections depends, strictly speaking, on the decision of the US representatives, I believe that additional efforts are required on the part of the US to improve transparency in the process for granting visas. This is why I, too, support what has been said by the Vice-President and I wish to relaunch the appeal to the Commission to insist on guaranteeing equal non-discriminatory treatment for all European Union citizens, including those from countries which still require an entry visa for the United States. Fellow Members, it is wrong and sad that the states which have resolved this visa issue have forgotten about this topic being debated and about the European Parliament’s official dealings with the US authorities.

This fee of USD 14, payable once every two years, is applicable to countries that are in good standing with the United States. We have had very good negotiations in relation to open skies, exchange of passenger information, etc., but this is very counter-productive because essentially, what we are talking about is introducing a new visa.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a visa affair, as Mr Busuttil has said: even non-ticketed infants are required to have an approved travel authorisation. I agree with the Commission, in this field, that this is regrettable and inconsistent with the United States’ commitment to ease transatlantic travel.</p>
<p class="contents">What this has done, in fact, is to introduce new barriers at a time when we were actually dismantling barriers, with the United States Senate introducing the charge in an attempt to reverse the declining number of visitors to its country. The majority of this money is to be used to fund the promotion of the United States as a holiday destination. However, I believe that it will actually put people off travelling there.</p>
<p class="contents">My own country, for example, has a long association with the United States: 40 million people living in the United States are of Irish origin, and we have huge trade between the two countries. People are not going to pay this amount in the majority of cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The essential purpose of the legislation is basically to enhance the exchequer and to enhance the attractiveness of the United States as a tourist destination. President Obama says that overseas visitors spend USD 120 billion and support one million jobs, and that this measure will provide an extra USD 4 billion and 40 000 new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the direct opposite will happen, because an online poll carried out by <span class="italic">Telegraph Travel</span> showed that 44% of the readers said that the fee would put them off travelling to the United States. On the basis of that survey, I believe this is going to be counterproductive, that it is going to have negative effects, and that it is actually going to do damage to the United States and to its tourist industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fellow Members have expressed their concern about the promotion of the ESTA system, which actually reintroduces a visa of sorts for all European citizens. The fee does not only entail the payment of USD 14, but also the collection of European Union citizens’ personal data. The US Department of Homeland Security is currently evaluating the application of this fee/visa. The Commission must find a solution along with the US administration to eliminate this. I want to point out that keeping this decision may have an unforeseen impact on other dossiers relating to transatlantic relations for security and mobility which are in progress, such as the future EU-US agreement on PNR information. If the US administration is not going to drop the fee, we support the Commission in taking the necessary measures to apply reciprocity to all US citizens travelling to the European Union, in accordance with the fundamental principle of the European Union’s visa policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe cooperates with the United States in numerous areas, and we can be proud of that.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point: I concur with all my fellow Members and agree with all the questions that have already been asked; there is really not much I can add. It is important that the Commission and possibly the Council answer these questions promptly. However, we regret that the US Government has taken this unilateral action, and one could well start a discussion on whether this is actually about the USD 14. Whether tourists pay that for their visa or for a Coca-Cola in Washington is hardly the point: the point is that Europe is being treated with a certain degree of contempt. A lot of conversations about SWIFT and so on, and then this unilateral action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must make it clear today what it has done. These days, the announcement of a policy study no longer makes an impression on the European Parliament. We simply want to know what you told the US Government and whether you were not able to deter it. Again, I really do feel rather insulted that this has been imposed on us unilaterally, given the extent to which we cooperate with the United States. The question of the method of payment has already been asked, but you should not be asking it in the first place if you do not want this levy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, however, there are also Members here in this Chamber from Member States like Poland where it is necessary to apply for an American visa. In Poland, this visa is obtained over the course of a long procedure, which, unfortunately, is sometimes also a humiliating procedure. The citizens of my country pay over USD 100 when they obtain a visa, but they also have to pay when they are not given a visa. For us, therefore, the most important thing is European solidarity. For us, it is important for the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council to be saying very clearly that the citizens of all the states which make up the Union must be treated in exactly the same way. I am pleased that the European Commission and the Council are not only talking about this here in Europe, but that such a view is being advanced more and more often in contacts with the United States administration.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament, however, it is worth asking ourselves this question: as Members of the European Parliament, what can we do together to solve the problem of the citizens of these Member States? I think that most important, here, are our contacts with the United States Congress, because in the legal system in the US, a decisive role in visa policy and tax policy is played by the US Congress. I would also like to express great satisfaction that for the first time, the representatives of the Commission and the Council are saying they can see a light in this tunnel and that there is a chance that quite soon, the citizens of countries such as Poland will not have to have visas for the US. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that this is happening today of all days is particularly significant. All of us will then have the opportunity to tell the ambassador what we have just underlined here in plenary. We ought to take the opportunity to do this in person.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States of America is not making our work particularly easy at the moment, and it is not making our friendship very easy, either. On many issues, I have the impression that what we are seeing is more like a bull in a china shop than a performance on the elegant political stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The EUR 14 alone is certainly not a decisive factor. However, if a family with three children wants to visit the United States of America, it then becomes a considerable amount and may ultimately prevent them from travelling there. On top of that, if you have to give extensive details on the Internet about which airline you are travelling with, where you are travelling to, which hotel you are staying in and, in addition, you have to give your credit card number, it raises a number of questions as to why all of this is necessary. If, in addition, you then hear the accounts of some good acquaintances who have had to wait for hours at American airports and experience the discourteous security control, then you sometimes ask yourself whether the United States of America is actually aware that in many areas, it is currently treating its own friends rather discourteously and perhaps, in certain respects in relation to what people actually need and have to do, it is way off the mark.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with regard to our close transatlantic relations, I have to say that we do have a close relationship with the United States. However, this should also mean that we are treated accordingly. I call on the Commission and on you, Mr Šefčovič, to make a clear demand for visa-free travel to be ensured for those Member States that do not currently enjoy this facility, and if this is not followed by an appropriate reaction, then please also demand that reciprocity be introduced. It is not a question of ‘an eye for an eye’, but we must negotiate on equal terms and we must not allow ourselves to be treated in the same way that a feudal lord would treat his serfs. We are not serfs; we are of equal stature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reality is as follows: US citizens can freely enter EU territory. The European Union has accepted PNR and Swift, as well as agreements concerning European citizens’ personal data. Some European citizens still need visas to travel to the United States. In addition, all European citizens have their fingerprints taken when they enter the United States, regardless of whether they have a visa or not. European citizens must indicate online their intention to travel and, most recently, they have to pay USD 14 to enter the United States.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to reassure Members of Parliament that we are examining all possible measures vis-à-vis the United States in the framework of the EU reciprocity mechanism, including the possibility of the introduction of the EU ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorisation) on which, as you know, a feasibility study is currently under way. Of course, you will be informed of the outcomes and possible proposals for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As to whether this fee could be perceived as a visa fee in disguise, I have to say that, according to the preliminary assessment carried out by the Commission in December 2008 on the present ESTA, as laid down in the Interim Final Rule, at this stage, the ESTA cannot be considered as tantamount to the Schengen visa application process as defined in the Common Consular Instructions – which is now known as the Visa Code.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the reaction of the Commission to the new ESTA rules in the United States, here again, I would like to inform you that we will issue formal comments and final assessments once the Final Rule on ESTA is published in the US Federal Register. Of course, we are very much aware of the high sensitivity associated with personal data collection and personal data protection, and it is very high on the priority list of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning future diplomatic and political action, I would like to inform you that the Commission has already requested the Presidency to put this issue on the next JHA Council in October and I am sure that the fee issue will be raised at the next EU-US JHA Ministerial in December.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken on board and fully understand the preoccupations of the honourable Members coming from those countries whose citizens still have to request visas when travelling to the United States, and I would like to assure them that we will relentlessly press for the inclusion of those four remaining EU Member States in the US visa waiver programme as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue was raised by Commissioner Malmström in Madrid in April this year at the latest EU-US Ministerial. It was also the topic of her conversation in Washington two months later, and this is, of course, an issue which will be raised at all political levels and we will be pressing for a quick solution to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to conclude by reacting to the comments by Mr Brok. I really would like to underline that it would be very helpful indeed if Parliament intensified its communication with its US counterparts because, as we all know, the ESTA fee project and visa policies are very much driven by the US Congress, and your support and your assistance in this matter would be very valuable indeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To this end, I am delighted, Mr President, that the United States ambassador to the European Union has been present at many of our debates. I believe this is a sign, a sign that the United States has been listening to the debate we have been having.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have, and the Commission will remind us of this in the report on visa reciprocity, four Member States whose citizens are required to obtain a visa to visit the United States. This situation cannot be tolerated in view of the visa waiver that American citizens themselves enjoy when they visit the Schengen Area. The Presidency will therefore do everything it can to support the Commission in the steps that it continues to take to end this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, furthermore, do everything to keep the cost of trips to the United States as low as possible, whether these are for tourist purposes, business trips or when carrying out missions. Please rest assured that the Presidency will continue to support the Union’s cause vis-à-vis the American authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Once the Commission has submitted its report on visa reciprocity this autumn, and given its final assessment of the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) and once the definitive rules have been published by the American authorities, the Council will decide what measures should be taken accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, four countries remain excluded from the US visa waiver programme: Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and Cyprus. Furthermore, the United States has introduced a fee for issuing EU citizens with travel authorisation, commencing 8 September 2010. I believe that it is the European Commission’s duty to give greater priority in its relations with the United States to the issue of reciprocity of granting visas and to strive, at the same time, to obtain equal treatment for all EU citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost 10 years after the creation of the European security and defence policy, which forms an integral part of the common foreign and security policy, the European Union is now a recognised player, in demand on the international scene. The Union’s numerous missions around the world are the best proof of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the European Union has, at the initiative of the Council and the Member States, deployed 24 military, civilian and civilian-military missions on three continents within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy. The Union therefore has a presence in Afghanistan, Georgia, the Middle East, Iraq, Somalia and in the western Balkans. There is no doubt that these missions also contribute to increasing the visibility of the European Union in this area. The general framework of these missions is furthermore set out in the Treaty of Lisbon, which also defines the general framework of the common security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Eurocorps, I would first like to mention – Mr Posselt in fact points this out himself in his question – that Eurocorps is not part of the European Union. They are multinational operational land-based staff. Eurocorps was founded in 1992, based on an idea by Chancellor Kohl and the French President François Mitterrand. It was deployed in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan and actively contributed to developing the interoperability of the armed forces of the participating Member States, as well as a culture of shared security and defence. Some Members States, namely Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Spain, belong to it, and recently, Eurocorps has been open to the participation of members of both NATO and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Presidency has made significant efforts to implement the Treaty of Lisbon, and in this context, the Presidency welcomes the agreement between Parliament and the Council on the European External Action Service, which constitutes a major contribution to the effective implementation of the common security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Belgian Presidency will continue with its efforts to also reach an agreement with Parliament on amendments to the two regulations directly linked to the European External Action Service on personnel and the financial framework and, more specifically, concerning the Belgian Presidency’s initiatives with regard to the ESDP.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to refer you to the Belgian Presidency’s programme, which states that the Union must equip itself with the military and civilian capacities to reflect its ambitions: structured and ongoing cooperation, a European architecture of planning and command for crisis operations, the capacity for a swift and coherent response, including for relief operations, civilian and military cooperation, the training of civilian and military players in crisis management, the strengthening of the European Defence Agency and the strategic relationship between the Union and NATO are all important issues that require special endeavours.</p>
<p class="contents">During its Presidency, Belgium will be launching numerous initiatives dedicated to the ESDP and, to this end, it has organised several seminars on matters relating to capacities in the field of ongoing, structured cooperation on training. All these questions will be at the centre of European defence ministers’ debates in Belgium tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council’s 18-month programme, as established by the triple Spanish, Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies, states that the fight against poverty and social marginalisation will be a major objective, with an emphasis being placed on the unemployed, children affected by poverty, the working poor and single-parent families.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against poverty is one of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy adopted by the European Council on 17 June 2010, whereby the Council has also approved the aim of promoting social inclusion, in particular, through poverty reduction, by removing the risk of poverty or exclusion for a minimum of 20 million people by the year 2020. Another objective which the European Council has set itself is to increase the employment level of men and women aged between 20 and 64 to 75%, and to improve levels of education, in particular, by reducing failure rates at school.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Belgian Presidency, four priorities in the fight against poverty will be highlighted: minimum wage and social welfare, housing and the homeless, child poverty within the family and finally, the participation of those living in poverty and all those involved in the fight against poverty, insecurity and social exclusion. At a round table on poverty and social exclusion to be held on 18 and 19 October, the Presidency will attempt to look more closely at the debate on a minimum wage at European level, the final aim being for each Member State to adopt a minimum wage that guarantees a sufficient standard of living.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of these discussions, the Presidency will also aim to promote, at European level, the importance of the principles of good governance to ensure participation by those living in poverty. Next, in order to guarantee everyone the fundamental right to housing, the Belgian Presidency will grant special importance to the problem of accessibility to housing during a conference which will take place on 9 and 10 December.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency will also prioritise the crucial role of education in the fight against child poverty and in the fight against its intergenerational transmission, which has already been the subject of a conference held on 2 and 3 September. Finally, on 16 and 17 December, the Belgian Presidency will close the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion by ensuring that lessons are drawn from it for the future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 15 July, during the presentation of its priorities, the Presidency did, in fact, invite the European Parliament to attend.</p>
<p class="contents">By organising this symposium, the Belgian Presidency wishes to contribute to current thinking on the preparation of reforms to the current common fisheries policy. A new common policy on the subject should be in place by 2013. The scientists and the fishing sector often have differing viewpoints and each adopt a different position on fisheries and environmental management. The aim of the symposium is to discuss this problem in detail and to learn lessons from good practices in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the plan is to organise discussions on five subjects: data collection and stock assessment, joint efforts to improve selectivity and reduce discards, communication between scientists and industry, improvements to the integrated consultation process and, finally, self-management. The results of the symposium will serve as the basis for a ministerial debate at the ‘Agriculture and Fisheries’ Council in November. The Council will then be able to draw the appropriate conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union is delighted with all the work that Croatia has put in over the past year and the progress achieved, not least towards meeting the criteria agreed in the course of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall to date, the accession conference has opened 33 of the 35 chapters and has provisionally closed 23. Croatia now needs to build on the progress made thus far and continue its reforms, focusing on fundamental issues such as justice and public administration, combating corruption and organised crime, and minority rights, which includes the return of refugees and investigations into war crimes. Croatia also needs to press ahead on economic issues, so as to be able to demonstrate positive results on all fronts.</p>
<p class="contents">As indicated in our work programme, the Belgian Presidency is committed to helping Croatia to move forwards in its accession negotiations by closing as many chapters as possible as soon as possible. To this end, Croatia will need to implement the reforms I have just outlined and meet all other criteria within the agreed timeframes.</p>
<p class="contents">In practical terms, the outstanding chapters could be provisionally closed if, on examination, the Member States feel that Croatia has met the relevant requirements. The chapters in question are: competition policy (chapter 8), agriculture and rural development (chapter 11), fisheries (chapter 13), regional policy and coordination of structural instruments (chapter 22), judiciary and fundamental rights (chapter 23), justice, freedom and security (chapter 24), environment (chapter 27), foreign, security and defence policy (chapter 31), and finance and budgetary provisions (chapter 33).</p>
<p class="contents">Three chapters are currently on the table in Council pending a decision on provisional closure, namely, free movement of capital (chapter 4), transport policy (chapter 14) and institutions (chapter 34).

The Council is aware that unpaid carers are at greater risk of poverty, as their duties limit participation in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">The first issue to address is how to reintegrate unpaid carers into the labour market. The Council is aware of the difficulties encountered by those who have taken a career break in order to provide unpaid care services and has urged Member States to ensure that provision is made for these individuals within national pension systems.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in the directive on the revised framework agreement on parental leave, the Council stipulates that, at the end of parental leave, a worker is entitled to return to his/her position or an equivalent or similar post in accordance with his/her employment contract or relationship. The Council understands that the Commission has consulted the social partners about the possibility of adopting new forms of parental leave, such as adoption leave and leave to care for family members.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor is gender inequality. The Council has highlighted the fact that the majority of family care is still provided by women, largely as a result of social stereotypes linked to the social and domestic roles of men and women. As part of the Beijing Platform of Action, in 2007, the Council adopted conclusions on the question of women and poverty which include a set of indicators designed to allow Member States and the Commission to monitor this key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In its conclusions, the Council had to make allowance for the fact that the decision to provide unpaid care work rather than take paid employment can be a personal choice, although gender inequalities mean that career breaks taken for family reasons tend to be a problem specific to women. The decision can affect those women’s financial independence and the degree of social protection afforded to them, particularly at retirement age, when many women are forced to make do with a very modest pension.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of all this, the Council has highlighted the need for a more equitable distribution of caring tasks between men and women. The Council has also stressed on a number of occasions the need for a childcare infrastructure and care services for other dependents.</p>
<p class="contents">As the population ages, we are going to be faced with growing numbers of older citizens who will need care. In its conclusions on ‘gender equality: strengthening growth and employment’, adopted in November 2009, the Council stressed the long-term strategic importance of these questions for the Union, not least in view of population trends.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear correlation between high female employment rates, the availability of childcare and care services, and high birth rates. The Council therefore advocates adopting policies that will allow men and women to achieve a better work/life balance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious that the Council is taking this matter quite seriously. I am interested to hear about the fact that you are looking at carer and family leave, that the same standards would apply to those who want to go back to work. You also mentioned the gender aspect of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect is that a lot of young people end up caring, and I often think that is forgotten. You also mentioned personal choice. I think that is what carers want. They want to have the choice as to whether they work or care. I am also very pleased to hear that you are taking into consideration the whole issue of pensions, because what happens sometimes is that people give up work to care, they lose part of their salary, they cannot continue to make their social contributions when they are caring, and then they lose out on their pension, so I do think that is an area perhaps where the Council could make recommendations to Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does the Council share this view? If so, is France’s expulsion of 79 Roma violating this fundamental Community rule?</p>

The conclusions acknowledge that a significant proportion of Roma live in extreme poverty and suffer from discrimination and exclusion. This, in turn, results in low academic achievement, inadequate housing conditions, limited access to the labour market and poor health.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council calls on the Commission and the Member States to forge ahead with the economic and social inclusion of Roma, in accordance with the decisions taken and recommendations drawn up by the European Union institutions, by guaranteeing more effective access to existing policies and instruments. The Council also stresses the importance of ensuring the active involvement of civil society, local authorities and the Roma themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stockholm Programme, adopted by the European Council in December 2009, specifically refers to the Roma community and recommends that Member States combine forces in order to promote the full social integration of vulnerable groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures taken recently by one Member State in relation to individuals from the Roma community gave rise to a debate during the European Council lunch on 16 September 2010. The President of the European Council highlighted three points on which consensus was achieved during the discussions: that each Member State is entitled to take measures to uphold the rule of law in its territory, that the Commission has both the right and a duty to monitor Member States’ compliance with EU law, and that the question of Roma integration will be discussed at a future European Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Presidency also wishes to include the issue of Roma integration on the agenda of the EPSCO Council scheduled for 21 October. The Council has not yet had an opportunity to discuss the outcome of the informal meeting held on 6 September in Paris. As far as I am aware, that meeting was not specifically about the Roma situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A draft directive aimed at stepping up the fight against trafficking and improving victim protection, as well as a second draft directive relating to sexual exploitation and abuse of children and to child pornography, are being examined within the Union’s institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the aim of these proposals is to ensure that specific measures of assistance, help and protection are offered to children who fall victim to human trafficking. They also contain provisions aimed at improving prosecution of offences committed outside the territory of Member States, as well as regulations designed to prevent these offences.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the Stockholm Programme, specific attention is granted to children who are particularly vulnerable, notably child victims of sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as child victims of trafficking and unaccompanied minors. In the context of the Union’s immigration policy, it should also be added that the Commission has adopted an action plan for unaccompanied minors which sets out a common approach based on the principle of the child’s best interests, and by identifying broad areas for action such as prevention, accommodation and the search for lasting solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Following this action plan, the Council, in its conclusions adopted in June 2010 on unaccompanied minors, decided to ask Member States to strengthen the measures concerning unaccompanied minors who fall victim to human trafficking by entrusting them to the relevant authorities in the Member State where they find themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Since it is difficult, currently, to estimate the exact number of people who are victim of human trafficking within the Union, or who are illegally brought in as a result of human trafficking, and in order to provide the European Union with objective, reliable, comparable and current statistics, the Council has adopted, in its conclusions of June 2009, the establishment within the Union of an informal network of national rapporteurs or equivalent mechanisms in the area of human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">This network, which should act as a forum for sharing experiences and best practices in the area of preventing and combating human trafficking on a European scale, has been set up. Finally, a general guideline document on the fight against human trafficking was adopted in November 2009. It is partly devoted to the issue of child trafficking.</p>

<p class="contents">Member States have frontline responsibility for defining and implementing their national employment policies. Given that the situation of the labour market varies from one State to the other, the measures to be taken will inevitably vary as well, as long as they contribute, by and large, to achieving the Union’s overall objectives. Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, these measures are coordinated within the European strategy for employment, which notably sets out guidelines for employment and recommendations to Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">During its meeting of June 2010, the European Council approved the general approach relating to the integrated guidelines for economic and employment policies, which are an essential tool for implementing the Europe 2020 strategy for jobs and growth. After taking into account the opinion of the House, adopted on 8 September 2010, the Presidency will submit the integrated guidelines to the Council for adoption at its next EPSCO session on 21 October 2010. According to these guidelines, Member States and the European Union should put in place reforms promoting intelligent, sustainable and inclusive growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the reforms should be to improve participation in the job market, particularly for under-represented groups – young people, older people, low-skilled workers, legal migrants – to reduce structural unemployment and to promote employment quality through measures impacting on both labour supply and labour demand. Their objective is also to develop a qualified workforce which meets the needs of the job market, promoting lifelong learning and stimulating entrepreneurship, as well as small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">A suitable use of European funds, especially the European Social Fund, will enable us to reach these goals and to ensure better access to employment and to the job market throughout the European Union, more specifically in disadvantaged areas. Furthermore, through the annual joint report on employment, the Council, along with the Commission, monitors the job situation in Member States and, in particular, the implementation of the guidelines on employment and the recommendations in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest 2009-2010 joint report on employment, published in the spring of 2010, provides an accurate description of the kind of measures that the various Member States have taken in order to promote employment, especially among young people and women. The Council highlighted, for instance, that Member States should also improve the business environment, stimulate job creation, especially green job creation, and help companies to modernise their industrial base.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the importance of the European strategy for employment with a view to coordinating national employment policies and improving their effectiveness, this strategy will play a key role in the new governance context laid down by the European Semester. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">While I appreciate the fact that the Minister mentioned the national policies, he will recall that in the State of the Union address, President Barroso referred, in particular, to the Commission’s policy for dealing with red tape.

According to this report, it will be necessary to continue with a thorough examination of the proposal, especially with regard to its scope, the provisions relating to disability and the timetable for implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the Council have also insisted on the need to guarantee the greatest legal certainty and to enforce the principle of subsidiarity. The proposal should be adopted in accordance with Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which requires unanimous approval from Members of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">While the aim of the draft directive is to achieve certain objectives of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, its goal is not to legally implement this convention, since the latter has a broader scope which goes beyond the European Union’s remit. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that one of the objectives of the talks that are currently taking place at the Council is to ensure consistency with this convention.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the economic cost of equality, the talks also touched on the concept of disproportionate burden; this concept precisely seeks to strike the right balance between the actual right to equality of access and the economic cost of such access. Whilst every effort is being made to reach a unanimous decision, the Council is not in a position to predict the outcome of the negotiations or how long they will last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Listening to Mr Chastel’s answer, I tried to gain a better understanding of the arguments and counterarguments which could have been raised in the Council. We know that this issue has remained unresolved since 2008, when the Commission tabled the draft directive and Parliament approved it the following year. This clearly entails certain burdens. However, the European Union also has an obligation, ensuing from or in relation to the UN Convention. In view of this, I would like to ask Mr Chastel whether he sees any chance or hope of any progress still being made in the near future, once all these factors have been examined. Secondly, I think that the crisis is a clear reminder that equal opportunities and the implementation of the Anti-Discrimination Directive may help many people in very difficult situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
