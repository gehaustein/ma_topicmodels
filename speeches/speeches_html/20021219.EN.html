<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we used to learn at school: ‘Mens sana in corpore sano’ – a healthy mind in a healthy body, and we are, in theory, all acquainted with this wisdom from ancient Rome. Of all leisure activities, sport is the most widespread, with one out of every three Europeans participating in some form of it, some of them, indeed, continuing to do so well into old age.</p>
<p class="contents">Physical activity promotes health, and competition in sport develops a range of social skills, such as friendship, team spirit, solidarity, commitment, perseverance and, last but not least, fair play. As you will all be aware, you can tell a good sportsman by the way he wins, but a great one by the way he loses.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite sport's essential social role, ladies and gentlemen, there is no policy on it at Community level. We have therefore been campaigning in this House for a number of years already, for the legal basis for this to be enshrined in the Treaties. We can therefore unreservedly welcome the way the Commissioner has at last responded to the aspiration expressed in my last report on sport, produced as long ago as 1996, and proclaimed a year of sport. It is admittedly not being called the Year of Sport, but, for many understandable reasons, the ‘Year of Education through Sport 2004’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is about using a large number of projects to highlight sport's role in informal learning and its educational value, and also the close partnership between school sport and the services provided by the many kinds of sporting organisations that exist in Europe. To come to the point, the objective and rationale of the ‘European Year of Education through Sport 2004’ is not to show what people are capable of in the sporting arena – something that we can demonstrate to ourselves to our own satisfaction every day of the year on dozens of television channels – but to show what sport can do in human terms and for people.</p>
<p class="contents">There is consensus in this House as regards the Year's seven objectives. It is to promote cooperation between educational institutions and sporting organisations, the development of social skills through sport, voluntary activity, pupils' mobility by means of international competitions, a balance between mental and physical activity, as well as consideration of how the educational needs of young sportsmen and women are to be met.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Council has accepted the essential points of the report passed by this House at First Reading stage. What is important is that it has confirmed the amount of funding involved, the EUR 11.5 million that the Commission believes to be sufficient to complete in this Year those things that it has in mind to do. If everyone now plays their part – and that includes the media – then this Year can be of truly great significance for sport. I very much hope that the trend towards the decreasing importance of school sport can be turned round. By means of this Year, we want to build up networks and give an impetus to cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do not want is for the small amount of money to be spent on even more interminable research projects. Research is always in progress, and that is not what this Year is for. I believe that the only research we need is to ask ourselves, when it is all over, ‘what has this Year achieved?’ but otherwise not to spend money on it. The Council shares our view on this. It has also accepted my idea of organising a European competition in the run-up to the Olympic Games – incorporating it, not into the Treaty, but into a protocol. I am very happy about this, and I very much hope that the Commission will respond to our concern by announcing a competition culminating in its victors being allowed to be present at the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia in 2004. That would be a fitting climax for the Year of Education through Sport.</p>
<p class="contents">What, ladies and gentlemen, is all this about? It is our intention to establish a platform for educational measures in sport above and beyond frontiers, institutions of state education and organisations. We want to kick-start cross-border initiatives and networks, and we have to set up an ideas exchange, enabling exemplary projects and initiatives – that is to say best practices – to be followed by as many as possible during the preparations in 2003 and the actual Year in 2004. The Community projects instrument will receive 80% support, and those things done at national level alone will receive 50% co-financing. This seems to me to be very well suited to putting this Year's European dimension centre-stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I think I will leave it at that, but would like to thank the Council and the Commission and express the hope that we will all be able to take the idea of this Year of Education through Sport back to our communities, and that, eventually, the Convention will be astute enough to give sport a legal basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would even go so far as to say that it is almost a historic moment for the young people of our countries. Indeed, you are about to adopt the decision to make 2004 the European Year of Education through Sport. This is the first time that such a large-scale initiative has been launched at Community level in the field of sport, particularly one focusing on its educational value.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the first time that such a clear message has been sent to our citizens, showing them that the Community institutions will henceforth be concerning themselves with the social and educational potential of sport and its fundamental role in informal education. It was right that the recognition of this value should take place in the European Parliament, for it is the European Parliament which has been calling for years for more focus on sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the European Year, resources, good intentions and imagination will be mobilised throughout an entire year to promote a policy, to promote an approach, to enable civil society to participate. I am sure that a European Year of Education through Sport can make a decisive contribution to the promotion of the ideals we share, the ideal of sport as having an educational role and as a means of imparting values.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, therefore, the decision that you are about to adopt with your vote is good news for the worlds of education and sport. It is also the formalisation of the astute work carried out together by Parliament, the Commission and the Council. Our spirit of partnership, our faultless cooperation and our consensus on the text mean that, today, if this were an Olympic competition, we would have to share the gold medal. All this means that everything is now in order and we can therefore move on and start the practical work, for the discussions have progressed quickly and well. There has been no need for red cards to be given out, to use a football metaphor, which is clear evidence that our joint effort has been carried out in a spirit of sincere friendship. Moreover, the European Parliament has played its part fully: our original text has been amended and altered and the result – I am not ashamed to admit – is an improvement on the Commission’s text.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, you emphasised the need to carry through practical measures relating to basic sport. You placed the emphasis on projects in the field rather than on reports and studies. You highlighted the need for a partnership between sports organisations and education organisations. Lastly, you clarified the objectives of our Year of Education through Sport and you pointed out the need to respect the principle of subsidiarity and the respective competences. All these demands have been taken into account and included in the final decision. At its last meetings, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport deemed that the Council’s common position gave due consideration to Parliament’s main concerns, and I believe that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noticed, during my travels throughout Europe and my conversations and meetings how popular this new initiative is already and how high the expectations are of our citizens, in our schools, in sports organisations and public authorities. I am therefore quite convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that this European Year of Education through Sport will be a great Year. If, by way of example, we consider the European Year of Languages and the way it developed through the contributions of the citizens, I am sure that, run along the same lines, the European Year of Sport will be even more effective and have an even greater effect on our different societies.</p>
<p class="contents">Some days ago, in Vienna, at a conference on the subject of Europe and ethics, President Prodi said: ‘Europe … needs ideas and a soul’. Our work on the value of sport, on social and educational sport, will help to bring this about. I am delighted to say that education and sport are at the centre of everyone’s daily concerns. The only thing we have to do, and we will succeed in this, is to promote the positive aspects of sport over the negative tendencies.</p>
<p class="contents">On a practical level, I can now tell you that my staff have already been working on the calls for proposals which need to be launched in the coming months. We are already thinking about a schedule, events and setting up an advisory committee. I must admit that, as you can see, this vote is not the final whistle marking the end of an impeccably played political game. Rather, it is the starting pistol. Of course, Parliament will be regularly informed of the progress made on the European Year. The Commission does, of course, have a formal obligation to keep Parliament informed, but this will also give me the opportunity to hear your ideas, for you have made such a useful contribution to the initial development of the idea of the Year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I spoke just now of the historic vote on education through sport. The year 2004, as everyone knows, will be a historic year in many other respects too: enlargement, then the Convention and many other major events. In this connection, I would like to ask you to reflect on the following questions. In a Europe which wants to be close to the citizens, can we continue to see sport just as a commercial activity? Should we not take notice of the fact that sport has pride of place in the citizens’ daily lives? Is sport not an important part of any citizenship policy?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I know that Parliament has started to discuss these questions and that you are already aware of the role played by sport in European integration and in awakening a European spirit in our fellow citizens. In a similar way, the sporting values that we are going to promote vigorously among the younger generations and citizens of Europe will be the basis for active citizenship in which there is respect for others and respect for the European ideal.</p>

Both in normal situations and in extreme situations, in marginalized areas, when there is a need for integration, amongst many others. Furthermore, it is a great tool for educating on issues such as the environment, food, health, teamwork etc. We should take the greatest possible advantage of this.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take advantage of the fact that 2004 is the European Year of Education through Sport in order to demonstrate to the Europeans that we in the European Union are also concerned about sport and that we attach much importance, for example – since I do not want to give an interminable list – on the benefits which it brings for health, for the integration of people in our Europe and for the fight against xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also take advantage of the possible impact of 2004 to demonstrate that it is entirely compatible to work for sport in the 15 Member States – or 25, when enlargement takes place – and also at Community level, at the same time, and that they must not fear that we are going to take over their competences. What we do want is to fill the vacuum left by subsidiarity so that the Europeans can benefit from the numerous positive aspects of sport. I therefore ask that we all make an additional effort so that, in the next review of the Treaty on European Union, an article relating to sport may be included, once and for all, so that the Europeans may see that here, in the European Parliament, in the European Commission and in all the European institutions, we care about sport as an essential tool for improving their quality of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I see it as a good start that we are able, today, to discuss it during the day.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that 2004 will be so fully devoted to sport. The Olympic Games, the Paralympics, the European Cup in football, to name but a few, will draw the attention of millions of people, filling many of them with enthusiasm, disappointing others, but also prompting people to themselves get involved or step up their involvement. The European Year of Education through Sport can make use of this public interest in order to highlight the social value of sport. There is already evidence, provided by numerous studies, of sport's educational value, of its capacity for preventing ill-health and rehabilitating after illness, of the social skills that it imparts to young people and the elderly, and of much else that has already been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">So I welcome the fact that we will be producing no more new studies, but will be gathering new insights from practical experience of the Year of Sport's extension of activities such as the encouragement of cooperation between schools and sporting organisations. That is of great importance in bringing the two together and maximising the advantages to both in terms of the mobility of pupils, clubs and officials, and also supporting sport in performing its social functions and discharging its social obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, however, it all keeps coming back to the importance of asking what we mean by fair play, which is inseparable from sport. I believe that racism, doping, and the treatment of sportswomen and sportsmen as commodities have left deep scars on the image of fair play. In the same way, we should be treating women in sport with a new respect, and doing something about their status in this area too. That is also underlined by our call for clubs to be involved in the Year of Education through Sport – something not called for in the first proposals. There are 600 000 sports clubs, with thousands of officials, and they make a very important and essential educational contribution that we can never dispense with.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, 2003, the Year of People with Disabilities, is almost upon us. I believe that here too we have to make use of this issue as an early preparation for 2004, asking even now how many opportunities disabled sportswomen and sportsmen have to integrate? What activities can the sports clubs – all 600 000 and more of them – offer these people? This is where there is a need for public awareness and also for financial support. All this underscores our demand for this to be incorporated into the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament has been pressing us for a European year of sport in previous resolutions, the last of which was in 1997. Up to now, the European Union has primarily paid attention to professional sport and much less to recreational sport and its cultural, educational and social merits. As has rightly been said, this is probably and primarily due to the fact that the Treaty still contains no articles giving the European Union explicit powers in this area. Yet in view of the fact that a third of EU citizens actively participate in sports and that there are more than 600 000 sports clubs, sport is undeniably an important social phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport is not only important on a social and cultural level but on a financial one as well. According to estimates, the sector accounts for about 2% of the European Union’s total gross domestic product. Sport is of great significance as a disseminator of positive values such as willpower, courage, tolerance, loyalty and friendship. In view of its enormous impact, however, sport is also often approached negatively with feelings of chauvinism, racism and violence, and it unfortunately also gets negative publicity as a result of violence, corruption or hooliganism. In this European Year the spotlight will be on sports education and training for young people, and this is therefore something to be celebrated. It is also true to say that less and less time and attention is devoted to sports education at school, a trend that urgently needs to be reversed. This is where sports clubs can play a complementary, supporting role for schools. It is therefore essential to improve links between clubs and schools. Sport should primarily be creating a physical and mental balance as well as social integration, and, as we are heading for enlargement in 2004, this is more than important, particularly at a time when intolerance is increasingly raising its ugly head. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I strongly and warmly welcome the celebration of the European Year of Education through Sport 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most looking forward to seeing the positive impact that sport will have on the lives of young people from disadvantaged communities as a result of this programme. It will present sport as a way of improving the social inclusion of these groups and communities. Nevertheless, I regret that both the Council and the Commission rejected Parliament's amendments providing for the organisation of school competitions which would have allowed winning schools to attend the next Olympic Games in Greece. That said, however, I welcome the Council's recognition of the will of Parliament on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not for nothing have both democratic and totalitarian governments used taxpayers’ funds on sporting activities.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the construction of Europe, the role of sport was formally recognised by the Communities in the Adonino report presented to the Milan European Council in June 1985. There can be no question that this issue was seen as a major asset, enabling the Communities to foster active engagement of the citizens of Europe in the construction of that project. Therefore, whatever the fine rhetoric that might flow from this House, the true aim of this particular European Year is to promote further European integration. In other words, this is naked propaganda.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not a coincidence that the Year has been declared to coincide with the Olympic Games. Members of this House may think otherwise, but this is a cynical attempt to hijack the Games in order to promote the European agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore outrageous that European taxpayers’ money is to be spent on this project. The sum of EUR 11.5 million may be a small amount in the grander scheme of things, but it is still a lot of money. There is no justification. We are not here to finance such naked and cynical propaganda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our dear friends, Mrs Zabell, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström and Mr Mennea, are in some way an example, evidence of the simple fact that educating people through sport means producing a generation which knows the value of things as well as the price. Precisely because it understands their value, it is able to display a great passion for social values when it matures, displaying a strength and commitment which are not limited to the quest for results at all costs, and that is why these Members are fully entitled to sit in this Chamber and are worthy representatives of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Our intention is to convey this concept and these values in a debate which embraces the education systems too. At the moment, if there is any severe criticism in our report, it is criticism of the European education systems, which are devoting increasingly less time to the playing of sport in schools and under which there are an ever-increasing number of schools with dilapidated sports facilities. These must receive support and assistance. This is one reason for the rapporteur’s concern to approach the matter in a practical way, promoting a practical debate on the educational potential of sport through the staging of the competitions. In other words, I believe that the European Year of Education through Sport may be the right stimulus to get schools to do something for the European youth of tomorrow, to change the fate of a generation, so that, in the future, we have different young people who not only become champions but, more importantly, become people who see sport as a path to truth, in other words who become champions of humanity, for a champion of humanity can become a sporting champion too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have done some really excellent work for many years now to promote sport and physical education. It has been a genuine pleasure to work with you.</p>
<p class="contents">It is excellent that the Commission should have begun to organise a Year of Sport.</p>
<p class="contents">The positive role of physical exercise as a basis for mental and physical well-being is now becoming common knowledge throughout Europe. Leaving aside for a moment the benefits of having a regular, wide-ranging hobby and an attitude to life that goes with it, even a little exercise prevents heart and vascular diseases, ailments that affect the organs of locomotion, rheumatic illnesses and mental health problems. The very fact that exercise is able to prevent mental problems often gets little attention. Exercise can help keep a nation’s major economic problems in check. An enormous amount of lost working time could have been prevented through exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">Seen in this light, the budget of EUR 11.5 million granted for the Year is at least not oversized. Schools in many Member States organise important optional activities after the school day has officially finished. Resources to make these afternoon activities possible must be increased considerably, as there is a huge demand for what they can provide. Afternoon clubs organised voluntarily often do valuable work. Afternoon sports programmes help children satisfy their natural desire and need for exercise. At the same time, they are doing something meaningful and social problems and exclusion are being prevented.</p>
<p class="contents">Why can we not talk of sport as sport? It is ridiculous that sports projects in the legal basis have to be hidden away under other articles, as there is not one for sport. It is better to call things by their own name, both now and in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to add my congratulations to those of all the Members who have highlighted Mrs Pack’s remarkable work and her vigorous, tenacious endeavours over many years, which have, at last, brought success. Today one might say, her baby is being taken to church to be baptised.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond briefly to a number of specific questions which have been asked.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it has not been possible to include in the text Parliament’s suggestion that schools competitions could be staged and that winners could be present at the ceremony of the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, I can let you into a secret. My co-workers are already working with the International School Sport Federation to see what can be done to accommodate Parliament’s request.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware, Mr President, that Parliament does not want an avalanche of studies on the matter. That is all well and good, provided that it does not turn round afterwards and say that studies would have been useful after all. While I acknowledge the need for practical work, I still feel that it is necessary for an evaluation to be carried out afterwards, as, moreover, happened in the case of the European Year of Languages, which was such a success that I feel we can use it as a model in terms of what to do and what not to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I can let you into another secret. I have already received numerous requests from the major European sports federations, who want to contribute to or participate in the project or to work with us. They all want to be involved and to make their contribution to the enterprise. They will not ask us for money, for they have much more money than we have! The EUR 11.5 million budget is intended to encourage, to set in motion a driving force, for it is civil society, sportspeople and schools which will actually do the practical work.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of questions have been asked relating to the European Year of People with Disabilities, on which we are actively working. The Special World Olympics will take place in summer 2003 in Dublin. In this context, we will fund the hiring of Irish volunteers to make this major sporting festival for people with disabilities possible. This is an experiment which will be repeated throughout 2003 and 2004: getting young volunteers – 100, 200, 300 volunteers – from all the countries of Europe to work together in the service of sport during major events of great symbolic importance. The first experiment, in Dublin, will thus bring together 200 volunteers from all over Europe. This will be repeated in Athens for both the Olympic Games and the Paralympics, and for all the major sporting events where the voluntary contributions, good will and idealism of our young people can come into their own. In other words, our young people will take centre stage.</p>
<p class="contents">You can therefore see that practical measures are currently being taken. As I promised you, you will be kept informed of developments, and I am also counting on your contribution so that we can make this year the year of all the citizens in your regions and your countries, for, as representatives of the citizens, you have a major role to play in this sense.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, the issue of public services is the subject of a major debate in Europe and elsewhere, and the general trend observed during the past 20 years has been a development of the role of the public authority, which no longer produces directly but regulates and establishes the rules for the game. This is the case in Europe, in particular, where the goal – which was also a necessity – of creating a single market has certainly facilitated this development.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience has shown that the creation of a single market based on the system of healthy competition is fully compatible with socioeconomic concerns, of which services of general interest are one of the most practical elements. Furthermore, a higher level of competition throughout the economy has led to an increase in the effectiveness of services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The history of the Community has always been consistent. At each new stage in European integration, progress has been made towards both freer movement of goods, persons, services and capital and greater inclusiveness and cohesion. Each step forward in the area of the internal market has gone hand in hand with the introduction of measures to ensure that the weaker regions and citizens are not left lagging behind. This was the case as regards the Single Act and the case at Maastricht and Amsterdam too. One example is the inclusion in the Treaty of the policy of economic and social cohesion, of consumer protection and of environment policy, all of which are intended to complement and balance the strategies of opening up the markets and liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 16 of the Treaty, introduced at Amsterdam, explicitly recognises the role of services of economic general interest. It confirms the need to find a better way of reconciling harmoniously and coherently the principles relating to services of general interest and the other objectives of the Treaty, particularly the internal market and free competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always recognised the primordial role of services of general interest. In its 1996 communication on services of general interest in Europe, it proposed a reference to the promotion of these services. The sectoral legislation adopted at Community level relating to major network industries, particularly the energy sector, contains extremely ambitious goals as regards high quality public services.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission has always applied competition and market rules in such a way as to avoid the supply and development of high quality services of general interest being hindered. I could mention by way of example the communication on public broadcasting, introducing rules on state aid, which was drawn up by Mr Monti and myself last year and which is an example of the way we can apply competition rules intelligently while giving governments all the leeway they need to organise public services properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Services of general interest are thus an essential component of the European model of society. They contribute to the citizens’ quality of life and are an essential condition if the citizens are to be able to exercise many of their rights fully.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report to the Laeken Council, the Commission declared its intention, and I quote: ‘to examine the suggestion to consolidate and specify the principles on services of general interest underlying Article 16 of the Treaty in a framework directive’</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission decided to carry out this examination within the framework of a Green Paper. There are two main reasons why it has adopted this approach. Firstly, the questions raised are very broad in scope and cannot be addressed in a debate limited to a proposal for a framework directive. Secondly, given the expectations and existence of very different positions with regard to the feasibility of a framework directive and the added value it would represent, it appeared essential to establish a reference framework first. We must not underestimate the technical and conceptual problems which would certainly be raised by the establishment of a framework directive either.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper will allow the Commission firstly to examine whether a framework directive would be appropriate and secondly to launch a large-scale debate on the overall issue. Therefore, the purpose of this Green Paper is not to delay the feasibility study on a framework directive. Quite the opposite: given the diversity of the traditions, structures and positions existing in the Member States, only a broad European-level debate will be able to draw out enough common ground for an overall Community framework to be established. In addition, alongside the preparation of the Green Paper, we are working on other dossiers, particularly in the area of the application of rules on state aid and in the field of the evaluation of services. This work could, moreover, be a useful contribution to the Green Paper. As regards the timetable, the Green Paper should be adopted in March 2003 and the conclusions drawn before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Mr President, is the Commission’s statement on this matter.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner Reding's task today is a difficult one, to make a statement on the Commission's behalf on action that the Commission has been putting off for a year. It is the case that, thirteen months ago, Parliament delivered its opinion on services of general interest by a well-supported vote, with 435 votes being cast in the final vote. Since then, the Commission has done little. It has submitted four documents. The latter two of these, submitted before the Copenhagen Summit, just as the submission of the others six months ago preceded that in Seville, say nothing more than that rulings are awaited from the European Court of Justice. I do not at all understand, Commissioner, why the Commission does not have its proposals debated here in Parliament, openly and with no holds barred. If, as in this case, you gaze fixedly at the European Court of Justice in the same way that a rabbit gazes fixedly at a snake, you are not acting as if all options were available to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Although, Commissioner, you are affected by this only tangentially, this being primarily a matter for the Competition Commissioner, it is for this reason that I really do want to insist with some emphasis that the Commission should not just hand out ‘non-papers’ that it sends to governments – the last was on 12 November this year – but should involve Parliament in this debate. We are not prepared to take the rap for whatever decisions the Commission comes up with if Parliament cannot be properly involved in the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">So let me say quite bluntly that, as you have already mentioned, we called for a framework directive. We called for a framework directive on the basis of Article 95, which deals with the internal market. That means that this public debate on the basis of Article 95 leads to a decision by Parliament and the Council by way of the codecision procedure. What has been submitted to us so far says only that previous procedure in competition policy was being followed, in other words, that a decision by the Council would be sufficient, that Parliament would be informed and should then see what happens next. It is exactly as you have said: the topic will give rise to a great debate on social and economic policy. Far from being something that the Commission can sort out with the Council behind closed doors, that must be done in public view, here in the directly-elected Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason why I make these somewhat pointed observations is that these issues are dealt with in none of these documents, which are numerous and of varying quality, the non-paper being far and away the best of those that have been submitted. The evaluation methodology set out in the summer was put together so carelessly, and was of such poor quality, that it cannot serve as a basis on which to raise proper awareness.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to stop biding its time and do the business at long last! The European Court of Justice's ruling in the Ferring case is a workable basis on which to evaluate state aid and public services. I call upon you to be prompt in submitting decisions based on it and to delay no longer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Lancker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would naturally like to thank the Commissioner for her announcement and for the prospect of a Green Paper. However, I do not often find myself in complete agreement with what Mr Langen has said. My group is particularly disappointed with the Commission’s reluctance to proceed with presenting the European Parliament with a framework directive. As you yourself said, services of general interest are the cornerstone of our European social model. I am talking about people’s social rights, basic facilities such as water, energy, public transport, communication and healthcare, which are furthermore essential for social cohesion and for the proper functioning of our economies. My group, and in fact the whole of Parliament, has been pressing for this framework directive for years. Even the Council is ahead of the Commission, as the Council pressed for this framework directive in Nice and then much more explicitly in Barcelona. Despite this, the Commission insists on broad consultation first via a Green Paper in the spring of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the problems surrounding services of general interest are complex. I understand the differences in approach between the Member States. I know that there are public and private players involved, and it is therefore true that there are differences depending on the sector. However, in the meantime we are constantly being confronted with standpoints concerning the liberalisation of various sectors in the economy without having a framework directive that sets out the general principles. Let there be no misunderstanding: my group is in favour of the internal market, subject to certain social and ecological adjustments. However, the market is an instrument, and the market has its limits, and when it comes to people’s basic social rights, it is not the rules of the market and competition that should be laying down the rules of play.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper will furthermore arrive too late to contribute to the discussion in the Convention about the role of services of general interest. We are already holding this discussion at this moment. We will be completing it in February, and the Commission will not be presenting a Green Paper until March. I think that the Commission will be missing the boat.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is one last reason, one fact that causes me great concern, and that has to do with Mr Langen's comments. So far the Commission has always assumed that Member States were allowed to finance their services of general interest as a social mandate without this being regarded as illicit state support – and rightly so, in my opinion. However, the Treaty is undeniably lacking in clarity. Recent conclusions by two advocates-general at the European Court of Justice have demonstrated that this principle is no longer above suspicion. The Commission will now obviously conclude that they cannot give legal security to Member States in the area of the financing of services of general interest. So what has happened to this much-vaunted autonomy to organise their own public services? Ladies and gentlemen, the conclusion is clear to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we will immediately ask the Commission to issue a framework directive, as we have repeatedly done.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Convention must provide the opportunity to establish the basic principles of public services with complete respect for the powers of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, our constitution must clearly specify that services of general interest are our people’s social rights and must not be left to market rules and competition. I hope that the Commission can support us in our ambitions.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallis (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, I was going to say on behalf of my group that we are pleased to see that a Green Paper is forthcoming, but perhaps I am in the minority in saying that I am pleased to see that a Green Paper is forthcoming in the sense that something is actually happening. The promise of future consultation and feasibility studies is to be welcomed, but this should not be an excuse for doing nothing. In that sense I agree with my colleagues that something has to happen sooner rather than later. Process can be important, and we must get that right.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two points on behalf of my group, the first relating to competition. Competition is excellent – we agree with the internal market – in that it is a way of raising standards generally and can also be a way of raising standards in the services concerned, but not for its own sake. Perhaps it would be interesting to look at a country outside the EU – Switzerland – in terms of energy policy. Recently the Swiss had a referendum to ascertain whether they should liberalise their energy provision, presently provided by their local cantons. Swiss citizens voted against this because they were not satisfied that choice in that sense would raise standards – it might just prove confusing. That question was put to the citizens of Switzerland. We, on the other hand, are waiting for a framework to establish how we should introduce such choices across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue of particular importance to my group is universal services provision. This guarantees social cohesion across Europe. Taking my own constituency, for instance, and the current issue of broadband, letters are flooding into my office from constituents in rural areas who complain that broadband is available in certain cities, but not for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Such matters have to be resolved so that we can provide the same level of service to all our citizens and therefore guarantee the social cohesion which is so important to Europe. It is ridiculous that the Convention and its working groups are currently discussing these issues. These matters call for coordination as we move forward with the development of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is good that something is actually happening, it is good that there has been a statement, but let us get on with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that services of general interest are at the heart of European integration, or rather that they ought to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Although their place and role in the Union are indeed recognised, in principle, in Article 16 of the Treaty, they are still subject to competition rules, with all the ensuing consequences. There has been growing pressure for faster liberalisation in many sectors. The Brussels European Summit, last March, was a decisive moment in this sense, moreover. Energy, transport, a new era for the postal services sector: the recurring argument is that liberalisation would be the solution to the need to modernise these services. This is not true, as we can see from numerous examples. I believe that one of the functions of services of general interest is to ensure social and territorial cohesion. They must guarantee access to high quality services for all citizens throughout the whole of the territory and at the same price. However, the rules of profitability and the principle of competition run counter to these objectives and these functions.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens’ needs as regards high quality European public services are currently being expressed in many Union countries. The drawing-up of common European rules allowing harmonisation from the top downwards has become a necessity, particularly in view of enlargement. The modernisation of services of general interest must be part of a measure not seeking to open up the market to competition but intended to respond to the needs expressed. That requires genuine democratisation and the genuine participation of workers and users in the development of these services. In this connection, the European Union has a particular responsibility. It must, first of all, allow a proper evaluation to be carried out of the different liberalisation processes, country by country. Despite calls from the European Parliament on a number of occasions, this evaluation of the consequences for safety, the environment, quality and social concerns has never been carried out. Why?</p>
<p class="contents">I too believe that we cannot wait for a Green Paper to be drawn up in a few months’ time to address this issue, however useful a Green Paper might be. Although a Green Paper might serve some purpose, I feel that services of general interest should no longer be seen as an exception to competition as they have been hitherto but, quite the opposite, that they must be seen as one of the European Union’s priority responsibilities. They must therefore no longer be subject to competition. Work is being carried out on a new Treaty within the framework of the work of the Convention with a view to the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference. We must address this issue in the debate on the Treaty. It is time to listen to the demands of the citizens, of the trade unions, which are demonstrating everywhere in a plea for high quality services. These demands go hand in hand with the need for a Europe of social progress, a more democratic Europe. That is why we cannot be content with a minimal definition of a European universal service. We must be ambitious for social Europe. We must place services of general interest at the centre of European integration and European citizenship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have already heard more sense from the Commission, when it started to express a doubt precisely as to this ability of competition law to bring about the achievement of all the social and environmental objectives. I believe that, in actual fact, we, and the Commission, in particular, would find it much easier to make these self-congratulatory statements if we had an evaluation, as my fellow Members have said. I feel that there is absolutely nothing to be gained in any quarter by underestimating the huge expectations of the European citizens, who are demanding more services, better quality and a higher level of safety. I believe that, if we were to turn a deaf ear to the doubts being expressed today regarding the continuity and sustainability of these services, particularly since<span class="bold"> </span>they have been called into question as a result of disasters and<span class="bold"> </span>particularly since this deterioration is currently evident in a number of public services, we would be severely jeopardising the future of Europe and the result of the decision that its citizens will have to take on the future Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">You have decided to open a broad consultation<span class="bold"> </span>process<span class="bold"> </span>on the Green Paper. It is true that this initiative is very surprising, given its connection with the – extremely problematic – debates that we wish to hold within the Convention with a view to fully enshrining the right to public service in the future European Constitution. I would therefore like to hear you speak about the organisation of the agendas, for it would appear quite incredible that a debate should be opened on the feasibility or usefulness of a framework directive under the current Treaties, even if the aim of the debate is to achieve the recognition of and basis for a European approach to public services in the future Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as regards the consultation procedure, we have already been sufficiently traumatised by a number of proposals which were clearly going against a whole range of different interests within European society. I would like the Commission to explain clearly which public method of hearing will be used to enable the different players – users, trade unions, NGOs, local and regional authorities etc. – to make themselves heard during this consultation on the Green Paper. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Della Vedova (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, as regards services of general interest, the Commission is attempting to reconcile two requirements which are, in a number of respects, opposed: the need to guarantee the provision of certain services which the market is considered not to be able to provide efficiently and at affordable prices, and the need to prevent certain services becoming a source of distortion of the market or distortion of competition. I believe that the Commission’s concern continues to focus too heavily on the first point and too little on the second, the distortion of competition. This is not surprising, because the governments, and, therefore, the Council, are pushing in this direction because of the existence of<span class="bold"> </span>a clear conflict of interests. There are key sectors, such as the telecommunications, energy, water, transport, television and media sectors, in which the governments are both referees and players, they have to juggle with a burdensome conflict of interests, they are not regulators and legislators, they themselves are entrepreneurs with large multinational businesses which are sometimes used for political and other ends. Today, this conflict of interests has yet to be resolved in many European countries. Indeed, in these sectors, a no-man’s-land is being created where, rather than the good of the European consumer and the general interest, the specific interests of companies and of the economic and political potentates associated with them are being pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">There are countless cases of the allocation of inappropriate market spaces to such companies. One example is <span class="italic">Deutsche Post</span>, which uses its monopolist’s profit in the postal services sector to overcome competition through take-overs too, as happened in the case of <span class="italic">DHL International</span>, which <span class="italic">Deutsche Post</span> acquired, exploiting its monopolist’s profit to knock a competitor out of the market. Not to mention <span class="italic">EDF</span>: France agreed to work towards opening up its energy sector within the country, in the sure knowledge that <span class="italic">EDF</span>, which was 100% state-owned and not quoted on the Stock Exchange and which could give loans guaranteed by the state, would acquire companies abroad, in Italy and elsewhere, in other words that it would go shopping, consolidating a dominant position in the European market. Then, in Italy, there is the case of a major television company such as the <span class="italic">RAI</span>, financed with huge sums of taxpayers’ money, which competes in every way with other television companies as a commercial channel.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the situation: there are public services which ultimately create state companies that distort competition. When the states have freed themselves from all the companies, it might be easier to imagine a regulatory state, a state which contracts out or puts out to tender services which it considers that the market alone cannot provide adequately.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one last point, Mr President, Commissioner. There is a service, the mobile telephone service, which the Commission does not deem to be a service of general interest. I feel that this is a serious mistake and that, now, the mobile telephone service is to all intents and purposes a service of general interest. Indeed, it is one of the services which is provided most effectively throughout Europe, extremely efficiently and with optimum prices, and it is a service of general interest which the market provides through a system of competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That being so, I want to give an example of how we in this House can bring some influence to bear. If we were actually to manage to at last make some progress with the legislation on local public transport, we would have done a substantial chunk of Parliament's and the Council's work. Here, for once, I would like to give the Commission credit for submitting a very specific proposal for a regulation on local public transport as long ago as 2000. We in this House delivered an unambiguous opinion on it in 2001. And what is the Council doing? It has shoved the draft in a drawer, done nothing with it, and still does not want to do anything with it. I believe that we have to make it clear to the Council that we will not put up with further delays on matters as fundamental as the right range of services provided to people in towns and in the regions, but may well have to consider bringing proceedings against the Council in respect of its failure to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, ladies and gentlemen, is this issue of legislation on local public transport so important? The law on the situation we are in is unclear. We have the option of awaiting rulings from the ECJ, but we want the decisions on what public transport systems should be like to be taken politically, and so we, the towns, the communities and private enterprise, need legal certainty as to how local public transport is to be organised.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to address is as follows. I believe that a slip of the tongue has crept in here. Services of general interest and competition are not mutually exclusive, but are, in my view, mutually complementary, something that we see particularly clearly in local public transport. If, in the exercise of its responsibilities for public services, the city or the region makes the right decision and defines what is required of local public transport – its accessibility to disabled people, the timetables, the intervals between services and the fares; you can add all the social factors you want – then, Mr President, it must be put out to tender, and then the best offer must be accepted, whether it be from the public or private sector. It is competition that decides, and the public that benefits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have had more lip service to the principle of services of general interest. We were told that the Commission was going to produce a framework for services of general interest before the end of this year, now we get a promise of a Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need the framework directive, not a Green Paper. We urgently need a change in competition law which enables services of general interest, public services, to survive and to prosper, and we need a clause in our new constitution which guarantees public services right across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity and citizenship are at the heart of the whole notion of the European Union. I would argue that, having taken a major step this week towards the political and geographical unity of Europe, if we are to create European citizens, we must have services of general interest universally available, accessible, affordable and of high quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Properly understood, services of general interest are for all citizens, not just for those who are excluded, or poor or indeed disadvantaged – though obviously they are of key importance to people in that situation. Services of general interest support and sustain growth. They sustain environmental sustainability. They are a key component of any serious spatial strategy which will enable us to have sustainable rural communities and indeed liveable cities. They will provide us with healthy citizens who do not fear illness. They will enable citizens to commute and to communicate. They will enable citizens to be well-informed, to be well-educated, not only in terms of technological education, but also politically literate. All of these things are necessary if we are to create a Europe of which we can be proud and which citizens will feel they own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It does, however, strike me as incomprehensible that the final conclusions and specific initiatives associated with it are to appear as long as six months later. Analyses and the demands for action resulting from them belong together. Having been called upon to do so by the Barcelona Council in March 2002, the Commission, in June of that year, adopted a new methodology for evaluating the quality of public services. You will be well aware that opinions on this are sharply divided, and I am telling you now that, in terms of its quality, this new evaluation methodology is an unmitigated disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the invariable tendency of the debate on public services to bring forth ritual repetitions about deregulation and privatisation, it would at least be proper to conduct, in parallel with the Green Paper, a scientifically sound analysis of the situation in those markets and enterprises that have already been deregulated and privatised. There are marked distinctions to be drawn between the successes and failures in the various lines of business involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The questions that demand answers are, firstly, whether equal rights of access are guaranteed to all citizens of the European Union, irrespective of where they live or of their levels of income. Secondly: has the cost of the service increased or fallen? Thirdly: has its quality improved or got worse? And fourthly: have the service's employees experienced an improvement or a deterioration in their social conditions?</p>
<p class="contents">This also involves putting the service providers on an equal footing irrespective of their ownership structures. There is nothing fair about the competition if the regulations on aid put enterprises with a larger than 25 % public stake in them at a disadvantage over against their private-sector counterparts. So ‘yes’ to competition on the basis of the best services, and ‘no’ to competition on the basis of ownership! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, you have the task of representing the Commission and your colleagues who are directly responsible for the matter, who have delegated this task to you. However, that is part of the job!</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to talk about the content, for my fellow Members have already amply expressed what are my views too. I have familiarised myself with the most recent Commission document, a concise text which was produced a few days ago. It points out, in particular, that the first general document on the subject produced by the Commission dates back to 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">Six years on, the Commission has announced a Green Paper. I do not feel that this is a responsible way to behave. You have timetabling problems which have already been pointed out by many people: you have problems scheduling your work to fit in with the Convention, you have scheduling problems with regard to the implementation of sectoral directives and you certainly have scheduling problems – as Mrs Ainardi mentioned – where enlargement is concerned. In any case, I believe that there is no point, ladies and gentlemen, in continuing to ask the Commission to produce documents. I am being mildly provocative in saying this: the Commission is divided. There is clearly no political leadership, which is disturbing considering that the Commission has sole right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that we Members of Parliament must now shoulder our responsibilities within the Convention. A number of contributions have already been submitted on the subject of services of general interest and the reconciliation thereof with competition law. In its first contribution to the Convention, in May, the Commission itself pointed out how important it is that we have legal bases for services of general interest. Page 6 of the document even states that, without this, any changes will actually be to the detriment of the European model of society and the values recognised by the European democracies. The Commission is therefore both aware of the problem and incapable of taking political decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We who are members of the Convention or Members of the European Parliament must turn to our national governments and, within the Convention, we must fight to ensure that the future European Constitution genuinely contains legal provisions providing a framework for competition law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In simpler terms, that meant that there had to be an end to the inconsistencies arising from unclear case law and the Commission’s never-ending attempts to use its competences in the field of competition to meddle with the definition and functioning of services of general interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years on, after a report from the Laeken Council and a call from the Barcelona Council for work to begin on a framework directive, we are still at more or less the same point, and the Commission’s only proposal is to put off resolution of the issue once again and draw up a Green Paper which will lead to a huge consultation process. This is extremely disappointing.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the solution is simple, clearly, the Member States still have to impose it. The Treaty must state clearly that, firstly, the Union recognises the freedom of administration of the States and their authorities, which includes their right to define and organise their public services, and, secondly, that the funding offsetting the additional costs<span class="bold"> </span>of successfully providing services of general interest is not to be deemed state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, there must be an end to the inconsistent behaviour of the Commission at international level. The negotiations taking place in the WTO on a future General Agreement on Trade in Services – GATS – are currently in serious danger of going off course, drifting away from the liberalisation of private services and becoming an indirect debate on the shortcomings of public services. These discussions are being led by the Commission with a complete lack of transparency and without a clear democratic mandate for the parties to agree on after a broad public debate. Moreover, this situation is strangely reminiscent of what is happening in the field of agriculture as regards the application of the so-called Doha decisions, which have not been democratically ratified by anyone.</p>

We do not need an examination of the need for a framework directive; rather, what we need is for the Commission to present a framework directive, in accordance with Parliament's long-standing request that it should do so. If examination is what you want, you should read the Langen Report, the thirty-five pages of which will give you a detailed explanation of why we need a framework directive of this sort. We therefore demand that the procedure be speeded up and that Parliament's resolutions be acted upon.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, there is such a thing as the Lisbon process, which speaks unambiguously in terms of the European Union having social cohesion as its objective. In my view, services of general interest serve that social cohesion. A large proportion of services of general interest are provided on a voluntary basis and not only as a main job. They contribute to a higher degree of humanitarianism, and, as a rule, they are at home in the area between the state and the private sector. The support they receive from the state is not to be regarded as state aid, and they are private, although not wholly subject to competition law. It is for this precise reason that we need a legal framework that provides legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">Christmas being only a few days away, I would like to extend the warmest thanks to those who work, whether professionally or voluntarily, for the common good.

Now, the subject is a Green Paper, but there has already – in the year 2000 – been a Commission communication on services of general interest, a Commission report to the Laeken Council and, indeed, many documents and positions adopted by the institutions, particularly the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, at this rate, by the time the framework directive is adopted, all the sectoral directives on energy, postal services and transport will already have been adopted, the timetables will have been established for liberalisation and there will thus not be much left needing a framework. The Commission is, indeed, very behind and we can only wonder what this means. Where liberalisation is concerned, we legislate and we set dates without even planning proper mid-term reviews. When it comes to public services, we organise debates on debating documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many of my fellow Members, I, for my part, feel that a precise legal framework is essential to protect and facilitate the development of public services in Europe as an essential part of citizenship. Now, public services cannot be subject principally to internal market rules because their objectives are long-term objectives, not immediate profitability, whether they relate to social and territorial cohesion, equal treatment or, as is sometimes the case, even equal pricing. Thus, these are not objectives which will bring an immediate return on investments, and they therefore cannot be governed by purely commercial reasoning, including where their compatibility and financing are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in the field of public services, we must be able to continue to finance what is not profitable with what is, and, therefore, that it is necessary to balance out prices. Since there is going to be a Green Paper, it would be appropriate, together with the social partners, users and local government representatives, to assess the long-term impact of liberalisation in a number of sectors in terms of quality and safety. I am thinking, by way of example, of the British railways, of employment and territorial cohesion. I am thinking of the postal services and the risk that oligopolies will form, and another example is telecommunications.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, in conclusion, that we need to give the Member States the possibility of having exclusive operating rights in certain geographical areas and of having reserved sectors which are not open to competition, for the expectations of the Union’s citizens are very high when it comes to public services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Much has already been said about the Green Paper and the Convention, and also about the question of whether we have left things too late. There is one thing that we can say with certainty, and that is that Parliament believes that the dialogue between the Commission and the European Court of Justice must come to an end. Parliament is being ignored to an extent that, in this area in particular, could scarcely be surpassed; hence the urgent call for the Commission to make some progress on laying down specific criteria for this.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points that are of great importance to me, and that I would like to see resolved once and for all. One feature of the discussion on services of general interest is that the Commission is willing to get involved only where economic activity is concerned. I am sure that this is perfectly understandable in principle, but it always ends up being about questions of detail. Is an ambulance service an economic activity? Yes or no? We do not need decisions in individual cases, but we do need the Commission to at long last specify the criteria to which it will refer when it takes decisions in future. It is not acceptable for decisions – like those on savings banks – to be at short notice and always, immediately beforehand, forwarded only for information.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to subsidiarity, which does, indeed, loom large in the Convention's deliberations. This is where the Commission's delay in making its presentation to the Convention has been crucial, but the regions and the Member States must continue to be given the option of determining these matters themselves on a local basis. What must not be allowed to happen is standards being imposed by the Commission through the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsidiarity is about having scope to take your own decisions on a local basis, so that things may perhaps be different in Bavaria – where I come from – from what they are in, say, Luxembourg, where the Commissioner comes from, or in Spain, Portugal, Greece or, in future perhaps, in Lithuania. That is why definitions must not be imposed through the back door. At the end of the day, though, I have to say that what we and the public need is legal certainty, and that is not promoted by what one of your fellow-Commissioners occasionally gets up to, then going as far as to advocate the deregulation of water. That, at the moment, is not on the agenda, and has to be dealt with in a sector-specific way; it is for that reason that the Commission needs to get around to taking action on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will shortly be saying something about the existence of other documents that are worth talking about and discussing, but first I will turn to the documents and the statement that you have given us.</p>
<p class="contents">You started by mentioning in your introduction that we are engaged in a discussion, and one that is being conducted in a very open way. At any rate, that is how it came across when interpreted into German. What do you mean by 'open'? Open as regards the possible outcome or open in the way the discussion is conducted? Both interpretations make me uneasy. With an open outcome? We have already moved on too far for that. Now you issue a Green Paper, which I see as nothing more than a means of creating a smokescreen while there are other decisions that urgently need to be taken. This is yet another exercise in avoiding doing anything, whilst, at the same time, very practical preparations are going ahead in other areas. Nor is the discussion being conducted in an open manner, for, as I have just told you, we have been given your statement on behalf of the Commission, along with documents of four or five pages each, not that the number of pages is of great importance. Yet, while we are given these documents, others are getting what are described as ‘non-papers’ – substantial documents that are really worth discussing, and in which we could find that there is legal certainty on specific points. Take the so-called non-paper dated 12 November, with its margin numbers – all 102 of them! You discuss these things with others, but not with us. I just want to pick up one point and be told what the Commission really thinks about it. Item 100 says: ‘An enterprise may provide more than one service to the public, some of them realising a profit and others showing a loss. Even if the enterprise does not provide public services, its services may cross-subsidise each other’. What that means is that, if we get an answer, we would be resolving an important financial issue, one that would help bring legal certainty. What we need right now is an answer and not this or that Green Paper, which serve only to delay the discussion process for ever and a day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is the major problem we are facing today, caused by successive decisions by the Commission and the Council, specifically at the Lisbon and Barcelona Summits, which have speeded up the liberalisation and deregulation of several sectors, such as telecommunications, postal services, energy and transport to name but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already beginning to see the consequences of these decisions, not only in the redundancies and in the greater instability of employment in some of these sectors, but also, in some cases, in the higher charges and prices and the poorer quality of the services provided. These developments have won the firm opposition of workers and of society as a whole, as demonstrated recently by the general strike in Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, acknowledge the importance of high-quality public services in guaranteeing all citizens the right of access, which also requires a firm stance to be taken in WTO negotiations against the liberalisation of public services.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, what commitments can you give in this context of the WTO? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They must take heed, for<span class="bold"> </span>the Constitution is to be ratified by referendum! My second point is as follows. If the concept of public services is not present, our citizens will stop believing in a European social model and see it as devoid of sense. This concept must therefore be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Commissioner, beware of ideologies!

Earlier this week I gave many well-deserved thanks to the Commission and Mrs Schreyer, my fellow rapporteur; my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets and our dear Chairman, Mr Wynn<span class="italic"> et al</span>. However, as the Danish Finance Minister was not present at the time, let me repeat my sincere thanks to the very constructive and efficient Danish presidency and in particular the Finance Minister, Mr Pedersen. He has managed to unite all the Member States and find solutions with us to very difficult issues. He has paved the way for the very broadly accepted solutions that form the basis for this, hopefully, short and uncomplicated vote today. I thank the Danish presidency very much.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me also thank the extremely efficient and competent secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, who worked extremely well under extreme pressure, but also in a very nice and friendly atmosphere. Finally, I warmly thank the sittings services who have always handled complicated issues on voting lists etc. in a very correct and efficient manner.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Now I turn to the formalities. Before the vote on the budgetary amendments starts, I must make a statement about some technical adjustments, some of which need to be put to the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">First, a purely technical adjustment: Amendment 1 on budget lines B1-406 and B1-4081 – Improving the processing and marketing of agricultural products – has been withdrawn, because it is covered by Letter of Amendment No 3 to the draft budget, which we have already voted on.</p>
<p class="contents">A vote is necessary to confirm the following corrections. First, Amendment 25 on budget line B2-5120 – Farm accountancy data network (FADN) – the figures should be modified as follows: an addition of EUR 1 391 000 in commitments and of EUR 1 383 000 in payments, giving the final figures of EUR 11 337 000 in commitments and EUR 11 329 000 in payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Amendment 238 on budget line B2-517 on plant and animal genetic resources. This should be withdrawn because it has also been covered by Letter of Amendment No 3.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Amendment 246 on budget line B3-3062 on Prince. The following five words should be deleted in the remark: '... of the national public sectors'.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in Amendment 168 on budget line A-200 – Rent and ground rent – the figures should be modified as follows: add EUR 3 409 073, giving a final amount of EUR 132 590 904.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest that we vote on these corrections en bloc before we start voting on the amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This money would otherwise have been used to compensate those who lost their livelihoods when we failed to renegotiate the Morocco Agreement. Since those funds are no longer required for compensation, they will be earmarked for helping the victims of the Prestige tragedy.

The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident occurred on 19 November. Six days later Parliament's delegation was in a conciliation meeting where we agreed on the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument for the remaining EUR 27 million for the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets. All this could have been dealt with differently and in a different time frame.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal as it is violates certain principles. Firstly, it violates a procedure that is transparent. Secondly, it violates the principles of specificity of the budget established by the financial regulation. It violates last year's decision to mobilise the flexibility instrument for the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets, and it also violates the principle of sound management since there is no margin left under heading 2, which implies that decommitments and then recommitments have to be made to make the necessary funding available.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made all that clear, let us look at the political and the pragmatic approach. We, in the Committee on Budgets, are political and pragmatic people – not just budgetary people as people seem to think we are!</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal at least gives us the chance to use this year's budget – the 2002 budget – and that would be a better solution for taxpayers, to make sure that we are using money from this year, rather than getting supplementary own resources for next year. Whilst condemning the procedure and making it abundantly clear that this calendar of the Commission should not in any circumstances represent a precedent, I can recommend, on behalf of the coordinator of the Committee on Budgets, approval of the urgency.</p>

Parliament wants to spend more money than the European Commission is proposing, but the Council guards the Member States’ purses by wanting to spend less. The result is an ever-increasing disparity between the expenditure ceiling agreed in 1998 and actual spending. As a representative of the Socialist Party in the Netherlands, I am faced with two choices each time. My party defends the maintaining or increasing of government expenditure intended for better public services, a better living environment and more solidarity with people in the poor parts of the world. It goes without saying that this will entail higher taxation levels than the governing neo-liberal politicians want. These taxes have to be collected from the top earners and from companies. However, accepting higher spending and higher taxes does not mean that we are happy to spend a great deal more money on an unnecessarily centralised EU. We regard part of the EU’s expenditure as a waste that only goes to support bureaucracy and megalomania. Even the structural funds and the common agricultural policy, which could deliver benefits for poor regions and small farmers, are sometimes spent on the wrong things. The only points on which I can support the increase in the budget proposed by the GUE/NGL Group are those relating to social funds, the Northern Ireland peace fund and cohesion funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you all know, I have always supported these initiatives, ever since 2004 was designated as ‘European Year of Education through Sport’ – and I stated this in the earliest debates on the matter in this House. I wish to reaffirm that this will give an important boost to better use being made of the educational values of sport in order to improve curricula and especially, parallel education, by establishing broader partnerships between educational and sports bodies. Furthermore, I would say that, in this context, it is worth emphasising the connections between sport and education and thereby increase the visibility of the ‘European Year of Education through Sport’, by holding and funding, for example, athletics meetings at school level in each participating country. Schools sports must, in fact, be a priority within sports policy and must, at the same time, occupy a prime position in schools and educational policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this is causing a problem for the many people who now live there. They have a higher standard of living than those around them and make greater demands on their government. They want to contribute critically to government policy, and yet they have simply been transferred from one colonial power to another. The ‘one country, two systems’ arrangement may guarantee the continued existence of capitalism, but it does not guarantee the introduction and development of democracy. It is therefore to be expected that many people will feel unsafe there and will want to leave. They want to go to Europe, the USA or Japan, where they are more likely to find the kind of society they have become used to. On the other hand, the Chinese Government wants to make Hong Kong more like the rest of the country. It may be being allowed to become a rich show-piece, but movements that are banned in China and normal democratic elections in which an opposition can come into power are not permitted. I therefore doubt whether an agreement on the readmission of refugees would really work. The intention that this agreement should become a model for other states in which critical people feel unsafe is even more controversial. That is why I am voting against this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It also represents an opportunity. Extending the Union to more than 100 million new citizens, from this first stage formalised in Copenhagen onwards, will encourage exchanges and economic activity and will breathe new life into the development and integration of Europe’s economy as a whole.

The consequences could be extremely damaging unless Portuguese interests are properly considered in the negotiations still to take place, even after the political decision on accession. It is unacceptable that a thoroughgoing revision of the CAP and the financial perspectives has not been advocated, in the joint motion for a resolution, for example, which we rejected.

The European Council has not even exhausted the envelope set in Berlin for the period 2003-2006. At the time, this was supposed to fund the accession of six new States. With less money, we are now supposed to cater for ten new members. Of the less than EUR 41 billion earmarked over three years, almost EUR 14 billion actually come from contributions from the new States themselves, which reduces the ‘joint’ effort of the 15 to some EUR 27 billion over three years, in other words, an annual transfer of less than 0.1 % of current Community GDP to the acceding countries. This is shamefully little, given the structural problems of almost all these countries. Under the Marshall plan, for five years after World War II, the USA transferred 1% of its GDP at the time to Europe. The FRG has for more than ten years transferred between three and four per cent of its GDP to the new ‘Länder’, totalling some EUR 75 billion per year.</p>
<p class="contents">Since commitment appropriations are not the same as payments, it is to be feared that some of the earmarked funds will not reach the countries for which they are intended. As the Court of Auditors has just observed, of the EUR 520 million earmarked in 2001 under the Sapard programme, only EUR one million has actually reached the candidate countries.</p>

This will result in the contributions to the structural funds that have already been established being redistributed amongst a larger number of Member States than initially planned by 2006. There will be much less money available to the farmers in the new Member States than to their counterparts in the present Member States. Things could have turned out worse, but thanks to the compromise proposed by Denmark and to Poland’s tenacity, the Copenhagen Summit goes some way to bridging the gap between rich and poor. The Netherlands’ calculated efforts in particular have failed. That is not likely to prevent Central Europe from being the poor cousin of the West for a long time to come. If the majority of voters vote in favour of accession to the EU, hopefully of their own free will and not as the result of a propaganda bombardment, enlargement will happen in 2004, probably including half of the island of Cyprus. The EU must make sure that it does not become involved in a war for this island or succumb to pressure to allow Turkey to join quickly without applying standards for democracy and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I must point out that reprogramming is not the right route, and that the Council has still not approved the compensation fund in the <span class="italic">Erika</span> packages, it has still not been approved in the Council of Ministers, the European Council, and there is a genuine division between the European institutions which is jeopardising the fight against the international maritime traffic in dangerous goods in our waters.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also point out that the European Council has only given EUR 5 million for the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, a sum which I described yesterday as miserable and this must be said, bearing in mind that the United States have applied specific legislation through the Oil Pollution Act<span class="italic"> </span>and are going to claim, and will achieve, EUR 4 000 million from Exxon Mobil<span class="italic"> </span>for the <span class="italic">Exxon Valdés</span> accident.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe these things should be pointed out so that the European Union may really become a political union which shows solidarity, especially in the case of an accident such as the one that has taken place in Galicia, which is a truly European problem. It is being suffered by Galicia because that is where the majority of traffic passes, but it is genuinely a European problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully agree with this basic text, of which we were the main proponents and which follows on from the useful content of the debates in plenary, now and as long ago as 21 November, and from that of the previous resolution in this field. I wish to reaffirm our two main approaches: the Commission and the Council must act immediately on what has been learned from this appalling disaster, in terms of rigorous new measures for the future, anticipating the full applicability of others that have already been adopted and a thorough examination of the entire legal and technical framework. The Commission must also, however, undertake and provide us with a detailed and rigorous study of the entire <span class="italic">Prestige </span>crisis, including the way in which it was managed in practical terms. We would all gain from learning, point by point, from this terrible lesson.</p>
<p class="contents">This lesson must, therefore, be technically rigorous, scientifically precise and politically unbiased and dispassionate. Bringing any partisan national pettifogging to bear on this crucial evaluation, as those on this House’s left have attempted to do, destroying the spontaneous consensus of 21 November and seeking to mislead the European Parliament because of a political spat in the Spanish parliament, can only harm the seriousness and objectivity of the debate – by all sides, I must emphasise – and, consequently, once again, endanger our common future, as a result of overlooking the main aspect: our coasts, the coastal communities, the greatest interest of the European citizens, a greater ability to prevent and to respond in the right way in future.

<p class="contents">This is why the States that are affected by oil slicks should systematically pursue the international liability of the flag State concerned at the International Court of Maritime Law.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (PPE-DE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, may I start by saying how delighted I am to see the new generation of Europe in the visitors’ gallery following this debate, which directly affects their future.</p>
<p class="contents">No one will be surprised if I say that this European Commission report gave us yet another opportunity to confirm that the equal opportunities situation is totally unsatisfactory. Unfortunately, however, the European Commission report is also unsatisfactory. It is still a descriptive annual report. Of course the 2001 report contains more facts and figures than previous reports but it is still the product of a routine exercise. It fails to illustrate properly either where we have failed to achieve our targets or commitments or the real difficulties in applying our policies at European and national level. Although it refers to future developments, it fails to set specific commitments or timetables.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to individual issues, the European Commission is clearly finding it hard to apply equal opportunities and is failing to do so adequately. Some Directorates-General are not making commitments in this area. At the same time, action to encourage more women to apply to participate in applications has been unsuccessful. Our motion for a resolution calls on the European Commission to examine new ways of disseminating information and simplifying bureaucratic and other commitments which will allow women and women’s organisations to find out about and take part in European programmes. The same applies to the Member States, which are having trouble understanding gender equality and implementing it in practice. Where there are no central or regional political support mechanisms, equal opportunities programmes are not being applied. Member States generally have no quantitative targets in their programmes, do not evaluate the repercussions of equal opportunities on their economic policy and have no indicators or statistics broken down by gender either for programming or for evaluating national policies. So it would be very useful for the purpose of raising awareness of the situation and drawing up future policies if the European Commission were to conduct a serious study with indicators and comparative data on the situation in each Member State, especially on the application of Community legislation, so that we can compare problems and achievements and exchange best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">During the forthcoming year, 2003, the European institutions and Member States will need to act boldly and decisively. During the mid-term review of the Structural Funds which, as we know, will take place in 2003, the Member States will need to decide where there is room to promote equal opportunities, so as to prevent appropriations for measures to benefit women from being transferred to other objectives. We shall be preparing for the first European elections to include the candidate countries in 2003, and for national elections in various Member States. The Council recommendations on the equal participation of men and women have not brought about the expected results. Nor does the Council have a competent agency to help improve the coordination of equality-related issues. As for the European Commission, we are anxiously waiting for it to present a proposal for a gender equality directive based on Article 13 as quickly as possible, so that we can follow up the equal opportunities programme decided in Beijing and achieve our self-imposed targets throughout the fabric of economic and public life. All of this, you will say, has been said many times before, and you would be right.</p>
<p class="contents">Numerous people have commented, both inside and outside Parliament, that we women and some of the men working on these issues are becoming tiresome and repeating ourselves. We need to ask ourselves why they make these comments. Why does this issue not affect our society or at least not with the degree of importance we attach to it as regards both the human and economic factor? Why are our policies and principles not being applied directly and properly? I think that now more than ever we need to conduct a broad, ground-breaking dialogue with society and with those responsible for exercising European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want from the European Commission, Commissioner, are good ideas and efficient ways of applying them. Where the European Commission cannot force the Member States, it should encourage them to realise that equality brings benefits, not losses and difficulties. Let them understand how important promoting equality is to the strategic objectives set by the European Union, and I refer here both to the Lisbon objectives, which have been complicated by enlargement, and the objectives of defending human rights throughout the world and contributing to the economic and social advancement of mankind, especially in our own neck of the woods, by which I mean the Balkans and the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the members of the committee, and particularly the rapporteur, on the extremely careful and valuable work they have done, as well as thanking them for both their excellent suggestions and critical comments.</p>
<p class="contents">Very progressive and inspiring ideas have been explored, and these encourage the Commission to continue its efforts towards this objective. Every year, we observe how effective, efficient and innovative our dual strategy is, involving as it does on the one hand, the inclusion of gender mainstreaming in all the Commission's areas of activity, and, on the other, the implementation of specific measures of positive action in favour of women. As we did in the last annual report, we have taken care, in the report on 2001, to take your comments and proposals into account. Your proposals, suggestions and concerns will, of course, also be taken into account in preparing and elaborating the report on 2002, work on which has already started.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, at this point to enlarge on one point in particular, the evaluation issue. I am already in a position to inform you that, in 2003, evaluation will be carried out by means of two methods which, although different, complement each other. As happens every year, what we call a gender scoreboard will be set up, whilst it is planned that a second evaluation will be carried out by external experts. These efforts have to do both with the assessment of the 2001-2005 framework strategy and also with the financial plan. It is envisaged that a provisional report on these activities will appear at the end of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to lawmaking, we will support the revision of the directive on the equal treatment of women and men, planned for 2003, by, among other things, drawing up a report evaluating the implementing measures taken at national level. It is precisely this to which you have just drawn attention, and we will make it our common concern to carry out an assessment in this area. The object of the revision of the equal treatment directives is to simplify them, help to make them more coherent, and bring them into line with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Another reason why the coming year will be significant is that we will be focussing on how to balance the participation of women and men in the decision-making processes. In this respect, too, we are endeavouring to achieve tangible results in all areas, with women becoming better represented in all sectors, including in the social partners. Your report will be a very valuable help to us in doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, we will be concentrating on the crucial area of combating negative stereotyped images of women. Misogynistic clichés, being a substantial obstacle to equal treatment for both genders, can and must be combated. This will be a comprehensive action, aimed at all the actors, with the objective of robbing obsolete ways of thinking of their power and, in the medium term – who knows? – perhaps even completely eradicating them. In any case, misogynistic clichés should soon be seen as ridiculous relics of times that are no more.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has insisted on the best possible utilisation of funds for this purpose. Let me, in this context, remind you of the assessment to be carried out by outside experts, and, furthermore, bring to your attention the imminent adoption of a Commission communication on the introduction of the gender question in the Structural Fund. This communication will be a valuable instrument in the programme's mid-term assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the candidate countries have made evident efforts to transpose the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> on equal treatment, substantial advances remain to be made, and so the Commission will continue to give the utmost attention to this topic. The success of European enlargement policy is dependent on the common rules being correctly applied. In this respect, the role of the programme of action, with which eight candidate countries have associated themselves this year, is that of giving impetus, and a valuable one.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by returning to the issue of violence against women, in relation to which the Commission welcomes the Council's framework resolution of 19 July 2002 on the fight against trafficking in human beings. This resolution is of great importance in terms of the conclusions to be drawn at criminal level as regards the trafficking in human beings. The Commission will follow closely the way in which this resolution is transposed into the laws of individual states, and will work very closely with the committee in closely monitoring this as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The political measures implemented are being analysed but their consequences are not being assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this framework strategy is to guarantee that all the Commission’s policies take account of gender issues and analyse the repercussions of its activities on men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again we have to insist on the need to create more and better jobs between now and 2010, in accordance with the objectives set at the Lisbon Summit. We must insist on the need to guarantee equality between men and women in all political fields, in accordance with Article 3(2) of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">We must once again demand that indicators be produced on the structures for childcare, dependent persons and family assistance, as well as the differences in salary between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona European Council called on the Member States to eliminate the obstacles preventing women from fully participating in the labour market, in particular by creating crèches.</p>
<p class="contents">Respect for and promotion of equality between men and women are part of the Community acquis and are therefore an essential condition for the new countries of the European Union. It is true that the Commission has made efforts to promote equality between men and women, but so far they have been insufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to programmes funded with Structural Funds, it has been noted that the objective of equality has not been met, including in the Regulation referring to them. Even when certain programmes present it amongst their objectives, the results are not analysed and we know that this objective of equality is not really being met.</p>
<p class="contents">The absence of women through balanced representation in decision-making bodies is significant, particularly social partners and other bodies. Additional efforts must be made so that the presence of women in decision-making bodies becomes a reality. It is cause for satisfaction that this issue has been included as a priority for 2003 and we hope that it yields positive results.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that the Commission has included the integration of the principle of equality between men and women in external relations, and it must be present in all agreements with third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank the Commission and Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for their reports.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has succeeded particularly well in giving clear pointers for the way forward in equal opportunities, by means of the framework strategy on gender mainstreaming and the associated fifth action programme on gender equality. More rapid progress is being made in some areas. Last year, we adopted the directive on equal treatment in employment. That is a milestone, and we keenly await the first evaluation report.</p>
<p class="contents">In other areas, things are taking a little longer. However, there are already clear pointers in the case of the Structural Funds and as regards combating violence. I would like to point out that we in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities have already on several occasions proposed what was agreed here this morning: to make 2004 the European Year of Education through Sport. This House and I myself have for many years been calling for a European year of action against violence. I hope that will be picked up again.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also very anxious to see the proposal for a directive under Article 13 banning discrimination. There is also some delay on that. This needs to be pursued with great vigour. We also need to maintain the political will to make progress in involving women at all levels of decision making, both legally speaking and in practice. The outcome of the Convention in that respect has been very disappointing, so we need to act now.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also still a great deal to be done in the European Parliament, and my criticisms are accordingly also aimed at this House. Let us not beat about the bush – Parliament is lagging somewhat behind the Commission when it comes to implementing gender mainstreaming internally. We need to make progress both in terms of political decision-making and as regards the administration. Balanced participation of women and men can only be achieved if a genuine political will exists, and it requires a top-down approach. We are particularly looking to the political group chairs, to the President of Parliament and to the committee chairs to set a clear example.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at present working in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities on an initiative to achieve gender mainstreaming in the European Parliament, a kind of gender equality health programme if you like. It will be ready in time for the 2003 International Women's Day. I believe that we can set an example here to make it crystal clear that the European Parliament – even when enlargement is in the offing – is serious about equal opportunities for women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly when elections are on the horizon, it is not enough for the parties just to include equal opportunities in their manifestos; we also have to make sure it is implemented in practice. We expect that here in the European Parliament, where 30% of the Members are women, which means that we are somewhat better than average, things will be even better after the elections, so that we will move significantly closer to the goal of equal representation of men and women in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many other points appearing in both reports that I could comment on. I believe that ultimately the crucial factor will be the political will that needs to be demonstrated if the position of women is really to be improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In recent days, in my region, Galicia, this equality is being clearly demonstrated, through solidarity and also through pain. Yesterday, television stations broadcast the human and heart-breaking image of the minute’s silence expressing condemnation and rejection of the latest terrorist attack by people, men and women, who were working to recover Galicia’s environment, the marine environment, in the fight to deal with the consequences of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday as well, the media reflected the figures relating to domestic violence inflicted on women by their husbands, boyfriends or ex-partners. In some sections of the media it was also pointed out that the great majority of victims did not recognise their situation. This is what seems to me to be the most serious violation of sex equality. On the other hand, it is of some comfort that the result of the survey suggests an improvement in the situation in comparison with the survey of 1999, but it is worrying that this situation is continuing 15 years after a constitutional text, in its marvellous Article 14, declared that all Spaniards, in this case, are equal before the law, and that there could be no discrimination on the grounds of race, sex etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Charter of Fundamental Rights, in Article 20, declares that all persons – it does not say men and women, which is not necessary – are equal before the law. And Article 21 states that all discrimination is prohibited and, in particular, discrimination on the grounds of sex, race etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Tuesday, the plenum of the Spanish Congress of Deputies approved the idea that all legislative provisions produced by the government should include a report analysing their impact on gender equality. I believe that practical conclusions should be drawn from Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou’s report, which is excellent, given the balance she has achieved on an issue on which it is very easy to fall into demagoguery and not do enough, and we must move on from theory to reality and insist on the objective of equality through the horizontalisation of policies promoting equality, so that principles may become reality and so that reality may reflect the principles which the great majority of us advocate and which we want to see alive and enshrined in the Europe we are building. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Progress has definitely been made on the question of gender equality, even if it is two steps forward and one step back. The fact that certain male colleagues have started to take the floor and enthusiastically support gender equality shows that progress has also been made within the European Parliament. However, I must express my acute concern, as did Mrs Gröner earlier, at the fact that the Convention discussing and planning the future of Europe, in the absence of women, feels that any serious discussion about enshrining gender equality in the new Treaty and, more importantly, applying it in practice is pointless. Unfortunately, even in areas in which there is Community legislation, we often find infringements and violations, as with legislation on an equal day’s pay for an equal day’s work. It is a fact that resistance, with attitudes and structures generated by this long-standing patriarchy, often proves to be stronger than political will or even legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also note that there has been a serious delay with the new anti-discrimination directive based on Article 13, which we have been expecting for some time now, Commissioner. We are extremely worried by the fact that the European Commission keeps putting off a decision. What is the reason for this delay? Can the Commission tell us? Why is this decision so long in coming?</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is the fight against various forms of violence against women. We know that various forms of violence in the European Union have mushroomed. We know that thousands of women are literally at the mercy of slave traders. I know, Commissioner, that you mentioned the decisions taken by the Commission to fight trafficking in human beings, but we are by no means convinced that these decisions and the guidelines which you have issued will soon be transposed into the legislation of the Member States and we know that without judicial and without police cooperation, that is, without pan-European collaboration, it is impossible to break up these gangs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am delighted, Commissioner, that you have given priority in the 2003 programme to breaking the glass ceiling. This is a particularly worthwhile priority, because we predict that there will be an even balance of men and women in the new European Parliament following the 2004 elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we need data and statistics to facilitate comparative assessments based on which solutions can be identified. A simple statement that men and women are equal before the law is not enough. The Commission's priority theme for 2001 was equal pay. However, the report once again reminds us that women's pay for the same or equivalent work continues to average only 76% of men's pay. The Joint Report on Employment for 2001 states that the Member States have taken only limited measures to reduce this pay differential, and the Commission needs to play an active role here, especially with the prospect of enlargement. The committee is actively working on the priority themes for 2002 and 2003 – the reconciliation of work and family life and the participation of women in decision-making processes. The provisions in force at present will have to be better adapted to current requirements. If women, and men too, opt for family life and to have children, that should not prevent them from participating in working life. Women need to be involved in decision-making processes at all levels. The only way to make credible progress with a policy for both sexes is by means of mutual cooperation based on equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, some good projects have been worked out by women's organisations, but those organisations need more information on access to the Commission's system of financing and aid. The objective should be to ensure that as many stakeholders as possible can participate in the relevant programmes. After all, appropriations are made available every year to support projects relating to women, for example in the Structural Funds and in particular in the 2000-2006 action programme. However, the procedures involved need to be rationalised and simplified, because they are too complicated, both at Community and at national level. I would like to conclude by very sincerely thanking Mrs Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her balanced report. Unfortunately, the limited time we have available means that I can only touch on a few points. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is very important that we take equality seriously. Not only through declarations, but also through intentions, policies and actions. We therefore need to take the pulse of the equality policy, measure it and assess it. We therefore call for quantitative objectives for policies on employment and access for women to information, training and politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst all of us, men and women, we must make it possible for both governments of the current countries of the Union and the governments of the candidate countries to take equality seriously, to transpose the directives when necessary and ensure that they do not fail to comply with Community legislation. A new stage is beginning in which we will have to be very vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality – as many of us here know – needs to be fought for every day and every day no progress is made is in reality a step backwards. Many women are looking to the European institutions. Many of them live far from our prosperous Europe. For them, the progress we can make here is absolutely essential. It is possible that for many of them their only hope is that the European institutions will take equality seriously, both for the women within the Union and for all of those who, because they are outside the Union, encounter many more difficulties fulfilling their expectations of life.</p>
<p class="contents">We often say that there is no discrimination worse than that which comes from happening to be a woman. One does not choose to be born a woman. One is born one and, from that moment, one faces a huge number of obstacles which would not be there if one were a man. Therefore, given that we women make up half of the citizenship of the European Union, it is essential to attend to their needs and expectations, because they are the needs and expectations of the majority of the European citizenship. We are also talking about the expectations, the rights and the defence of equality for the majority of women in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities has been working very intensively on all these issues. This committee has achieved, I believe, significant progress, but it is not sufficient. We are interested to see the work the European Commission is doing as well and I believe that this report reflects perfectly both what we have assessed and also everything we are asking for for the more immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this excellent cooperation in our committee has borne fruit. Now that the time has come to evaluate the work of the year, we can all be pleased. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the dynamism of our rapporteur, although I would like to make two observations.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must remember the scale of poverty amongst women. Most of the 60 million people living beneath the poverty line in the EU are women.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must remain vigilant over Europe’s desire to protect the equality of the sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the first preliminary draft of the constitutional treaty presented by the Convention in October 2002 causes me some concern. The absence of any reference to equality between men and women in Europe is notable: it appears neither as a value nor as an aim, despite its inclusion in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention’s work programme, which is now dedicated to social issues, will enable this oversight to be corrected. We cannot conceive of it failing to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since 1975, the date of the first directive on equal pay and treatment, progress has certainly been made, but a great deal remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Statistics broken down by gender and the gender dimension that is included in all our policies are essential prerequisites. Practical actions to ensure that parents, both men and women, can benefit from infrastructures such as nurseries, for example, which enable them to reconcile family life and working life, would constitute a considerable step forwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Our actions must increase the population’s awareness of changes in mentality so that finally more women gain access to positions of responsibility and to supposedly typically ‘masculine’ careers. This also requires a common effort to be made with the social partners to ensure that this fundamental principle is applied in every company and in all collective bargaining.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is right to be taking an interest in mountain regions. As you know, the Commission is also paying great attention to these issues, as demonstrated by the conference organised in October at the initiative of my colleagues Michel Barnier and Franz Fischler on the subject of ‘Community policies and the mountains’. My colleagues Mrs Wallström and Mr Barnier – the latter of whom is in Brussels at a meeting of the Presidium of the Convention – have asked me to update you on some of the work being undertaken and on some issues still outstanding as regards the Commission's work on the European Union's mountain regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC Treaty does not refer to the concept of mountain regions as such. Article 158, which provides the legal basis here, states, in connection with the policy of economic and social cohesion, that the Community shall aim in particular to reduce disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, including rural areas. It could be argued that specifically incorporating the concept of mountain regions into the Treaty would better reflect stakeholders' concerns. For example, 95% of mountain regions come under Objective 1 or Objective 2 of Europe's structural policy. Compensatory payments for less favoured regions made under the common agricultural policy also benefit mountain regions in many cases.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has commissioned a study in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of mountain regions more effectively. This study has three objectives: to define the mountain regions of the enlarged EU, to create a database of these regions and to carry out an objective analysis of the situation in mountain regions and of existing Community and national policies, and to evaluate those policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the first of these objectives, a definition of mountain regions is to be created for the 27 current Member States or candidate countries covered by the study. This definition is being drawn up on the basis of topographical criteria, and in some cases climatic criteria are also taken into consideration. At the beginning of December 2002, the contractor carrying out the study presented the Commission with 16 possible definitions, and these are at present being examined in detail. A decision will be taken at the end of December as to which definition can be used.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this process of defining regions, a start can now be made on collecting statistical data. We expect that the process of collecting and analysing data and the presentation of the final report will be completed by September 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards regional policy and the common agricultural policy taking account of mountain regions in future, I have already explained that regional policy and agricultural and rural development policy are indeed two policies that directly take account of mountain regions. In the case of regional policy this is done through regional programmes for Objective 1 and Objective 2 areas, and also under the Community initiative known as Interreg, particularly through the Alpine region programme. Under the CAP, mountain regions are chiefly supported by means of compensatory payments for less favoured regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Consideration is at present being given to the future of these policies. The Commission's proposals on the future of the regional policy are to be presented at the end of 2003 as part of the Third Cohesion Report. It would therefore be premature to prescribe at this early stage how mountain regions are to be taken into account in the forthcoming 2007-2013 planning period for regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the current mid-term review of the common agricultural policy, the Commission's proposal places particular emphasis on strengthening agri-environmental measures, which often benefit mountain regions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards measures in favour of mountain regions under other Community policies, I would like to say a little more about competition policy and about general interest services. As you know, EU policy on grants of state aid is based on Article 87(1) of the Treaty, which stipulates that grants of aid by the state are fundamentally incompatible with the common market. However, this article also specifies cases in which grants of state aid may be approved. These exceptions include aid of a regional nature, or to be precise aid ‘to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment’, in other words areas whose per capita gross national product is less than 75% of the Community average. Certain other areas may also be covered by this exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Commission attaches great importance to services of general interest, as demonstrated by its communication of January 2001. However, as you know, maintaining and developing services of general interest is solely a matter for the individual Member States. The Commission can only offer encouragement in this field. In its communication, the Commission states that the aim of services of general interest is to ensure universal basic provision, that is to say access to essential services, including those in remote or inaccessible areas. In addition, the new Article 16 of this Treaty specifically recognises the important role played by services of general economic interest in promoting economic, social and territorial cohesion. The importance of these provisions was also emphasised by the Heads of State and Government at the Lisbon Summit in March 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point that I would like to mention is the Alpine Convention. Although this convention only directly affects four Member States, the Commission was involved in launching this initiative. It was not until summer 2002 that a sufficient number of signatories to the convention had ratified the various protocols so that it could come into operation. For its part, the Commission is investigating the various options available to it for more active involvement in the context of the Convention. The Commission has already presented its proposal for signing the transport protocol to the Council. However, I have to report that this proposal has so far not made much further progress within the Council. Furthermore, it needs to be made very clear that these protocols also have to be supported by the Member States at Council level, as the Council is responsible for signing and ratifying them on behalf of the Community. As you know, several states participating in the Alpine Convention have not yet ratified the protocols. However, we hope that things will move forward positively in the coming months, reflecting the effort made by some Member States at the end of the summer to breath new life into the Alpine Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission will continue to pay close attention to issues concerning mountain regions. Present and planned work, in particular the Directorate-General for Regional Policy's study, the results of the mid-term review of existing programmes and the conclusions of the Third Report on Economic and Social Cohesion will give us a more accurate picture of the situation and options for further action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now, unfortunately, mountain regions have rarely been a subject on which we have made observations or recommendations. And yet these regions warrant particular attention. Mountain areas offer a huge variety of riches. They are usually exceptional areas, which must therefore be managed in a very specific way, within a global policy of sustainable development of the mountains. These are complex areas due to their geography and their climate. They are areas in which farming plays a crucial role, but not any old farming; it must be a form of farming which is extensive, that takes care to preserve species of fauna and flora and the abundant supply of water, and to protect forests and natural habitats as defined by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This type of farming cannot exist, however, without people, hence the need to preserve these mountain areas from desertification and to do everything possible to maintain a human presence there. We must therefore strengthen and update provisions to benefit young farmers. The Commission has set up a number of programmes with which we are quite familiar: Leader and Interreg, inter alia, as you mentioned, Commissioner. This aid probably needs to be simplified, precisely because these are areas with specific characteristics, in order to make them more flexible to ensure that they are better suited to the terrain and that they take account of the specific characteristics of the region, the necessary protection of the environment and the existence of numerous specific methods for the management of these areas, such as pastoralism, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to tourism. We must encourage sustainable tourism, promoting the natural wealth of these areas but refusing to allow mountains to be turned into leisure parks built of concrete – which has, unfortunately, happened all too frequently in the Alps, amongst other areas. In order to achieve this, we must encourage private initiative, we must help local SMEs, which often suffer as a result of their isolation and communication difficulties and we must maintain services.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I was very pleased to hear what you had to say on this matter, particularly your reminder that it is important for services to be available everywhere, including the most remote areas. We must therefore give priority to structural projects aimed at promoting forms of transport that respect the environment and probably at giving a greater role to the railways. In mountain areas, this is, of course, more difficult, but, in the Alps, we have first-hand knowledge of these problems. We must also give priority to renewable energies such as water and wood and increase research into the prevention of both natural and material risks.</p>
<p class="contents">You also emphasised, however, the need to define mountain areas and not to forget hilly areas, because these play a crucial buffer role between mountains and lowland areas. We must also bear in mind, when talking about mountains, that the Alps are not the only ones; there are also the ancient massifs, which have their own specific characteristics and which must also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the sustainable development of mountain areas can only be achieved if all partners are fully involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very grateful to you for your words, Mrs Schreyer, which show how interested the Commission is today in the range of problems facing mountain regions; we are quite aware of this. I would also like you to know that we firmly intend to work together to ensure that our areas, which have very well-defined handicaps, can be effectively protected. I shall therefore dwell on a few points that complement what has just been said.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want our territories to enjoy a form of economic development that comprehensively brings together preserving the countryside, preserving the type of farming that is characteristic of a mountain region and developing tourism, perhaps the Commission should listen more carefully to two or three points that are absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to recall that competition policy, as it is currently legislated for and regulated by the European Union, can by no means meet the needs of these regions, which do not have as many opportunities as others.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is crucial that Community competition legislation is adapted to take account of the specific characteristics of our regions, in order to reduce these economic and structural disadvantages. We must also put in place economic and financial support and tax concessions of a structural and sustainable nature. Such measures are essential if we wish to combat the desertification and the ageing of these regions because, at the moment, these developments appear to be inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to reiterate the importance of the EU’s environmental policy. This might be a taboo subject, but I hope that, whenever work is done in this field, thought is given to the applicability of these provisions, which were designed for an urban context, a context of lowlands that do not experience the same type of problem. Very often, when regions with a geographical handicap are forced to apply this regulatory approach, they find themselves totally disempowered. I would even say that they suffer genuine deprivation.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore fervently hope that, together, armed with a coherent vision, we will be able to make progress, because enlargement will give mountain regions an extremely important role to play. Furthermore, in its work, the Convention must address our set of problems quite specifically. This concerns the territorial coherence and the cohesion of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is very positive that Parliament is able to discuss Europe’s role in this matter, particularly at the end of the Year of Mountains.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to welcome, along with the Commissioner who is present and those who are absent, the fact that we are witnessing a change in perspective. Over the years, my colleagues here and I have criticised the Union’s lack of interest in the problems of mountain regions. Today you have shown a different attitude, which was already evident in the October meeting organised on the Commission’s initiative around the theme of ‘EU policies and the mountain’, which included, among others, a speech by President Prodi.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciated your speech, Commissioner, because you succeeded in summarising the various issues. I would like to briefly go back over a few matters.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, as Mrs Guy-Quint said at the end of her speech, there is the major problem of introducing the issue of mountain regions into the treaties, which is absolutely essential. I think that we should take into account the important role of the Convention in this. We also need to make use of the two presidencies of the Council: the Greek Presidency and the Italian Presidency, two countries that are obviously affected by the problems of mountain regions. Introducing the issue into the treaties will provide an essential legal basis for obtaining a directive on mountain regions, in which we must of course solve the problem of competition. I therefore think that progress should be made in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, we should also look at the prospects for regional policy for 2007-2013. Why not consider a specific structural fund for mountain regions? Or, better perhaps, for areas that are geographically or naturally handicapped? I will not add anything regarding agriculture. Agriculture remains essential for safeguarding mountain regions. The same can be said about tourism, which Mrs Grossetête discussed in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add a few words on the International Convention on the Protection of the Alps. Unfortunately, I do not think that the Commission has sufficiently monitored the work of this Convention. In this respect, we need to promote the transport protocol, in order to have a legal basis for taking specific measures to regulate the flow of heavy goods vehicles in mountainous areas. We obviously also need to look more closely at the issue of the funding of the major rail links such as Turin-Lyon, the Pyrenees and the Brenner pass, because in my view it is one of the keys to sustainable development in mountain regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mountains are areas that contain some of the few remaining wildlife sanctuaries left in Europe. They need special status as sensitive areas. There is a clause in the Treaty for ultra-peripheral regions that provides for flexibility in adopting EU policies for special needs. This is what the Commission should be doing. It should declare mountains to be sensitive regions and then adopt legislation accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">It is disappointing that the Commission had no initiatives this year concerning mountains – not even a communication or a White Paper. That would have been very welcome. The Commission, whilst pushing for the International Convention on the Protection of the Alps, states that the protocols have been ratified, but not everyone has ratified the transport protocol. It is essential, in relation to the threat that highways and the trans-European networks are having on mountain regions, that these protocols are properly implemented, not just in relation to the Alpine regions but also in other regions such as the Pyrenees which are in danger. We also need conventions for those areas to protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to priorities, there is a conflict between the trans-European networks and the needs and concerns of people. It is quite clear that the people who have opposed trans-European networks have voiced real and true concerns. Their concerns have been ignored to prioritise the trans-European networks. This is a conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I cannot understand why the Commissioner is not putting pressure on Member States to ensure that they comply with Natura 2000 in the Alpine regions or why we do not have officially adopted lists of sites of Community interest. That is disgraceful. I urge the Commissioner to put pressure on the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, they are seeking recognition of their handicaps. Regions can only be classified as mountainous on the basis of their altitude. Difficulty of access, harsh climate and declivity should also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Mountain regions are also seeking recognition for the quality of their products. They do have a reputation for high quality, but that can only be valued if consumers can identify the products. Steps are being taken on this and we should support them.</p>
<p class="contents">In promoting the mountain economy we need to take into account the fact that it is developing in a fragile environment that needs to be both preserved and developed. It is therefore difficult to find the balance, which needs to be supported by coherent legislation, which is not currently in place. I am thinking in particular of legislation on bringing livestock rearing and shepherds’ huts up to standard, which is difficult to implement in some mountain ranges.</p>
<p class="contents">Conservation programmes, such as the LIFE and NATURA 2000 programmes, for example, also have damaging consequences for economic activity. Mountainous regions will only remain open if everything possible is done to offer those who have chosen to live there prospects for the future, particularly young people.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need effective policies for mountainous regions that are adapted to each mountain range and based on management that is devised jointly by elected representatives, public services and professionals. These policies must work towards compensating for the excess cost of production, the opening up of regions, the diversification of activities, maintaining public services and developing specialised training and access to new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture, pastoralism and forestry play an essential role in mountain regions. Not only do they generate quality products, but they are also the only means of maintaining sites and keeping them secure.</p>
<p class="contents">In certain mountain ranges, however, pastoralism is being put at risk by the reintroduction of predatory species, and the poor management of their populations.</p>
<p class="contents">Diverse landscapes, high-quality products, ‘green lungs’, rare species: mountain regions are and must remain diverse. We should not make them into sanctuaries, or into deserts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ebner (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mountain regions account for 30% of the surface area of the Community of Fifteen, and 10% of the population lives in mountain regions. Up to now, the European Union has viewed its policy on mountain regions as part of agricultural policy. I believe that this issue needs to be seen as a whole and not just sector by sector. Mountain regions account for over 50% of the total surface area of Member States such as Austria, Italy, Spain and Greece. For this reason it is absolutely essential, in addition to the issue of defining mountain regions, to consider the impact on various aspects of life, and for mountain regions to be seen as an area in which people live and not just as a business area for particular sectors of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the Commissioner has been able to inform us that a positive solution to the problem of creating a definition has now emerged. I think that in the final report to be presented in September 2003 this will provide us with a foundation on which we can build.</p>
<p class="contents">The suggestions that it is too soon to be specific about financial issues may reflect an unavoidable degree of caution, but it is certainly not very satisfactory, Commissioner. I myself come from a mountain region which is in a relatively good position by virtue of its autonomous status. We have had some degree of migration, but only a low percentage in recent years. However, mountain regions in Piedmont, Lombardy or the Veneto, for example, have been totally depopulated and have ultimately become back gardens for affluent areas in the big cities – and I am sure that are many similar examples in other EU Member States. If you consider those, it becomes clear how absolutely necessary it is to give those who have stayed on positive signals that changes are being made and that they will not have to wait for almost another decade. One possible measure would be for short-term changes to be introduced in competition policy. Classifying mountain regions as sensitive zones in the treaties would also give a strong signal with this in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, both Parliament and the Commission have treated policy on mountain regions rather shabbily. Up to now, we have only had three debates on this topic in this House, something that I regret, even though the Commission rounded off the International Year of Mountains by organising the conference you have already mentioned in an effort to form a picture of the situation and invite or listen to everyone involved in that Year. This conference was held in Brussels in October thanks to the efforts of Commissioners Fischler and Barnier. However, it would also certainly be advantageous if you could make a strong case to the Commission for it to take due account of the report on this subject adopted by the European Parliament on 9 September last year and to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, let me briefly mention the Alpine Convention. The Commission has been completely inactive in this area. The picture you painted was not quite accurate. It is not so much the signatory states to the Alpine Convention that have not done their homework, as the Commission, which has signed only three protocols and for cost reasons has even stopped turning up to meetings. I think there is an urgent need for action here.</p>

The very fact that this debate is being held is an achievement and I would say that, this year, in honour of the International Year of Mountains, the European Parliament too has endeavoured to make its contribution. The Commission and I remember that memorable seminar of 17-18 October, we discussed this matter in the context of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy and Agenda 2000 too, and we are discussing it today. It is a shame that, as always, this is an intimate conversation between a few friends, but that has always been the fate of the mountains in the history of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, if you were to do a little research on the Internet and search in our databases for the word ‘mountain’, you would find three references to past resolutions. The first was tabled by a certain Mr Colleselli in 1983, the second tabled by myself in 1998 and the third tabled in 2001 by Mr Ebner, who spoke just now. If you add these names to the few Members present today in this Chamber, you have the mountain people, the champions of the mountains, if I may be so bold as to use that phrase. However, mountains, as we know, cover 30% of the Community’s territory. In countries such as my own, Italy, and in Greece, Portugal and Spain too, over 50% of the land is defined as mountainous. Why, then, has there been so little attention paid to mountains throughout history? Because the inhabitants of the mountain regions are few. Between 5 and 7% of the European citizens live in mountain regions, on average. There are few inhabitants who are therefore unable to form a strong lobby in terms of either numbers or wealth. That is a shame, for this may well be a historic time for the mountains in terms of their future and prospects. First and foremost, they have to convert their diversity from the weakness it has been hitherto into added value in order to start to exploit the genuine potential they offer. Europe is not a depressed region: it is a complex, complete economic and social system. I would say that, strangely, Europe does not need economic assistance so much as credibility and specific legislation which will allow it to launch its initiatives for the future. That, Madam President, is why, if you search for a directive in the database, you will find that the most recent directive dates back to 1975. Twenty-seven, almost thirty years have passed: the mountains have changed dramatically in that time but we are still working with a very outdated directive.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, can we suggest? Some of the Members have already made proposals and I too would like to make some demands. We must cling to the proposals of Article 158, which the Commissioner mentioned just now. This article calls upon the European Union to reduce and avoid development divides between the regions of Europe. Then the same article recognises the specific situation of the Community’s islands. We are not demanding another article or a different legal basis: we are asking for the specific situation of the mountains, at least, to be recognised alongside the specific situation of the islands. It is clear for all to see that the mountains are different from the rest of the territory: they are different environmentally, biologically and in terms of natural history and social conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would mention a suggestion made by Mr Mantovani – who is unable to be here because he was unable to get a flight at an appropriate time – who laments the fact that, in addition to the environmental and economic problems, life is difficult in the mountain regions when it comes to healthcare too. When a hospital closes in a mountain region a serious problem is created. When, in particular, healthcare networks are insufficient, genuine difficulties ensue. That is why the mountains need overall, general measures. All we have to do is give them a hand: they are not asking for aid, they are just asking for a little attention and, as I said just now, for the specific nature of their situation to be recognised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In conversation, journalists, politicians, various religious groups, representatives of human rights organisations and organisations such as Falun Gong all express great anxiety faced with this planned change. The strength of Hong Kong lies in its success in retaining the principle of one country, two systems. I, together with many others, fear that this change will seriously undermine that principle, something which would naturally be completely unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that China is pressing for this change to take place is not reassuring. We know that China often puts pressure on Hong Kong to get it to accept legislation there that exists in China. I am afraid that the way in which Article 23 is being interpreted may lead to the disappearance of fundamental freedoms such as academic freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of organisation and religious freedom. If a group such as Falun Gong, which is banned in China, were also to be banned in Hong Kong, it would be a serious offence against the principle of one country, two systems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only I who am concerned. The major demonstration at the weekend, in which thousands of Hong Kong citizens protested about the change, shows that the Hong Kong authorities have not succeeded in reassuring their own citizens, and they are not therefore reassuring ourselves, either. If the change is only a technical one, as Hong Kong maintains, the point needs to be made extremely clearly. I am afraid that that is not the way it is.

Like Mrs Malmström, we particularly fear for Falun Gong supporters, whose peaceful protest does not justify persecution in any form. Hong Kong must be allowed to remain what it is, in the expectation that China will also go down the road to democracy and human rights. Only on this basis can we maintain the dialogue and the cooperation. When I visited China along with some members of our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I noticed the extent to which the Hong Kong economic model was held up as an example to the big cities on the Chinese mainland. Yet the concept of ‘one country, two systems’ still applies in the areas of human rights, democracy and freedom of speech. In that regard, Hong Kong still to this day remains a unique phenomenon in the Chinese sphere of influence.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people in China told us that developments towards greater democratisation and human rights could be expected in the future. We therefore view with the greatest concern the creation of the law to combat subversive activities in Hong Kong. We fear that this will be at the expense of freedom of speech, the objective administration of justice, religious and artistic freedom, scientific freedom and so on. This would be precisely the opposite of what we have always hoped for, which is that one large area of democracy and human rights will be allowed to come into existence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have very clearly heard what not only people in the religious world but also the business world, the newspapers and journalists in Hong Kong have told us, and we need to take those fears very seriously. There are fears that the opposition is to be silenced, that freedom of speech and freedom of the press, the right to publish and freedom of association are to be curbed, and that the right and the freedom to establish trade unions will no longer be guaranteed. These are genuine fears and we must take them seriously, because we are talking about civil rights that we regard as fundamental values, and we also intend to defend those fundamental values in China.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are calling on the People's Republic of China to respect Hong Kong's autonomy under the ‘one country, two systems’ policy which the previous speakers have already mentioned. That policy must be respected.

It sounds almost too good to be true for Hong Kong. Article 23 of the Basic Law, however, is a potential time bomb under all of this. This article requests the drafting of laws against a whole range of serious crimes against the government of the People’s Republic of China. The Hong Kong authorities have embarked upon the implementation of this highly controversial article at a most inopportune moment, and in a manner that lacks transparency. That is why the residents of Hong Kong came out on the streets en masse at the beginning of this week. Does Hong Kong really give Peking reason to fear treason, secession, unrest, subversive activities, theft of state secrets or dangerous foreign political activities or connections? No! Yet the Chinese authorities are insisting on the implementation of Article 23. Mark you, this is an article that was given its current form only after the bloodbath in Peking's Tienanmen Square . Article 23 therefore reflects Chinese Communist paranoia, both past and present. The same can be said of Hong Kong’s citizens’ fears then and now. While Hong Kong is going through a difficult economic period, Peking is making matters worse with its crippling political uncertainty. Even the business sector in Hong Kong is reacting negatively, and that speaks volumes. It reflects the broad dissatisfaction amongst the populace with a desultory consultation process on the legal implementation of Article 23. What is lacking is the publication of the exact draft laws. The Council and Commission must therefore address the powers that be in Hong Kong and Peking on this matter quickly, as the European Union is serious about maintaining the principle of ‘one country, two systems’ for Hong Kong. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In pursuit of this policy, we have worked constructively with the Hong Kong administration, reflected by the attendance of the former Chief Secretary Anson Chan and her successor, Donald Tsang, at meetings of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. It is therefore appropriate that we should continue to monitor developments which could in any way undermine the autonomy of Hong Kong and threaten fundamental freedoms. Enactment of legislation under Article 23 has raised such concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">While I welcome the personal guarantee given by Chief Secretary Donald Tsang that he will not allow the freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong citizens to be undermined, this must be reflected in the proposed legislation. Last weekend, a large demonstration in Hong Kong illustrated the genuine concerns that Article 23 laws could undermine existing human rights and civil and religious liberties. I share these concerns and I urge the Hong Kong SAR Government to address them in the final proposals that they bring forward. In particular, the new laws must not violate the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, nor must they in any way undermine the independence of the Hong Kong courts and their right to exercise the power of final jurisdiction. The reinterpretation of the Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress during the right-of-abode case is still fresh in many people's minds. There must not be a repeat of this with regard to Article 23 issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Hong Kong authorities to take note of this debate, to take note of this resolution, especially our request for the publication of a draft bill which should be subject to further consultation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first point I would like to make – and this has been alluded to by my friend and colleague, Mr Cushnahan – is that Hong Kong cannot pass law under its constitution if it contravenes the international standards of human rights. My second point is that all countries need security legislation. I would argue that even what is proposed is milder than the recent Homelands Security Act passed in the United States, without much obvious protest from this House.</p>
<p class="contents">We asked the Hong Kong authorities to ensure that the Article 23 proposal would not be used to silence opposition. I shall give a couple of quotes. A few days ago on 27 November, Mr Antony Leung, the Financial Secretary, was in the European Parliament. From the minutes of the meeting he attended – and I quote: 'He gave a very personal reassurance of the government's commitment to upholding the rule of law and the guarantees of human rights and freedoms set out in the Basic Law and enshrined in the Hong Kong legal system'. That was in front of our Members very recently. A few days ago, on 10 December, the former financial secretary, now acting Chief Executive, Donald Tsang, said in a speech in Hong Kong: 'The free flow of information, the freedom to say and do what we want are the very fabric of Hong Kong society'.</p>
<p class="contents">I put it to you that there is concern. I also look forward to having a clear and detailed provision and would like to see a draft bill for us to debate. But let us concentrate on getting good legislation, and not fall victim to those who want to campaign against the PRC by proxy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This law, known as Article 23, is aimed at protecting Hong Kong from foreign and internal threats, but at the same time involves Hong Kong legislation’s being brought into line with China’s. In that way, organisations and movements banned in communist China will also be banned in Hong Kong. In common with Christian churches not approved by the Chinese Government, the Falun Gong movement would acquire the same illegal status in Hong Kong as it has had since 1999 in China.</p>
<p class="contents">The law would increase the authorities’ powers to control and thus to censor <span class="italic">everything</span> printed in newspapers, as well as other media and other published material. Such material as was considered damaging to the region and to China as a whole would therefore be censored, and it would be a punishable offence to possess it.

The Commission is conscious of the enormous significance and political sensitivity of this initiative, especially as regards the development of Hong Kong and China as a whole. As this proposal by the regional government has been framed in very general terms, it will not be possible to judge this draft law properly until it is presented to Hong Kong's Legislative Council. That will probably happen in February 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's approach is based on the assumption that a wide-ranging consultation process will now take place, and that this will subsequently be extended to the detailed legislative provisions as soon as they are presented to the Legislative Council. The Commission believes that it is very important for the views expressed by various groups during this consultation process to be taken fully into account when drafting the future legislative provisions. Furthermore, the proposed legislative provisions and their application should not undermine the preservation of a constitutional system or respect for human rights and basic freedoms in Hong Kong, in accordance with its ‘one country, two systems’ principle. Lastly, in accordance with Hong Kong's Basic Law, the legislation proposed must be compatible with UN agreements on civil and political rights and on economic, social and cultural rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is carefully monitoring developments in this area through its ambassadors. On the basis of their recommendations it intends to transmit a declaration to the Hong Kong regional government at the highest possible level and as soon as possible, and in any case before the end of the consultation process on 24 December; this declaration will emphasise the European Union's commitment to the principles I have just mentioned.</p>

Between 1948 and 1952, the Israeli Government destroyed 420 Palestinian villages, as documented by Israeli historians. Some of the Arab districts of Jaffa were destroyed. In 1967, after the occupation of East Jerusalem, the Moroccan quarter of the Old City was destroyed to make room for a large square in front of the Wailing Wall. Throughout these years of military occupation, permission was never granted for restoration of the historic parts of the various cities.</p>
<p class="contents">After the Oslo agreement and the creation of the Palestinian Authority, a very enthusiastic start was made on restoring the Old Cities of Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron. In the past two years, with the reoccupation of the autonomous territories, the destruction caused by the Israeli tanks and bombings has been huge. Sixty-six palaces built between the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries have been destroyed, including the caravanserai, the Turkish bath and the old soap factories. Today, it is the turn of the Old City<span class="bold"> </span>of Hebron, where the houses are next to the Tomb of the Patriarchs: Mameluk and Ottoman houses and houses from the British Mandate. This is more than just a question of preserving old buildings however: the Old Cities are inhabited by women, men and children, like those in the refugee camps in Jenin and Rafah who have no roof over their heads. Moreover, their numbers have risen to over 15 000 in the past two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The official justification given by the Israeli authorities in the military decree providing for the demolition of the houses in Hebron talks of security and military grounds. Nothing could be further from the truth. Ariel Sharon has clearly said that there is a need to build a link between the settlement of Qiriat Arba and the Tomb of the Patriarchs. This is annexing of territory, for the Qiriat Arba settlements are illegal. It is true that the decision was taken to destroy the Old City, the subject of our resolution today, after an armed attack by a Palestinian group killed nine people, army soldiers and armed guards from the settlements. It is true that, in some cases, the houses destroyed in the West Bank belong to families in which a son, brother or cousin has taken the tragic, horrific decision to kill himself and Israeli civilians, but over 2000 houses have been destroyed in the past two years! This does not give the Israelis a licence to violate international law and the Geneva Convention, which clearly bans collective punishment, the destruction of property and the killing of civilians. Over 2000 houses have been demolished in these past 2 years and 20 000 people have been wounded. I am sad to say that there have been many Israeli deaths too – over 600 now. Israel is an occupying country which is violating the obligation laid down by the fourth Geneva Convention to move its people out of the occupied territories – there are over 400 000 settlers now – and should be ensuring the well-being and providing for the needs of the Palestinian people, whereas 72% of Palestinians are unemployed and confined in the villages.</p>
<p class="contents">The first illegal fact is the military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which has now been in effect since 1967. Israel can no longer be allowed to continue to violate all international legislation, inflicting pain and suffering not just on the Palestinians but on its own people too. We must send out a signal to the Palestinians to give them hope of justice and to enable them to prevent the growth of fundamentalism. We must send out a signal to the Israeli Government so that it knows that it cannot always act outside the law, playing on the threat of anti-Semitism and terrorism. Our only concern is for there not to be two sets of checks and balances: human rights and the right to life are equal for all people.</p>

But that heritage, which for too long has undergone the colonial conflict ravaging Palestine, is in danger of disappearing. Many age-old historical centres have been devastated, destroyed by the Israeli occupying forces. In Hebron, the army is preparing to destroy around one hundred houses bordering the prayer route. It is a real corridor, riddled with watchtowers and only accessible to the settlers, which will be developed to link the settlement to the tomb of the patriarchs, the symbol of the three religions, which Israel wishes to appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Hebron is a blatant example of apartheid. The town is separated in two by a large road used only by Israelis, and some streets are entirely forbidden to Palestinians. This is a symbol of a downward spiral that can only lead to an escalation of violence. During the conflict, Palestinian heritage has become a major political issue. The foundations of cultural sites are giving way under the attacks from Israeli tanks and helicopters, which are also battering public and professional buildings, schools, houses and refugee camps, causing thousands of civilian casualties. Is that not true terrorism, military terrorism, state terrorism? Israel is thus clearly showing that a Palestinian identity has no place in its plans to extend the settlements. This idea of eradicating the history and memory of the Palestinian people is a result of the Israeli State’s quest for legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to commend the courage of civilian and international missions, which with no power to intervene but the right to report and observe, are playing a moderating and protective role. Through their action on the ground, they are carrying out citizen’s diplomacy where our international diplomacy is unable to intervene. We must urgently condemn what are genuine crimes against humanity’s shared cultural heritage, demand that the Hague conventions and Geneva conventions on the protection of goods and persons be respected and ask the Commission to call on the UN Security Council to send an intervention force to protect the Palestinian people, their cultural and historical heritage and their environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember that fair and sustainable peace for these two populations can only be based on respect for international law, the withdrawal of settlements and occupation forces and the creation of a Palestinian State within the 1967 borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Things really have come to a pretty pass, all as the result of indifference or negligence or fanaticism. A few part-sessions ago we were passing resolutions to protect infrastructures in Palestine, because they were infrastructures built with European Union money. Now we are passing resolutions to protect the cultural heritage because nowhere on earth does the cultural heritage belong to the Sharons or Arafats of this world; it belongs to history and to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, we now need to realise that the resolution system is too limited to bring in results. In Copenhagen a few days ago, the European Union showed that it can act decisively and intervene when it has to. This being so, it makes no sense to stand and watch the machinations going on in the Middle East, the clashes, the destruction, the loss of human life on all sides. We now need to apply a different policy, a different sort of decisiveness, in order to stop this endless, stalemate of a crisis. Settlement policies, terrorist policies – not that terrorism qualifies as a policy – offer no prospects or framework for a solution of any kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, when a few months or rather a couple of years ago, we watched the destruction of the Buddha statues by the Taliban on our televisions, we said, who do they think they are, destroying the history of mankind? Today the same is happening on our very doorstep. And we just stand and watch. It is not our job in these circumstances to stand and watch. It is not our job to complain. Our job is to intervene. An end to settlements! They get us nowhere. An end to destruction! It gets us nowhere. And an end to terrorist action! It gets us nowhere. We need to keep to the policy decided years ago by Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin, God rest his soul. Therein lies the way forward, therein lies the solution. No other policy makes sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said which, a European Union of the twenty-five which wants to play a political role and intervene in international affairs needs to change its tactics on this issue. It is no good being in the audience. It needs to play the lead role and now it has the chance to play the role which it should have been playing for years.</p>

It may seem derisory or even distressing at first sight for Parliament to issue another resolution on this subject, this time to protect stones, however loaded with history they may be, while human lives continue to be sacrificed every day in the infernal spiral of violence and fear, blood and vengeance that has been unleashed in this land that is so dear to so many of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the PPE-DE Group is nevertheless taking part in this debate today, it does so aware and with the conviction that the action announced by the Israeli authorities to safeguard access to the Kiriat Arba settlement can only have disastrous consequences for the development of the continuing conflict, without genuinely guaranteeing the security of its, the settlement’s, inhabitants. My experience of the previous conflicts that I was involved in, both in Algeria, nearly fifty years ago, and more recently in the Balkans, taught me that no wall, even it is surrounded by mines and watched over by the most sophisticated methods, is insurmountable. However, like our colleague Mr Souladakis, even more recently, I have not forgotten the horrified reaction from the public worldwide following the destruction of the Bamyan Buddhas, which triggered the unanimous condemnation of the Taliban regime.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, while not wishing to be the judge, and even less the prosecutor, of a situation in which the European Union, as Mr Souladakis rightly said, has not yet succeeded in establishing a role, we can only draw the attention of the Israeli authorities to the significance of the consequences of any decision leading to the destruction, or even partial destruction, of the ancient city of Hebron. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The power of oppression originating from it is not only destroying houses and stone; it is destroying people and their existence. It is killing them. The State of Israel is oppressing the Palestinian people, with the clearly displayed or hypocritical collusion of all the major powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should the extreme right-wing powers in Israel be worried by the friendly admonishments from the major powers every now and again when the Israeli army goes beyond certain limits? Mr Sharon is aware that what he is doing in Israel is simply a copy of what the United States’ leaders did in Afghanistan and are preparing to do in Iraq. Why should Mr Sharon be bothered by the empty protestations from countries who pretend to distance themselves somewhat from his policies, such as France, when that very country is in the process of engaging in a dirty war itself?</p>
<p class="contents">The French army is not protecting the population against ethnic and xenophobic killings; it is protecting the clique in power that is carrying them out. The rebels are undoubtedly no better, but it is not for the French army to act as arbiter or policeman. By protecting the government in power, it is mainly protecting the French corporations that have major interests there.</p>
<p class="contents">So yes, the Israeli army should withdraw from Palestine and the French army should leave Côte d'Ivoire and Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This time, the world’s protests should be as vociferous as they were following the barbaric destruction of the Buddha statues in Afghanistan. We are concerned here with an irreplaceable heritage of buildings of religious and cultural value, from the Mameluk period in the fifteenth century to the Ottoman period in the nineteenth century – cultural treasures that belong not merely to the Palestinians but to the whole world. The destruction of these cultural treasures has nothing to do with security and self-defence. It is pure vengeance, and vengeance that will increase the spiral of violence in which, far removed from the public eye, Israeli soldiers and settlers kill Palestinian civilians with tanks and rifles, while young Palestinians, in the full media spotlight, blow themselves up. More than three hundred homes face destruction. The historic town of Hebron, with its unique architecture and religious importance, will never be the same again.

Not only are these buildings of cultural and historical significance, but the planned action will also add further to the suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has condemned the attack by Palestinian militants on 15 November in which 12 Israeli soldiers were killed. The Commission cannot, however, see how the measures planned would increase security in Hebron; if anything, these measures will serve to exacerbate the situation, which is already extremely tense. The Commission considers that the destruction of historic Palestinian dwellings is in breach of the Hebron Protocol agreed by Israel and the Palestinian Autonomy Authority in 1997. That protocol commits both parties to preserving and protecting the historic character of the town, so that no part of its heritage is damaged or changed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also wishes to draw Parliament's attention to the recent conclusions of the European Council held in Copenhagen, when the Council expressed its alarm at the expansion of settlements and related construction work.

This will certainly not be the last time, either. There is a very great deal of solidarity with the Tibetan people here in the European Parliament. The Tibetan people have for many years been exposed to appalling treatment by Beijing, and this is continuing. Perhaps there is, however, a very small light at the end of the tunnel inasmuch as a cautious dialogue has been instituted between Beijing and representatives of the Dalaï Lama. The fact that two people like Ngawang Sangdrol and Jigme Sangpo – two very well-known prisoners of conscience to whom attention has been drawn on several occasions in this Chamber – have now been released from their long-term imprisonment is also very positive. There are, however, many more prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that this development indicates any fundamental policy change on the part of China. I only wish that it did. I do not, however, believe that that is the case. It is, at any rate, a step on the way. It is all the more worrying, therefore, that the two Buddhist Tibetans, Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup have now been sentenced to death. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time and have now been branded as terrorists. They have not been given anything in the way of a fair trial; no evidence has been presented; they have been kept in total isolation for eight months; and now they are to be executed. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party demands a fair legal process in accordance with the rule of law and treatment in accordance with international conventions. As always, we condemn the death penalty wherever it is practised. China’s contribution to the international fight against terrorism appears so far, unfortunately, to have been confined to Beijing’s branding opposition dissidents and various minorities as terrorists and in that way obtaining an excuse for oppressing them. That is not how matters should proceed. The fight against terrorism must always be combined with the rule of law. We shall continue to fight for the rights of Tibet, continue to condemn all human rights violations in China and hope that the Commission will step up the human rights dialogue with China. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also a so-called autonomous region in China, however meaningless this autonomy is in practice. Every attempt to achieve real autonomy is, after all, regarded as a crime, giving rise to legal proceedings, and the concept of political offences is unknown in China. Political opponents are simply treated as common criminals. The struggle against terrorism provides yet another excuse for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The death sentences against Tenzin Delek, an influential Buddhist lama, and his assistant, Lobsang Dhondup, pronounced on 3 December, are a sad illustration of this. We regard the accusations as unproven, but the way in which the two people were held in solitary confinement and ultimately sentenced to death after months of incarceration and after a mockery of a trial, confounds us. These death sentences must not be allowed to be carried out; the verdicts must be reviewed on the basis of a fair trial. The dialogue between China and the representatives of the Dalai Lama, who inspires so much hope in this hemisphere, must be resumed, but we must not be naïve in our relationships with this big country. They pay a great deal of attention to what we think of them, but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by diversionary tactics. We must see what is actually happening and bring about change judicially and in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had gained the impression that a real opening up, a genuine dialogue on human rights was actually going to take place. So I too very much welcomed the release of both Ngawang Sangdrol and Jigme Sangpo. We regarded that as a sign that pledges were being honoured and promises were being kept.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much welcomed the fact that Li Peng honoured his commitment finally to enter into contact with the Dalai Lama and that initial discussions were actually being held with representatives of the Dalai Lama. We regarded these as two very positive signs.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are all the more dismayed now that at exactly the same time two people, Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup – a lama and one of his followers – were arrested and kept in solitary confinement for six or even eight months, although to this day it has not been established beyond doubt that they really committed the act of which they were accused. This is totally contrary to the constitutionality that we naturally expect and demand from a people or from a government.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand very well that the fight against terrorism is important, but that means combating genuine terrorism, not dissidents. The fight against terrorism must of course also respect constitutional criteria, otherwise it cannot be justified.</p>
<p class="contents">I only hope that this was a blunder that will be very quickly rectified by the Chinese Government, and that these two people will be released or will at least receive a fair trial. I also hope that China will make sure that the door to human rights, which has been very slightly opened, will not be slammed shut again but will be opened further, so that genuine constitutionality may also prevail in China.</p>

In September an official delegation from the Dalai Lama visited China's leaders. In October, the nun Ngawang Sangdrol was released after decades of imprisonment, following massive international protests, including those from the European Parliament itself. A considerable number of Members of this House had repeatedly nominated her for the Sakharov Prize.</p>
<p class="contents">Did these welcome steps on the part of the Chinese amount merely to political manoeuvring in the run-up to their President's visit to the USA? Will the path to constructive dialogue now peter out again in the aftermath of the Communist party conference and the far-reaching changes in personnel brought about by it? Are the hardliners getting the upper hand?</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard some alarming reports recently. At the beginning of December, as other Members have mentioned, two Tibetans were sentenced to death by the Kardze People's Court after a trial so rushed that doubt must be cast on its legality. They were accused of owning illegal weapons, of separatism and of taking part in an attack using explosives carried out in Chengdu in April.</p>
<p class="contents">One of those involved is the Tibetan Tulku Tenzin Delek, who has a death sentence hanging over him with a two-year reprieve. He has been committed to preserving Tibetan culture, language and religion for decades. He founded new monasteries and championed the social well-being of the public. His colleague Lobsang Dhondup also faces a death penalty, without reprieve.</p>
<p class="contents">It is evident that neither of the two defendants received a fair trial. International standards were breached. For example, Tenzin Delek spent eight months in solitary confinement without any contact with his family or with lawyers, which is clearly in violation of the UN's minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners. The authorities demanded the payment of bail equivalent to EUR 120 000 before a proper trial could be initiated. His students were arrested when they tried to raise the money.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a flagrant violation of international human rights. It is imperative for the Chinese authorities to maintain legal standards. However necessary the war on terrorism may be, and however much we may all support it, it cannot be waged without respect for the law and for human rights. It is totally unacceptable for the peaceful struggle to practice Tibetan religion and culture to be treated as an act of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, I call on the Commission immediately to raise these unfair verdicts under the dialogue on human rights with the Chinese. We must prevent unlawful sentences from being executed and the grant of financial aid must be made dependent on improvements in the area of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to stir your Member States' embassies in Beijing into action without delay, so that these defendants can be given a fair trial. The first step must be to lift the death sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as Chairman of Parliament's Tibet Intergroup, I would like to express my hope that the forces of reason will prevail in China and that our worldwide campaign for human rights and the rule of law will succeed.</p>

However, that also demonstrates that we have a responsibility to wage that war. The United States also bears that responsibility within the international institutions, the United Nations and under international law.</p>
<p class="contents">If you only fight terrorism – and that is unfortunately a danger that also exists in Washington – strictly by means of a coalition of the major powers, there is a risk that those powers will misuse that war on terror for their own ends: Moscow will use it against the Chechens and Beijing will use it against Tibet. We need to be fully aware that the sort of repression that has been practised in Tibet or in Chechnya is no way to fight terrorism, it will simply engender it.</p>
<p class="contents">We were talking earlier on about mountain regions. A few decades back there were even bomb attacks here in the Community, in the South Tyrol, which is nowadays a peaceful model region of Europe of which we can be proud. There were even extremist movements in our European democracies. That sounds unlikely today, because by granting autonomy we have ensured that no one takes separatist or terrorist action. We now feel comfortable in the greater community of Europeans and regard ourselves as being at the heart of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">My message to the Chinese is therefore this: ‘Give the Tibetans autonomy, give them democracy, and give them human rights!’ That is the way to fight terrorism and separatism. That is a successful approach that will not lead to terrorism but will genuinely bring peace and ensure that peace will prevail in the world's most important and most historically precious mountain region, peace that can be a model for the entire world.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution before us has much to recommend it, but the wording is rather infelicitous, by which I mean the phrase ‘the Tibetan minority in China’. Of course, in comparison with China's massive population, we are all minorities. However, what we are talking about here is the great Tibetan people with its ancient world culture, which is a valuable heritage for mankind. We appeal to the Chinese to respect this people and its culture as full partners, just as we treat the Tibetans and Chinese as equals.</p>

Also, Mrs Maes, the problem raised today by these two death sentences reveals changes in the borders made by the Chinese. The Tibet of the autonomous region is one third of Tibet. There is also the province of Sichuan, a large proportion of which is part of the historic Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who spoke before me discussed this. Three months ago, there was a sign of hope for some on the return of Kelsang Gyaltsen and Lodi Gyari, the Dalai Lama’s envoys who went on an official visit to Peking for the first time in a long while. Meanwhile, a small change has taken place in the People’s Republic of China. Hu Jintao has become the new President, the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party. The result of the so-called dialogue that was undertaken is these two death sentences: those of Tenzin Delek and Lobsang Dhondup.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, Mrs Gebhardt, there could be better signs emerging from this dialogue. Having said that, I think that above all we should question ourselves, as members of the European Parliament and as Europeans, on how we are supporting the Tibetan people. I think that we should seriously ask that question. There is a risk of exoticism, and a risk that the peaceful struggle of our Tibetan friends will not be capable of achieving the objective of freeing Tibet. This is an objective for the Tibetans, but also for all free men and women across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly three years ago now, in June 2000, Parliament adopted a resolution inviting the governments of the Member States to recognise the exiled government of Tibet, the Dalai Lama’s government. I believe that is how we can genuinely give power to our Tibetan friends and show our Chinese friends that the rule of law is based on solid foundations of dialogue, and not just on semblances of dialogue, on the crumbs of dialogue that they throw to the Tibetans and to us, the Europeans, to make us believe, as they have been doing for 40 years, that they want dialogue while each time they reject real dialogue and any political solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The President of the exiled Tibetan Parliament, Professor Samdhong Rinpoche, has asked for restraint until June. I will restrain myself until June, but I think that from then on we should reconsider our entire approach to supporting the battle to free Tibet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are deeply concerned about the death sentence passed on Lobsang Dhondup and Tenzin Delek on 2 December. You may recall that Mr Delek was on the list of individual cases that we handed to the Chinese authorities under the human rights dialogue between the EU and China. The Commission is also concerned because these death sentences are the first to be passed against Tibetans because of alleged political crimes for some years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to take this opportunity to inform Parliament that the EU troika raised this matter through diplomatic channels with the Chinese authorities on 13 December, at embassy level. The EU requested information on both these cases and in particular on what evidence had been presented, and called for the trials to be reopened in accordance with international standards for fair trials. Furthermore, the troika reaffirmed that the EU rejects the death penalty and its use in China in general, referring to the ongoing campaign of ‘drastic action’. By virtue of this prompt intervention on the part of the European Union and because of pressure from the United States and Australia, the executions have so far not been carried out, and the two convicted men have entered appeals. The executions can therefore not be carried out until the People's Court has re-examined the case. Although we believe that the immediate danger of execution has been averted for the time being, the Commission will continue to follow this case very closely, particularly as regards the provision of solid evidence and guarantees of a fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is also continuing to put pressure on China to guarantee the cultural, linguistic and religious identity of the Tibetan people. It has repeatedly called for the initiation of a direct dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama, as this is likely to be the only way to secure a peaceful and lasting solution to the Tibetan question.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the Commission is encouraged by the positive news conveyed by the two envoys of the Dalai Lama who visited China in September 2002. We hope that this will be a first step towards the establishment of a more regular dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama. The Commission intends to continue to take only such cooperative measures in Tibet as will directly benefit the Tibetan population.</p>

<p class="contents">We believe that equality proceeds from the equal value of every person and from every individual’s right to respect for their person and their choices when it comes to personal, family and professional life. It is a matter of justice that no one should be discriminated against because of their gender or for other reasons. Any form of oppression, discrimination or stereotyping must be combated, and the opportunity of everyone to make free choices promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not therefore believe that the proposal in the report indicates the right road to go down. We oppose those parts of the report that recommend the adoption of quotas and what is termed positive discrimination. It is not the task of politicians to determine how private employers take their recruitment decisions in the light of these considerations. Mathematical redistribution does not mean justice and does not lead to genuine equality.</p>
<p class="contents">Selection procedures for recruitment and admission to higher education should, however, ensure gender neutrality as far as possible. Moreover, we see the continued work on equality as being, in the first place, about changing attitudes in the long term, and we would emphasise the importance of schools in shifting attitudes in this direction.</p>

<p>(DA) The latest EU-Russia Summit, held on 11 November in Brussels, has been widely judged to have been a great success. Despite a difficult political context, it yielded vital agreement between leaders on both sides on how to deal with Kaliningrad. This was an important result on the way to EU enlargement. Apart from the agreement on Kaliningrad, we were able to reach agreement on Joint Statements concerning the Middle East and the fight against terrorism. We also noted good progress made on the Common European Economic Space, and on the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue. Such results would not have been possible if the Summit had not taken place.</p>
<p>Member States were kept informed at all stages in the preparations of the Summit. Proof that this was done completely and effectively comes from the fact that, since the Summit, the Presidency has received warm praise for its transparent handling of the preparations. On the particular question of moving the Summit from Copenhagen to Brussels, the Presidency at all times expressed the positions of the Council and of the Union. The Presidency received the full support of Member States.</p>
<p>The Presidency absolutely agrees that it is important for the Council to speak with one voice. It was this clarity that allowed the Summit to go ahead in a successful manner. The Council has been united and Russia has taken good note of the EU’s position. Mr Rasmussen, on behalf of the Council, made clear after the Summit that Chechnya was an important subject of discussion between the two sides. The EU was able to use the occasion to put its view that a political settlement is an essential condition to achieving a lasting peace in the region. In Copenhagen, the European Council (12/13 December 2002) recalled that the enlargement will strengthen relations with Russia</p>
<p>As the honourable Member will know, there have been a number of developments since this question was submitted. First, a Danish court refused a request for him to be extradited and ordered him freed. Then Mr Zakayev flew to the UK, where he was detained on arrival. He has since been remanded on conditional bail, and is due to return to Court on 9 January 2003.</p>
<p>Given that the case of Mr Zakajev is currently still a matter for the judiciary, it is not appropriate for anyone else to make any comment at this stage.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0758"></a>

<p>(DA) As the Honourable Parliamentarian is aware, the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 laid down the political criteria for accession which stipulate that candidate countries must have achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities. All candidate countries with which accession negotiations have been opened fulfil the political criteria. This has been of course strongly confirmed by the decision of the last European Council in Copenhagen, to conclude negotiation with Latvia, among others.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Union has closely followed the question of national minorities in Latvia in the past and will continue to monitor it until the accession process is fully completed. This issue has been included amongst the priorities of the revised Accession Partnership for Latvia, adopted in January 2002, and has regularly been discussed with the Latvian side in the framework of the Europe Agreement bodies, in particular the Association Council which held its latest meeting in February this year.</p>
<p>The 2002 Regular Report from the Commission on Latvia's progress towards accession , issued in October, concluded that Latvia continued to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria. More specifically, this report stated that: 'Latvia has encouraged the further integration of non-citizens into Latvian society by removing language requirements in the election law, and increasing support to facilitate the naturalisation process, and through the activities of the Society Integration Foundation.'. The Report also underlined that 'the integration process needs to be accelerated and sufficient funding made available to encourage naturalisation and language training in particular'.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it can be said that Latvia has taken a number of concrete measures as concerns integration of non-citizens into society, and that these positive developments should be acknowledged, as also confirmed by the decision taken by the OSCE in last December not to extend the mandate of its mission. At the same time, the Union will continue to monitor the situation, particularly with regard to the implementation of the adopted measures, and to encourage Latvia to build on the progress already made. The European Council, in Copenhagen, 12-13 December 2002, underlined that monitoring up to accession of the commitments undertaken will give further guidance to the acceeding States in their efforts to assume responsibilities of membership and will give the necessary assurance to current Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0762"></a>

<p>(DA) The Council is not aware of any meeting between the European Union and Iran scheduled to take place on 16 and 17 November 2002. The Council can confirm, however, that a working group on energy, consisting of competent representatives of the European Commission, and of the Iranian Government, met in Teheran on 19 October 2002.</p>
<p>This meeting was not a 'launch of negotiations' but one of several activities in the framework of the EU-Iran Comprehensive Dialogue; it was in fact the third such meeting of this group to take place since 1998 Pending negotiation of a new contractual relationship between the EU and Iran, the Comprehensive Dialogue serves as a forum for raising issues of concern, such as human rights, but also for exploring promising areas of cooperation between the EU and Iran, such as energy. Any such co-operation must been seen in the overall global political context within which all relations with Iran now have to be considered.</p>
<p>There is thus no link between the meeting of the working group on energy on 19 October and the Council's conclusions of 21 October. The Council would moreover like to point out that no decision was taken on 21 October on whether or not to table a resolution on Iran at the 59<span class="sup">th</span> session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, due to commence in March 2003.</p>

<p>As amendments were made to the proposal for a directive during proceedings in the Council, and since Parliament had not yet delivered its opinion, the Council decided that it would brief Parliament in a letter of 22 September 2002 on the progress of the proceedings so that it could deliver its opinion in the light of the amendments that the Council's bodies had made to the proposal.</p>

The Council must, therefore, point out that Parliament has delivered its opinion in full knowledge of the progress of proceedings in the Council, as evidenced by the revised version.

<p>(DA) The future of the Kurds in Iraq is of course inevitably linked to the future of Iraq. The Council’s view, and indeed the view of the international community as a whole, is that Iraq must fully honour its obligations under the United Nations Security Council Resolutions. The UN weapons inspectors are now back in Iraq after nearly 4 years, working under a strengthened inspection regime, decided unanimously by the Security Council in Resolution 1441. This Resolution clearly points out the obligations which Saddam Hussein must fulfil in order to avoid serious consequences for Iraq and it sets the conditions for a peaceful solution of the crisis. The purpose is to have disarmed, peaceful Iraq.</p>
<p>The Council has not discussed the future of the Kurdish population in Northern Iraq and their local administration. The Council's main concern is to ensure that the prospect of weapons of mass destruction in Iraqi hands is stopped, and that those weapons are eliminated.</p>
<p>The European Council in Copenhagen (12-13 December 2002) confirmed that this goal remained a priority. It underlined its full and unequivocal support for the Security Council Resolution 1441 of 8 November 2002 and considered it was now up to Iraq to seize this final opportunity to comply with its international obligations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0784"></a>

<p>(DA) The Presidency of the Council has today given a declaration to the European Parliament regarding actions taken to reduce the effects of the Prestige disaster.</p>
<p>At its meeting of 7, 8 and 9 December 2000 in Nice, the European Council instructed the Member States to implement ahead of schedule the provisions agreed on by the 15 Member States with a view to improving the European signalling and information system for maritime traffic, to set up a European Maritime Safety Agency and to remedy the shortcomings of the existing international system of liability and compensation and to do as long as these do not require an international framework.</p>
<p>The European Parliament and Council regulation on setting up a European Maritime Safety Agency entered into force on 25 August 2002, although it contains no provision for deciding on a permanent location for its headquarters.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this situation does not affect the obligation, laid down in the regulation, to adopt the necessary measures for the Agency to be operational within the twelve months following its entry into force. It is also planned that the Agency will provisionally undertake its work in buildings belonging to the European Commission in Brussels.</p>
<p>The European Council which, at its meeting in Gothenburg (15/16 June 2001), gave a commitment to pursue its efforts to reach a decision on the location of several future bodies, it being understood that the decision taken in Edinburgh in 1992 still applies, has since welcomed the creation of this Agency.</p>
<p>The inaugural meeting of the Agency’s governing board took place on 4 December 2002. On that occasion, the Agency’s action plan was decided on. The appointment of the Agency’s executive director is expected to take place in January 2003. On the occasion of its meeting on 6 December 2002, the Council noted with satisfaction those developments and expected the rapid adoption of a working programme which will enable the Agency to be operational as soon as possible and to establish the principles that can serve as a basis for actions to be taken at Community level and in a wider international context. This should include the promotion of uniformity and quality of port controls inspection in all ports of the Members States, as well as, for the Commission, the establishment and the monitoring of the procedures for the authorisation and the control of classification societies.</p>
<p>The Council has taken notice of the Parliament's intention as regards the Budget 2003 to put 50 % of the financial resources for the European Maritime Safety Agency in reserve awaiting final decision on permanent location. If this position of the European Parliament is maintained, it will make it more difficult for those involved to make the agency fully operational as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes the Commission's decision, as mentioned in its communication to the Council and the European Parliament on improving safety at sea in response to the Prestige accident (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2002&amp;nu_doc=0681">COM(2002) 681</a> final), to provisionally house the Agency on its own premises. The Council also welcomes the information given by the Commission in this communication that the Commission has done everything to make the Agency operational six months ahead of schedule.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0820"></a>

No measures have at the moment been submitted to the Council under Title VI of the EU Treaty concerning further strengthening of protection under criminal law against counterfeiting and piracy. New instruments such as the Convention of 29 May 2000 on mutual assistance in criminal matters and the recent establishment of Eurojust could nevertheless make a contribution to an effective response to this serious form of offence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Whilst the Commission is satisfied in principle with the implementation that Greece has undertaken of the Directive regarding the Internal Market for Electricity (96/92), it is fully aware that the Greek electricity market, as is the case in certain other Community markets, is as yet by no means characterised as a fully competitive market; and this despite the two additional years of derogation applicable for Greece up to February 2001. As yet few new competitors have established themselves in Greece.</p>
<p>The main way that Greece attempted to improve the level of competition in the electricity market was through issuing seven licences to seven consortia of independent private companies (IPP’s) for the construction of seven new generation plants with a total capacity of more that 2000 Megawatt (MW). This new capacity would offer enough room for competition, and also solve the problem of security of electricity supply of Greece (as an additional capacity of 500 to 600 MW for 2005 is estimated to be required).</p>
<p>However, none of the seven IPP’s has advanced substantially up to now with the construction of new plants mainly for various reasons of financing.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Authority for energy (RAE) prepared a full revision of Law 2773/1999 in early September 2002 and submitted it to the Ministry of Development for approval. It is expected that the Ministry of Development will issue soon its final proposal for the revision of the Law based on the text of RAE, maybe with some modifications and additions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the political agreement of the Energy Council on the new Electricity internal market Directive, due to enter into force in 2004, will also lead to an intensification of competition over the coming years.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission is following with interest the above process and expects the final revision of the Law in order to examine its compliance to the Electricity Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The reform aims to make EURES a more efficient instrument to support mobility on the European labour market and to ensure that EURES remains manageable after Union enlargement. To achieve this:</p>
<p>EURES must be fully integrated into the activities of the public employment services. This is the way to fully implement Council Regulation 1612/1968 of 15 October 1968 on the free movement of workers<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which requires that the specialist service of each Member State (generally their Public Employment Services) shall send to the specialist service of the other Member States and to the European Co-ordination office details of job vacancies and applicants according to a uniform system. The reform reiterates that information on all vacancies has to be made available and that EURES cannot be regarded as a marginal activity.</p>
<p>The management system must be updated. The Commission needs to concentrate on strategy, overall co-ordination and evaluation, while more operational tasks should be left to the Member States.</p>
<p>Under the Regulation the public employment services must also make concrete commitments to developing cross-border activities.</p>
<p>In the new system, cross-border activities will become part of the activity plans that the Member States' public employment services will present to the Commission. The Commission will grant financial assistance for the execution of these activity plans subject to the decisions of the budgetary authority and the rules governing the relevant budgetary resources.</p>
<p>The role of the social partners will be crucial to the reform. At European Level, the European social partner organisations will be invited to participate in the EURES High Level Strategy Group established by the new decision and in the EURES Working Party in charge of the development, implementation and monitoring of EURES activities. At national and regional level they can be partners in the cross-border partnerships.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is not considering a proposal to impose tough sanctions on new Member States if they fail to fully implement Union rules and honour all the commitments of membership.</p>
<p>In its Strategy Paper ‘Towards enlargement’ adopted on 9 October 2002, the Commission has proposed to include into the Accession Treaty certain safeguard clauses in addition to the clauses allowing exceptions from the rules of the internal market in the Treaty establishing the European Community and safeguard clauses in secondary legislation.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal to include into the Accession Treaty, besides a general economic safeguard clause similar to the one included into the previous enlargement treaty, one specific safeguard clause concerning the internal market and one specific clause relating to the area of justice and home affairs, have been endorsed by the Brussels European Council (24-25 October 2002). It is clear that safeguard measures which might be taken must be proportional in scope and duration vis-à-vis the nature of the problem which might occur. These safeguard clauses will allow for a more flexible reaction to possible problems associated with the initial period of membership.</p>
<p>Work on the exact wording of the clauses is still ongoing. The general economic safeguard clause may be invoked against both old and new Member States in case of serious difficulties in an economic sector or the economic situation of a given area. Concerning the two specific safeguard clauses, these may only be invoked where a new Member State does not meet the commitments it has made during accession negotiations and where this results in a serious breach of the functioning of the internal market, or where there are serious shortcomings in the implementation of the criminal law under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union as well as civil law under Title IV of the Treaty on the European Union. The two specific safeguard clauses will be applicable up to three years after accession and will serve to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and mutual recognition in the civil and criminal law area. They will compliment the Commission’s usual instruments which ensure compliance with Union law. Beyond that period, the Commission will apply the usual measures of ensuring the proper implementation of the acquis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0723"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission very much regrets the events the honourable Member refers to in his question. Unfortunately, these tragedies are taking place more and more frequently.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced of the need to develop policies on preventing and combating illegal immigration in order to prevent any repetition of these events in the future. In order to be effective, these policies must be developed in partnership with third countries of origin and of transit.</p>
<p>Several measures have already been adopted at European level. On 28 February 2002, the Council adopted a global plan for combating illegal immigration and human trafficking in the Union, and on 13 June 2002 a global plan for the integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the Union. These two plans follow up Commission Communications in these fields.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several meetings of experts in the field of illegal immigration by sea have taken place on the initiative of the Commission. Their aim has been to identify operational measures for preventing and combating illegal immigration in the Mediterranean region. The implementation of the measures contained in these plans will be of great assistance in preventing any repetition of these tragedies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission is aware that all these measures will not be able to resolve, by themselves, such a complex problem. As was pointed out by the Seville European Council, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere Council, an integrated approach aimed at tackling the underlying causes of illegal immigration must continue to be the Union’s long-term objective.</p>
<p>Within this context, the Commission will attempt to ensure that cooperation with third countries in the field of migration is integrated in a balanced and coherent way into the Community’s relations with these third countries, taking account both of the needs of the partner countries and the interests of the Community, which will allow us to combat illegal immigration and to directly tackle the causes underlying migratory movements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0733"></a>

<p>The Commission recalls that the June 2001 Council Report on Nuclear Safety in the Context of Enlargement, as the key document defining the Union’s approach towards candidate countries on nuclear safety issues, recommends that the Czech Republic should 'ensure the safety case demonstrating appropriate protection against high energy pipe breaks'.</p>

Whilst the Commission provided its good offices to mediate this process in 2001, it is not the guardian of its implementation.

Therein, the Czech authorities summarised the results of the investigation conducted over the last year to assess the actual technical options available to accomplish the task of ensuring the safety case.

<p>(EN) Gender mainstreaming in the rural development policy is part of the general Commission framework for gender mainstreaming of Community policies. It contributes to the implementation of important aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy, including rural development, and of Community initiatives, such as Leader+, which are seeking to boost activities in favour of women. These programmes, which are set for the period 2000-2006, will pursue the purpose of promoting gender equality in the measures co-financed by the Union (as stated in Article 2 of the Council Regulation N° 1257/99).</p>
<p>It is necessary to recognise the growing role of women in rural areas and to strengthen their position in the economy and in society through concrete measures and actions. The rural development policy offers ample opportunities for Member States to include such measures in their programmes and to support new activities in rural areas so that more rural women can be involved.</p>
<p>For this reason, the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the Parliament will be taken into account in future decisions. As an example, in the context of the information policy the Commission will continue to support women’s organisations and associations in rural areas, will encourage capacity building and help creating a space for women where they can express their needs and develop their projects, as in many cases, it is one of the major difficulties for women to make their voices heard and to influence policy in a way that better corresponds to their specific approach.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0740"></a>

<p>Earlier this year, the new French government made clear that it did not consider that it needed to meet the stability pact convergence criteria by 2004 and that it would do so by 2006, adding, moreover, that this target was based on projected economic growth in the country of 2%. At the present time, it is 1.5%.</p>
<p>Does the Commission as a whole support its President's description of the stability pact as 'idiotic' and is this to be regarded as the Commission's official line? Is the French government's unilateral action in line with the 'more intelligent tool and greater flexibility' that the Commission President wishes to see for the euro in the future?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1.	As a minimum requirement, the Pact is an essential instrument for the coordination of financial policies and is adhered to in its entirety.</p>

<p>(EN) In terms of overall humanitarian situation, there has been some improvement, albeit slow in the Chiapias region.</p>
<p>This is due on one hand to the 'calming down' of the conflict which has claimed less displacement and suffering over the last months.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the significant international assistance over the last years has helped improving the living conditions of the Indians.</p>
<p>The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) as well as the partners in the field (National Societies of the Red Cross in Germany and Spain) share this assessment.</p>
<p>The European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) which has been present in the Chiapas since 1994, is one of the leading donors. It has played a key role in supporting the relief efforts of humanitarian organisations.</p>
<p>ECHO currently finances the IFRC, the German Red Cross and the Spanish Red Cross. In this regard, the affirmation that the non governmental organisation (NGO) Médecins du Monde is financed by ECHO is incorrect. This NGO is financed via the co-financing budget line of the Union -B7-6000 (managed by EuropeAid Office) for a specific project (ONG-PVD/1999/850) that commenced in 1999 and should finish in the first half of 2003 according to the terms of the proposal submitted by the NGO itself. The Selection Committee for the recent Call for Proposals for this budget line has proposed the financing of a new contract in favour of this same NGO and for the same region from the 2002 budget with a starting date in 2003.</p>
<p>ECHO does not intend to disengage from Chiapas this year. However, the situation which affects the people of the Chiapas region is now falling more into the grey zone between humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation and development. Faced with an improved situation, the IFRC and the partners in the region foresee a progressive reduction in humanitarian activities to be replaced by co-operation instruments.</p>
<p>In order to consolidate the impact of the humanitarian aid provided to date, ECHO intends to finance a final programme for 2003 in favour of displaced people in the state of Chiapas. This new programme aims to strengthen the productive potential and the skills of displaced people so as to reduce their dependence on humanitarian aid. Actions will be aimed at encouraging peaceful coexistence between the returning populations and those who stayed and at developing post-emergency rehabilitation activities. This will help ensure a smooth transition towards development aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0742"></a>

<p>(EN) It is widely accepted that social protection policies, including pension policies, should remain the responsibility of the Member States. The Commission has no intention of changing this.</p>
<p>However, all Member States are facing similar challenges concerning the future development of their social protection policies. This is particularly the case in relation to the impact of an ageing population on the national pension systems. Indeed, the provision of safe and sustainable pensions in the context of demographic ageing will soon be seen as one of the greatest challenges facing our social policies. Member States will have to ensure the social adequacy of pensions systems, whilst guaranteeing their financial sustainability as well as their capacity to adapt to changing societal needs.</p>
<p>The new open method of co-ordination that has been developed for the area of pensions with its comprehensive approach covering adequacy, sustainability and the modernisation of pension systems is the right way forward. It will prove to be a valuable tool to address the common challenges.</p>
<p>The commitment of all Member States to the 11 common objectives that were presented to the Laeken European Council (14-15 December 2001) is welcomed by the Commission. The aim of the open method of co-ordination should be to support Member States in their reform efforts through mutual learning and peer reviews. It will increase the ability of national policy makers to assess relative performance, raise awareness of other policy options and promote a better understanding of the advantages and problems of these different options.</p>
<p>However, imposing a single, uniform policy approach which would not take account of different traditions and aspirations in the Member States should not be the aim. So, it should be left to each Member State to further develop its pension system, including the balance between 1<span class="sup">st</span> , 2<span class="sup">nd</span> and 3<span class="sup">rd</span> pillar schemes and how to guarantee a minimum level of income for older people.</p>
<p>The first result of this new open method of co-ordination will be a joint report by the Commission and the Council to the Spring 2003 European Council. This should be the right moment to examine whether further initiatives are required.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0744"></a>

<p>(EN)</p>
<p>1.	Penal law</p>
<p>The Commission is examining the need for the approximation of penal national laws concerning receiving and handling stolen goods among other things and sanctions in this field. This issue has also been discussed during a work shop on the prevention of illicit trafficking in cultural goods, organised by the Commission with relevant public and private sector stakeholders, that took place on 9 December 2002 in Brussels as part of the Forum for the prevention of organised crime.</p>
<p>Concerning judicial and police co-operation between Member States, the Commission would in particular like to point out that under the programme AGIS managed by the Commission, Community funding will make available since 2003 for projects which include the analysis of the juridical obstacles to the co-operation between European law enforcement. Furthermore, the illicit trafficking in cultural goods, antiques and works of art is included in the scope of the European Arrest Warrant by Article 2 of the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender procedures between Member states<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>2. Community legal instruments</p>
<p>The establishment of a Single Market has also meant that from 1993 onwards Member States are no longer allowed to make physical checks at the Community’s internal borders. As this can facilitates the illegal traffic of cultural goods, the Community had to adopt measures accompanying the completion of the internal market to supplement the protection afforded to national treasures by national rules with a common system of protection at the Community level. These measures are the Regulation of 9 December 1992 on the export of cultural goods<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the Directive of 15 March 1993 on the return of cultural objects illegally removed from the territory of a Member State<a href="#defann_36_3" name="refann_36_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Regulation stipulates that any export of cultural goods listed in its Annex shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence issued by the competent authorities of the Member States. Furthermore, the Regulation introduces uniform controls for the prevention of exports of cultural goods at the external borders of the Community, which allow the competent culture and customs authorities of the Member State from which the cultural goods are to be exported to a third country to take the interests of the other Member State into account, following either lawful and definitive dispatch from this Member State.</p>
<p>The Directive is directly linked to the Regulation and shares a common Annex. It provides mechanisms and a procedure between Member States for restoring national treasures when these have been unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State after 1 January 1993. The Article 15 of the Directive provides that the Directive shall be without prejudice to any civil or criminal proceedings that may be brought, under the national laws of the Member States, by the requesting Member State and/or the owner of a cultural object that has been stolen.</p>
<p>3.	Civil law</p>
<p>The right-to-ownership of stolen goods touches also the general area of property law. Initiatives in this area have been taken in the context of the debate launched by the Head of States and Governments in Tampere, October 1999 (paragraph 39 of the Tampere conclusions).</p>
<p>In a report of 16 November 2001 'on the need to approximate Member States' legislation in civil matters', the Council took note of the initiatives in this area by the Parliament and by the Commission. As far as property law is concerned, the Council considered it to be wise to examine whether the differences in the laws of the Member States in this area constitute barriers to the proper functioning of the internal market in practice. It called on the Commission to conduct a study on this subject-matter.</p>
<p>The Commission has published in July 2002 a call for tender specifying that the aim of this study is to determine whether there are interferences, delimitation problems or even terminology or conceptual differences, resulting mainly from mandatory provisions, between property law and contract law, which might create real or likely obstacles to the smooth running of the internal market or competition imbalances. The aim is, therefore, not to examine property law as a whole, or to compare national legal frameworks, but to analyse the problems and obstacles resulting from differences in legal frameworks in contract and commercial practice.</p>
<p>The Commission will integrate the results of this study in the context of its forthcoming follow-up to the 2001 Commission communication on European Contract Law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has whole heartedly supported the negotiation and the final adoption, within the International Coffee Organisation, of Resolution number 407 regarding the quality standards of exportable coffee. The so-called Quality Programme, if well implemented, should lead to progress in the rationalisation of supply. In fact, in the medium and long term, a large proportion of coffee holdings on the market might be withdrawn.</p>
<p>The Programme has only been operational since 1 October 2002, so the Commission has not yet received any feedback. The Commission hopes that all the producing countries, without exception, will agree to implement the scheme.</p>
<p>The Commission will carry out comprehensive monitoring in close collaboration with the private sector in order to ensure respect for the agreed standards. It will send to the International Coffee Organisation on a quarterly basis, the information received by the European Coffee Federation on compliance by coffee exporters of the quality requirements.</p>

<p>(EN) The Petition to which the honourable Member refers (N° 466/2001 Lambiris) concerns an individual case of a professional recognition procedure under Article 8 of Directive 93/16/EEC (Doctors Directive). This Article has been transposed in the United Kingdom by the European Specialist Medical Qualifications Order 1995 (ESMQO): The relevant parts of Article 8 have been specifically referred to in Article 3(4)(i) and 3(4)(ii), which provides as much certainly as if the provisions of Article 8 were set out verbatim in the ESMQO. The Commission does not dispose of any elements that would allow it to conclude that the relevant Article of the Doctors Directive has not been fully and precisely implemented in the United Kingdom. The circumstances of the application for recognition made by Mr Lambiris have also been examined by the Commission. It has been concluded that the facts show that the Article 8 procedure has been correctly applied in this case.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member correctly states the Commission has not hesitated to initiate an infringement procedure in this context against Spain. The Court decided on 16 May 2002 that Spain had failed to transpose, within the prescribed time-limit, Article 8 of Council Directive 96/13/EEC. If it is justified, the Commission will not hesitate to bring Member States to the Court in the future.

The rules establish that the national terms and conditions of the country to which workers are posted are applicable.

They declare that tax and social security contributions are paid in their own country, which is difficult to check in every single case. Such self-employed workers often charge a very low hourly rate. There is therefore reason to believe that at least some of them do not fulfil their obligations in their own countries.

<p>(EN) The Posting of Workers Directive refers to a situation where an undertaking established in a Member State, within the framework of the provision of transnational services, posts its employees to carry out work temporarily in another Member State.</p>
<p>In essence the Directive defines a set of terms and conditions of employment of a host state which must be complied with by the undertakings that post workers.</p>
<p>Three different forms of postings are covered: postings based on a service contract, intra-company postings and finally postings by temporary employment undertakings or placement agencies. In all these cases there must be an employment relationship between the undertaking making the posting and the workers during the period of posting.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Directive applies to workers but not to self-employed persons. According to the Directive the definition of a worker is that which applies in the law of the Member State to whose territory the worker is posted. It is for the host state to control and verify whether a posted worker is a worker within the meaning of its legislation.</p>
<p>Supervising and monitoring the compliance with the terms and conditions of employment is a matter for the Member States.

<p>(EN) The Union has granted support for the development of railway infrastructure in Greece under the Community Support Framework for the programming period, 1994-99. The results achieved will be set out in the final report for this programme, which is due to be forwarded to the Commission by the Greek Authorities as part of the programme closure procedures. The Commission will also receive similar information on rail projects supported by the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p>The new Community Support Framework for Greece covering the period, 2000-2006, is intended to make a significant contribution to the establishment of an upgraded railway network by the end of 2008 between Patras, Athens, Thessalonika and the borders with Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Bulgaria. The Commission is working closely with the Greek authorities in an effort to ensure that this ambitious programme can be fully realised.</p>
<p>The Commission has carried out a control mission early this year at the level of the projects as well as an audit of the management systems and capacity of Ergose. The findings of the controls are currently under discussion with the Greek Authorities. Meanwhile, the findings of the audit will shortly be communicated to these authorities. The Commission will only be in a position to draw conclusions from these investigations when the discussions with the Greek Authorities are completed.</p>
<p>With regard to the level of payments made to projects in this field, the figures supplied in April 2002 in the answer to the honourable Member’s written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2002-0332_EN.html">E-0332/02</a><a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> are still valid. No payments have been made in the interim while a strategic plan for railway investment is being finalised in order to provide a solid basis for the further management of the projects concerned. The Greek Authorities have submitted a plan in draft form, which is currently being examined by the Commission. Payments will resume when this is finalised and when a clear timetable together with realistic costings for different elements of the investment programme have been put in place.</p>
<p>It is therefore premature at this stage to discuss matters such as the possible launching of a procedure by the Commission to recovery resources transferred to Greece for railway investment under the Structural Funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In its communication on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) adopted on 2 July 2002, the Commission proposed the setting-up of a Multi-Stakeholder Forum on CSR at Community level with the aim of promoting transparency and convergence of CSR practices and instruments.</p>
<p>The main tasks of the Forum are to improve knowledge on CSR, to facilitate the exchange of experiences, and to establish a common Community approach and guiding principles concerning CSR instruments and practices.</p>
<p>The Commission has invited the CSR Forum to agree by mid-2004 on guiding principles for CSR instruments such as company codes of conduct, socially responsible investment and social labels.</p>
<p>At the launch of the Forum on 16 October, the various stakeholder groups including business, trades unions and civil society, have agreed to take up this challenge.</p>
<p>Such guiding principles should take into account existing Community initiatives and legislation and international agreed instruments such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines for multinational enterprises, International Labour Office (ILO) core labour conventions and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights.</p>
<p>Indeed the growing number and diversity of guidelines, principles and codes, not comparable in scope, intent, implementation or applicability, reflects the richness of voluntary enterprise initiatives, which often include innovative elements, but do not answer the need for effective transparency about business CSR performance.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that convergence of CSR practices and instruments, based on European values, is desirable to further promote the development of CSR.</p>
<p>This convergence should build upon core European values and international agreed instruments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0776"></a>

<p>(EN) The law on the financial conditions of the religious and public activities of the churches was amended in November 2001. The modification of the law was supposed to enter into force in January 2003. The main element of the amendment concerned a change of the financing modalities of the churches.</p>
<p>The new financing modalities were based on the results of the 2001 census, which for the first time included a non mandatory question on church affiliation following a joint recommendation by the United Nations Economic and Social Committee and Eurostat for the forthcoming census world campaign.</p>
<p>The question on religion included in the 2001 census was responded by less some 9 million persons out of which 7,6 million claimed to belong to some 260 various churches/religions; these figures basically confirmed the previously estimated numbers.</p>
<p>Following the change of Government in 2002, it was decided to maintain the church financing regime of 1997, through an amendment annulling Article 153 adopted in 2001. This modification is supposed to enter into force in January 2003 after its adoption before the end of 2002.</p>
<p>Declaration 11 to the Amsterdam Treaty states that 'the Union respects and does not prejudice the status under national law of churches and religious associations and communities in the Member States'. In the current Member States, a wide variety of different systems as regards the support for religious groups among the current Member States exists. It is up to each national administration to define the criteria for being recognised as a religious group and for being eligible to receive support from the state budget. It goes without saying that this freedom also applies to future Member States such as Hungary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as stated in the 2002 Regular Report on Hungary's progress towards accession, the 'freedom of religion is enshrined in the Hungarian Constitution and no particular problems have been reported in this respect'.</p>
<p>The criteria for membership agreed by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993 include the guaranteeing of the rule of law.

<p>(EN) The Ministry for Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation (Minatom) is responsible for ensuring the safe collection, treatment and disposal of spent fuel and radioactive waste arising from the decommissioning of the Russian nuclear submarine and the nuclear ice breaker fleet in North-West Russia. The international community, including the Union, attach great importance to the effective pursuit of these activities.</p>
<p>The recent Commission proposal to raise the borrowing ceiling would allow Euratom to grant loans targeted at improving the nuclear safety level of installations in operation or under construction or to assist in their decommissioning in Central and Eastern European countries, including Russia.</p>
<p>The Commission has played a very active role in launching the 'Northern Dimension Environmental Protection Fund' (NDEP). The Commission has pledged €50 million as a contribution to the fund, of which €40 million is for its 'nuclear window'. The main objective of the NDEP nuclear window is to assist the Russian Federation in the most urgent tasks relating to nuclear waste in NW Russia, including in particular those relating to the situation of the Northern Fleet and the quantity of spent fuel stored in the region, for example at Andreeva Bay.</p>
<p>The NDEP Steering Group (consisting of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Nordic Investment Bank, World Bank, European Commission and the Russian Federation) has identified 16 nuclear waste management projects on the Kola Peninsula with an estimated total cost of approximately € 500 million. The promoter of these projects is Minatom.</p>
<p>The Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme in the Russian Federation (MNEPR) will set the legal framework addressing the most important legal questions associated with western assistance in the Russian Federation, in particular access to sites, tax exemption and liability. Its conclusion is a crucial precondition for initiating nuclear-related projects. The Commission, along with other Western Donors and Russia, has participated in the negotiations that it is hoped will lead to the signature of the MNEPR.</p>
<p>In addition, at the Kananaskis summit June 2002 the G8 launched a global partnership against the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction including projects to address non-proliferation, disarmament, counter-terrorism and nuclear safety (including environmental) issues. The dismantlement of decommissioned nuclear submarines is a priority concern in this context and the G8 will commit itself to raise up to $20 billion to support such projects over the next ten years.</p>
<p>Finally, the guidelines for the New Action Plan of the Northern Dimension were agreed on 21 October this year at the Third Ministerial Conference on the Northern Dimension.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0788"></a>

Because of this he risks losing other patents to American firms, including the world standard for flight navigation systems (VDL Mode4) which is largely funded by the EU. On 26 June 2002 the Swedish Foreign Office sent an official letter to the US Attorney General and asked the authorities to look into the matter. No reply has yet been received, in spite of persistent pressure from the Swedish government.</p>

<p>The UN Secretary-General's proposals regarding Cyprus contain not only short and medium-term provisions but also permanent measures running totally counter to the Community acquis. Concerning the right of movement and establishment for example, the number of citizens of one 'component state' establishing themselves in the other 'component state' may not exceed 1% of the population of the latter. After an extremely long transitional period, i.e. 20 years, the figure will increase to 20% and will then be set in perpetuity at one-third. Such a measure will totally run counter to the basic principles of the Treaty establishing the European Union and to the Community acquis since the admission of 'Cyprus' to the European Union under such conditions will create a new particular category of lesser Member State partially and conditionally admitted to the European Union, thereby setting an undesirable precedent and possibly causing more general functional problems within the European Union.</p>

<p>(EN) Since the decision to start the accession negotiations, taken in Luxembourg in 1997, the Union has supported the United Nations (UN) efforts to find a solution on the basis of a bi-communal, bi-zonal approach, taking into account the relevant UN resolutions.</p>
<p>The United Nation’s plan for a settlement is a long and complex document, which seeks to bridge differences between the parties. The presentation of the plan was a courageous and important step which has the support of the Union.</p>
<p>In Seville, the European Council indicated that Cyprus would need to speak with one voice in the Union and ensure proper enforcement of Union law.</p>
<p>The initial assessment is that the institutional arrangements envisaged in the UN plan would broadly comply with the conditions set out in the conclusions of the Seville European Council, as confirmed in October 2002 in Brussels.</p>
<p>The UN has proposed that Cyprus request from the Union derogations from the acquis in order to guarantee the constitutionally enshrined bi-zonality, as expressed in the UN Security Council resolutions. There are precedents for certain derogations which, if acceptable to the parties directly concerned, could be accommodated in the framework of a comprehensive settlement.</p>
<p>At the recent European Council in Copenhagen the accession negotiations have been completed with Cyprus, which will be admitted as a new Member State to the Union. Nevertheless the European Council confirmed its strong preference for accession to the Union by a united Cyprus and welcomed the commitment of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots to continue to negotiate with the objective of concluding a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem by 28 February 2003 on the basis of the United Nations Secretary General's proposals. The European Council considered that those proposals offer a unique opportunity to reach a settlement in the coming weeks and urged the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to seize this opportunity.</p>
<p>The Union also recalled its willingness to accommodate the terms of a settlement in the Treaty of Accession in line with the principles on which the Union is founded. In case of a settlement, the Council, acting by unanimity on the basis of proposals by the Commission, shall decide upon adaptations of the terms concerning the accession of Cyprus to the Union with regard to the Turkish Cypriot community.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0791"></a>

<p>(EN) The Stockholm European Council set an employment rate target of 50% for older workers for 2010. In addition, the Barcelona European Council called on Member States to take measures to progressively increase the average effective age at which people stop working by about 5 years by 2010. Achieving these targets will require determined efforts by Member States.</p>
<p>In response to these calls, the Commission is encouraging Member States to take policy measures for older workers within the framework of the European Employment Strategy. In line with the employment guidelines, Member States are devoting more resources to active ageing policies in employment and there is now certainly wider recognition that such policies are essential in facing the challenges of an ageing population. The Commission's assessment of the implementation of the employment guidelines shows that Member States have made some progress in developing active ageing measures, although only a few have developed comprehensive national strategies. So far, the Member States have tended to concentrate on benefit reforms, and have given less attention to improving the working capacity of older persons. More needs to be done to avoid too much reliance on early retirement. Candidate countries are fully associated with the Employment Strategy and will have to formally implement it on accession.</p>
<p>In the light of the revision of the European Employment Strategy an even greater priority will be attached to the policies on active ageing. Future employment guidelines could usefully focus on policies and practices enhancing working capacity and on creating the right working conditions for older workers. Efforts to enable and motivate older workers to continue to work longer should not rely merely on the removal of financial disincentives but should also be based on better access to training, upgrading skills in the workplace and making age-sensitive improvements in the working environment. Such efforts should aim to raise the quality of individual lives and at the same time, at societal level, contribute to more growth, lower dependency burdens and consequently contribute to the sustainability of pension and health care systems. The active support and contribution of the social partners is essential to maximise the impact of such measures.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission suggested that progress towards the target of increasing the effective age exit from the labour market should be assessed on the basis of a new structural indicator on 'effective average exit age'. The Commission will report on progress towards meeting the Stockholm target and the Barcelona goal before the Spring European Council 2003.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0803"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission believes that the Union can and is making a very important contribution to the eradication and prevention of poverty and social exclusion. It is doing so through the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) on poverty and social exclusion which was established at the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 in order to make a 'decisive impact on the eradication of poverty and social exclusion by 2010'. The key elements of the OMC are the setting of common objectives and guidelines, translating these into Member States' own policies through national action plans which contain clear objectives and targets for reducing poverty and social exclusion, establishing comparable indicators and benchmarks to measure progress, periodic monitoring, evaluation and peer review of national performance and policies and the promotion of mutual learning and the exchange of best practice.</p>
<p>Considerable progress has been made over the past two years in advancing all aspects of the OMC. All Member States submitted their first National Action Plans for social inclusion in 2001, which were examined first by the Commission and subsequently with Member States. A Joint Report on Social inclusion, setting out the conclusions of such examination was presented to the Laeken European Council in December 2001.</p>
<p>The next round of National Action Plans will be due in mid 2003. This will be a very important opportunity to consolidate and build on the achievements to date and to further intensify efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion. Assessing progress of the Union strategy will become more effective on the basis of a first commonly agreed set of social indicators, and of national targets to be set by each Member State in 2003.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that if the OMC is to have the maximum impact then the objective of eradicating and preventing poverty and social exclusion can and should be mainstreamed across all levels of policy making - the European, national, regional and local levels - and across a broad range of policy domains including economic, employment and social policies. In this way the different levels of policy making will reinforce each other and the multi-dimensional nature of poverty and social exclusion will be fully taken into account. This would reinforce the integration of economic, employment and social policies and contribute to the reinvigoration of the European Social Model.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0804"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission undertakes no regular sectoral assessment of growth and employment prospects in extractive industries. Thus, no such precise sectoral forecasts for growth and employment in 2003 can be provided to the honourable Member.</p>
<p>According to the most recent data available from Eurostat, some 500 000 people were occupied in mining, quarrying and oil extraction activities in the Union in 2001. This figure represents a decline of one-fifth from the employment level five years earlier.</p>
<p>Various information sources highlight the impact of the overall weak economic performance on developments in extractive industries. One can therefore assume that as long as the major markets for minerals, i.e. construction, transport, steel and chemicals, do not pick up, the growth prospects for 2003 will remain rather moderate. The volume of sales of aggregates is even expected to decline. The metals mining sector may be the exception, as it is expected to increase its production. In terms of employment the difficult market conditions together with structural changes are likely to contribute to further decline in employment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0805"></a>

<p>(EN) In the context of the Spanish National Hydrological Plan, the Commission raised, in its note of May 2002 to the Spanish authorities, concerns on the question of possible salt wedge intrusions into the Ebro delta and requested information on the likely impact of abstraction from the river on the delta (in distance and in time) as well as on the salinity of groundwater resources. The Commission is currently evaluating the comprehensive documentation provided by the Spanish authorities as a response to this note. Given the comprehensive and detailed character of the documents, the Commission has in its evaluation not yet arrived at conclusions. However, the response does not refer to an increase in salinity of 20 to 50 % in the lower Ebro.</p>
<p>The Water Framework Directive was adopted on 23 October 2000 and entered into force on 22 December of that year. Specific obligations under the directive will start to become effective as from the end of 2003. With regards to the achievement of environmental objectives, the directive requires that all surface water bodies and all groundwater bodies have to achieve/maintain ‘good status’. Good status is defined as a rather limited deviation from ‘high status’; such high status corresponding to totally or nearly totally undisturbed conditions of a type-specific ecosystem. Good status is further elaborated in a comprehensive annex: on salinity, it is specified that salinity must not reach levels which do not ensure the functioning of the type specific ecosystem. (annex V; 1.2.1). In the specific context raised by the honourable Member, attention has to be paid to an adequate equilibrium between freshwater and salt water in the lower channel, taking into account the current water uses in the area, the ecological status and the inter-relation between surface water and groundwater.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0819"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission is aware of the existing difficulties in the marketing of certain road safety barriers in the Member States mentioned by the honourable Member. The Commission is examining the problems mentioned concerning certain public contracts for the supply of these products and more generally the technical specifications contained in the legislation of certain Member States, causing obstacles to intra-Community trade in road safety barriers, legally manufactured and/or marketed in the Member State of origin.</p>
<p>Standard EN 1317, to which the honourable Member refers, was published by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) as a voluntary European standard in 1998. In principle, in accordance with directives 93/36 and 93/37, the contracting authorities should therefore refer to such standards in their invitations to tender.</p>
<p>However, certain Member States, as a result of national technical regulations, continue to demand, in their public contracts, that products conform to the models described in the national standards, which are still in force.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Commission has received several complaints from certain people in the industry. These complaints are under investigation, with a view to ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market in this field.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a ‘harmonised’ standard is being drawn up on the Commission’s mandate under the directive on building products. This standard will essentially include the content of standard EN 1317 published in 1998, and will add an annex that will define the conditions for affixing EC markings to these products, in accordance with the directive on building products. When this harmonised standard is finalised, the situation should improve since all products placed on the market will have to conform to it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0824"></a>

<p>Reports have appeared in specialist media to the effect that 39 cases of BSE were detected in Spain during the third quarter of 2002: the number of livestock infected was double that for the equivalent quarter of 2001.

<p>Are these data correct?

<p>(EN) The Commission has also noted that the number of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) cases detected in Spain is increasing. In the third quarter this year, Spain reported more than twice as many cases as during the corresponding period last year. At the same time the number of cases decreased or was stable in all other Member States except in Germany, where the Commission saw a slight increase.</p>
<p>Overall, the BSE incidence in Spain is increasing since the beginning of this year. The incidence is however still relatively low, around 35 cases per million adult cattle over the past 12 months, and it is not increasing rapidly. At the end of 2001, the overall BSE incidence in Spain was around 24.</p>
<p>The Commission does not know the exact reason for the increase in BSE cases in Spain. It can however partly be explained by the relatively high number of cases in young animals born between 1996 and 1998 reported in Spain last year. This age group of animals is now getting closer to the average age when the disease becomes clinical, which is 4-6 years, and consequently the number of reported cases is increasing.</p>
<p>On the other hand the Commission has already noted a shift in the age structure of positive cases towards older animals this year, which is a positive sign. This leads it to believe that the trend in the BSE incidence in Spain will reach its peak and start declining sometime next year, provided that the methods of detection remain the same. If new, more sensitive BSE tests become available, the Commission expects to see an increase in reported BSE cases in all Member States.</p>
<p>There is not much that Spain can do to immediately decrease the number of BSE cases being detected. The cases being reported now were infected more than three years ago and reflect the exposure of cattle to the BSE agent at that time. The effect of any measures put in place now will only be seen after 4-5 years. The current Community legislation, in particular the feed ban and the removal and destruction of specified risk material, should, if rigorously implemented, be sufficient to prevent new animals from becoming infected. BSE cases will nevertheless continue to appear in Spain, as in other Member States, for a number of years.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0829"></a>

<p>The EU has recognised the serious economic situation in the Dominican Republic and has taken action accordingly, including the grant of EUR 23 m for a rural development project. This project has been successful, and as a result the production of milk has increased considerably. However, the effects of the project have now been undermined by export subsidies for milk powder, since as a result of these subsidies, Arla (a Danish firm selling dairy products) can sell its milk powder at one third of the price of locally-produced milk. This competition has driven local farmers out of the market, to the extent that, according to local authorities, 20 000 milk producers have had to quit farming.</p>
<p>Is it correct that export subsidies amount to some DKR 5600 per tonne for skimmed milk, some DKR 8100 per tonne for whole milk and some DKR 13 000 per tonne for butter?</p>

<p>(FR) According to the information available, although the Dominican Republic has developed its national milk production, it is not self-sufficient in milk production and needs imports in order to meet the needs of its population.</p>
<p>In 2000, 50% of these needs were met by imports. Without imports, the price would be significantly higher and milk products would not be within reach of large sections of the population.</p>
<p>The increase in national production demonstrates that the resources implemented by the Union within the framework of development projects have had positive results.</p>
<p>In fact, it is precisely in order to allow such progress that the Community had agreed to restrict its exports of powdered milk within the framework of a rectification, requested by the Dominican Republic, of the concessions made at the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p>For exports within the framework of this system, the Commission decided to grant refunds lower than those granted for the export of powdered milk to any other destination in the world; 70% for skimmed milk powder and 85% for whole milk powder. This means that the amounts are considerably lower than those mentioned in the honourable Member’s oral question: DKK 3379 per tonne for skimmed milk powder and DKK 6502 per tonne for whole milk powder. Butter is not covered by the system and the Union’s exports do not exceed 150 tonnes per year.</p>
<p>In view of these considerations, the Commission does not accept the accuracy of the information suggesting that exports of European milk powder have had harmful effects for the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>In fact, in the frequent contacts held under the system agreed with the authorities of the Dominican Republic, the latter have never mentioned any negative effects on national milk production.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0831"></a>
