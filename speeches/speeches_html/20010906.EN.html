Yesterday, however, in connection with my report, a decision was taken which points in two directions. After we had already discussed the legal basis for this decision, and also raised appropriate objections to it, to which we received no response from the Commission, this House decided yesterday to agree to the Commission's legislative proposal and then passed a resolution rejecting the Commission's proposal. This is recorded under item 11 of the Minutes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to propose that the resolution passed by this Parliament yesterday be referred to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the purposes of clarification under Article 148(3). There are two specific reasons for this: Firstly, we need clarification as to which of the two resolutions in this instance is actually valid. Secondly, we need, for the future too, clarification in the Rules of Procedure as to what is to happen in cases such as this. For if, as appears to me, votes are being, as it were, immediately corrected by the authorities, I find that not exactly in order. I believe that a correction should in principle be made if the Committee on Constitutional Affairs so decides. I therefore base my objection on Article 148(3). I request this House's Committee on Constitutional Affairs to clarify the situation and set down a ruling in the Rules of Procedure as to how we should proceed in future cases of this sort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I feel it would be discourteous to say no, but it would also be too hasty on my part to give an answer right away.

At the Nice summit in December 2000, these rights were enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The reports and resolutions which the European Parliament is debating today concern the present state of these vital constitutional rights of European citizens. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate, which goes to the heart of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">Before commenting on some of the reports, I would like to express my thanks to Commissioner Loyola de Palacio for continuing to ensure that the Commission respects deadlines for answers to the Ombudsman's inquiries and provides answers which are complete and accurate. This good cooperation is vital to ensure that the Ombudsman can deal with complaints promptly and effectively and thereby fulfils his mission of enhancing relations between the citizens and the Community institutions and bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to pay tribute today to the work of Mr Jean-Claude Eeckhout. He will soon be retiring from his post in the Secretariat-General of the Commission where he deals, amongst other things, with relations between the Commission and the European Ombudsman. To me, he represents the model public servant. He is devoted not only to the European ideal, but also to the hard practical work of improving administration for the benefit of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour and congratulate Mr Roy Perry on his excellent report. It is appropriate that Mr Perry should be the rapporteur, since he first launched the idea of such a code some years ago, in the report of the Committee on Petitions on its activities in 1996-1997. Jean-Maurice Dehousse, rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has also played an important role. He has stressed that the code should have a firm legal basis and suggested a practical way to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this report will be followed by the rapid adoption of a regulation. The Nice Charter includes good administration as one of the fundamental rights of citizenship. I cannot understand why anyone should oppose the idea of Community law providing citizens with as high a standard of legal protection <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the European administration as national laws already provide <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the Member States' administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the Statute of the European Ombudsman is unusual because the Treaty makes the European Parliament the legislator and also entrusts to it the power of initiative. The role of the Council is limited to giving its approval to the Parliament's text by qualified majority, whilst the Commission gives an opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Teresa Almeida Garrett, for the principled approach which she has taken to the legislative process. As she has emphasised, the original Statute was drafted nearly a decade ago. Its provisions concerning the inspection of documents and the hearing of witnesses need to be updated in the light of the greater emphasis on administrative openness and the need to gain the confidence of the public and promote a modern administrative culture at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of the Committee on Petitions on the Ombudsman's Annual Report for the year 2000 is also before you. I congratulate the rapporteur Mr Bösch for his excellent and constructive report, which rightly focuses on the need to serve European citizens effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the rapporteur that the Ombudsman should deal with complaints as quickly as possible. To this end, we have continued our efforts to eliminate unnecessary delay by insisting that the institutions and bodies respect the deadlines for responding to complaints and by improving our own efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made progress towards achieving our internal management targets of acknowledging complaints within one week, deciding on their admissibility within one month and closing inquiries within one year. At the end of August last year, there were 65 cases still open after one year. By August 2001 the comparable figure was 25 cases. Of these, one remains open because we have submitted a special report to the European Parliament. In five other cases, the Statute lays down that the institution concerned has a further three months to produce a detailed opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bösch's report also refers to the problems which the Committee on Petitions has faced in obtaining the information needed to deal effectively with citizens' petitions. An example of such problems is the case of the petition concerning the regulation of the Lloyd's insurance market.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the most effective way to improve the situation could be through strengthening cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, especially in relation to petitions about infringements of Community law by Member States, where the Commission plays a vital role through the so-called Article 226 procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We would be ready to handle the preparation of such cases in a professional way and thereby facilitate the work of the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I am ready to enter discussions with the committee and the European Parliament's administration to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I shall make some brief comments about the Commission's recently published White Paper on governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper contains much talk, but few concrete proposals for action to benefit citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It could have contained firm commitments to: propose a law on good administrative behaviour, to ensure the rule of law and respect for citizens by the EU administration; reform the way that the Commission acts as Guardian of the Treaty in order to make the procedure open, fair and understandable; advise officials to use their freedom of speech to promote debate and help focus citizens' attention on European issues; reinforce the legal advice service to citizens in the Commission representations, thereby promoting the correct application of Community law. But it does not.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to say that the Commission seems to have forgotten European citizenship. This neglect is illustrated in a brochure which the Commission has recently published called <span class="italic">Who's who in the European Union</span>. The brochure mentions the Charter on Fundamental Rights and the fact that the European Parliament exercises democratic control over the Commission's activities. However, it contains no reference to citizenship or to the right to petition the European Parliament or to complain to the Ombudsman, which the Nice Charter includes as fundamental rights of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to call the present Commission back to the road of making European citizenship a living reality. It is the only way to obtain the confidence of the citizens, which today seems more lost than ever before.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizenship may be less fashionable than the more technocratic sounding ‘governance’, but there are no technical solutions to the deep gulf between the rulers and ruled in Europe. This gulf was revealed not just by the Irish referendum but by every other referendum on Europe in the last decade and also by the events in Gothenburg. It can be bridged only slowly, by the development of European citizenship in an honest, fair and just way.</p>

In 1995 there were only 298 complaints; in 2000, to which my report refers, there were by contrast 1732.</p>
<p class="contents">There were of course many cases which, in the final analysis, were not within the remit of the European Ombudsman. However, the excellent networking of the European Ombudsman, which is to be further intensified in the future, resulted in the cases and complaints in question being passed on to the appropriate agencies. An Ombudsman is there, after all, for the citizens, and there is sometimes confusion about who is responsible for what.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman has already addressed many of the points made in my report. The ever shortening turnaround times are greatly to be welcomed; here, the Ombudsman is an example of good administrative practice on a European scale. Eighty-three per cent of complaints were against the Commission. I do not wish to make this an accusation levelled at the Commission; the division of competencies makes it quite obvious who is most going to be complained about. What I, however, find interesting is what the complaints focus on. In 28% of cases, it is a lack of transparency or the withholding of information, and in 24% avoidable delays. Over half the complaints, therefore, focus on these two areas. What this is about, Commissioner, is good governance. It is precisely in these areas that we could improve European administration at no cost whatever.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I consider it quite remarkable – and this is something that must be said very clearly in a Parliament such as this – that those at the top of the Commission have neglected to consult the European expert on good governance – namely the Ombudsman – about the White Paper on the subject. So I must ask you, Commissioner, how seriously you are taking the improvement of administration across Europe. We do not need White Papers, we have an Ombudsman who gets complaints from our fellow citizens every year. All that is needed is willingness; not repeated postponement and the commissioning of reforms and White Papers and studies and who knows what else; what we need is different administration.</p>
<p class="contents">That is perfectly clear from this report, in whose appendix I have taken the opportunity to discuss specific examples. There is an instance, Commissioner, of a submarine. You will be well aware of what significance submarines had for the previous Commission and what the consequences were. If the European Ombudsman needs to intervene nearly a dozen times in order to get the Commission to certify that such a submarine had work done on it, then that tells you something about the new Commission. If this Commission took until 2000 to concede that submarines existed, then whom are you trying to convince that this Commission is willing to take transparency and – let me say this as a Socialist – the protection of employees' rights in Europe seriously?</p>
<p class="contents">I really would like our Ombudsman to follow up instances like this rather more stringently in order to give them the critical attention they deserve, for the alternative would be undiluted flattery, credible to nobody. Mr Södermann, I would again ask you, as I did in the report, to consider presenting a special report on the issue of access to documents and data. Otherwise, I can only repeat my thanks to you for your work. In these thanks I wish to include your colleagues. I believe your work has become a quite central building block for the further development of the European Union, and I hope that it will continue as it has begun.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Perry (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, this week we have been debating very many important issues: the enlargement of the Union, the future governance of the Union and anti-terrorism measures amongst others. I do not want anybody to think that the issues addressed in the joint debate this morning are not themselves of the utmost importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is a great ideal. The institutions are undoubtedly worthy and officials of the institutions seek to discharge their functions responsibly. As the Ombudsman himself said this morning, unfortunately the institutions of Europe do not enjoy the highest reputation amongst our citizens. It is critical, therefore, that every step is taken to ensure the quality of the administration of European affairs by the EU institutions. In Parliament we have the Petitions Committee and the Officer of the Ombudsman to oversee allegations of maladministration. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of Herbert Bösch in his report on the Ombudsman, my colleague on the later report, Felipe Camisón on the work of the Petitions Committee and Mrs Almeida Garrett on her work on the Statute of the Ombudsman. We need a new framework agreement so that the Member States also pay more serious attention to their obligations under the EU Treaties. We should also place on record our appreciation to the Ombudsman and to his staff for the calm and efficient way in which they discharge their functions. It cannot be easy to be the complaints department of Europe. It requires special skills and Mr Söderman has shown us that he has those in abundance.</p>
<p class="contents">To turn to my own report proposing a code of good administrative behaviour, this has been a long time in the gestation and in the last Parliament there were reports from myself and from Mrs de Esteban proposing a code of good administrative behaviour. I am grateful to rapporteurs from the Citizens' Rights Committee and the Legal Affairs Committee, in particular Mr Dehousse, who have pointed to a procedural route that could, and will I hope, enable us to get this code. There are two central principles if the code is to be fully effective. One, it must be based in law. Good administration is a right, not a privilege and the code must be uniform for all the institutions. Citizens need to know where they stand and precisely what their rights are in dealing with the institutions. The right to good administration is enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. But without this code, the charter would just be a form of words. This code is to put flesh on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is a concept that is contained within similar laws in most of the Member States. Spain, is just one example. Its 1992 administrative law requires that citizens be treated with respect and cooperation by the authorities. Germany and its unfair practice law dating from 1909 enforces good practice upon its officials. The European Union must now follow suit with its own code of good administrative behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate that the Commission in particular, but also the other institutions, have adopted and are applying their own voluntary codes. They are good as far as they go, but they do not go far enough, and they have to be obligatory rather than voluntary. There are, however, some differences between the proposed code as now drafted by the Ombudsman, which I hope that this House will support, and the codes currently in use. I would refer just to one of them and that is the requirement that when an error has been made the official concerned has to apologise to the citizen who has suffered as a result. A readiness to apologise never comes amiss, so I particularly support that particular clause in the draft.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, British Members like me are often against written constitutions. They are alien to our tradition. They seem to us very often to concentrate on giving power to those in authority and ignoring the rights of the citizen. But from the Magna Carta 1215 to our citizens' charter of the 1990s, we in Britain have welcomed codes that set out citizens' rights. I hope that fellow Europeans will see this as a contribution to the good governance of Europe that even British Members can support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel that this is a fundamental objective of European integration and, as such, an area that unites us with everyone, in the sense that we are all on the same side, civil servants and politicians, taxpayers and administrators. Since 1994, European citizens have had their own Ombudsman and know that they can rely on him and his actions, always competent and judicious, to protect their rights and to sensitively and ceaselessly endeavour to correct and improve the running of Community administration.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Ombudsman has always been able to count on the support of this Parliament. In the course of recent years and through the presentation of annual reports, we have been able to see the increasingly visible affirmation of this still young institution and the increasingly consistent and productive results of its worthy activity. The time has come today to present you with some amendments to its statute. We are not of course, talking about a revolution. Time has proved, and the practice employed by the Ombudsman is an example of this, that the powers and the competences granted him have always been used to fulfil the central objective of his activity, in his ceaseless quest to improve the sound administrative practices of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are discussing today is simply the adaptation of the Statute’s provisions to the new legislative climate which has, fortunately, been making considerable progress towards the construction of a genuine Europe of the citizens, by improving the speed of a modern administration, which must be increasingly open and transparent. By clarifying the Ombudsman’s powers of investigation, by giving him all the resources for accessing documents and for uncovering the truth, we can be sure of improving the administration’s operating conditions and of bringing the public closer to the various European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say one last word, Mr President, simply to mention the only area which has, on occasions, divided us, on which today an amendment to my report will be tabled which I cannot support. It concerns the possibility for members of the institutions or more specifically, members of the Commission to also be heard by the Ombudsman. I am convinced that the majority of this House will understand that given the hazy border that sometimes exists between political and administrative acts, Parliament claims for itself the monopoly on political control of the members of the Commission, as the prerogative of those who have been directly elected by the citizens of Europe and that it acknowledges that this power cannot be delegated. It is in recognition of this common philosophy that this Parliament, and its rapporteur in particular, hope that the Commission, especially Commissioner Loyola de Palácio, will deliver a favourable opinion and that the Council will approve the amendments that I have tabled today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A special thank you goes to Mrs Almeida Garrett, who has succeeded in putting her case with great ability, and has also been successful in conducting intelligent mediation.</p>
<p class="contents">Society advances and the law always follows its progress. Sometimes that progress is rapid and the law seems slow compared with practice. That is why I think the Ombudsman is right to propose amending Article 3 of the statute, which dates from the 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">However, together with other members of the Committee on Petitions, I felt that the request to amend Article 3 went too far, in particular as regards the obligation to testify, even for members of the Community institutions. This is because there is a difficulty and confusion, including legal confusion, between control of the institutions’ administrative practices and control of political acts of members of those institutions. There was therefore a need to maintain greater balance, although there is no intention to slow down any investigation, for clarity and above all in defence of proximity and transparency, fundamental pillars contained in the Union’s Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the solution adopted of partial revision, to which the Ombudsman has also contributed with his final letter accepting the positions of the rapporteur, Mrs Almeida Garrett, and the Commissioner, is the best way forward, and in the future appropriate steps can be taken to carry out a more systematic and juridical revision of this statute, respecting Community legislation and continuing to act in accordance with that principle of proximity and transparency which governs – and should continue to govern – the relationship between European citizens and Community institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proclamation of the Charter represented an important step forward for the citizens of the European Union, even if there is controversy as to what legal reality this proclamation has achieved in the meantime. In any case, the continuation of this important process demands further efforts at every level. The Charter further laid down, in addition to other important things, a triad of significance to EU citizens which is echoed in the three reports before us: petitions, the Ombudsman and good administration. For this, the three rapporteurs, Mr Bösch, Mrs Almeida Garrett and Mr Perry, to whose report I have the honour of speaking, deserve especial thanks and also congratulations.</p>
<p class="contents">In reinforcing the triad I have referred to, they have achieved an important step forward, for there is a need for the creation of a further substructure, a network, to secure these institutions for the citizen. It will now be exciting to see how this network's ramifications will develop. The law has many instruments through which to turn rights into realities – constitutions, laws, regulations, decrees, right down to service instructions. In all these, the principle applies: the more generally a right is formulated, the higher up this hierarchy it should be set, and the more specifically, the further down it.</p>
<p class="contents">So it is good that we have a code for good administrative conduct before us, and it is right to encourage the Commission to make a regulation for this purpose. When this regulation is put into tangible form, however, we must keep a careful eye on its precise final content. In Germany, there was at one time a regulation which stated that a soldier had to start swimming, once he reached a depth of 80 cm of water. Write this into a constitution and comedians will have a field day with it. And so it was with good reason that this was not in the German constitution, but in a service regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it to be important that administration should be well organised. This does not only mean ensuring that the right decisions are taken but also touches on the question of how administration comes across to the citizen – at the shop counter, as it were. This is very important. Modern administration means that the citizen is not the authorities' supplicant, but one of its customers. Modern administration involves the authorities not thinking of themselves as superiors, but as providers of a service. That is what they are there for, and the citizen is entitled to expect good services.</p>

Also Mr Söderman for his continued unstinting defence of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach of these reports is based on the need to create a system of transparency and understanding, so that citizens of the European Union can be confident that when they have a legitimate complaint they have recourse to the Ombudsman or the Committee on Petitions, depending on the nature of their problem. It is important that we clarify for the public the distinct functions of the two institutions and press for more publicity and a more effective information policy for both the Ombudsman's office and Parliament's petition process. I fully support the view that is necessary to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the treaties of the Union, so as to further enhance the rights of citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To succeed as the most progressive combination of States, we must ensure that our institutions are fully democratic and accountable and that the individual and collective rights of all are guaranteed and defended. I congratulate the Ombudsman in particular for succinctly identifying – perhaps one of the few to have done so at European level – the underlying reason for the failure of the Irish referendum and that is the gulf between rulers and ruled. There is absolutely no doubt in my view that that is the case and it has given rise to all kinds of concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bösch report quite rightly praises the cooperation between Parliament and the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman's office and the invaluable procedure of referring complaints to the Committee on Petitions where they fall outside his remit. I welcome the Ombudsman's suggestion that there be a much closer working relationship between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman's office with regard to the legal implications of some of the cases that come before us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Perry report is another piece of important work and, as the Ombudsman has said, it is appropriate that Mr Perry, the author of the report, is given a role in initiating the whole idea of a code of conduct at European level. It is essential that a common code of conduct applies in all our institutions, so that citizens are not baffled or bamboozled by the response of our institutions to their problems and complaints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that the Ombudsman, reinforced by the Charter, plays an increasingly meaningful and forceful role in protecting the citizen from abuses of executive authority.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled one amendment to Article 3 of the Statute, which would bring Members of the Commission and Members of Parliament as well as members of the agencies of the Union, such as Europol, beneath the purview of the Ombudsman. The Commission opposes this reform on the grounds that it implies political interference, but we believe that the Ombudsman is perfectly capable of distinguishing between maladministration and defective politics. The right to inquire into the conduct of those supremely responsible for administration is an essential part of good governance and a necessary complement to, not a substitute for, the work of this Parliament in exercising democratic accountability in relation to the College. In most, if not all, Member States national ministers are subject to inquiries by the national ombudsman and it would be a pity if European standards of good administration fell below the norms now established in our Member States. In fact, in our view, they should be superior. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to say that the Committee on Petitions may even be the very committee in this Chamber that is able to find solutions to the gaping chasm that exists between the people and the decision-makers. In my opinion these annual discussions are always among the highlights of the year and it is most agreeable to be able to participate in them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bösch’s report on the annual report on the Ombudsman’s activities reiterates this call by Parliament for making the Charter of Fundamental Rights a binding component of the Treaties. This deserves our enthusiastic support as this may just be one way – as Mr Bösch and the Committee state – to reinforce and broaden the scope of the right of petition instrument. Some day it might evolve into a real citizens’ initiative, found in the legislation of some Member States. With regard to the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, the subject of Mr Perry’s report, Parliament takes the view that what is needed is a law that is binding on all the institutions making it obligatory that administration should actually serve the people. It is quite clear that the Commission should now be promoting this swiftly and determinedly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Duff has already referred to Teresa Almeida Garrett’s report on the Statute of the European Ombudsman, and I have to say his arguments convince me that it should be possible that members of the institutions can also if necessary be heard by the Ombudsman when it is a matter of administrative error. In my opinion, Members of Parliament have nothing to fear from this as the Ombudsman’s competence is administrative and not political. I hope Mr Duff’s amendment will be widely supported.</p>

As I see it, the rapporteur, Mr Perry, is strongly advocating a code of conduct which reflects the aims guiding those who drafted Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, namely the citizens’ right to good administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, such a code calls for good administration by all those involved, institutions and officials alike. Furthermore, it should be implemented in the same way within all institutions. The code must be as widely known, as transparent and as accessible as possible to the citizens and should help to make the European institutions more credible and bring them closer to the citizens. Incidentally, I have to say that we still have a long way to go to achieve this. In addition, there must be no discrimination for reasons of sex, race, colour, ethnic origin, language or religion when implementing the code.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, Mr President, I think it is worth mentioning that, even in this institution, far more zeal than usual is displayed in asking one of our German colleagues for her card. It so happens that the lady is of Kurdish descent, with a dark complexion and black eyes and therefore does not look like the average Member. If such behaviour goes on here, in this very House, imagine what can happen in the wider world. It is therefore essential for the code of conduct to be implemented with no discrimination whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">The bodies already implementing the code of good conduct proposed by the Ombudsman deserve to be congratulated. I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Ombudsman himself on his work.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the citizens’ complaints the Ombudsman and the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions on which I sit have become very aware of how much more still has to be done to make the European institutions more credible and bring them closer to the citizens. It is for us to work to promote such closeness and credibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel that giving access to all the classified documents from a Member State without the consent of that Member State, even if the documents could concern diplomatic or defence issues, is a very dangerous precedent, especially if this revision is in some way imposed on the Member States. The perverse result of this measure, if it were adopted, would obviously be that the Member States would be encouraged to retain classified documents rather than passing them on to Community bodies, and this is why my group cannot support this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, with regard to the Bösch report, we do not entirely share Mr Bösch’s optimism on the analysis of the activity of the European Ombudsman. It is true that the work done by Mr Söderman’s department seems quite remarkable given the modesty of their resources. However, just over 1 700 complaints received in 2000, of which only 297 have been declared admissible, does not demonstrate good administration by the institutions of Europe, it shows above all a lack of information to citizens on their means of defence against some aspects of Brussels bureaucracy. As for the tenor of the complaints lodged, which were mainly against the Commission, we feel they are symptomatic: refusal of information, lack of transparency, delayed payment, abuse of power, injustice and even discrimination are the main grievances. It is on the basis of these grievances that I think we should continue our discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We fought for a long time to obtain a proper statute so that the Ombudsman might have the opportunity to inspect everything. That battle was lost but must now be joined again. The statute should be revised so that the Ombudsman is entitled to see each and every document before he has to pronounce upon a matter. The Ombudsman must, of course, respect privacy and reasonable demands for confidentiality, but he must have the opportunity to see everything. If the Commission’s officials themselves can decide what they want to have inspected, then it is not of course the role of an Ombudsman we are talking about here, but a public relations function. The European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control has the same problem. The Commission itself decides what it wishes to have inspected. Even the Court of Auditors does not have the opportunity fully to inspect the Commission. The President explained in the Committee that he too is not allowed to see every document.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where Mr Prodi ought to begin, instead of issuing further empty promises about more transparency and a closer relationship with the people. The Ombudsman and the Court of Justice have done some good work in the interests of greater transparency. Mr Söderman deserves a lot of praise, but the new regulation on transparency will not constitute great progress towards transparency. Instead, it is in danger of being an actual setback. There is therefore a need now for active efforts on the parts of the Ombudsman, the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control. A number of active members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have brought legal proceedings against the Commission, and these are something which the whole Parliament should support. The Court of Auditors ought not to accept a single refusal to let it see a document. If the event of such a refusal, Parliament should make it known that it is not giving discharge. And why – I would ask the Ombudsman – not appeal to the people and go before the Court of Justice in the event of what you consider to be an unjustified refusal to grant access to documents? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Again we see that the world has not yet managed to allow the principles of the Enlightenment, which have found their way into American case law via the Constitution and the Freedom of Information Act, to travel to Europe, because the Enlightenment unfortunately made no inroads into the French administrative tradition. That is again how one experiences these various speeches. It is a bitter experience to find that the EU is still where it was on 17 December 1992, when dealing with the draft on the Ombudsman. In any case, however, here we are, and I believe that this time we will win.</p>
<p class="contents">The many complaints from citizens having problems with EU institutions are essentially to do with so much still being withheld or suppressed. What is now being proposed in the Garrett Report, which in my opinion can only be supported, is only the first step. At first it should be the Ombudsman who is actually given access to all documents, but then it should also be the citizens themselves. We urgently need here a reversal of the burden of proof; I would, indeed, demand of the Ombudsman that he should tell us in future what documents he has still not received where regulations on confidentiality have been invoked, and that we should, by means of this reversal of the burden of proof, reach the point where we really are living out a democracy and, as far as possible, have access to all documents and also to public sittings of the Council. For I am firmly convinced that a democracy cannot exist without transparency.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wyn (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I welcome all these reports but will concentrate this morning on the Bösch report, highlighting the very important work carried out by the Ombudsman which goes some way to respecting the idea of transparency and open governance. This will hopefully show citizens that Europe's institutions do endeavour to act in the interests of its people and that cases of maladministration will always be punished. Of course the Ombudsman's powers are limited, but I am happy that the report demonstrates that the Ombudsman does his utmost in most cases in the name of fair play.</p>
<p class="contents">The bulk of the Ombudsman's report consists of a thorough account of the complaints made to him about maladministration by the European institutions, the investigations his office has carried out and the action taken, including, of course, the results. However many complaints addressed to the Ombudsman still concern actions by national authorities, for which the European Ombudsman is not competent, and many complaints prove not to merit any action. The number of cases where the Ombudsman's intervention has proved successful for the complainant shows that the Ombudsman has developed efficient ways of ensuring that the European institutions comply with his recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman's special reports, based on his right to own-initiative inquiry, make an important contribution to the interpretation and development of Community law. I particularly welcome the fact that, in connection with the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Ombudsman has strongly urged that the Charter recognise the citizen's right to an open, accountable and service-minded administration. Community bodies have a duty to shape Community policies and law in a way which is beneficial and comprehensible to citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have never had any illusions that this Nordic guarantee of legal certainty, which is of course what the Ombudsman <span class="italic">is</span>, would revolutionise the EU bureaucracies, but if only the Ombudsman could clear just a few negotiable paths in the EU jungle, we should view this as progress. The Ombudsman does not have an easy time of it. It requires a great deal of patience to put up with the EU systems’ inertia. The Ombudsman’s very moderate proposals for a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour for the individual institutions has of course been met with that mixture of verbal good will and practical passivity which, in practice, can block any progress, and the current restrictions upon the Ombudsman’s ability to obtain any of the relevant information on the matters with which he is dealing – we are concerned here with Article 3 of the statute – is downright scandalous.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ombudsman is patient, however. The institutions shelve recommendations and enquiries, but that does not cause the Ombudsman to give up. The mill turns slowly, but I believe it turns all the same. A regulation concerning good administrative behaviour – and which is not ineffectual nonsense from the Commission, but the Ombudsman’s own proposal – is something that we shall be able to support. Such a regulation will not revolutionise the various forms of administration. For that, fundamental changes to the administrative culture are required, and these will not come overnight. However, the rules can help develop legal certainty and transparency. Accordingly, we are able to support the proposal to amend Article 3 which, in its present state, really means that the institutions can refuse to provide the Ombudsman with the information needed for him to be able to exercise any supervision at all. I do not consider the proposal to be far-reaching enough, but limited progress is better than nothing. I wish Mr Söderman every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to convince people that the work of the Ombudsman is not just important, it is crucial to the proper integration of the European Union. Unfortunately, a great many of our fellow Members still do not know this. Luckily, these duties are being carried out by the experienced Mr Söderman, with his usual degree of enthusiasm for the job.</p>
<p class="contents">I drafted the report on the application of Community law and saw the huge problems caused by the poor application of Community law at first hand. This is not just a legal problem, it is also a social problem, because the society of European citizens malfunctions as a result, and it is a political problem, because it reflects how mature we are about the type of European legal order we want. At the same time, I saw the huge role played by the Ombudsman in ensuring that this legal order operates smoothly in the Community. I need only remind you that most infringements of Community law are only discovered as the result of the complaints system.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make in connection with the regulatory role of the Ombudsman is that the right of complaint and petition is tending to develop into a conciliation procedure for resolving differences amicably, which is the only way of settling differences flexibly and cheaply and freeing up the Court of the European Communities. However, first of all we must do everything humanly possible to find a way of cutting down the time taken to complete the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close by pointing out that we need a generally applicable code of conduct on general principles and that individual organisations should only have their own code of conduct on matters which relate specifically to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The institution of the Ombudsman is very important, and it is important that we should all constantly keep an eye on it and ensure that it can thrive, in the light of the new developments too. The Ombudsman himself stated that there is a gulf between the EU and its citizens. We do a lot of talking about it, but in reality we bring about very few radical steps to change the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the reasons why people cannot fathom the EU system is also, of course, the utterly hopeless way in which we have organised ourselves, with a physical presence in Luxembourg, Brussels and Strasbourg, and I think one might well ask whether it is particularly appropriate for the Ombudsman to be located here in Strasbourg, though this is, of course, also partly due to the Ombudsman’s own decision. I do not think it is appropriate. I think it means that the Ombudsman is very easily sidelined in relation to the EU’s other institutions which he has, of course, to inspect but then also to reform, and I am inclined to think that it might go some way towards creating further conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would go on to specify a couple of specific areas. The first is the White Paper. The Ombudsman himself touched upon this. I think this is a very good example of a situation in which, as Mr Prodi pointed out the other day, the fact that the Ombudsman does not associate with the Commission on a daily basis means that he is not mentioned at all in the White Paper, as it would otherwise have been only natural for him to have been. The other thing I should like to say is that I think, in fact, that there are too few complaints. I am well aware that the Ombudsman is pressed for time, but I cannot understand why there are not more complaints, considering the huge institutional apparatus with which we are concerned here. The third very important point is that the Ombudsman has made an effort to obtain ombudsmen for the candidate countries. It is, of course, extremely important that, when the new candidate countries come on board, we also make sure they understand the nature of good administrative behaviour, seeing that they do not of course, in reality, have any special experience of our way of administering matters. Fourthly, I am very pleased that the Ombudsman has addressed the subject of the e-mail system and that he is doing some energetic work on this so that we obtain real complaints and not only junk complaints. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I particularly welcome the proposed change relating to the status of documents emanating from Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Committee on Petitions and elsewhere, we are running into difficulties on this question: to whom does information belong? It is crucial that the Ombudsman should have the widest possible access and I agree with comments made by colleagues concerning the need for greater openness. I only regret that we did not pursue this issue more fully in the Parliament's own debate on access to sensitive documents.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Perry's report is also important, especially in its definition of an institution and the emphasis on the willingness to be helpful and to communicate. Other civil services could well learn from this and I also welcome the extension of non-discrimination in his proposed Amendment No 11 to Article 5. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is on the right lines, and it is very gratifying to read that the Ombudsman has obtained the documents he asked for. I hope this practice will rub off on the rest of the EU system, for that is the way it should be. Only through openness do we ensure that it is possible to combat fraud and irregularities and that politicians have a better image in the eyes of the population. We might well have had more use for the Ombudsman in relation to a case in Britain in which Lloyd's cheated thousands of people, an event which led to a long list of tragedies in the form of suicides and much else besides. We see a lack of openness in the British government, the Council and the Commission, and it would be useful if the Ombudsman could give us further help on this issue. I believe that the Committee on Petitions should have greater powers. It is perhaps one of the most important committees, for it is here that the ordinary person within the EU system can come to raise matters. It is therefore also incredibly important that there should be a powerful committee which can help him when he does just that.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that when I heard my fellow MEP’s, Mr Krarup’s, speech, I was very surprised indeed. Naturally, there were the snide remarks that are bound to come from an opponent but, knowing Mr Krarup as I do, what we have here is proof that he loves this system and really thinks it is fantastically good. It is just that he does not really want to say so. I believe then that, somewhere along the line, even Mr Krarup will say that we need the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has made it possible for me to discuss with you issues of an institutional nature which are important to the efficient operation of the European Union. In particular, they are important to our relations with the citizens, and we do need to bring the Union’s institutions as close to the citizens as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to turn first to the Bösch report, the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2000. Allow me to say once again how much the Commission appreciates the excellent work undertaken by the European Ombudsman’s office, and how grateful it is for it. The Ombudsman himself, Mr Söderman, deserves particular recognition. He is the driving force and is largely responsible for the results and beneficial effects achieved by this new institution of the European Ombudsman. It has to be said that the citizens of Europe are daily becoming more familiar with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Ombudsman’s work focuses on poor administration and the Commission is bound to improve its administration and the quality of services provided for the benefit of the citizens. In this context, the Commission shares the concerns expressed by the rapporteur. In particular, it agrees with the need to receive the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions as positively as possible, and provide them with every facility required.</p>
<p class="contents">One aspect of the Bösch report of particular concern to us is the follow-up to critical comments. Last year, we, in the Commission, set up a new procedure for methodical review of the conclusions to be drawn from the cases dealt with by the Ombudsman. As I see it, we have definitely improved as far as study, approval and consequently cooperation with the Ombudsman are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to refer to two examples to illustrate such follow-up. Firstly, further to the Ombudsman’s initiative, the Commission agreed to make the scripts of candidates in competitive examinations available to them as of 1 July 2000. Ladies and gentlemen, these are not empty words but actual facts. I venture to suggest that some of you should keep a closer eye on what is actually happening.</p>
<p class="contents">You have levelled some serious criticisms at the Commission. It is only fair to criticise the Commission when it acts inappropriately. In my view however, constant criticism, targeting the Commission’s work just for the sake of it, is entirely unhelpful. It does not promote the Commission, the institutions as a whole or the idea of Europe amongst the citizens. Criticism should be voiced when it is called for. We shall work towards improvements across the board. Furthermore, we shall take all critical comments into account and study, analyse and assess them.</p>
<p class="contents">Another example I should like to refer to concerns the citizens’ right to freedom of expression and lifting the age limit for staff recruitment. The Commission is inclined, for example, to offer its political support here. However, these issues go beyond our competence and impact on other institutions too. For instance, an interinstitutional agreement is required to amend the maximum age at which staff can be recruited. We do endorse and accept the view expressed and are prepared to discuss the matter with the other institutions. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether the latter will endorse Mr Söderman’s approach. As I said, we totally support it.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now move on to Mr Perry’s report on the code of good administrative conduct. Mr Perry has highlighted how these codes of good conduct are crucially important in guaranteeing a high quality service to European citizens. They constitute an important tool for us, as we strive to turn the right to good administration enshrined in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights into an operational guide for the staff of the European institutions. The Commission therefore warmly welcomed the study undertaken by the European Ombudsman into the existence of such codes. Furthermore, the Commission worked closely with Mr Söderman in drawing up the code of good administrative conduct. The latter is now complete and contains a great many of his suggestions and contributions. It would not be fair to say that all his ideas have been included but most certainly have. Once again, I should like to thank Mr Söderman for his unfailingly positive approach and for always making helpful suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken full account of the provisions contained in the Ombudsman’s draft code amongst the various other codes adopted by European institutions and bodies. Indeed, the Commission’s code approximates most closely to the model put forward by the Ombudsman. This is not only because of its content and legal nature, but also because it is binding on our officials.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wanted to urge you not to confuse issues, ladies and gentlemen. The White Paper on good governance stands for much more than administrative reform. Administrative reform is already under way and is Commissioner Kinnock’s responsibility. To date, this House has agreed with the Commission that much has already been achieved in that respect. We must carry the administrative reform through. We are quite determined to do so. Mr Kinnock is working very hard to that end, but it is a different issue, quite separate from good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, the White Paper on good governance stands for much more than administrative reform. It aims to establish how best to gather, bring together and integrate the various links in the chain of responsibility within our complex society. This is a problem not only for the European institutions but for all our countries, all advanced democracies. Society is becoming ever more complex, the technological means allowing information to flow more freely are increasingly widespread, and new possibilities are opening up. In addition, the way in which citizens organise themselves is daily becoming more complex.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the significance of the White Paper. It puts all this in the context of the interplay between the European institutions. That amounts to far more than administrative reform. Consequently, administrative reform should not be confused with the White Paper on good governance being drawn up by the Commission under President Prodi’s guidance.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make it very clear to Mr Perry that the Commission agrees with him and with Mr Söderman on how unfortunate it is that such a wide range of codes of varying legal status are currently in place. This does nothing for consistency or legal clarity. It should however be borne in mind as Mr Perry suggests in his report, that it would be wise to consider the results of the codes of good conduct implemented or approved recently. In the Commission’s case, this was ten months ago. As for the Council, it was just before the summer, in July. In our view therefore it is still too early to draw conclusions on the implementation of these codes of good conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall start work on a report at the end of the current year. The report will refer in particular to the Commission’s own code of good conduct which will by then have been in place for a year. As soon as sufficient information becomes available, the Commission will consider whether or not to prepare a legislative proposal for a horizontal regulation. We need to have more information available so we do not at present have a position on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Mrs Almeida Garrett’s report, I have to say that from an institutional point of view it is undoubtedly the most sensitive. I shall only refer to it briefly however, because pursuant to Article 195 of the Treaty the Commission is only competent to give an opinion, and the latter is not binding. Nonetheless, I feel it is important to make our view known.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, Mrs Almeida Garrett deserves to be congratulated on her excellent work. I have also had the opportunity to speak on the subject at the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and to emphasise how well the present statute has worked.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stated earlier, the Commission has followed up investigations launched by the Ombudsman. The code of good conduct is but one example of this. In general, the Commission provides a constructive response and complies with the timetable for supplying information to the Ombudsman. I am grateful to Mr Söderman for highlighting this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has tabled three amendments. Regarding lifting the secrecy classification for access to files, I have already explained that the Commission has not resorted to this in any of the twenty requests for access submitted by the Ombudsman. We could certainly succumb to the temptation of bringing the law into line with reality and go along with the position adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. On the other hand, given that everything has worked well, we might also query whether it is really necessary to amend this point.</p>
<p class="contents">We should always err on the side of caution when dealing with delicate matters, given the Commission’s role and the nature of the issues it is dealing with at present. Indeed, the latter will become increasingly delicate and varied as the building of Europe proceeds.</p>
<p class="contents">We might also encounter problems with the governments of Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The structure of the European Union, based as it is on three pillars, means that the function of the Commission and also that of Parliament itself varies depending on the pillar in question. The Commission will therefore deal with these matters in greater detail in the opinion to be given and put to Parliament in the near future, once a final position on the text approved has been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the deletion of the principle according to which when officials give evidence they speak as representatives of their administration, the Commission does not wish to be dogmatic, but we do feel that it is important for officials not to speak simply as individuals. Rather, they should put forward the details and explanations pertaining to matters they are responsible for. For the rest, they should comply with what is required of them under their statutes. Further, I should like to emphasise that as a former Member of Parliament, let alone a Commissioner, I fully endorse the position of the rapporteur, Mrs Almeida Garrett, regarding the differences between political and administrative responsibilities and the European Parliament’s responsibility concerning political responsibilities, the responsibilities of Commissioners and indeed not only Commissioners but members of other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards access to documents emanating from the Member States it would be appropriate, as I said earlier, to be consistent with the new Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 on public access to documents. The principle of obtaining prior consent from the Member State is provided for under Article 4 Paragraph 5 of the Regulation, and in the framework agreement with Parliament. Declaration 35 annexed to the Final Act of the Treaty of Amsterdam serves a similar purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs once again. I must also say how very grateful I am to Mr Söderman for his work. It is most helpful to us because after all, criticism encourages us to improve and also offers solutions. That has to be borne in mind. We have already made progress regarding the code of good conduct, infringement procedures, and officials’ freedom, to name but a few examples. I venture to suggest in this context that many things are open to criticism, because nothing is perfect. When, however, one fails to go deeper and criticism is unfounded, it runs the risk of losing its value or at the very least, proving less effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly there was the question of hearing Commissioners as witnesses and the problem that arose in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs where people felt that there might be a difficulty in drawing a line between the political control of the European Parliament, the political responsibility of Commissioners and the administrative responsibility of the same Commissioners. Many Members of the Constitutional Affairs Committee thought that this was very difficult to solve. It is very important to understand that the Commission is the executive body and in theory it is the administration of the Union which has contact with the citizen. Of course the Commissioners have administrative functions. We have had a few complaints in this connection and the Commissioners have always replied very correctly. Therefore to avoid further debate and confusion in this matter, this could be deleted from the proposal and, as the rapporteur said, one day an answer in writing might not be necessary. I would like to stress that OLAF has the right to hear the Commissioners and that was the inspiration for my proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly on the question of all documents. The idea that the Ombudsman has the right to see all documents is because the citizens do not have this access. Trust in the Ombudsman's work is based on the fact that the citizens accept that they cannot have access to all documents but they need to know that the Ombudsman has the right if necessary. This is the basis of their confidence in the Ombudsman's operations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is sometimes feared that the Ombudsman might get hold of state secrets. Having been an ombudsman now for twelve years, I have never in a case of maladministration had to ask for documents on really secret matters. I am not aware of any case in which an ombudsman has leaked documents. The principle must, however, be in place that the Ombudsman has the right to see documents. We have had some problems of interpretation here and we have lost time on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi asked for a debate on the White Paper and this is what I have tried to start. It is very important that the White Paper is discussed because there is still one run to go. I would hope for some more concrete proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the criticism about the low number of complaints, publicising the work of the Ombudsman institutions, and the many complaints outside the mandate. First of all our mandate lies entirely within the European Union. Citizens may find this difficult to understand when they encounter problems with Community law. They go to a Parliament Information Office or Commission Representation, get our form and complain to us. We try to rectify the situation. There is the possibility that this limits the number of complaints but the number has been increasing over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of publicising the Ombudsman's work, I would mention that we are more known than many ombudsmen on the national stage and Members of Parliament can surely do a lot to tell citizens about the right to petition and the right of complaint to the Ombudsman. After all it is you who meet the Europeans out there. It is you who have the contact with the public. If you tell people about the possibilities then they will become much better known. Many of you have done that and I am grateful.</p>
<p class="contents">I am really honoured that I had the possibility to discuss these matters. I am very grateful for the comments made by Mrs de Palacio and all of you here and thank you very much for your work.</p>

This is because I am one of those firmly convinced of the value of the European Parliament’s Committee on Petitions for society at large.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason is that the system enabling citizens to present petitions is the most direct channel available to Europeans when it comes to denouncing the loopholes still remaining in Community legislation. It is also invaluable for highlighting cases where commitments resulting from directives and regulations already adopted are flagrantly disregarded either because the latter are not being implemented or because they have simply not been transposed.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the European Ombudsman has a key role to play in this great task. It has also been a matter of great personal satisfaction for me to note the high degree of consensus between members of the Committee during debates and votes.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures speak for themselves. All sixteen conclusions in the report were adopted by unanimity. The same was true of the five amendments tabled following minor adjustments in the interests of compromise. Accordingly, I should like to thank the entire Committee and its secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are already familiar with the content of the report, ladies and gentlemen, I shall only refer to what I consider to be its most innovative features. For instance, the European citizens’ right to petition, which as I see it is a fundamental right, is extended to include natural or legal residents, together with those who have registered in a Member State. There is also the recommendation that in future debates this fundamental right should be ascribed the importance due to it, and that it should be included in the possible convention on the building of Europe. Further, it is clearly necessary to grant the Committee on Petitions the status it deserves, given its social importance resulting from direct contact between individuals and the institution.</p>
<p class="contents">This must come about, because something has to be done to break down the barriers between the people and the remote European institutions highlighted by all the surveys undertaken. One way forward might well be to encourage more own initiative reports, particularly concerning issues on which the citizens appear to be particularly anxious to be more closely involved with the institutions. It also seems reasonable to try and devise ways to carry through legislative initiatives stemming from civil society itself. They are usually indicative of serious shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">All this serves to highlight once again the legitimacy of this Committee’s right to have access to all relevant interinstitutional documentation. Indeed, this is essential if the Committee is to undertake its important task effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection it is only fair to mention the ongoing help received from both the Commission and the Ombudsman. Their support is invaluable and much appreciated. Unfortunately, the same is not true of the Council. It remains conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, at this stage the citizens need to become far more aware of the petitions system. This could be achieved through programmes aimed at informing and educating or more specifically, through information technology. User-friendly guidebooks are needed. This is an outstanding task. Apathy on the part of certain public authorities at all levels, community, national, regional or local has been detected all too often when it comes to finding fair solutions to the problems arising.</p>
<p class="contents">Some reaction to this negative situation is called for. At the very least, we should appeal to the President of the House to ensure that, if appropriate, publicity could be given to this reluctance to tackle problems and flagrant injustices which continue to afflict certain sectors of ordinary European society.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to draw attention to the considerable importance attached to maximising personal contact between petitioners and the European Parliament through the Committee on Petitions, so as to ensure that the Committee’s work bears good fruit. I should also like to express our appreciation of the splendid service provided by the European Parliament’s Directorate-General for Research and by STOA. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to him our colleagues can be aware of the expectations of the citizens of the Union and therefore of the task of the Committee on Petitions.</p>
<p class="contents">The situations in which petitioners find themselves are often Kafkaesque. That is what comes out of reading some of the cases mentioned by Mr Camisón: whether they are problems of recognition of qualifications, discrimination, payment, or withdrawal of vehicle registration, the complexity is such and the obstacles so clear that citizens feel completely powerless.</p>
<p class="contents">The combined work of our Committee and the European Commission means that, by dealing with the problems, what is felt to be injustice can be corrected. The Committee on Petitions can go further, however. It can involve citizens in drawing up Community rules.</p>
<p class="contents">On 13 June, I had the honour of putting a report on silicone implants to the vote in Parliament. This report is an example of the use, which is unfortunately all too rare, of paragraphs 1 and 4 of Article 175 of the Rules of Procedure, which says in particular that the committee responsible may decide to draw up reports on the petitions that it has declared to be admissible and, if necessary, to put motions for resolutions to the vote in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the case for the report for which I was responsible. It was following two petitions collecting more than 1000 signatures that this report was undertaken. But it was only the second time since the Committee on Petitions was created that a resolution adopted by Parliament resulted from direct complaints from citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As advocated by Paragraph 18 of Mr Camisón’s report, in this case our Committee called on STOA to make a scientific analysis of the problems encountered by petitioners. Increased use of Article 175, an idea that is defended by the rapporteur, should enable our Committee to make a direct link between citizens’ problems and all the Members of the European Parliament. In my view, this is a political recognition of truly listening to citizens and it is one of the paths for the future for the Committee on Petitions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The work of the Committee on Petitions has often led to a successful conclusion for the citizen concerned and has in some cases resulted in changes to national law and practice in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The areas that present the greatest difficulties to individuals and groups of citizens continue to be social protection, healthcare, taxation and recognition of academic qualifications, particularly for citizens who work in states other than their own Member States, such as in border regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental complaints are also made on major developments where it is felt that their impact on the environment and the livelihoods of people in the areas affected is being ignored by the developers and in some cases by the authorities concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been many successes. For instance, an Irish petitioner with a UK higher institute teaching qualification was refused the right to apply for a post in a state school. The Commission took up this case on behalf of the petitioner and the Committee on Petitions and eventually won the case, having met strong resistance from the German authorities. That is the kind of success that can be achieved by the Committee on Petitions and we need more resources if the Committee on Petitions is to do its work effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware that it is not one of the most influential committees in the House, and that not everyone appreciates it fully. Nonetheless, the work of this Committee does represent one of the few channels allowing us to establish direct contact with the citizens and bring the institutions closer to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I entirely agree with Mr Camisón Asensio’s report. I believe it reflects the concerns of those of us who are most closely involved with the Committee’s work. We shall therefore vote in favour of it. I should however like to highlight some of the everyday practical problems we encounter…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption by Mr Marinos)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I do apologise, Mr Marinos. I was saying that we work well in the Committee on Petitions and that our work is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I was hoping to highlight some of the everyday problems we encounter. Firstly, we enjoy a good relationship with the European Commission. The European Commission and the Ombudsman work closely with the Committee on Petitions. The opposite is true as far as the Council is concerned. We do not cooperate with it at all, yet the Council could have something to say on a good many petitions and we very much regret it is always absent. That is our first problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem I would like to mention concerns swift and decisive action on petitions. I am very involved in the Committee on Petitions’ work on environmental issues. That is quite logical, as I also sit on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. It is often the case with environmental problems that if it takes a long time for a response to be received, the decisions taken in a particular country prompting the petition have had an irreversible impact on the natural environment by then. The petitioners lose patience. That therefore is another problem. Responses need to be swifter and more efficient. I am well aware that Member States are conscious of the fact that delaying responses can facilitate their political decisions. That is sometimes the case. It is not entirely the Commission’s fault. The Member States take a long time to respond.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, the Committee on Petitions is very important to me. It is however lacking in human, legal – and here I am addressing our own institution of course – and technical resources, and it does need them.</p>
<p class="contents">One of Mr Camisón Asensio’s proposals seems to me to be entirely appropriate. It would mean that in cases of lengthy delay in responding to the citizens, the President of Parliament would be requested to publicise the delay and its negative consequences for the petitioners. After all, the latter have enough to do familiarising themselves with Community legislation and assembling the documentation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I do believe that work needs to be done to educate and inform citizens of their right to petition, because this is one of their rights. I recall that in the previous legislature it was even proposed to do away with the Committee on Petitions and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. For myself, I wish both Committees a great future in this House as they do at least bring the citizens closer to our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I merely wish to highlight the inexcusable fact that the Committee on Petitions is still being rudely ignored by the Council of Ministers, none of whom – not so much as a representative – has ever wanted to work with us.</p>
<p class="contents">Why would they? European citizens generally take recourse to the Committee on Petitions precisely in order to complain about infringements or omissions by ministers and their services, when they are wronged or when their protest or complaint is ignored. That is precisely why the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman have become the refuge of those who believe that they have been wronged or who, as civic-minded citizens, are trying to do something about infringements, injustice or the destruction of the environment. That is why the European Parliament needs to pay greater attention to the Committee on Petitions and to give it more scope for efficient intervention. It is true that the Committee works closely with us but it often comes up against the indifference and filibustering of national services. As a result, cases drag on interminably, to the disappointment of the European citizens seeking our support.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Camisón Asensio report quite rightly says that short, mandatory deadlines need to be introduced for dealing with petitions more quickly. At the same time, we need a procedure for publicising complaints and the inertia or filibustering of the authorities against which the complaint has been made in the petitioner's country. This will give citizens the only weapon which the guilty authorities fear: publicity which exposes them to the voters.</p>
<p class="contents">A proposal which, if adopted, would I think be hugely important: we need, subject to certain requirements, to introduce an injunctions procedure so that an immediate stop can be put to any incipient infringements of Community law which threaten to wreak irreparable damage on the natural environment or our cultural heritage. Because the time-consuming procedure up to final judgment by the European Court is bereft of any material value if the damage has already been done and cannot be reversed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also would like to thank the European Ombudsman who carries on the fight in defence of the citizens from his observation post. We are working together, of course, and we too are working for the citizens of Europe, because they have a champion in this Parliament, the most authoritative institution in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to the European Commission’s particular sensitivity, as demonstrated by the preparation behind the officers’ explanations of their reports in the Committee on Petitions, we have made great progress. However, more and more European citizens are presenting petitions on personal, social and environmental problems. It is our duty give them increasingly relevant, detailed, and satisfying responses.</p>
<p class="contents">Their petitions illuminate the path the Union still has to travel to ensure peace of mind for our citizens. Of course we do not want dull and amorphous standardisation in the European Union, rather we think above all that cultural differences should be harmonised by turning those differences into the true wealth of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have entered a season of reform, defence and strengthening of the institution of petitions and we believe that season of reform will give us the power to defend the citizens and, at the same time, make the European institutions better known to our ever-growing population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate Mr Camisón Asensio on his report. In it he emphasises how petitions allow the citizens to make their legitimate aspirations known and also draw attention to the inherent weaknesses of Community legislation. The Commission is interested in your work on both these counts, ladies and gentlemen. As an outside observer, allow me to reiterate what I said earlier to Mrs González. I believe that the Committee on Petitions in this House does serve to bring the citizens closer to the institutions in general. The same is true of similar committees in other Parliaments I am acquainted with, for instance in my own country’s parliament, with which I am most familiar. They play a key part precisely in bringing the citizens closer to the institutions in general. They are also invaluable to the work of Members themselves, making them aware of issues a significant number of citizens feel are sensitive and worthy of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">This last year, not only have the Commission’s services cooperated with this Committee, but we Commissioners have also made it our business to cooperate actively with you, ladies and gentlemen. I would therefore like to thank Mr Gemelli for his remark. It is certainly the case that Mr Kinnock, Mr Liikanen, Mrs Wallström and Mr Bolkestein have contributed to your work. They have come in person to discuss and explain issues. They have tried to adduce reasons, possibilities or solutions to concerns expressed by the Committee on Petitions further to requests or complaints by citizens. This proves how much we in the Commission value your work, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I should like to reiterate what I said earlier. The Commission will respond in as open and constructive a manner as possible to your desire for strengthened cooperation. I appreciate that the time it sometimes takes for us to respond to a query is a problem. Nonetheless, I am sure the House is aware that on most if not all occasions when problems were experienced they arose because the Commission was dependent on a Member State for information.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to deal with different administrations. The only way we can obtain certain types of information from Member States is by exerting political pressure. There are no other means at our disposal. The Commission brings pressure to bear in the same way as you do, ladies and gentlemen. We publicise the fact that the Member State in question has failed to respond to a query or is hindering a response by the Commission. I can only promise that the Commission will continue to urge Member States to act on queries as quickly as possible, supplying the information requested. We will then be able to respond appropriately to the concerns raised by you. In that sense we shall endeavour to continue cooperating fully with the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a little late, but I am still going to attempt it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first of all like to point out that this is the second time that we have been consulted on this issue. In the previous legislature, Parliament gave its opinion on the Commission’s proposals on the simplification of vertical directives on sugar, honey, fruit juices, milk and jams. The Council took a great deal of time to finalise the case and finally made significant changes to the Commission’s initial proposals. This is why we are being consulted again today.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore remind you that the idea was to simplify the directives. The point of view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is certainly compatible with this objective, but it also consists of not abandoning quality requirements in the name of simplification, and above all not compromising on good consumer information. All the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, a large proportion of which came from the rapporteur, have this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the consensus in the Council obviously limits our room for manoeuvre, as we are simply being consulted, that is to say that following our vote today, the Council will, at the end of the day, be completely free to decide. Nevertheless, I think that the amendments succeed in improving the texts from the point of view that I just specified: quality of products and correct consumer information.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to review the various directives in order to give the main elements of them. First of all, on sugars, there is a small problem of definition. The Council, quite rightly, has defined a sugar that is being increasingly used, fructose, but it failed to give a definition of what it calls brown sugar. Parliament’s amendment therefore asks for a definition in the texts. A deadline needs to be imposed, but the Commission needs to propose a definition. That seems elementary.</p>
<p class="contents">The second case, that of honey. This is a sensitive case insofar as honey is a high quality product, usually produced on a small scale, with which there have been many marketing problems in previous years, inasmuch as we often see mixtures of honeys and also honeys coming onto the European Union market whose quality is not guaranteed. We therefore need to be vigilant on definitions and labelling. The Commission proposes adding a new category of honey, filtered honey. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes that we do not accept this proposal, as filtered honey is in fact a honey whose floral origin cannot be checked. Most of the time it has lost the pollen that allows this to be checked, which prevents the product from being well defined and goes against a guarantee of quality for consumers. We therefore propose that we do not accept this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to harmful substances that may be found in honey for industry or baker’s honey, we think that it should be forbidden for them to be present in honey. We are of course talking about lower quality honeys, which are used as raw materials in certain preparations in the agricultural and food industry, but there is no question of accepting the presence of harmful substances. There is therefore an amendment from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The third case, that of fruit juices. I think that the majority of the amendments are aimed not at making major changes to the proposal from the Commission and the Council, but rather at clarifying the texts and preventing them from going off course. I will explain: we do not feel that a non-exhaustive list of treatments and substances authorised for production, as it is envisaged, is satisfactory. A positive list should be given. We therefore ask the Commission to put forward, within a certain period, a positive list of filtration adjuvants, precipitation agents and absorption adjuvants. A positive list means that substances that are not on the list are forbidden. We think that this is clearer, in the end, and more positive for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">An amendment also asks for fungicides not to be used to preserve fruits to be used to make juices, but for only preservation by chilling to be permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the fourth case, that of milk, there are no proposals for modification. We think that the text proposed to us is quite satisfactory. For jams, I personally reintroduced an amendment that was not accepted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but which I hold to. It concerns not accepting the general use of a chemical flavouring in jams and marmalades, that is vanillin. It does not strictly do anything apart from altering the taste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of those proposals was to simplify the existing legislation, which contains far too much detail, or to replace it by directives containing only the essential requirements. In that way, they would be easier to implement and better correspond to the horizontal directives. This is a commendable effort which is in line with the expectations of both consumers and those who are involved in other ways. We, the PPE-DE Group, are keen to lend our support in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">We have established that the Directive on cocoa and chocolate products, which also originally formed part of this package and which had to undergo the lengthiest legislative procedure, namely that of co-decision, was the first one we managed to complete. As for the five other directives of the package of seven, the five we are debating today, we will ultimately require more than five years to complete the simplification procedure. We do wonder if we should not aspire to faster working methods and other decision-making methods, for we do not believe that that is what the public wants.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work. The delay is certainly not due to him, but due to the fact that the Council has fundamentally changed certain components, thus necessitating fresh advice from us. On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I can say that we are in agreement with the report as it emerged from the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. That is the case for all components of the package, except for fruit juices. On these, our view differs slightly from that in the report, but that was also apparent in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I do not believe, therefore, that I need to go into any more detail here regarding the reasoning, motives and strands of thought behind that difference of view.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not want to conceal the fact – and I should like to devote the rest of my speaking time to this – that we in our group, further to these issues arising, have held a serious debate on the issue of whether it is really up to a Parliament to discuss such detailed measures with 626 Members. This is creating problems for us. Parliament is being slated for this from outside. That does not mean that we underestimate the importance of food legislation. We realise that the detail is important in this connection, but we do wonder whether, with the material being at such a high technical level, we really are the people best placed to take the decisions and whether we should inconvenience 626 MEPs with these kinds of far-reaching, technical measures. The question we asked ourselves is: should we not move towards two kinds of derived legislation, one on which Parliament deliberates and another which, surely, should be entrusted to the executive? This discussion has certainly not reached its conclusion, but I should welcome a discussion which includes groups other than the PPE-DE Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have been referred back to us simply because there are some changes to the comitology procedure. I note with satisfaction that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has no objections to the revised procedure. It is, however, proposing new textual changes to the draft directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the directives is to simplify rules governing composition and labelling. We should therefore avoid complicating matters. Political agreement has been reached on this issue after long and arduous negotiations and we should therefore avoid reopening the negotiations at all costs. I agree with changes that add clarity to texts but do not change the substance. One case in point is the inclusion of the definition of brown sugar. This would be an added protection for consumers. In relation to fruit juices, the proposed changes to the treatments and substances would be more appropriate within the horizontal legislation governing these treatments. The suggestion to introduce three new product names for fruit juices is not in line with proposals currently under discussion on the Codex. Furthermore, they will only serve to reopen the entire debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that substantial changes, if adopted by this House, will achieve anything. They will only serve to delay the procedure. If that happens, it is the consumers who will be the losers in the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we then turn to purely technical aspects such as those addressed by Mr Lannoye, the complications increase. We find ourselves in agreement with his report, except for the point raised by Mr Thyssen.</p>
<p class="contents">However the point I want to make is not about the actual merit of the report, but rather about an evaluation that this Parliament needs to carry out over the next few months on the future legislative method. We also found certain points in this report where we have either aggravated the situation or intervened in legislation already dealt with in the course of the last two months, and here I am thinking, for example, of problems relating to water. Coordinated production of legislation can, I think, only be helpful to this institution. Another aspect I want to bring up is the excessive regulation to which we subject our legislative process, which is not reflected in our Member States. In the Member States a whole series of areas are dealt with through the method of circulars.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the report we drew up last year with the Commission, we will have to think very carefully about those issues, because I do not think a consumer who is buying honey is immediately aware of whether it is honey produced in beehives or filtered honey, even if the label is clear. As our task is to be impartial and we need to produce legislation that is comprehensible to European citizens, perhaps further thought is necessary over the next few months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we are increasingly advocating information and clarification for consumers. Responsible, adult consumers, getting information from product labels, are meant to decide for themselves what they buy. Strict, clear, unambiguous regulations, the thinking behind which is clear to all, must be enacted. Descriptions such as ‘juice’, ‘fruit juice’, ‘nectar’, ‘fruit juice from concentrate’ or even ‘contains fruit’ make it difficult for consumers to assess a product's true quality or know how it was produced.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in 1975 that the Fruit Juice Directive first introduced consumers to the designation ‘fruit juice’ or reinforced it, and consumers have got used to it. ‘Fruit juice’ and ‘fruit juice from concentrate’ are in the final analysis one and the same product. The designation ‘fruit juice from concentrate’ refers only to the manufacturing process and not to the ingredients, which must of course be the same. The additional designation ‘with concentrates’ tends in my view to confuse. Product designations must be clearly defined, simple and comprehensible. We must prevent additional descriptions which are not absolutely necessary, as confusion is no protection for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the proposed Amendments Nos 18, 19 and 25 make the current legal position stricter in an unjustifiable way, particularly for the juice industry, and I believe they should be rejected. Fruit to be sold fresh in markets, in other words for consumption, may be treated with fungicides. Why, then, not fruit for juice production? In exactly the same way, the criteria of the EU Drinking Water Directive must suffice for the water which has to be used in the preparation of fruit juice. I would ask you therefore, ladies and gentlemen, to vote objectively and purposefully to set a directive on course which will help the consumer and which manufacturers will be able to implement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I share some of Mrs Thyssens' reservations about what we are being asked to do here and the degree of expertise with which we do it. Mr Lannoye knows he has my respect, but I have to say with some regret that I fear we are repeating some of the debating errors of the chocolate directive and the determination to rechristen some products.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lannoye's amendments have caused confusion in the name of purity when we come to the issue of honey. I agree with him about fruit juice and I certainly salute his motives. But there are a number of Member States which use filtered honey extensively to remove insect debris, grains of sand and pollen fragments. I have heard no convincing argument that this damage of the product adds unwanted material and indeed there are other amendments before us today which call for the removal of organic and inorganic material from some honeys. The Council had arrived at a sensible position on this and I have seen no evidence – and I have checked back with our own Food Standards Agency – that there are any legitimate concerns about content. There are other ways of tracing the origins of honey, as well as the pollen content to which the rapporteur has referred.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to look at what a number of Member States call ‘baker's honey’, which is to be redefined, if the rapporteur has his way, as ‘industrial honey’. There is no such thing. I would like to think this was an unwitting translation error but this derogatory phraseology is probably not accidental. By just putting a noun with an adjective you cannot always make sense. If I were to describe Mr Lannoye, whom I hold in esteem as an ‘industrial Belgian’, it would be a meaningless phrase. We should use a real description understood throughout the Community, not an invented one. This is not a product only fit to grease the wheels of industry. It is a product that people know and have confidence in and it is safe for consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s proposal is sound and does not require amendment. In particular, I welcome the double definition of juice from concentrate and fruit juice. It helps to keep the consumer better informed. Consequently I cannot support Amendment No 39, deleting the Commission’s text. I do support Amendment No 30 dealing with the subject in greater depth and referring back to Annex 1.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, I totally reject Amendments Nos 18, 19, 23 and 25. The first of these concerns a ban on the use of fungicides in treatments after gathering. It has to be borne in mind that fruit gathered in Europe is in principle destined for the fresh fruit trade. The decision on which fruit will be sold fresh and which will be processed is only taken following selection by quantity and size.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 97/41/EC has already set a maximum limit for residue in the case of fresh fruit, based on detailed studies to ensure consumer safety. I believe this Directive applies equally to juice, fresh fruit, juice produced in the home, or packaged juice. Treatment after gathering is required to guarantee optimum storage, transport and distribution conditions. I should like to reiterate what I said earlier. A substance may not be harmful in itself, it depends on the amount used. Regarding the quality of the water added to concentrates, Directive 98/93/EC refers to the quality of water for human consumption, including water used by the food industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 23 calls for a list of authorised substances to be drawn up. It does not make sense to specify additional substances over and above those referred to in Directives 89/109/EEC and 90/128/EEC on materials and objects liable to come into contact with foodstuffs. This would restrict the juice industry’s capacity to adjust quickly to technological developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They also involve a great deal of uncertainty. This report should achieve greater clarity, and Mr Lannoye has evidently put a great deal of effort into it. I believe, however, that too much exactitude and too many details can also be dangerous, and with this in mind I can only support what was said by Mrs Thyssen: here, and also in our work generally, we should distinguish more and more between political statements and technical considerations. We are also overstretched in many respects, not through our average IQ being so low, but simply because the specialised technical knowledge cannot be present, because simply too much is presupposed and we then also have difficulty at some point in deciding what is lobbying and what is meaningful activity. I also believe that we should be careful when deciding on the details of labels, so that we do not, through the sheer compulsion to regulate – as for example with fruit juices, where, however, we have now reached a compromise – end up leading the consumer astray with duplicated explanations and elucidations. If we carry on that way, even wines will soon have to carry their chemical composition on the label, and then the marketing of wine will no doubt be far less straightforward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to be able to thank all those who have contributed to reaching compromises – in the field of fruit juices, on the subjects of fungicides, water adulteration and the juice and concentrate issue, as well as on aromas – and hope that, in the problematic area of honey, it is impossible to conceal the product's origin.

The higher production costs associated with the effort and the quality guarantee must, however, be clearly acknowledged in labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">There are currently, depending on whether they are free of concentrate or made from concentrate, two major categories of fruit juices, each of which correspond to the nature of specific products and a particular production process. In terms of labelling, current practice does not enable consumers to clearly distinguish between these two categories. In order to remove this source of confusion in the mind of consumers as to the actual nature of the product that they are buying, the Finnish Presidency has proposed introducing two simple, clear and objective definitions. The term ‘fruit juice’ would be reserved for juices without concentrate, while, according to them, juices made from concentrate should be named for sale purposes in accordance with their characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, consumers looking for a more authentic and more natural product will easily be able to find it on the shelf under the clear name ‘fruit juice’, knowing that they are prepared to pay the price corresponding to the specific qualities associated with this product, while consumers inclined towards a more standardised and cheaper product will be able to turn with full knowledge of the facts towards a juice made from concentrate without any ambiguity about its nature and particular characteristics. We, think, Mr President, that defining these two categories of juice, corresponding to two different names, represents real progress in consumer information, and that is why we support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Along with previous speakers, we believe that the Council’s proposal represents definite progress because it establishes a clear distinction between fresh fruit juice and concentrated juice. This is a welcome development as it provides consumers with full information on two products with different characteristics produced in very different ways. We cannot therefore support any amendment aimed at blurring or doing away with the distinction established so clearly in the Council’s text.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, we cannot accept the amendments aimed at ending the use of fruit from the fresh market. This is what would result if we agreed to ban treatment after gathering. The use of this fruit makes it possible to provide the consumer with a healthy product, manufactured to high standards of quality and food safety. It is also a way of utilising surplus agricultural production so that large quantities are not allowed to rot and pollute the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we shall support the Council’s proposal and vote in its favour. In our view, the majority of the amendments tabled in committee do not serve to clarify or improve the situation. Instead, they cause further confusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These directives relate to sugars intended for human consumption, to honey, to fruit juices and similar products intended for human consumption, to certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption and to fruit jams, jellies and marmalades and chestnut purée intended for human consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the way that Parliament has kept to the guidelines given by the Council on comitology and has thereby agreed to replace the advisory committee procedure by the regulatory committee procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments to the Council's five drafts, the Commission notes that Parliament had been heard as early as 1996 on the corresponding proposals by the Commission and had adopted positions on them in the sittings of 14 January 1998 and 4 May 1999. Even though some of these amendments appear to me thoroughly sensible from the editorial or technical point of view, I regret however that I must point out that, as has been said, we are dealing here with Council drafts and not with original proposals by the Commission and that these amendments therefore apply to the Council drafts and not to the Commission's proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore, unfortunately, observe that the Commission cannot accept the amendments proposed in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Rule 148(3) requires a decision by Parliament. No such decision has been taken. I just wanted to know what happens to my objection now.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to point out that we decided yesterday to adopt the Commission proposal on which I reported. We then adopted a legislative resolution rejecting the Commission proposal. The services changed this in the Minutes to ‘approves the Commission proposal’. However, item 4 still contains a sentence which contradicts the first decision because it still says that the upper ceiling is to be maintained, which was something we rejected at the outset. Because of this contradiction in the current draft minutes, I have asked that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs should be instructed to look into the matter with a view to making a general amendment to the Rules of Procedure clarifying what happens when this sort of contradiction arises. I just wanted to point out that no decision has yet been taken on my objection to the minutes, as required under Article 148 (3). I assume that the Minutes have not been approved on this point and will not therefore be approved until a later date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Swoboda is making a mistake and I would ask you to consider it carefully. Parliament did indeed make a slightly contradictory decision yesterday, I repeat a slightly contradictory decision. We adopted the Commission proposal on the transit system by a clear majority of 303 votes to 253. The proposal says that the previous upper ceiling is to be abolished. Parliament approved this by a clear majority.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, item 4 has been included because of a <span class="italic">faux pas</span> by a number of colleagues. However, there is still no material contradiction here because we also call on the Commission in item 4 to maintain an upper ceiling until the ecopoint system expires. In other words, we clearly decided in the legislative act to adopt the Commission proposal. If the Council agrees, and I hope that it does, then all will be well. The second call in item 4 is a call for the Commission to reflect. What the Commission does in this case, whether it proposes a new upper ceiling or no upper ceiling, is up to the Commission. We did not, as you will see if you read the second clause, call for the old upper ceiling; we said the Commission might like to consider setting a new, reasonable upper ceiling. However, this <span class="italic">faux pas</span> was carried by a majority. All that means, however, is that the Commission has been asked to reflect and submit an opinion to Parliament once it has done so. Parliament's clear position was, is, and remains – and in this respect there is nothing to correct, Mr Swoboda – that we approved the Commission's position yesterday by a large majority and I should like to confirm as much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is absolutely essential to safeguard the interests of European haemophiliacs who rely, occasionally, on imported Factor VIII plasma products which may contain some donated and some sold blood from the United States. So this is absolutely essential, if we are not to put in jeopardy the lives of British and other haemophiliacs. It has the support of myself and Mrs Korhola.

At this point, as the first part has fallen because unfortunately I was not given a chance to speak, it is absolutely pointless to take the oral amendment, which related to the first part.

It has increasingly become the norm that ignoring this sign is rude and even unlawful. Such a regulation has meanwhile become known as an opt-out, whereby the recipients themselves must make it known that they do not wish to receive such mail. An opt-in, which requires an instruction that one <span class="italic">does</span> wish to receive commercial mail, would be preferable still. In the case of electronic communication, there is even more reason for having such an opt-in, for it would prevent consumers from being harassed by unwanted communications they receive and need to delete, and for which they also have to pay. Moreover, the e-mail system is also being weighed down by this deluge of advertising and is thus becoming unusable for reliable communications. The Commission is right to propose such an opt-in in Article 13. I am rather shocked by the view of the rapporteur, who appears to choose an opt-out which will only free consumers from the inconvenience after they have expressly lodged their protests. Furthermore, people have already had bad experiences with pledges from organisations which make their money through direct marketing. The protection of privacy, which the Directive is right to have as its objective, is seriously threatened by Mr Cappato’s view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I voted against both these reports. There is a great danger, first of all, in relation to the blanket retention of information on users. It raises serious questions about civil liberties. With cybercrime we have the situation where new forms of crime are being created. The lack of attention to civil liberties, the lack of attention to people's basic right to privacy is being overlooked. There is a great danger here that in future we will have a society where people are afraid to communicate and use modern technology because they know that their communications will be intercepted, listened to, and be in the hands of people who have no right to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Before we start looking at bringing in legislation in these areas we should first of all ensure that people's basic rights and civil liberties are protected. Both are enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the EU Treaties. The emphasis here is to use scare-tactic arguments such as the issue of paedophilia, terrorism, drugs or arms trafficking. These are issues which are very emotive. People are very willing to allow legislation to be put in place and oppressive measures to be brought in because they are concerned about these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that I voted against does not mean to say that I am not concerned about these issues. But first and foremost we must protect people's basic civil liberties as enshrined in international law. We should not overlook that. What kind of a society will we have if people's basic rights are overlooked in the combating of other crimes? There are a lot of similarities between the two.

Indeed, I am tempted by the thought of setting up a little business in somewhere sunny like a Carribean island from where I would spray unlimited emails into the EU from EU businesses in return for a nice fat fee. This business could not exist in the EU. The well-meaning EU, if it chooses 'Opt In', will do two harmful things : it will handicap EU-based businesses against their worldwide competitors, and it will transfer jobs outside the EU.

E-mail advertisements are, in general, an inconvenience for the consumer since it takes time, for example, to open and delete them. They also contribute to the spread of viruses on the Internet.

This is being seen for the first time now that a Swedish environmental study has shown that high brominated flame retardants, which were considered to be less dangerous than low brominated flame retardants, are also bioaccumulative, having been found in peregrine falcon eggs in Sweden. The study shows that the content of brominated flame retardants in eggs from wild peregrine falcons is 400 times higher than that in eggs from falcons kept in cages.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that low brominated flame retardants are bioaccumulative now that they have been found in birds, fish and mammals, but it was previously believed that high brominated flame retardants were not especially dangerous. High brominated flame retardants were thought to have larger molecules and thus to find it more difficult to penetrate the cell membranes of living organisms. This has now proved not to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a major health and environmental problem because many users replaced the high brominated flame retardants in products with low brominated ones, and the use of low brominated flame retardants such as decaBDEs accounts for 80 per cent of all flame retardants.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Greens therefore voted in favour of an immediate ban on the whole group of penta-, octa- and decaBDEs. This is required by the precautionary principle, given the new discoveries that have been made. A majority of Parliament chose to await the risk assessment that is at present under way in the case of decaBDEs. This means that tons of dangerous high-risk chemicals continue to be released into the environment, something which in our view is contrary to the intentions of the precautionary principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Everyone agrees in deploring, quite rightly, the shortage of blood and plasma within the European Union while stressing the fact that under no circumstances should we relax our vigilance regarding the quality of these products, so much so that the European Union’s requirements are half covered by imports!</p>
<p class="contents">This directive, amended by Parliament, modifies, integrates and completes the legislation that currently governs quality and safety standards in Europe for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components. It is about adopting stricter requirements regarding the admissibility of donors and practical screening of them, as well as putting in place a quality system at Community level in blood transfusion establishments. This would all be completed by an equivalent testing and approval system in the Member States. Finally, common standards would be defined for staff training and for the traceability of blood from donor to patient.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, these measures will not prevent the Member States from maintaining or establishing stricter protection measures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also desirable to reduce the European Union’s dependence on imports of blood or blood components from third countries. In order to do that, information campaigns need to be aimed at potential donors. But under no circumstances should we envisage a system of payment for these products. The European Parliament report rightly stresses the importance of the voluntary nature of blood donation while accepting that the social contribution made by donors and the commendable nature of the donations that they make should be highlighted.</p>

It is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons of subsidiarity, I would certainly value a greater role for national competition authorities in the implementation of the competition rules. However, it should not undermine the standard application of these. That would not only lead to uncertainty for businesses, it would also lead to discrepancies in competitiveness between one Member State and another.</p>
<p class="contents">The national authorities need clear guidelines in order to rule out different interpretations. It is too precarious at this stage to carve up responsibilities among different authorities. The most appropriate authority could be the authority on whose territory the most important effects make themselves felt, but also the authority that has been monitoring the situation for a good while.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur gets to the heart of the matter when he asks for the proposal to be further developed for the benefit of legal certainty. Despite the demarcation of powers, the Commission is responsible for safeguarding standard application in the event of effects being felt from one State to another.</p>
<p class="contents">Set against the Commission’s authoritative powers, a strengthening of the rights of defence would be appropriate. In this connection, the question arises as to whether the Commission could indicate how the companies’ need for a prompt, EU-wide statement can be met.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for legal certainty is not only a matter of further development by the Commission. The European Institute of Public Administration recently indicated that, in many cases, there is simply too little case law available to draw on<a href="#def_6_2" name="ref_6_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It is therefore inherent in the current state of European competition law itself that major legal risks cannot be ruled out. Before the proposed reform can take place, the Commission must lay a foundation in the form of guidelines, or legislation which safeguards legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">In this perspective, the concept of core tasks for the Commission and implementing tasks for the national authorities is worth further consideration. Just and decentralised application will prove its worth, certainly following enlargement.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Lest any doubts remain that the Commission is seeking to renationalise policy, it has tabled Article 3 of the regulation, which guarantees the primacy of Community law over national law, in other words, the implementation by national authorities and courts of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of fact, throughout the Commission proposal runs the blatant desire to increase its powers, as Article 7 shows clearly, which the European Parliament report, nevertheless, seeks to limit. What remains, however, is this haste on the part of the Commission to reformulate competition policy before enlargement, thereby increasing both its powers of intervention and supranationality.</p>

The economies of most of those states are weak in comparison with those of the current Member States. It is not to be expected that these new Member States will swiftly change over to the euro as their own legal currency. In those states, the euro can at best acquire the position of a second currency, additional to the national currency and involved in an ever-fluctuating exchange rate battle. In those countries, the euro will at best be the currency for the rich and foreigners and have a role similar to that of the American dollar in many countries. The result of the enlargement will therefore be that the number of Member States which are eligible for financial support for their balance of payments will rise sharply. I am therefore not in favour of the simultaneous cut in the maximum level of loans to be allocated, from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion. The Commission has still not made a concrete proposal for the way in which the new Member States can participate. I do, however, agree that responsibility for the management of the loaning mechanism should be transferred from the European Central Bank to the European Commission. A responsible body is needed which can operate at a political level, and the bank is not that body. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, those who say that the result obtained there was the best achievable under the present circumstances, are correct. On the other hand, the result is worse than the worst-case scenario that was feared at the previous conference in The Hague in November 2000. That conference was dominated by the fear that, for the sake of a worldwide agreement, concessions would be made to the US. Among the EU Member States, the question was about the choice between two possibilities. One was to stand firm in order to maintain the reductions agreed in Kyoto. The other was to search for what might be just acceptable to the Americans, and to accept the required moderation as inevitable. As an observer at this conference, I took the side of the steadfast German and French Green Environment Ministers in the debate at the plenary session on 29 November. Since the refusal of the new American President to sign any agreement, the resistance against what was then feasible seems to have fallen by the wayside. In order to keep Japan and Australia on board, more has now been paid than was demanded by America last year. Bush is the winner. In ten years’ time, this inadequate agreement will be deemed a disgrace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The information given to consumers must be as clear as possible and as legible as possible, while avoiding increasing the number of categories.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, for fruit juices, the sales name should not lead to any confusion. It is therefore essential to indicate to consumers the difference between a fresh fruit juice and a fruit juice made from concentrate. These two different names will enable people buying them to choose a product with full knowledge of the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, some fruit juices are produced by mixing fresh fruit juice and juice made from concentrate. Just marking it as ‘fresh fruit juice’ would be deceiving consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that in this case labels should have an additional note indicating that the final product is also made from concentrate. The name ‘made with concentrate’ or ‘partially made with concentrate’ should then feature directly under the name, in sufficiently large type to ensure that consumers are informed.</p>
<p class="contents">This measure also applies to nectars made from concentrate.</p>
<p class="contents">These decisions are aimed at informing consumers as clearly as possible, but also at not penalising producers. The production processes for these two categories of products have technical, financial and organoleptic differences. The production of fresh fruit juices requires high quality treatment of products, particularly during the pressing and pasteurisation phases, while the production of fruit juices from concentrate does not involve the same requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of my main concerns in this case was, at the time, labelling. I had tried to demonstrate that the label on a pot of honey should above all inform consumers about the origin and quality of that honey, in order to prevent honey imported from who knows where containing who knows what pollen from being confused with quality honey produced by our beekeepers.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, once again, we are talking about the quality of honey. My aim is to draw your attention to the Commission’s proposal concerning the possibility of filtering the honey in order to remove the pollen from it, which I strongly condemn. Pollen is the only indicator of the origin of honey.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the amendments proposed by our rapporteur prevent consumers from being misled, as they would no longer be able to know the origin of the honey and its exact composition if it were filtered to remove the pollen.</p>
<p class="contents">Without these amendments, there would therefore no longer be any guarantee of the quality of honey, and consumers would no longer be able to distinguish between quality honeys from their region as opposed to industrial honeys from abroad, which have been subjected to the filtering technique for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, honey could, according to the directive, contain 20% pollen ‘A’ and be 80% from 8 types of pollen. On the label it would only say ‘Honey from pollen A’ as the English version of the directive propose, the term ‘mainly’ to describe the composition and the presence of pollens in honey. This word ‘mainly’ indicates a majority, but not necessarily a majority of more than 50%. (N.B. the German translation ‘<span class="italic">überwiegend</span>’ and the French ‘<span class="italic">essentiellement</span>’ reflect that majority of more than 50%).</p>
<p class="contents">It then becomes possible to mix different sorts of nectar, without more than 50% of a nectar being present. One could imagine a honey with 20% nectar A and the remaining 80% being made up of 8 different varieties of nectar.</p>

It presents a much too enthusiastic assessment of the agreement negotiated. It is difficult to believe that this agreement ‘gives new impetus’ to Kyoto, constitutes an ‘essential instrument’ for a ‘world strategy against global warming ‘ and represents ‘an extremely positive message for all citizens who are concerned about globalisation’. It should in fact sound the alarm bell: nine years after Rio, no real measures have been put in place and the ambitions displayed by the Member States have been strangely diluted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bonn agreement includes positive points, such as the refusal to present nuclear energy as ‘clean energy’. But it marks a new climb down in the face of supporters of the ‘let the market decide’ approach, which can only concern and not reassure ‘citizens who are concerned about globalisation’. The joint resolution is still quite ambiguous on this essential issue. Paragraph 9 ‘regrets’ the space given in Bonn to ‘coal wells’ and ‘flexible systems ‘. But paragraph 6 proposes that the 2003 conference on the climate should have these ‘systems’ as a theme (the international system of exchange of emission rights) rather than the essential public policies that are required to fight against climate chaos.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Dehousse (PSE),</span> <span class="italic">in writing</span>.<span class="bold"> –</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr Perry’s report marks the happy and constructive end to 15 months of calm and continuous work by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It was on 11 April 2000 that the European Ombudsman, Mr Jacob Söderman, charged Parliament with the innovative project of a code of good administrative conduct applying to all the institutions and bodies of the European Community. It is this code that has been approved this morning. In order to achieve this result, with the practically unanimous assent of the European Parliament, several obstacles have had to be overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, like most legislative assemblies, we had to prevent a conflict of responsibilities between our different committees as, depending on the approach, four of them could be declared to be responsible for the whole of the proposal. We succeeded in overcoming this risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Next we needed to find a sound and undisputed legal basis for adopting the code. This is what the Legal Committee applied itself to doing, beyond the traditional disputes and opposition between the groups, and the more discrete but no less acute disputes between nationalities. I am delighted to have been able to contribute to it through an opinion that was very open to the expression of this large constructive majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the European Parliament wished to both strengthen and simplify the rights of European citizens with regard to the Community’s administrative actions. It has managed to do so as the code adopted contains significant new elements, the importance of which we will gradually discover. Simplification, however, is just as important as it prevents an endless breakdown of all citizens’ rights, rights which would actually lose their importance if they differed in every case.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to have been able to contribute through my vote in favour to this significant advance for European citizenship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are quite a few where pensions are paid late, even quite a few years late, sometimes decades. We must also commit ourselves, as Europe, to take action to prevent these delays happening any longer.</p>

Behind the guise of ‘land reforms’ the so-called ‘veterans’ loot and occupy white-owned farms at will. These bandits shrink from no form of violence. The police stand by laughing at the brutal scenes of intimidation and even murder of honest citizens. Thousands, mostly black agricultural labourers, are also robbed of their jobs and driven from their houses. Despite the fact that the judiciary has branded these activities as illegal, the pillaging goes on undeterred.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the campaign of intimidation has now also turned against the judiciary itself. Various independent senior judges have resigned as a result. The ban on the publication of ‘incorrect’ news capable of causing panic and despair, is used with increasing frequency to muzzle the free press. Opposition leader, Mr Morgan Tsvangirai, was indicted earlier this year for infringing the same law.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to second the proposal of Mr Van Orden to put forward this man’s name for the award of the Sakharov Prize.</p>
<p class="contents">The orchestrator of this state terrorism is the 77-year-old dictator Robert Mugabe. He justifies his crimes with an appeal to a renewed liberation struggle, a fight against ‘evil capitalism’ and ‘evil whites’.</p>
<p class="contents">His Vice-President, Mr Joseph Msika, takes things even one step further. He recently declared that whites are not human beings. No comment. It is becoming clear that Mugabe’s excesses are causing him to lose all credibility as a national and regional leader. Still, the isolationist President still has his own friends here and there. At the Libyan festival of revolution last weekend, Mr Mugabe sat next to Colonel Khadaffi as the principal guest. A few days before, his host, Mr Ghaddafi, had given him an oil loan of USD 360 million and a gift of USD one million for his election fund.</p>
<p class="contents">This crystal-clear joint resolution asks the Council and the Commission to take concrete steps against the criminal policy of the Mugabe regime. No Member State should be allowed to shirk this.</p>

It was a land full of hope, the civil war was over and people wanted to embark on a new future. The oppositions between white and black would cease to exist. If we look at what has come of these plans twenty years on, we see chaos, poverty, possibly famine in prospect, no press freedom and certainly no democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Europe cannot stand idly by, just as it could not in the past. I think, however, that Europe, in particular, must encourage Africa to condemn Mr Mugabe, because if we are not careful that situation may spread to other countries in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">What are our options according to my group? In the first place, we have to suspend aid. Food aid will be a different matter. If the reports are correct, Zimbabwe’s self-sufficiency may already be under serious threat, and this will certainly be the case in future. If that happens, food aid will have to be given, but of course it must not be distributed via the government bodies, since we know what will happen to it in that case. It must be distributed by independent organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also like an investigation to be carried out into what kind of sanctions can be used against Mr Mugabe and his clan personally. Can we take steps against possessions that they have in Europe, such as the freezing of bank accounts, etc?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like the Commission to investigate whether the rumour is true that people from Zimbabwe enabled to study at European schools and universities, are mainly selected from the circles of Mugabe and his henchmen. Is that correct and does the Commission intend to do anything about it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The wretched fact is, of course, that Mr Mugabe has extended his term of power to an unreasonable length of time and has forgotten to settle the problem of land reform himself. The way in which he is now tackling it beggars all belief and is bringing his country to the brink of collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore very disappointed that Zimbabwe is still, despite the misery befalling the country, involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I am deeply disappointed that the land occupations that this country is subject to are throwing the whole economic system out of balance and that a country that is actually suitable for food production is now itself going hungry.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the hope awakened by Zimbabwe has meanwhile been dashed. Consequently I am disappointed by the attitude of the European Union, which is unable to adopt a coherent stand in respect of Zimbabwe and to take the necessary measures on Zimbabwe that are required to consign the government of Mr Mugabe to the past, and to give a chance to the hope for a new age.</p>

If the Council and the Commission did not feel moved to act before, then it is certainly time to act now, before the Mugabe regime destroys all hope for what is potentially one of the most prosperous countries in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The breakdown in the rule of law, the terrible human rights abuses inflicted on all sections of the population in Zimbabwe and the catastrophic economic situation have all been well documented and have intensified. The political opposition to Mugabe's regime has been in the frontline of attacks from Zanu-PF militants. The opposition press has been bombed and critical journalists have been routinely attacked. Opposition politicians in the movement for democratic change and their supporters have been the particular targets of harassment, violent intimidation, arbitrary imprisonment and murder. In the last few weeks, many MPs and party officials have narrowly escaped death after violent attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not some family squabble between Britain and Zimbabwe. Mugabe's regime is a destabilising factor in central Africa and his human rights record is of international concern. The economic collapse in Zimbabwe is pulling down neighbouring countries. In the last two days, senior black opposition activists visiting this Parliament have insisted that the crisis is nothing to do with land, but about Mugabe's desire to hold on to power. He faces defeat in the presidential election next year, but is trying to head this off with a savage campaign of brutal intimidation against his political opponents. We must recognise that democratic norms, protection under the law and basic human rights have been abandoned in Zimbabwe for all elements of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">It takes enormous courage to stand up for democracy, liberty and freedom of speech in such circumstances. Morgan Tsvangirai, as the leader of the opposition MDC since 1999, personifies this courageous stance and the struggle for genuine freedom in Zimbabwe and deserves international recognition for his stance.</p>
<p class="contents">I had rather hoped that we would have senior Council representatives here this afternoon. This resolution is aimed at the Council in particular because there are a number of high-level meetings taking place in the next few weeks. Can I have an assurance that today the secretariat will ensure that our resolution is passed to the Presidency, so that it can brought up at the informal meeting of ministers at Genval near Brussels this weekend and formally put on the agenda of the General Affairs Council on 8 October?</p>

The major powers did not find fault with the dictatorial nature and the corruption of the regime in Zimbabwe until its dictator, Mr Mugabe, started, in order to preserve his power, to make a few demagogical gestures calling into question the privileges of the white farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">France, which is less associated with this category of privileged people, is meanwhile continuing to unscrupulously support the dictatorship. The feigned indignation of all those who, here, are protesting against the violence of Mugabe’s regime, seems, in these circumstances, to be above all a hypocritical way of defending a handful of privileged people against the right to live of millions of farmers in that country. Even though some occupations of land by groups of poor farmers are violent, that only represents a small fraction of the violence that was imposed on them in order to despoil them.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we express our protest against Mugabe’s regime, both against its dictatorial nature and its corruption, but also because that dictatorship continues to protect revolting social inequalities and the privileges of a limited section of society to which his clique and the rich white farmers belong.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not, however, associate ourselves with this joint resolution, of which we reject both the letter and the spirit. It is up to the population of the country to settle its accounts with Mugabe and his dictatorship. It is not up to those in collusion with the privileged minority and those who conducted or supported colonial violence to give morality lessons to that country.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to express our solidarity with the working population of Zimbabwe and our support for their right to take possession of all the land, without any repurchase or compensation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I must say to the last speaker that, as somebody British, I can confirm that my ancestors had absolutely nothing to do with the oppression or repression of the people of Zimbabwe. I would like to make it clear that I and my family are in no way guilty of colluding with anything that took place in colonial days.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important for us to recognise that this resolution is being debated here today at a very important time. It is an opportunity for President Mugabe to make the decision once and for all to step back from the brink, as Mr Van Orden has clearly said. In addition to the negotiations, which are taking place as we speak in Abuja between foreign ministers of the Commonwealth, there are a number of European Union initiatives including the intended visit to the southern African countries by the Belgian Foreign Minister, representing the Presidency and Mr Solana, the high representative.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of other things going on as well. Very importantly, in about three weeks, the preparatory team will be going out to prepare for the European Union's involvement – hopefully – in the March presidential elections. That makes it extremely important. But if it turns out that all those initiatives fail and he still turns his back on the willingness of the international community to have dialogue with him, then it will be time to take stock of what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to Mrs Maes in particular that one of the reasons the Council and the Commission have not wanted to take urgent action, as some in this Parliament would perhaps have wanted, is the danger that what Mugabe wants is an excuse to call a state of emergency in Zimbabwe so he can cancel the election, stop the democratic process and stifle the official opposition as well as any opposition from the press and media. We need to understand the potential impact of anything that the European Union, or indeed the Commonwealth, does in order to tackle what is happening in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">The defining moment will be on 8 October when the next General Affairs Council is due to take place. If no progress has been made by this time, if the dialogue has failed, if we say this is a useless procedure, then at this point it is essential that we adopt so-called smart sanctions. We should restrict visas to all Mugabe's associates and his government and identify those individuals with foreign bank accounts and freeze their assets. Those are smart sanctions that will not hurt the poor people of Zimbabwe but would certainly hurt those Zimbabweans who very much like coming to London to shop in Harrods or visit their children who are in British public schools. Those are the kind of important things that the European Union can do. Similarly we will have to look at the possibility of the suspension of development aid because that is how the Cotonou Agreement would suggest that we should proceed. At that time, we would have to express Parliament's view, as we say now, that insufficient progress has been made on land seizures, on political violence, on all of these things that others have raised.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I support the words of Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Opposition Party, who this morning on the BBC was very tough on Mugabe and I will quote what he said and finish with this: 'President Mugabe has clearly violated all the tenets of the Commonwealth and all other international organisations and should now be isolated from the international community.' We should heed the words of the leader of the opposition in Zimbabwe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nine white farmers and 360 black farm workers have been killed in the chaos over the last few months. Thousands of black farmers have lost their jobs and their homes and the farms are unworkable.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe depends on the success of agriculture and the contribution of these farmers is vital to sustain its economy. There is money available from the United Kingdom government under the Lancaster House Agreement and there is a willingness among the white farmers to give up 80% of their land to settle the black families. Mugabe must accept such a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1970, Tanzania nationalised sisal farms, businesses and real estate, killing its private sector. The same happened in Uganda in 1972, when the Asians were expelled, and those two countries' economies have been bankrupt ever since. I sympathise with the farmers and farm workers of Zimbabwe, as my family was a victim of similar confiscation and nationalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">My family has lived in Tanzania for 166 years, much longer than many white farmers in Zimbabwe. We bought land from Deutsch-Ostafrika in 1876 and I still have a title deed. We lost land and property through nationalisation without compensation and I know what that means. I share the grief of the silent black majority in Zimbabwe, who continue to live in poverty. The poorest in Zimbabwe do not want to shoot, kill, loot and burn crops. They are hungry and unemployed. They need food, education, health, employment and shelter.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the vision and quality like Nelson Mandela that at last set an example for Africa that reconciliation, cooperation, democracy and respect for all people, irrespective of their colour, is the only way to govern a developing country the only way to help the poorest to be free of poverty and disease. President Mugabe must follow Mr Mandela and accept reconciliation and democracy, allow the white farmers to thrive and continue farming and accept that Zimbabwe belongs to the people of Zimbabwe and nobody has the right to deprive them of a decent life based on peace and democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to explode the myth that this is about land and land ownership: This is about politics. This is about the fact that Mugabe knows that if they had the same votes that were cast last year in the general election, he would lose a presidential election. He is driving the farmers and their farm workers off the land, out of the constituencies, so that they cannot register to vote. It is plainly about politics. It is not about colonial powers. It is about politics.</p>
<p class="contents">Those farms are well run, they provide churches, schools and hospital treatment in those areas.

Our analysis is the same as that which most of you have made: the sole objective of the Zimbabwean government is to stay in power, even if that means ending up destroying a country that not long ago was considered to be one of the soundest economies and democracies in Africa. The Zimbabwean government, which could have reasonably avoided this crisis, is therefore clearly responsible for this dramatic descent into hell.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s political objective, as many of you have pointed out, is that presidential elections should be held. The Union’s main objective is presidential elections in 2002, in the best possible conditions to enable change, as we say in conventional language. The Union’s position, if that is the objective, should therefore be to seek a balance between, on the one hand, indicating our disagreement with the current development of the situation and, on the other hand, preventing it from serving as a pretext for declaring martial law, which would have the effect of delaying the elections that we want to take place. Therefore, observing the presidential elections in 2002 is, in our view, the absolute priority for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to what was said in your speeches on the implementation of Article 8, that is political dialogue (Article 8 of Cotonou), we approve the pursuit of political dialogue, while stressing, like you, that no substantial progress has been made in this dialogue in recent months. A small hope remains, which is the forthcoming visit by the presidency to the countries involved in the Congolese crisis, an event that could perhaps lead to this dialogue being revived.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the following stage is concerned, which is the implementation of Article 96 of Cotonou, which we call consultation and adoption of appropriate measures, again in conventional language, the Council will look at this issue at the beginning of October with, of course, our participation, and we will decide then whether or not we will take this step. With regard to the impact of this situation on development cooperation, we hope to be able to maintain the programmes that the Community funds in Zimbabwe, particularly in the health and education sectors, given the humanitarian and social nature of these programmes, in order not to penalise the population, which is already being heavily affected by the economic crisis. All this is taking place, as you have all said, in an extremely worrying economic and social context. In Zimbabwe this year we see that a cereal shortage has already occurred and that should be manageable if it was only a question of the cereal shortage and its consequences for the population. However, the serious instability prevailing in the country, the economic crisis and the societal conflicts that are taking place there are an important factor in a situation of food insecurity that we think, in these conditions, is in danger of becoming worse. It is therefore the interaction between the food situation, the agricultural shortages, in this case of cereals, the economic context and the political context, which contains the germs of a crisis that is probably even more serious than that which we are currently experiencing, and which we should do everything we can to avoid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Dam (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, the regions of Oene, Kootwijkerbroek, Mayenne, Cumbria and Northumberland have become notorious in Europe. Regions where humans and animals have suffered from the foot-and-mouth epidemic. However, the suffering was caused not only by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, but also by the means of combating the disease imposed by EU regulations, namely the slaughter of all animals on infected farms and in a buffer zone around them. An approach based solely on the preservation of distant export markets. Odd, if we realise that the European Union actually imports meat from vaccinated cattle from Argentina.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the suffering of the last few months would have been unnecessary if the Commission had been prepared to accept preventive vaccination. In France and since June also in the Netherlands the crisis has been averted. Unfortunately, that is not yet the case in the United Kingdom. There the suffering of farmers and animals continues unabated. The figures make our heads spin. Since 9 a.m. this morning, there have been 2 005 new cases. Twenty recent new cases in Northumberland that for three months had seen no new infections. In the United Kingdom, four million animals have been destroyed in connection with foot-and-mouth disease and a further one-and-a-half million because of welfare problems related to the crisis. Let me be clear about this. This is not a loss of production units. This is the destruction of living creatures. It surprises me that the British government is only now considering using vaccination. The argument that they wish to retain the lucrative export markets no longer cuts any ice, now that winter is nearly upon us. Under the present circumstances, the United Kingdom will have lost that market for a considerable time.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that the British government will listen to Sir William Stewart of the British Association of Science who says that vaccination must play a part in combating foot-and-mouth disease and should have been used at a much earlier stage. There is intensive contact with continental Europe through the many movements of people, animals, vehicles and lorries. That makes the situation in the United Kingdom life-threatening for agriculture in Europe. The present checks, including those at the Dutch border, are so minimal that they are asking for trouble.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to take adequate preventive steps to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in continental Europe, so that humans and animals are spared unnecessary suffering. Finally, I appeal urgently to the Commission once again in the light of the unmanageable crisis in the United Kingdom to change the non-vaccination policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martinez (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, in this outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, there are technical areas of shadow, political certainties and strategic questions.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all regarding the areas of shadow, how, far from the known endemic sources – Turkey, Asia and Thrace in Europe – how has foot-and-mouth disease, and its virus, managed to reach Great Britain, an island? Perhaps by swimming? Why this dogmatic refusal of a vaccine that is nevertheless effective. In 1950, before the obligatory vaccination between 1961 and 1991, France had up to 300 000 sources of infection per year, which disappeared with the obligatory vaccination. Why, in the same country, have we had the foot-and-mouth virus and the prion for mad cow disease?</p>
<p class="contents">So many questions that lead to political certainties, if not lessons. In both cases, BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, the British authorities have reacted late and have been overwhelmed, because the ultra liberalism of the Thatcher years left only 220 vets compared with 8 000 in France. Just as for a developing country, Australia, Canada and even the French army had to send vets to Great Britain. A lack of vets and no epidemic monitoring, which is why the disease spread. It was also ultra liberalism that led to abattoirs being closed and meant that, from Carlisle, Hadrian’s Wall and Northumberland, sheep are taken to the south and the virus is spread. The virus is spread across Great Britain and, following the removal of borders, it is also spread across France. Freedom of movement is freedom of contamination.</p>
<p class="contents">The third certainty, demonstrated in an investigation report from the French Parliament in June 2001: it was illegal purchases, at knock-down prices – less than 90 euros per sheep for the Muslim feast of Eid-el-Kabir – which led to the spread of the virus.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with these certainties, however, there are questions for the Commission; and it is good that it should be Mr Lamy, the strategist, who is here. First of all, does the compensation system in Great Britain not end up becoming a bonus for contamination? The impression was given that the beneficial compensation meant that people perhaps had an interest in having contaminated animals. All the more so given that, collectively, four million animals were slaughtered, the majority of which were sheep, means that the surpluses will be drained. And finally, does New Zealand, the leading world exporter, not have an interest in seeing its potential market share in Europe increase as animals are slaughtered? And my God, if Anglo-Saxons were able to come to an understanding on the Echelon Treaty, they can exchange favours. For me, Great Britain, excessive individual compensation, for you, New Zealand, the possibility of more exports. The Cairns group would be happy. Doha would be a success. It would be good if Mr Lamy could clarify this for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The great question is, and I do not know whether the Commission can answer it: what is the Commission’s explanation for the continued outbreaks of foot-and-mouth in the United Kingdom?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is not only a matter for the authorities in Great Britain itself. After all, every European taxpayer contributes to the solution of the crisis. Has the Commission urged Britain for example to use ring vaccination? I should have thought that the example in the Netherlands was very successful, and why could it not be repeated in other European countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Another question. One of the reasons for the crisis is that meat was imported illegally into Europe. Controls on our outer borders were inadequate. My question to the Commission is: what has been done since on the outer borders? What has changed from, let us say, some six months ago? Why not implement a similar type of check as in the United States or in Australia, where there are strict controls on entry? I have not been able to find this anywhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">A further question. I believe that the large-scale slaughter of animals will no longer be acceptable to public opinion in the long run. The development of marker vaccines might be one of the solutions. The Commission has already done something about this, but will it do a little more to ensure that these marker vaccines and also the accompanying testing methods are made available as quickly as possible, so that we no longer have to slaughter so many animals?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I should like to know something about the costs. The situation in Great Britain is special, since the whole question of rebate is taken into consideration, but how much does the Commission estimate that this has cost up to now? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have a document here in front of me stating that the British government admits that it was unable to meet the required deadlines for the slaughter of infected animals. It goes on to say that the control of the disease, as my colleague there has said, has failed because we are now having new outbreaks in the centre of Britain, in the centre of the region where we thought we were rid of it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have failed to control it and we have also failed to provide the necessary border controls. Last Sunday I drove from my farm in North Yorkshire to Strasbourg. I was never questioned about whether I was carrying any meat and there were no border controls at all to check my vehicle. There were no disinfection points. There was a simple carpet in the middle of the road and that was all.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to Mr Lamy, who is the really important man here today, that we have a situation where England is the dustbin of Europe. We are importing food from these countries. We must look at that.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I very much regret that this is the second time in six months that we are having to debate foot-and-mouth disease in this House. The reason for our debate is, as the Joint Resolution says, that the measures taken by the UK government to control this disease have failed, that new outbreaks are appearing and that there is a very real risk of the disease spreading again to mainland Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ask ourselves why the UK government has failed and why in particular it consistently rejects the idea of ring vaccination in the face of mounting calls from those in rural communities who want to adopt it. It is ever more clear that it is not small farmers' livelihoods, it is not even the tourist industry and the wider rural economy that the UK has as its priority, but simply our meat exports and the desire to regain FMD-free export status again as soon as possible. Yet even this dismal economic justification for culling on such a scale does not stand up. According to the National Farmers' Union the UK earns just GBP 630 million a year from meat and dairy exports. Compare that with the estimated cost to the wider rural community of GBP 9 billion as a result of the foot-and-mouth epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the call in this resolution for a full cost-benefit analysis between the various disease control approaches so that we can compare the losses that have been suffered under the culling approach to those that would have been incurred under a vaccination strategy. I feel sure that the results will demonstrate that the UK government’s approach is not only inhumane, it is also uneconomical. We are urging the Commission to revise the EU strategy on defending by all means FMD status and to recognise that the culling and destruction of healthy animals is both inhumane and ineffective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret very much that we have been unable to agree a compromise text on this occasion. The reason is simple. Recital A accuses the UK government of failure to control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. In truth, it is not an attack on the UK government but on all those who have battled very heroically against the disease since the end of February – the farmers themselves, the vets, the scientists, the civil servants, the police, the military, many different rural agencies which have all been involved. In particular, the farmers in the Allendale Valley, the scene of the recent hotspot, believed that they had taken all the necessary measures to avoid the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">Failure to control implies that the outbreak should have already ended. But the mover of the resolution did not explain when and by what means that might have been achieved. No-one ever promised, or even surmised, that the outbreak would be over at this stage. At its peak there were 40 to 50 cases a day. Despite the recent outbreak in Allendale, the average is now two or three cases per day. If this does not indicate a degree of control then we really have a very serious problem in front of us, something that none of us ever imagined.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important also to recall that from the very start the UK government has given full information to the other Member States and has followed the advice of the Standing Veterinary Committee. In that respect, we can point to a considerable success for the mechanisms that we have operating within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A word on vaccination. I would suggest to Mr van Dam, the original speaker on this resolution, that perhaps he ought to apply for the job of chief scientist in the United Kingdom. He certainly seems to bring to the debate on vaccination an authority and conviction which far exceeds that of the current holder of the office, Professor David King, who only this morning in a radio broadcast said we could not be certain that vaccination would have done any good. In the Netherlands the animals were also slaughtered and there is quite a problem here in the suggestion that vaccination actually saves the animal's life. That does not necessarily follow – but I do not know when the job becomes vacant! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the great success of the tackling of foot-and-mouth disease by the British government is causing many farmers in continental Europe sleepless nights once again. Is that a successful policy? Foot-and-mouth policy there is not only inadequate, because we do not use, for example, vaccination and ring vaccination but because the Council and members of Council are treating the threat from Great Britain extremely lightly. After all, it is extremely simple to lay disinfectant mats and carry out standard soil checks in ports and airports in order to clamp down on the problem. We emphatically appeal to the Commission and the Council on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in my country, financial subsidies to farmers are cut back drastically if they have made minor mistakes and have had foot-and-mouth disease. At the same time, however, many Ministers have no reason to talk, because they are doing nothing to avert the danger of foot-and-mouth disease from Great Britain in border checks.

I believe it has been the worst epidemic of this disease that the world has seen. Nobody can doubt the drastic measures that have had to be used to curtail it.</p>
<p class="contents">The two current hotspots show that this outbreak will be with us for many months. We cannot, on the one hand, say that the containment is too drastic because of the slaughter policy and, on the other hand, that it is too slack because it has let the disease take hold. We did not anticipate effectively the extraordinary scale of animal movements, particularly of sheep, in February 2000 and later. The first of the three inquiries that have now been launched in the UK will need to look at that and perhaps also at the role of one form of CAP subsidy in encouraging some of these forms of animal movement. We provided effective information for our Dutch, French and Irish neighbours and for them it worked. We should study how their containment worked and why. Vaccination, in my opinion, has to be one of the options that the inquiry can recommend if they so find.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally a word to Mr Sturdy, who called for a European public inquiry. When we had one into BSE, he was not so enthusiastic. But BSE was a new disease. There was a real element of concealment in some of the factors that led to that disease and particularly in the European factor and the fact that we were still exporting infected meal to continental Europe for years after we banned it for ourselves. That was a genuine European inquiry. The epidemiology of this outbreak is not in doubt. I believe that our friends should accept that the British have to get their own house in order and, if that means a public dimension to the inquiries, that case can be made in the UK. It is not like what happened with BSE: we have done our duty by our neighbours. We hope that they will now have the confidence in us to let us help ourselves and see all remedies properly examined so that this dreadful disease can be exterminated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With millions of animals being slaughtered and farms being crippled or wiped out, this is hardly the time for party political argument. I well remember how Labour let fly at the Conservative government during the BSE crisis and now there is the temptation for the Conservatives to let fly at the Labour government, but even if governments are guilty of omission, what you are doing here is not exactly constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">We have submitted a regulation on feeding meat and bonemeal in certain cases – we are talking animal waste here. Had we had it at the time, there would have been no BSE problem. The same applies to foot-and-mouth. The Commission needs to change its strategy. Holland may have ring vaccinated successfully, but it was only by going against the mood in the EU and the Commission. I do not want you to help, I want you to do something so that we end up with a different strategy which we can then also secure through our trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must move away from this insane strategy of ‘foot-and-mouth free’ or ‘disease free’ and discuss this with our trading partners. We need a regulation on feeding or destroying leftovers. What the Council has done now, that is, just banning, is no help at all. This rubbish has to go somewhere and we cannot dump it in landfills because then the problem of improper processing will keep recurring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of cases of foot-and-mouth is on the rise once again. As you know, the foot-and-mouth virus is harmless to man but is highly infectious to all cloven-hoofed animals and results in huge financial losses. With new outbreaks occurring, I again call on the Commission and the Council to favour vaccination rather than slaughter. We must rethink how we fight zoonoses in Europe and today we have what I think is a very balanced resolution in order to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Consistent preventive hygiene is only one side of the coin. With people travelling the world for business and pleasure, foot-and-mouth disease is an ever-present threat and we must be far more consistent in applying controls at airports to prevent this epidemic from coming in and spreading. I realise that both farmers and consumers are having difficulties with the ethical implications of the current vaccination policy. We are talking fatal consequences here. We must, at long last, move away from our non-vaccination policy. We need marker vaccines. We need a reasonable approach to ring vaccination and we need to make up our minds once and for all to show through our policy that science needs to make progress with prevention, that is, by formulating suitable vaccines.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>To give a brief description of the current situation in the Union as a whole, no restrictions have been imposed in the Union as a result of foot-and-mouth disease, except in Great Britain, and that was on 25 June this year, thirty days after the slaughter and destruction of the last vaccinated animal in the Netherlands. So in fourteen of the fifteen Member States of the Union, plus Northern Ireland, we have quite a favourable situation, which is the result of the implementation and effective application of measures to combat foot-and-mouth disease at Community level. I shall now run the risk of offending Mrs Lucas by referring briefly to the international point of view, and from that point of view we sincerely hope that the measures which have been adopted by France, Ireland and the Netherlands will enable them to obtain the necessary status from the International Office of Epizootics, thus enabling third countries to lift the trade restrictions that are still in place.</p>
<p class="contents">However – and on this point I should like to reassure Mrs Lucas – since this is perhaps not the most important aspect, let us come back to the case of the United Kingdom, which is actually still giving cause for concern, since the two-thousandth case occurred on 3 September. Although the situation in Great Britain has remained stable for almost three months, we are still worried about it because of the fact that cases are continuing to occur within or close to the areas that have been placed under restrictions. Many Members have referred to the most recent cases, in the county of Northumberland, the place where the epidemic first appeared. These cases are worrying, because they were confirmed three months after the disease had disappeared there. Radical measures were taken: infected herds were slaughtered, as were neighbouring herds and contact herds, and although the occurrence of this admittedly limited but nonetheless worrying number of cases was to be expected, after the disease peaked at the beginning of April, the period over which a small number of cases have continued to occur is excessively long, and the Community has asked the British authorities to step up their eradication measures. Time is pressing, because things will become more difficult in autumn and winter, not only because of weather conditions, but also because it is customary for animals to be moved during that period.</p>
<p class="contents">The present development of the disease is clearly passing through a critical phase. This is not the time to relax our controls. As has already been said, and as several of you have emphasised, this is the time of year when we see herds being moved around and handled in various ways, and in our opinion it is therefore necessary to reduce animal movements to the absolute minimum. The Commission has made this known to the people involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Staying with the United Kingdom, the complex structure of beef and dairy farming, the absence of any clinical signs in sheep, and the fact that the spread of the disease within a herd or flock is slow, are all factors which complicate the problems and which make it necessary for us to have recourse to laboratory testing, and the capacity available for such testing is now sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is the Commission’s opinion? We would not say that the situation is satisfactory, because in this specific case it is not, but the risk of the disease spreading to other Member States is now much less than it was in March and April, when the disease was at its peak, because all the restrictions that were imposed, in particular on the movement of animals and untreated products from Great Britain, are still in place. We are carrying out regular on-the-spot inspections, the latest of which goes back to the end of August, in order to satisfy ourselves that the British authorities are taking adequate measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Other regions of Great Britain, in some cases quite large regions, have not been affected by the disease, and the Veterinary Committee must continue to consider the matter so that when the time comes, and circumstances make it possible, trade with those regions can be envisaged subject to stringent conditions. On this point we shall be extremely careful, because the experience of Northumberland reminds us that the risk is still present, even in those areas where it seemed that the disease had been brought under control.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back for a moment to the question of third countries, if Mrs Lucas will allow me, a certain number of countries have continued to take discriminatory measures against European products, which go beyond the international standards currently in force, and we are working on this matter together with a certain number of our trading partners. Many third countries have gradually lifted the somewhat extensive prohibitions that they had initially imposed. Others, by contrast, such as the United States, Canada and even some of the countries which have applied for accession, have been slow to lift the restrictions, which they still maintain, wrongly, even today. We shall continue to work on this question, taking as our basis the WTO Agreement on Health and Plant Health.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking more generally, it should be emphasised, first of all, that this crisis has had major repercussions on the Community budget. We decided to grant an overall budget of EUR 400 million to the four Member States affected this year, and the latest forecasts show that the Union’s anticipated financial contribution will be slightly more than EUR 1.5 billion. We shall take the necessary measures from the point of view of budgetary procedure. There is no doubt that this is an exceptional situation. We do not know how to predict the budget for epizootics on this scale, and we shall therefore have to make adjustments as we go along. That is just one aspect of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">A second aspect, of course, is the damage done to the image of our livestock farming industry, following the slaughter of almost four million animals. A third aspect is the fact that the problem, as has already been mentioned, is also present outside the European Union, and we are seriously worried following the recent appearance of a case in Turkish Thrace.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we at the Commission hope that we shall be able to learn some lessons for future use, with regard to the handling of this sort of crisis, so that we can improve our current regulatory and legislative system, for example by making provision for a certain number of additional requirements for intra-Community trade in small ruminants, such as restricting the number of stopping points, which would probably be the first step. We are also working on a proposal regarding the identification and registration of sheep and goats, and on another proposal regarding the importing of animal products by travellers. We are also working towards adjusting our inspection procedures when this type of epizootic appears. I believe that we now have sufficient experience, but we must not delude ourselves. The reinforcement of our legislation and of our systems, however necessary it may be, will not, on its own, be enough to prevent the reappearance of such an epidemic. We must also improve the operation of the veterinary services within Member States, and there is not doubt that we must also change our farming practices.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is one that several Members have drawn attention to during our discussions, and that is the question of vaccination. As far as the use of so-called ‘ring’ vaccination around infected holdings is concerned, I should like to remind those of you who have sought to implicate the Commission by asking why the Commission did not order compulsory vaccination as a matter of urgency, that in our present legal system, which whatever any one says is characterised by certain forms of subsidiarity, vaccination is the responsibility of the national authorities. There is therefore a procedure which allows any Member State that wants to to use vaccination, and that is how it is done. The system exists and it is at the disposal of the Member States, but it is not the Commission’s responsibility. I believe that I have thus given a clear answer to the questions raised by Mr van Dam, Mr Martinez, Mr Mulder and Mrs Lucas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What, then, is that constitution worth? There is no freedom of association for political parties. The Green Party, which submitted its articles of association several months ago, has still not been recognised and has not even received an acknowledgement that its application has been received. These anti-democratic manoeuvres are taking place on the eve of the legislative and local elections planned for October. We have no guarantee regarding these elections, because there is no independent electoral commission. In our opinion, the release of Chbih Melainine is a prerequisite for holding the elections in October, as is the reconstitution of all the opposition parties. It is in order to allow all these political actors to participate that we are asking that the elections should be postponed. In order to re-establish democracy and guarantee the organisation of free and fair elections in Mauritania, we are asking the Council and the Commission to enter into consultations with the government, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Political opponents of the regime are being neutralised. People are being arbitrarily arrested, excessive force is being used against peaceful demonstrators and the press now serves only as the president’s lackey. The judiciary is again entirely at the disposal of those with political power. Their Honours recently sentenced the principal political opponents of the president in a show trial to no less than five years in prison. The imprisoned politicians were kept <span class="italic">incommunicado </span>for a long period and then taken to prison 800 km from the capital, so that they can receive almost no visitors. It appears that no one can do anything to stop this. Independent human rights organisations can scarcely operate in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">While Western countries are obliged to apologise in Durban for the slave trade conducted by their distant ancestors, slavery is still common practice in Mauritania. In the caste system, people become serfs at birth. They receive no education; no income from forced labour and are not allowed to marry without the permission of their master. According to an estimate by the American State Department a few years ago, there are still some 90 000 slaves in Mauritania. As recently as 1983, this country was the last on earth to abolish slavery officially, but still does its utmost to keep the gruesome reality hidden from the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is high time that the European Union opened the consultative procedure of Article 96 with Mauritania. We cannot continue giving aid and maintaining intensive trade relations as if there were no problem. We must prepare for pseudo-elections in a pseudo-democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Water is a scarce resource and its 2.2 million people are poor and live in rural areas. It depends on its exports of iron ore and fishing – just two things. I was invited in May of this year to lead a small delegation of MEPs and visit Mauritania, which I did. I spent a week with parliamentarians, all the ministers, President Taya, civil society and NGOs. We travelled up and down the country – a week is a long time to be in Mauritania. Mrs Sudre and Mrs Langenhagen came with me. I was impressed by what President Taya has done over the years in a country as poor as this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am astonished – and I want to embarrass him and his government, which I shall do at the ACP Conference when their delegates come – that there is now this sad case of locking up the opposition. There is no reason for it, there is no need. He is quite strong, he is quite popular. He has done well. He can do well without locking up his opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as slavery is concerned, it is actually banned in Islam and Mauritania is a Muslim country. There are Moors, there are blacks and various mixtures of these two. I saw their lifestyle. I did not see any slaves, though that is not to say they are not there. What I shall certainly do is embarrass the government of Mauritania at the ACP Conference to make sure this practice does not continue and the opposition is allowed to operate freely so that there is accountability of the ministers. It is better for the president of the country and the people of the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are talking about a country that falls within the ACP framework in relation to the European Union and which, furthermore, hopes to move on from its current observer status to becoming a full member of the Barcelona process. We are obliged to remind the Mauritanian authorities that it is impossible for the European Union to envisage, for example, that country acquiring full member status in the Barcelona process if democracy does not become a reality, if human rights continue to be violated and, what is more, if the date is maintained for the municipal and legislative elections which, as things stand at the moment, will take place this October without any type of guarantee.</p>
<p class="contents">There is clearly little chance of dissolved parties and imprisoned opposition leaders being able to participate when, furthermore, they have nowhere to express themselves because the press is either overseen by the government or simply does not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">I shudder to think about the situation of that one Member of Parliament who does not belong to the government party in an assembly of 79 seats, but I imagine that if any opposition Member were elected in these elections – which will not happen – he would probably soon be sent from Parliament to jail.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the European Union must implement the provisions of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. Mauritania lowers the already low average level of democracy and human rights in the Maghreb. However, it is clearly just one more case on a continent such as Africa, where human rights are constantly violated.</p>
<p class="contents">Mauritania is a country where the permanent dictator, not the dictator of the moment, President Mauya Uld Sid'Ahmed Taya, has just torn up all the rules which, with the mediation of the European Union, the opposition and the government had established for proper elections, elections furthermore which have been delayed indefinitely.

Since then, although some good souls have assured us that everything is working out nicely, Togo is still living in a political wasteland and it has a long way to go before it escapes from it. Democracy is still a fleeting ideal. Civil rights and human rights are constantly flouted, and I believe that the passive attitude of the governments of European Union Member States does nothing to encourage things to change. Parliament’s regular condemnations are merely rhetorical and ineffective. Most recently, the sum paid by the Commission to organise new elections – CFA francs 4 billion – was dismissed as insufficient by the government, which took advantage of the opportunity to postpone, yet again, the long-awaited legislative elections. In a complete violation of his previous undertakings, President Eyadema and his government are even thinking about amending the constitution so as to allow him stand for election again. Finally, one of the opposition leaders, Mr Yawovi Agboyibo, was arrested and sentenced, a month ago, on trumped-up charges. The truth of the matter is that he had denounced the terror tactics employed in areas where the opposition had a majority, tactics which took the form of rapes and other crimes, including the murder of opponents. Mr Eyadema seems less than ever prepared to honour his obligations to his people and his obligations to the international community. Here again, Parliament should firmly condemn his actions, demand that free elections be held on the planned dates, and ask the Council and the Commission to initiate consultations in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Opposition parties are banned or it is made impossible for them to function. Opponents who have or threaten to acquire support are put behind bars. The press is completely manipulated and anyone openly criticising the president winds up in a cell if he is lucky and six feet under if he is less fortunate. Mass demonstrations are mercilessly broken up. The political class consists entirely of slavish servants of the president as a result of a system of rewards and punishments. A ludicrous cult of personality is designed to give the Head of State a quasi-divine status. The French President, Mr Chirac, has to be hoodwinked to such an extent that he condemns Amnesty International instead of the human rights violations in Togo. The murdering of opponents of the regime goes unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">This is still unfortunately the familiar pattern in many African countries and we do not really know how to deal with it. Crude misuse of power hampers development and perpetuates poverty. The European Union quite rightly suspended aid as long ago as 1993, but the situation has not improved. On the contrary, the opposition leader and human rights campaigner, Mr Agboyibo, was thrown into jail for six months, for allegedly insulting the Prime Minister. In order to add force to his arguments his Excellency maintains a private army of 1 000 troops.</p>
<p class="contents">Togo is asking for financial support to hold parliamentary elections in October. The question is whether or not we would then contribute to the organisation of a democratic farce, designed solely to give those in power a semblance of legitimacy.

Some leaders are indeed proving exceptionally creative in eliminating their political opponents and getting round the democratic rules of the game. One of them is General Eyadema from Togo.</p>
<p class="contents">At the last elections in 1998 he did not hesitate to have the counting of votes stopped and himself again proclaimed president. A period of bloody repression followed, in which, according to Amnesty, hundreds of people were killed. An international committee confirmed those findings, but at the present moment, no one has yet been called to account or punished. On the contrary, the repression is simply continuing. The latest victim is opposition leader, Mr Agboyibo. Last month in a show trial, he was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for spreading false information. I have met Yawovi Agboyibo several times personally in his home base. I have developed a very great admiration for the way in which, at the constant risk of his own life, he continues to campaign for human rights and the restoration of democracy in his country.</p>
<p class="contents">This must be stopped in some way. Maintaining the suspension of aid is one thing, but I believe that we must ask ourselves whether a country like Togo still belongs at conferences of the ACS and the European Union. However, the problem is that, just as in the case of Zimbabwe, certain European states follow their own agenda for the sake of commercial or other interests and, in so doing, run counter to the European strategy towards Togo. It is not enough to establish fine principles in an agreement. They must also be applied consistently and that also applies to a country like France. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much support is still required on the slow road to democracy, and the local elections will be an extremely important moment in that process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kampuchean People’s Party, which controls the country, is an old-style Communist party, which means that it as a party is directly or indirectly involved in everything, in every sector, at every level in that country. Consequently, it is not surprising that the local elections should be considered a threat and that they have been repeatedly postponed. It is therefore essential that we continue to exert international pressure on the government to do everything possible to create a violence-free period before the elections and to reopen the procedure for voter registration. Voter registration is in the hands of the village headmen, who are appointed by the central committee of the Kampuchean People’s Party, and nothing is simpler than to give poll cards to those in favour of the government and withhold them from those opposed to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Only last Monday, the leader of the opposition, the Member of Parliament, Sam Rainsy, had a meeting with the local representative of the European Commission, who in that conversation, was able to make the point that we have a very positive attitude to the National Election Committee. I am far from being so enthusiastic. We must watch that National Election Committee very closely, since it is at the crux of whether or not the elections are being conducted fairly. The European Union has little cause to be proud of the way in which we observed the elections in Kampuchea last time, and we must do a lot better this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During this period, there were two people who personified the hope for freedom, Son San, the important democrat, who often visited us here in Strasbourg and who has since died, and King Sihanouk, who is now an old, ill man. That is why this country needs to be renewed from the roots upwards and young, democratic forces need to be supported. This can only be done through the communes, it can only be done through democratic local elections from the roots upwards. That is why it is so important for us to support and back the numerous candidates in the communes, for us to ensure that fair local elections are held, for us to monitor efficiently, for us to ward off, prevent and correct any jiggery-pokery during registration. As for the Criminal Tribunal, we must state quite clearly that this is not a question of revenge, it is a question of law. We must state quite clearly to future offenders that acts of violence, genocide and mass murder will be ruthlessly punished on the basis of the rule of law, irrespective of who is responsible.

The period of terror still casts a shadow over the country. Even now, with elections in prospect, the democratic process turns out not to be proceeding completely smoothly. On the contrary, restrictions have been imposed on the opposition. There is increasing violence. Voter registration has been halted, so that 30% of the electorate cannot even take part in the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the lack of legal guarantees in the special tribunal, and so on. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge for the European Union, or the democratic world, to do our utmost to keep watch and to help guide the country towards democracy. It would surely be positive if at least one guarantee could be given. Something concrete, namely that voter registration will be reopened, so that the hope of a democratic result is not completely dashed in advance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last 20 years, millions of people have fled Afghanistan and, according to the UN human rights organisation, approximately 6.2 million Afghans are classified as refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Their first port of call when they leave the country is generally one of the refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran, where they live in appalling conditions. Pakistan can no longer cope with the number of refugees and is sending them back to Afghanistan. Outside the refugee camps, there are so-called travel agents waiting who send refugees with money on to other countries, and the cheapest fare to a Western country is now a journey to Australia, which costs approximately EUR 6 000.</p>
<p class="contents">This stream of refugees will not stop if we do not manage to receive the refugees properly near Afghanistan and that is what we as the European Union must put our money into. This is the solution to the problem. As long as people are living there in dreadful conditions, they will want to go on fleeing to Western countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only did he rescue the people from a sinking ship, but subsequently too he consistently took the side of the people. It is thanks to such humanitarian help that we can retain a vague hope in a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, our group feels that a legal obligation should be introduced to allow the stowaways ashore at the first port of call, in agreement with the 1957 Treaty on stowaways. As a result of the clash between the various spheres of law, the refugees become the exhausted pawns in a game of passing the buck.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, it must be clearly stated that Australia’s actions in this matter have been far from praiseworthy. Local political interests have taken precedence over the respecting of human rights. Through its actions, Australia supports and finances the source of the problems with which the country is confronted. Too little attention is paid to the cause. The main responsibility for this drama lies with the Taliban regime, which is systematically destroying its own country and killing the spirit of its own population, so that migrations of people have become a necessary evil.</p>
<p class="contents">In this matter, we have an international political humanitarian responsibility. We might have wished that Australia would use its political weight to condemn the regime in Afghanistan and to spur the international community on to constructive action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only because of the repressive and fanatical nature of a regime which denies women and children education, work and even medical care, but also because of the deterioration of the economic situation which that fanatical regime is causing in the country. We therefore perfectly understand the almost 500 people which tried to flee, at risk of their lives, and came up against a brick wall erected by a country such as Australia, a rich country which could have taken them in from the outset without any problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we should acknowledge the courage of the captain of the Norwegian freighter, Arne Rinnan, who, without thinking of the consequences and led only by humanitarian considerations, immediately picked up these people, who were in danger of drowning. In contrast, we must strongly criticise a country which, like any of our countries, is obliged to take in a ship which was sailing in it waters with almost 500 people in a situation as precarious as that of these refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules must be laid down to prevent this type of situation. I know that it is not easy, that there are increasing numbers of refugees, that poverty is spreading and is the reason why many people are seeking a better life, but I believe that the attitude of Australia must not be imitated by any country towards any group of refugees who, under the protection of the United Nations Convention of 1951, are asking to be allowed to survive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, a former European Commissioner and Member of this Parliament, the current Greek Minister for the Merchant Navy, Christos Papoutzis, has highlighted the irresponsibility of the Turkish government in allowing a situation such as this to come about.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Member who has just spoken has said, we are undergoing a universal process of globalisation. The phenomenon of illegal immigration is not confined to one part of the world. The European Union, to be specific, is currently seeing the arrival of huge numbers of immigrants, and since Commissioner Lamy is here, and he has been so concerned with the problems of globalisation, I would like to say that I believe we are dealing with another aspect of the phenomenon of that globalisation. Just as capital and goods are being moved about freely, it seems that people also want to move about freely.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs González Álvarez has said, this is not an issue which is easily resolved, but I believe we could do something from here on many levels. On the most general level there would be a regulation of the international economy that includes population movements. And on more specific levels it would mean action by the institutions of the European Union to try to regulate this illegal immigration. This very week, this summer, on the island where I live, we have seen the bodies of illegal immigrants who have been flung from the boats on which they were arriving by Moroccan skippers who form genuine mafias.</p>
<p class="contents">The question should be put to the Commission of what measures the European Union is preparing for action within its own territory and what measures it is proposing on an international level. I believe that we must act in our own territory, and in the area of neighbouring countries, such as Turkey and Morocco, which are sending us illegal immigrants, and on an international level, by establishing regulations of a general nature.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that responsibility on the issue of the Afghan refugees should fall exclusively to Australia. Responsibility also falls, for example, to the Indonesian government because it was from there that the original boat sailed, the crew was Indonesian, it all began in waters under Indonesian jurisdiction and it seems that nobody is remembering to state this type of responsibility at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that international action is required in this case and I believe that this would be an excellent opportunity for the European Commission to implement an initiative, I repeat, not only in the closer area of our neighbours, but also on an international level, with a view to achieving the regulation of migratory flows and illegal immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The captain was given permission to proceed to the Indonesian port of Merak, after which he was put under duress by the passengers with threatened suicides and forced to sail towards Australian waters. It is believed that many of these passengers set out from a refugee camp in Pakistan, paying about GBP 4 500 each to be taken illegally to Australia. Apparently the going rate for Germany is GBP 7 000 and Britain, the destiny of choice, is GBP 10 000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Australian government was perfectly entitled to exercise its sovereign right under the law of the sea to secure its borders by refusing the ship access to Australian waters. Nor do its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention apply until an asylum seeker is actually present on its territory. The convention itself, introduced before the age of cheap mass jet travel, was a response to the horrors of Nazism and designed to protect the principle of asylum. However, as we are all aware, it is increasingly abused by economic migrants who pass through several safe but poor countries in order to reach rich countries to settle in, where it can lead to people-trafficking, prostitution and a black economy in jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">In Britain over 100 000 people claimed asylum last year and the great majority of these claims were unfounded. But it remains profitable for criminal people-traffickers to ply their trade because appeals can be strung out for years and, even when unsuccessful, almost no-one is deported back to their country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Australia's problem is also our problem. We need urgently to face up to the need to secure our borders and remove those who enter illegally. There is widespread concern. The EU should urgently develop new policies in this area. We also need to exert severe pressure on those countries which refuse to take back their own nationals. In fact we need to totally renegotiate the 1951 Geneva Convention and think again.</p>

I would like to distance myself from statements like that. It misrepresents the position of people in Britain who do not understand the kind of attitude that we heard here earlier this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">We are glad that after eight days of sitting under tarpaulins in the hot sun and inside containers, the Afghan refugees are now at least in reasonable conditions on board the ship on a long voyage to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. It has been an extremely tragic incident and terrible to watch and to think of their suffering. But more than anything it teaches us that the 50-year old asylum-seeking system instigated by the United Nations is not working any more. It is creaking under the strain of the mass movement of 21 million migrants a year. The desperation of the people on the <span class="italic">Tampa </span>is clear. To suggest that people take this kind of action lightly is ridiculous. They take terrible risks with their lives and the lives of their children in order to escape persecution or penury. They cross the seas in inflatable boats, they cling to the underside of trains like the Eurostar and jumbo jets. The suffering of the refugees on the <span class="italic">Tampa </span>should at least lead all the governments that we represent here to rethink the way that they implement the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees.</p>

<p class="contents">Once again, it was UNITA which struck the blow, thereby continuing to violate the peace agreement signed in Lusaka in 1994, which made provision, amongst other things, for the disarming of the militant rebels.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, these acts of terrorism are merely one further stage in the civil war that has been ravaging the country for more than 25 years. Above all, however, these extremely violent acts against civilians only serve to postpone even further the prospect of organising the elections planned by the government for 2002–2003.</p>
<p class="contents">When he announced, on 23 August, his intention not to stand in the presidential elections, President dos Santos threw the ball back into the rebels’ court. He says that he is prepared to hold free and democratic elections, provided that the war comes to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">The pause in the fighting and the restoration of a peaceful climate are due, according to him, to Mr Savimbi and his militant movement. Yet Mr Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, says that he wants to negotiate. In reality, of course, sitting comfortably on his diamonds, he wants only one thing: all the power.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also responsible here, because who is it who supplies UNITA with arms? Who is it who participates in this diamond trafficking? As for the government, it is not transparent either. The lack of transparency in the management of petroleum revenue leads us to conclude that public funds have been used to back up the regime. The Angolagate scandal has revealed the role of Europeans in this affair.</p>
<p class="contents">The violence has to stop, and dialogue must be initiated as a matter of urgency. Angolans must vote for and achieve peace. The European Union can make its influence felt, and it has a role to play here. It should be reminded of that fact, and we must vote in favour of this resolution in order to go forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We condemn UNITA today with the same independence with which, in February, we condemned the MPLA and the Angolan government for persecuting journalists.

<p class="contents">We have watched these terrible events unfold in Angola with profound and heartfelt regret. The suffering of the Angolans and of these innocent civilian victims of the attack by UNITA or of other events gives us no satisfaction. We do not see these occurrences as a triumph that should feed the warlike approach of the government and prolong the war. We must remember the tragedy that Angola has experienced for the last twenty-six years, in a never-ending violent bipolarisation of the country, of which the Angolan people are weary. </p>
<p class="contents">This phase of the civil war, we must remember, is the third wave of the war, and each wave has been more brutal than the last. It is clearly the consequence of UNITA’s failing to meet its commitments, but it is also the consequence of President dos Santos’s plan, announced in December 1998, to use weapons to destroy his old enemy.</p>
<p class="contents">This could only lead to disaster and, once again, it is a disaster that we are witnessing.</p>
<p class="contents">With your permission, I should like to read from the account of a missionary who returned from Angola a few months ago: “In 2000, Angola celebrated 25 years of independence. In 2001 it ‘commemorated’ 40 years of war. There are now three generations of Angolans for whom living in wartime is all that they know. I lived in Cuíto and Huambo between 1989 and 1994. I saw boundless hope etched on the faces of many Angolans, who were crushed by commitments that had never been met. Now, when it is clear that there is no military solution to the conflict, – not that there ever was! – people are saying more than ever that arms are the key to peace. Whilst this is being said and put into practice, young people are abandoning their studies, adults are not working and children are not going to school, hospitals are without medicines and this armed route will not lead Angola to any kind of future”. Serious incidents are occurring, such as those that we are condemning today. The missionary goes on to say: “I cannot, however, accept such a conclusion about a country that is so rich in natural and, above all, in human resources.”</p>
<p class="contents">This priest, Father Tony Neves, who has a profound knowledge of Angola, finishes with a dream of peace, but warns us that “25 years after independence, Angola has only two options: peace or total destruction”.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what must make us aware of our responsibilities. We cannot work with the warlords, whether they are involved in diamonds or oil. We can only rely on those who are fighting for peace without weapons in their hands, those who, inspired by the churches, by Archbishop Kamuenho, by the Interdenominational Committee for Peace, are rising up in civil society. We can only rely on those on the moderate wings of UNITA and the MPLA, such as the former prime ministers Marcolino Môco and Lôpo de Nascimento, such as certain journalists of whom we sometimes hear because of the persecution to which they are subjected, such as certain moderate UNITA Members of Parliament like Chivukuvuku Jaka Jamba, many moderate people in the MPLA and, above all, other small parties in the Angolan Parliament, whose voices are never heard. Why do we never hear these people, such as Filomeno Vieira Lopes and Mfulopinda Nando Vítor, who have never taken up arms?</p>
<p class="contents">These are the people we should listen to, because Angola does not only consist of the dos Santoses and the Savimbis. Angola belongs to the Angolan people, and we must listen to the spokespeople of those who are suffering and not always the spokespeople who are doing the killing.</p>
<p class="contents">The candidature of Archbishop Zacarias Kamuenho is part of this approach and I urge all honourable Members to ensure that we, as an international community, understand the tragedy of the Angolan people. The cold war is long since past and it is high time that the international community stopped pouring oil on the flames of Angola and contributed responsibly to peace, to dialogue and to a bilateral, simultaneous and immediate cease-fire. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are some of the most violent and reprehensible terrorist acts in living memory. I therefore feel that the European Parliament too must express its repudiation of such acts in the most forceful terms, as the rest of the international community and, in particular, the other Community institutions have done by unequivocally condemning such barbarity.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, and if any doubts could possibly remain, these acts have brutally shown the correct nature of the positions that have been successively adopted by the international community which, with a single voice, has called for and is implementing the isolation of UNITA and the imposition of sanctions on it. That organisation had already given sufficient proof of being largely responsible for the tragic situation affecting Angola and its people, through its rejection of election results, obstructing the disarming of its forces and, more generally, through waging war and not respecting and even blocking the implementation of agreements that they themselves have signed.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, however, with such acts of vandalism, UNITA is revealing its true colours even more clearly and there is no longer room for any doubt, however small, as to the nature and the objectives of this organisation. This is why there are even fewer grounds for holding equivocal positions, particularly where the European Parliament is concerned. Any positions or initiatives, particularly when formulated by friends of UNITA such as Mr Ribeiro and Castro, which tend to condone, exonerate or divert attention from the huge responsibilities of UNITA in the tragic situation that Angola is experiencing are completely unacceptable. This applies also, and especially, to those that tend to place the legitimate government of Angola on an equal footing with this type of terrorist organisation. As a matter of fact, it is now clearer than ever that any path to peace in Angola requires holding UNITA responsible, ensuring its political and diplomatic isolation, ending the diamond trade that sustains it and disarming it for good.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I should just like to say a few words about the motion for a resolution that we shall be voting on next. Its approval, despite the odd provision that is not worthy of adoption and is not essential, would be a positive development in that it would enable the European Parliament to adopt its traditional position of aligning itself with the international community and with the other Community institutions on this matter. In particular, I would like to emphasise the correctness of the decision adopted by the resolution to call the acts that UNITA has recently been perpetrating ‘terrorist’ acts. This is the right word to describe them and all concomitant conclusions should be drawn from that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the subject of Mauritania, first of all, we share the concerns that have been expressed regarding respect for human rights in Mauritania. In recent years we have observed some progress. This has now come to an end, and we are experiencing a period of sudden backward steps. Like the Members who have spoken during the debate, we believe that the Union cannot remain silent in the face of the imprisonment of the leader of the opposition, Mr Chbih, in the conditions that we are aware of and in particular in the period leading up to the elections. Therefore we, like you, believe that steps should be taken to ask for the release of Mr Chbih while the result of his appeal to the court of cassation is awaited, at the same time using this opportunity to remind the authorities of the principles to which the Union is committed with regard to the electoral process. The release of Mr Chbih and the holding of the elections this coming October are our two priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of Togo, again we share your concern, both about the imprisonment of a local journalist in May and about the imprisonment of the two leaders of the opposition parties, Mr Olympio in June, and Mr Agboyibo just recently. All these names and all these facts have been mentioned, in particular by Mr Rod. We should like to follow up our approach to the Togolese Minister for Foreign Affairs on 17 August, when once again we expressed our concerns to the Togolese government. At the time, I believe that we got a clear message across, to the effect that, from the point of view of the Union, the political parties and the media must be able to continue their activities without restrictions. So far, our approach has not had any effect. We believe that the statement made in August by the Prime Minister, in which he mentioned the need to postpone the elections and proposed that the electoral code should be amended, which some Members have mentioned, is not good news and does not help to create a climate which is conducive to the conducting of transparent, free and democratic elections. On this subject we have noted with satisfaction the statement made by President Eyadema, in which he said that on this point the Prime Minister’s proposals committed only the Prime Minister himself, whereas he, the President, intended to respect the constitution and abide by the undertakings given under the Lomé Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We are continuing to monitor the political and economic situation and we shall maintain our position, to the effect that we can render assistance to the electoral process by helping the government to create the necessary conditions, notwithstanding the suspension of our cooperation with Togo which, as you know, was decided on under the provisions of the Lomé Convention, which corresponds to what would now be Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. From this point of view, Mr Rod, we are already past the Article 96 stage. The Union has also responded positively to the invitation from the Togolese Minister for Foreign Affairs to participate in a mission to observe the elections. If the United Nations decided to take on the task of coordinating such an observer mission, we would not have any objections. However, the conditions for organising and implementing such an observer mission still have to be determined. If it is decided to go ahead with such a mission, obviously Parliament’s participation in that mission would be welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">As for human rights in Cambodia, the Commission and the Member States have been officially invited by Cambodia to nominate and dispatch observers to monitor the local elections. With this in mind, we have sent a fact-finding mission. The conclusions and recommendations of that mission will be examined by the Council during September, so as to decide whether or not we should organise a Community observer mission to monitor the local elections. We are also ready to assist in the smooth running of those elections by means of technical assistance projects. On the question of electoral registration, Mrs Maes, the latest figures available to us indicate that the overall rate of registration is just over 80%, which is an improvement on the previous figures, though 100% registration has still not been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the question of how we should deal with the past, which some of you have mentioned, I would remind you that we support without reservation the efforts of the United Nations and of the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia to reach an agreement concerning the court responsible for the Khmer Rouge trials.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the Afghan refugees seeking asylum in Australia, we, like Mrs Kinnock, are relieved that a solution has been found which will provide the help and protection needed by those people, men, women and children, who are fleeing from one of the most intolerant of all regimes. If I have understood you correctly, your speeches were not intended to put any particular third country in the dock, but rather to consider whether, in the context of the present system of international governance, there are any remedies that would enable us to handle this type of situation better.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right, we cannot remain insensitive. We all know that there are other ships carrying other fugitives from misery, often in the most appalling conditions, and that these ships arrive, some of them off the coasts of Europe. This is not a question of ‘the rest of the world’, from which we can remain detached, any more it is a question of looking at it purely in the light of the problems that it may give rise to elsewhere. There is clearly a growing malaise in the international community with regard to forced migration, whether it is of economic, political or criminal origin, because this is how we must describe the organised networks trafficking in human beings. Mr Medina Ortega, we share the desire which you and other Members have expressed for international instruments to be adopted which will be able to prevent and settle such cases, and also your desire at least to update and amend the 1951 Convention so that it can cope with the present situation, which is not the same as it was in the 1950s. From this point of view, we support the efforts initiated by the High Commissioner for Refugees, which were announced on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of that Convention. The High Commissioner for Refugees played an important role in dealing with the crisis involving the <span class="italic">Tampa</span>, and I believe that we should all encourage the Commissioner to put this type of problem on the agenda of the consultations which, following the Geneva Conference in December, should enable us to update our rules, because that is what they are, international rules. We must also remember the importance of the protocols on trafficking in human beings which are annexed to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime of December 2000. The Community is itself a party to those protocols which, when they come into force, after a certain number of ratifications, will improve the joint framework that we have at our disposal in order to combat such crime.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Union itself is concerned, and we really <span class="italic">are </span>concerned, as I have said, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions of the Tampere European Council provided the basis for a common policy on asylum and immigration. I believe that the Union, by means of these instruments and various declarations, has repeated its commitment and that of its Member States to a humanitarian tradition which should take the form of the creation of a common asylum regime which provides appropriate protection to any person who needs it, and which guarantees the principle of not turning people away.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this will not work without preventive measures in the countries and regions of origin. We took a step in the right direction here when the Council adopted a certain number of action plans prepared by the immigration and asylum group. One of these plans is specifically targeted at Afghanistan and neighbouring regions. If it proves to be ineffective, we shall have to look at it again, and we shall rely on Parliament to point us in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as trafficking in human beings is concerned, we need to strengthen the action taken by the Union, especially in cases where the victims are able to benefit from international protection. Here too, the Commission takes the view that a more systematic and coherent approach is needed. We shall shortly be taking action with a view to achieving this, by issuing a communication.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all turning into a timetable of action for the Union. Work has started within the Council. To be perfectly honest, we think that things are proceeding very slowly, but this is only to be expected given the sensitive nature of these issues from the point of view of Member States. No doubt we shall need fresh impetus at an appropriately high political level, probably at the European Council in Laeken. At any rate, that is what the Presidency seems to think. It goes without saying that Parliament’s support in this matter will, we are sure, enable us to proceed in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of the attack on a train in Angola, there is not much that I can add. Much of what has been said we can all agree on anyway. Like you, the Commission is very concerned about the continuation of this war, and deplores the fact that these confrontations are intensifying and that, yet again, several hundred civilians have been killed in various regions of the country over the last few weeks. We are absolutely determined to support the efforts being taken, in accordance with the Union’s common position, to find a political solution to the conflict in Angola. I did not get the impression, from your speeches, that you are seriously critical of that common position. We are therefore working towards implementing it, by supporting any proposal which seeks to support the initiatives being made by the African Union – and there <span class="italic">are</span> some – or by African regional organisations such as the Southern Africa Development Community, with a view to developing the systems which have been set up on the initiative of African countries in order to prevent and resolve conflicts. I would remind you that we are continuing our humanitarian aid to Angola, which is substantial, and that we are consequently ready to adjust the nature and the scale of that humanitarian aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Long after peace has been concluded, and I hope that even in Angola that will one day be the case, there will still be fields that cannot be walked on, because they are full of mines and therefore put innocent people are at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1997, a treaty was concluded banning landmines. One hundred and forty-nine countries have already signed it. Many countries have ratified it, but 52 have not and they include some of the largest nations. One of the major problems is that not only regular armies lay the mines, but that terrorist and rebel movements also use them. That is why it is necessary that they should be urged to stop using landmines.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult for an official body like ours to involve non-governmental players in the negotiations, but it is good that we as an official body should urge the countries not to stockpile landmines and that we should support the NGOs that are striving to get the terrorist organisations and rebel movements to forsake the use of landmines. I refer in this context to the appeal of Geneva, which we have heard proposed here this week in our own Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Landmines kill, every day and in many countries. Landmines are a lethal threat daily in many dozens of countries. In Kampuchea alone, over 35 000 people have been injured by landmines and those are the survivors. Every day, mines are removed and every day new ones are laid.</p>
<p class="contents">The anti-landmine treaty of 1997 has been ratified by 19 countries and signed by 141. Countries that have not yet signed include Russia, Yugoslavia, but also Finland, which uses mines to defend its border with Russia. That is, of course, cheaper and helps bring down the defence budget. We can understand that. If Finland can use that argument, however, why not other countries too? I should therefore like to call on the Member States to force present and future members, as well as countries that receive financial aid from the European Union, to sign the treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Most EU Member States no longer have anti-personnel landmines in the operational armouries of their armed forces. These weapons have indeed been banned for the past four years. It is only irresponsible armed forces such as those in former Yugoslavia and armed groups of non-state actors engaged in civil war and insurgency that continue to use these dreadful weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">By definition such groups are not party to the Ottawa Convention to ban landmines. This resolution draws attention to the fact and seeks to find ways in which these groups can be influenced. This requires very careful consideration as we must take great care that we do not imply any sort of recognition of the legitimacy of these groups or of their actions. We do not wish to distract EU resources from the priority task of mine clearance and assistance to mine victims. We wish to bring this matter to the attention of all the states party to the Ottawa Convention that will gather in Managua in Nicaragua later this month. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that at the next meeting of the contracting parties to the Convention which will take place in Managua, the European Union should contribute to ensuring that the Convention is signed and ratified by more countries. There are 52 which have not signed it and many who are still to ratify it. It should also contribute to ensuring that more resources are provided for the complete clearing of mines, since mines which are still buried are causing death and mutilation throughout the world, and the parties involved – State and non-State agents – should be forced to reach an agreement on a total ban of these mines.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end by asking for recognition and support for the work of NGOs such as the initiative launched by the humanitarian organisation ‘Geneva Appeal’ and others, which are going to contribute to the disappearance of such a lethal and odious weapon as anti-personnel mines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that is the question that is being asked and the question to which you are asking us to reply.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, first of all we have equipped ourselves with a framework of rules for the Union, and just before the summer recess we adopted two regulations against mines, so that we now have legal instruments on the basis of which we shall be able to take effective and coordinated action.</p>
<p class="contents">Then at the end of this month we shall be actively participating, together with the presidency, at the meeting in Nicaragua of signatory states to the Ottawa Convention, a meeting which we believe is extremely important, because we shall of course be discussing the challenges posed by the abolition of anti-personnel mines, sharing the practical experiences of those who have been involved in this action and, as most of you have asked us to do, putting pressure on those states which have not yet signed the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the objective remains the same and we are determined to achieve it, by obtaining a universal prohibition on the production, stockpiling, movement and use of anti-personnel landmines.</p>
<p class="contents">The achieving of this objective and the removal of the risk to which the millions of mines which still have to be removed from areas of conflict throughout the world expose not only human lives, but also economic activities, is chiefly the task of states and governments. There is no doubt about that. Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that non-government actors also use anti-personnel landmines in internal conflicts or conflicts between states, and they too bear a responsibility for the suffering and devastation caused to populations and societies by mines</p>
<p class="contents">Experience has shown, as you have pointed out, that we need to explore new ways of involving non-governmental agencies in these campaigns against landmines, and of making them subscribe to the objective of a complete ban on such devices. From this point of view, the Geneva appeal is an initiative with laudable intentions, but we must make sure that any future initiatives of this kind take place in the context of the considerable efforts which have already been undertaken by the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament knows, the international campaign to prohibit landmines has assumed the form of a worldwide movement which the European Union has supported since the beginning. This international campaign, in conjunction with a certain number of governmental and non-governmental agreements, has drawn up standards and action programmes which will supplement the international regulations of which the Ottawa Convention is an example.</p>
<p class="contents">We would therefore like to see, alongside this international regulatory framework, initiatives being set up to strengthen the action that is being taken within states and civilian society, and we are ready to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must analyse this Geneva appeal in detail, and encourage those who have instigated it to coordinate their activities closely with the ICBL and with other major agreements, so as to ensure that all the forces that are mobilised towards this objective never run the risk, given the magnitude of what is at stake here, of becoming dispersed. There is still a lot to be done to consolidate the ambitious demands and objectives that were defined by the Ottawa Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I will use part of my speaking time to say that this has had short-term consequences. In brief: one and a half million people are suffering from hunger in the region, not to mention the long-term consequences for sustainable development and the climate.</p>
<p class="contents">So far the European institutions have reacted by trying to alleviate the short-term consequences: with emergency aid and with deliveries of food, which have gone some way to alleviating the hunger in the region. So far we have been incapable of responding to the long-term needs or shortages.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution asks the Commission firstly to take account of these needs when drawing up the 2002 budget. Secondly, that it implement actions which will serve to accelerate and promote a sustainable development policy in the field of agricultural development, which will serve to prevent drought and the long-term consequences which I mentioned previously. Thirdly, I refer to section 4, relating to a policy of cooperation with the region in the long term, which would help to meet the needs which I stressed before. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First there were the death squads and the extreme right governments. Then, with democracy won thanks to the mediation of the European Union, there were corrupt governments; then there were the catastrophes of Hurricane Mitch, earthquakes and now this drought, which, as has been said, means hunger, misery and death for hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must behave with a solidarity which distinguishes it from others, not only by approving budgets for this circumstance, but, as has been said, also for the coming years, by approving important and essential budgets which will eliminate the causes and consequences of this drought.</p>
<p class="contents">I drafted the report on the reconstruction of Central America after Hurricane Mitch, and I have seen that the corruption in the area prevents aid from arriving directly. We therefore recommend that the aid which we grant arrives in the most direct way possible by means of local councils and democratic NGOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are tragedies, however, which persist while nobody talks about them, which get worse and fester although they do not make the headlines.</p>
<p class="contents">One of those cases filed away in our selective first-world memory is the situation in Central America and the dramatic effects of the drought which has been devastating it for more than three months. This is a tragedy which is unfolding in a region, as has been said, which is already weakened by constant natural disasters, quite apart from political disasters, and which has a social and economic structure lacking the least resources for resisting them.</p>
<p class="contents">El Salvador has declared a state of emergency and Guatemala just yesterday declared a state of public disaster, in a truly desperate attempt to combat hunger. The drought has destroyed the majority of the crops in the region and hunger is now affecting millions of people, as previous speakers have said. All of this in an area where an extremely high percentage of inhabitants live in poverty or extreme poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations world food programme raised the alarm very recently, telling us that if the current situation continues, it will only be able to meet the needs of half of the affected citizens for barely three months.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore draw your attention in particular to the recommendation contained in section 4 which, in relation to that in section 3, seeks to direct our decisions in the field of development aid towards the objective of combating the structural problems. Only in that way, by investing in sustainable development in the most sensitive areas of the world, will we be able to prevent and alleviate as far as possible the effects of natural disasters, because we will have invested our aid and our resources in the structuring and strengthening of the population and we will have made them stronger so that they can endure the consequences of phenomena which not even we, in the first world, can prevent.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for Europe to be able to give out fishing rods, to show people how to fish, rather than to hand out fish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any event, we in the European Parliament delegation for relations with the countries of Central America were in El Salvador in July and were able to see the consequences of the earthquakes and of Hurricane Mitch. In fact there is a very important European Union programme for the rehabilitation of institutes in that area; at the moment, however, the worst thing of all, which we were informed of in July, is what is happening as a result of the drought.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must envisage two types of aid: immediate aid, to prevent starvation, and a more long-term aid, in order to work towards sustainable development; because the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believes that earthquakes, floods and droughts are going to become increasingly common, and in precisely the poorest parts of the world, which are least able to endure them. Therefore, I believe that the European Union must use two approaches: immediate aid, which they requested of us when we were there in July, and more long-term aid, in order to prevent what is happening now from happening again.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned about the distribution of aid. It must be very well controlled by the services of the European Commission that are on the ground, so that it may reach the people genuinely affected. Some complaints have been made about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current drought in these countries is certainly the worst since the one caused by El Niño in 1997. For the moment, however, we believe it is going too far to compare the situation with the one that followed Hurricane Mitch. There is constant contact between the Commission and the representatives of the countries of Central America, and we believe, along with the representatives of those countries with whom we are working, that the situation is certainly extremely worrying, but that at this stage it is under control, and is unlikely to continue for very long because the rains will soon be returning to most of the areas affected by the drought.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the rains are due to return shortly, that should not prevent us from thinking about the real causes of these crises which, as you have all, I believe, pointed out, are due to cyclical factors but also, and above all, to structural factors, including the falling incomes from primary products, especially coffee, the probably inappropriate nature of agricultural policies, and increasingly difficult access for many rural families to production inputs, not to mention the poverty which is undoubtedly rife in all these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to monitoring, I should just like to say that the Commission and the Union now have a network of antennae which enables us to monitor the food situation in all the regions that are susceptible. One of these antennae is located in Central America and will enable us to be alerted instantly so that we can intervene if necessary. The heart of the problem, that is, the structural causes of the lack of food security in the region, is the real problem that we will have to face in the medium and long term, as some of you have pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important solutions, as we see it, is rural development, and this is already a priority in the Union’s action and cooperation in most of the countries concerned, and we would like to see it strengthened even more by the pooling of efforts, whether that means aid to local governments to enable them to concentrate their development policy in that area, something that we can actually do, or whether it means support for the projects of non-governmental organisations or local communities seeking to diversify production and crop distribution and to create family incomes of another kind, or whether it means coordination with other international donors, like Member States, or the Bretton Woods institutions, or, finally, whether it means putting in place programmes to reduce poverty in the countries concerned. Like you, we are convinced that we shall have to cope with short-term emergencies, but that the problem is a deep-seated one and is one of the fundamental causes that will have to be tackled if we wish to avoid a repetition of the same problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Activities have therefore been planned over the coming year at international, national and local level to promote the sustainable development of mountain regions. The main objectives of the International Year of Mountains are to create awareness and increase knowledge about mountain ecosystems and their dynamics and operation, to promote and maintain the cultural heritage of mountain communities and the maintenance and sustainable development of resources in mountain regions to safeguard the quality of life of the population now and in the future. Finally, mountain regions account for about 30% of the land area and 20% of the utilised agricultural area in the European Union and 10% of the population of the EU live there.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that the European Union should also use the coming International Year of Mountains as an opportunity to express the specific concerns of mountain regions and recognise mountain regions as indispensable habitats. At the same time, the quality of life in mountain regions must be maintained and protected and the constant threat of exodus must be stopped. This report is also, by definition, the European Parliament's position on the International Year of Mountains and should be seen by the Commission and the Council as our basic wish list.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically I call in this report, which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for a comprehensive EU strategy for mountain regions. The report contains numerous new and, to my mind, practical proposals which I call on you to support during the coming vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is thus called on, first, to submit a communication this year setting out EU actions in connection with the International Year of Mountains. I think this communication should contain a comprehensive concept for the regions in question with regard to the period after 2006 and with regard to enlargement. This will, of necessity, include revising Directive 268/75 and subsequent amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I should like to clarify that the overall concept needed must take account of the principle of subsidiarity. Despite what are often similar problems and difficulties, it is a fact that even mountain regions differ in their individual characteristics, meaning that there is no universal patent solution. Common problems can be solved more efficiently by means of a cross-border approach.</p>
<p class="contents">My report therefore advocates an approach which takes equal account of the following areas: farming and forestry, transport, tourism, energy and water, regional planning, nature conservation and the maintenance of the common cultural heritage.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a few words on individual demands set out in the report. Agriculture: basically it calls for the second pillar of agricultural policy, the development of rural areas, to be extended, taking appropriate account of the contribution made by farming to the environment and the countryside and the multifunctional character of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to find common problem-solving strategies in the form of regional conventions, set and update criteria and data on mountain areas and fund practical, mountain-related projects under the sixth framework programme, extend the basic infrastructure needed and provide training and further training so that the population keeps abreast of events and strengthen transport networks in mountain regions, taking account of the principle of sustainability, in order to safeguard these regions as habitats and economic areas and nature areas. This means, for example, that access roads to farms and alpine pastures must be guaranteed, while bigger roads must comply with criteria of strict eco-compatibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, last but not least, mountain regions need special treatment in the run up to enlargement. The forthcoming International Year of Mountains is an ideal time, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to discuss the specifics of tomorrow's proposal. You, ladies and gentlemen, by voting in favour of my report, and more importantly you, Commissioner, and the Commission, by implementing the ideas contained in it can make a fundamental contribution to this development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to start by thanking Mr Ebner for his own initiative report. This is a report which I can wholeheartedly support. Given that, as Mr Ebner has just said, mountain regions account for around 30% of the land area in the EU, while in many Member States, such as Austria, they account for as much as 50%, I welcome and support this own initiative report.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of mountain ecosystems is a cultural heritage. The maintenance and sustainable management of resources is very important in numerous regions of Europe. The protection of mountain regions, forests, water, the ecological balance and biodiversity needs to be set out in an overall European concept. Many mountains straddle frontiers. Many problems can only be solved more efficiently by means of a cross-border approach and by joining forces. I must stress that farming and forestry have a multifunctional role in mountain regions and that this will be hugely important in an enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the people who live in the mountains and the tourists who visit every year looking for rest and relaxation value this unique natural and cultural landscape, which is why we must create appropriate incentives for people to live and work there. We must take precautions to prevent the ecological and socio-economic consequences of exodus and depopulation. Sustainable cultivation by mountain farmers not only provides quality food, it also renders a huge service to mankind as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations have rightly proclaimed 2002 as the International Year of Mountains. I think it is important for Europe to take a stance now and for the Commission to present a communication as quickly as possible, setting out a really clear definition, taking account of criteria such as altitude, gradient and the vegetation which has been cut down so that we can really address the various problems throughout Europe, and proposing appropriate concepts for strategies and development mechanisms.</p>

<p class="contents">However, amongst its many and, I believe, very valuable, proposals, I would like to draw your attention to certain issues which, on this forthcoming celebration of the silver wedding of mountain farming, should receive very special, and in some cases new, attention.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring, firstly, to the role which should be recognised for women in this new multifunctional mountain farming. For them, a new approach is required today which is very different from their obsolete marginalisation within the traditional CAP. This proposal appears in section 19 of the Ebner report, but if we want to do it well, Mr Fischler, coordinated approach is required.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the new agriculture of the mountain regions, women currently play many important roles, both in relation to agriculture and in relation to tourism, rural development, rural tourism, new technologies and in relation to craft-industry, commercial and economic policies. I hope you understand, Commissioner, that their potential could be enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to draw your attention to the proposal contained in section 22, which also relates to another of today’s pressing problems, that of migration policies. It is proposed that mountain regions where population is decreasing could serve as reception areas for absorbing immigrants, given suitable socio-economic planning.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Commissioner, I believe that compensation measures should be taken to prevent mountain regions receiving less structural aid than they receive at the moment as a result of enlargement. This must be prevented, because enlargement must not under any circumstances have a negative impact on these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I think that small and medium-sized farms should be promoted by means of a modulation of aid that stimulates employment.</p>

The report speaks for itself: it is complete and exhaustive and also has the merit of setting mountain farming in a wider and more general context of mountain problems. I think this approach is the right one for achieving a genuine European policy in 2002: International Year of Mountains.</p>
<p class="contents">You see, Commissioner, Agenda 2000 does mention mountain farming, but everything gets more complicated at the implementation stage, for instance when Italian regions give notification of intervention laws for mountain areas, for example on animal husbandry or indeed on natural disasters which have already occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, your ‘Agriculture’ Directorate is turning into a worthy and legitimate control body. It is beginning a long correspondence made up of requests for minute details. It will take at least six months or even more for definite replies to come in, frequently stamped on the closing date, sometimes using the competition rules which always seem to deny the particular characteristics of mountain agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Sooner or later, especially in the Alpine areas of the Union – lucky Switzerland takes care of its mountains without this network of controls – this could lead to an anti-European backlash. That is why we ask you, Commissioner, to publicise the principles of this report on agriculture and remember, not just occasionally, that the Union has signed the Agriculture Protocol of the Alpine Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A good report. Like under a burning glass, mountain farming shows what happens when you try and master sustainable land management tailored to a particular location. Your report also has a drawback, however. It only focuses on this aspect. It is interesting that the House, or rather those still in it – although they do, after all, represent the majorities – can reach a majority understanding on these numerous excellent proposals and warnings. It is true of agriculture as a whole that we should have fostered sustainable management in general, but then there would have been no agreement here, so that this acts as an alibi and that is a pity. However, that should not detract from the usefulness of this report and we shall, of course, vote in favour of it. We should like, however, to widen this debate to agriculture as a whole in order to achieve sustainable land management tailored to each particular location. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we know, the trend is towards greater liberalisation of agricultural production and the concentration of land and production in the hands of fewer and fewer people, with the result that mountain regions are sinking faster and faster into economic and social stagnation.</p>
<p class="contents">All that the proposal to offset the reduction in Community support for these regions by applying national and regional measures means in practice is that the European Union will completely abandon mountain regions and will attempt to shift even the miserable and ineffective support of the last 25 years on to its Member States. This shift will have a massively adverse impact on countries such as Greece, which have a high proportion of mountain regions and a small budget, with the result that it will be impossible to support these regions from national funds. In addition, this sort of proposal recommends nationalising the financing for policies formulated by the European Union, meaning that the poorest countries will be forced to apply anti-farming Community policy without any compensation or support measures and pay for it out of their own pockets.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the proposal to reject the removal of the milk quota system in mountain regions on the grounds of reduced competitiveness and high production costs is proof of the total lack of any social criteria and the annoying hypocrisy of the European Union's environmentally-friendly pronouncements, given that the same restrictive measures are being applied to mountain and industrial livestock farming, while we all know the differences between them as regards both the environment and public health. What with grim neo-liberal criteria and the profit and competition argument, mountain regions are condemned to stagnation and abandonment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for these reasons that we shall be voting against the report, because we believe that the specific measures proposed, operating within the more general framework of Agenda 2000 and the so-called competitiveness argument will not only reverse, they will speed up the economic stagnation and desertification of mountain regions, with huge economic, social and environmental consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself come from a region where there are mountains and where transhumance is practised, in our case with flocks of sheep. It really is an ideal form of farming, especially for the European Commission. You have the countryside, forests, biodiversity and the environment, you are preventing soil erosion and producing high-quality products, honey, meat and fruit, you have the tourist industry, and you put the accent on quality of life. Above all, you are not practising productivism, you are not farming intensively, you are not annoying the United States in the world markets in wheat, oilseeds and animal proteins. Basically, hill and mountain farming is multi-functionalism without the quantities. It is the Austrian model that the 2006 reform of the CAP intends to generalise throughout Europe, including the lowland areas. It conjures up a picture of rosy-cheeked milkmaids, accompanied, of course, by Commissioner Fischler, frolicking among haystacks, cow-bells, marmots and alpine pastures, and stroking rare-breed cows, while Mr Bush’s Texans have a monopoly in the meat market.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us say yes to hill and mountain farming, in the hills and mountains, but no to a European farming industry reduced by WTO negotiations to a series of theme parks with peasants dressed up by Mike Moore to look like Walt Disney characters, whose job would be to entertain Anglo-Saxon tourists and conserve the landscape. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We could return to the subject at a later stage in another way and produce some costings and a tighter, more comprehensive proposal as to how we will put the ideals expressed in this report into effect. We have to consider too that we will have a conflict. Firstly there is the size of the budget we have and enlargement, which will also lead to an increase in the mountainous area within the European Union, while at the same time we refuse to produce any resources to finance the very idealistic proposals in this report which most people in this House would subscribe to.</p>
<p class="contents">In parts of the European Union at this moment people drive two hours to work in their cars, two hours home and live in overcrowded circumstances. All the utilities are over-utilised while in other areas we are closing down public services. Roads are under-utilised, we are withdrawing police stations and closing down little churches and schools.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union should not make the mistake the Americans made. We should not abandon vast areas of our countries, where human activity will fade away. These mountains will not be attractive if there are no villages, if there are no variable scenes of farms and livestock and people living there. They will not provide the tourist amenities we need in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">If we allow this to happen, it will be like what we did in my country 50 years ago when we closed down our railways. We will regret it in 40 or 50 years from now. If we lose these areas as habitats for human beings and everything that goes with that then Europe will be so much the poorer and we will regret it.</p>
<p class="contents">We should fight within the European Union because individual States have failed. I was in Scotland during the summer and I have seen the extent to which the Highlands have been denuded of their population. Britain is much the poorer for that. If we allow this to happen elsewhere we will have a Europe that will be much poorer. We should return to this subject later and make firm proposals for the budgetary resources that we, as a Union, could use towards this end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We represent only a little over 5% of the inhabitants of Europe, of European citizens, but, as documented in the annals of the European Parliament over fifty years of the European Union, this is only the third time that the word ‘mountain’ and a motion for a resolution about mountains have been heard in this Chamber. The first time was in 1983. The rapporteur then was Mr Colleselli, from Cadore, in the North of Italy. The second time, fifteen years later, I myself had the honour and the duty of bringing the problems of the mountains to this House, with my report on a new strategy for mountain regions, approved on 23 October 1998. My report started from an overall view of the problems of mountain regions, in all their complexity, and concluded that mountain farming was and remains the key.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ebner report – and I congratulate the rapporteur on the specific detail he has been able to put into it – takes this aspect further and opens up another horizon. I can state that he starts precisely from the conclusions of the previous report by indicating that the salvation of the mountains we are all calling for can start from the farming sector itself.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are all aware, once again, that farming cannot do it alone. That is why there are also proposals in Mr Ebner’s report which involve the whole mountain world: transport, infrastructure, tourism, the eco-system.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another factor we must protect and safeguard; the vital factor for the mountains, Commissioner, is and remains man. The average age of farmers in Europe – as you know –is about 50. Some mountain farmers are over 60. That is a dire statistic for the future of the mountains.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make mountain farming attractive again, give the farmers confidence, and give them resources. Above all we must have the courage to recognise, Commissioner, that a specific type of farming called mountain farming exists. Let us do so with conviction so that the mountains themselves can continue to exist! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has always seen hill and mountain farming as a very important and highly interesting subject. I should like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, more importantly, the rapporteur, Mr Ebner, for this own initiative report on 25 years’ application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming.</p>
<p class="contents">Starting with the 1998 Santini report on a new strategy for hill and mountain farming and with the International Year of Mountains coming up next year, the Ebner report highlights the importance of mountain regions to the European Union. In particular, it stresses the importance of environmental protection and the need to maintain natural beauty spots, produce quality products and urgently maintain the cultural heritage. It also points out that the viability of the countryside in mountain regions goes far beyond agriculture and depends on a multitude of factors.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from this starting premise that the same questions preoccupy us. Multifunctionality is also the cornerstone of our new rural development policy. It aims to promote farming in which all functions and services are recognised, every function which farmers offer our society.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an integral part of the European farming model and I can assure you, in response to a number of concerns expressed in the report, that the Commission will stand squarely behind the need to take account of this aspect during trade negotiations at the World Trade Association.</p>
<p class="contents">With enlargement impending, the report calls on the Commission to create a global strategy for mountain regions and hill and mountain farming both in the Member States and in the candidate countries. On this point, I must say, the Commission approach differs from the approach taken in the report. May I remind you that the new rural development policy only started up last year. We placed subsidiarity right at the forefront of this new policy, so that the Member States could set their own priorities and include what they consider are the most suitable measures for making the best of their regions and dealing with local drawbacks or difficulties in their rural development plans or Structural Fund planning documents.</p>
<p class="contents">This decentralised approach, which also applies to the SAPARD programmes, means that the rural development programme can be properly tailored to mountain regions and can accommodate the differences between them. For example, the Pyrenees need different concepts from the Alps. This fosters sustainable development which takes account both of socio-economic problems and the environmental challenges facing each of these regions. Instead of laying down central guidelines, as was recently the case, we should be discussing how best to implement the mountain region policy in detail not just with all the Union institutions and bodies, the Member States, the regions and the local authorities but also with our economic and social partners, non-governmental organisations and scientific circles.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out, <span class="italic">à propos</span>, that the Commission accepted the second report on economic and social cohesion on 31 January this year. This report raises the question of setting priorities for the balanced and sustained development of the regions in an enlarged Union and the question of covering increased cohesion requirements, to mention just two, and calls for discussion on the subject. This report offers numerous opportunities to develop regions lagging behind.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of the Commission's contribution to the International Year of Mountains, therefore, is to advertise our current development mechanisms more widely. The Commission will organise a seminar in the second half of the year at Commissioner Barnier's and my initiative, the purpose of which will be to present and advertise the opportunities which Community policy offers mountain regions. You and any other interested parties are also invited to attend.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to the report, I should like to emphasise that it is already possible as the law now stands to provide targeted support for hill and mountain farming through compensatory payments, which form and shall continue to form our basic support for mountain regions, and through environmental measures, through aid for forestry, through processing aid and marketing aid or through diversification aid, for example in the tourism sector. I should also like to remind you, Mrs Rojo, that the instructions for drawing up rural development programmes state that express reference must be made to programmes specifically for women and that each of the rural development programmes must contain a chapter describing specific help for women.</p>
<p class="contents">The same rules apply to rural development and the common organisations of the market. These too take account of the specific nature of extensive farming, especially in mountain regions, either through specific, customised measures such as beef extensification premiums or premiums for sheepmeat or goatmeat production or by giving the Member States additional room to manoeuvre by allowing them to give special support to regions of their choice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will address special treatment for farmers in mountain regions in relation to milk quotas, as proposed in the report, as part of its midterm review. Finally, we should not forget, with reference to the Structural Funds, that 95% of mountain regions come under Objective 1 or Objective 2. These mountain regions can all apply under current support rules and the Member States can tailor the measures needed to individual demands, be it in relation to transport or telecommunications networks, basic public services or support for economic activities. In principle, this can be complemented by national aid, as Mr Caveri mentioned. Here too, however, the golden rule is that we continue to require notification a) because this gives regions the security of knowing that their measures will be seen to be compatible with EU law and b) because we must not allow unfair competition between individual regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot address all the suggestions in the report, but I hope that the seminar organised by the Commission to coincide with the International Year of Mountains will give plenty of opportunity to come back to these suggestions. In the meantime, the Commission will exercise its powers and right of initiative in order to examine the conclusions of the report in greater detail and continue the dialogue started today. I am positive that this will allow us to successfully raise the profile of mountain regions and highlight their importance to Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">Let me set out what the targets are: free and compulsory education for all, halving adult illiteracy by 2015, eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary schools by 2005 and extending learning opportunities for adults and young people and improvements in the quality of education provided.</p>
<p class="contents">We are quite tired of hearing about development targets. They are set and they are endless. We know the ‘whys’ for all these development concerns. What we from the Committee on Development and Cooperation are asking is ‘how’ we are going to deliver on these targets. The subject is at the heart of the global strategy that we, in our committee, discuss on poverty. The EU clearly has a key and central role to play here. Clear commitments were made at Dakar in Senegal last year. But neither from the EU nor anyone else really are we getting practical strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">I was a teacher myself for 30 years, mostly in primary education so I think I am quite justified in having a passion about looking at the reasons for this crisis. One in six of the world's population are functionally illiterate. One hundred and thirty million – one in five – of the total number of children are not in any kind of primary education. One terrible statistic is that two-thirds of those are little girls. Their learning situation is terrible. Many of will have seen children trying to learn sitting under a tree with not even a blackboard to assist the teacher. When we talk about information technology we are often talking about children who have never even held a pencil in their hand, never mind being likely to sit at the keyboard of a computer. In these schools too the quality of their education is often affected by the fact that they are not taught in their own language.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear link between illiteracy and income poverty. Average incomes in a country mirror very clearly the levels of access to education. There is a clear link between child mortality rates and the level of parental education. A 10% increase in girls' enrolment in primary school would bring a substantial improvement in infant and maternal mortality rates. And yet we see aid from developed countries to basic education being slashed from budgets across the globe. It is only 1% of the total.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing countries themselves take insufficient interest in the importance of education. The sub-continent of India spends less than 1% of GDP on education. As far as the EU is concerned, I hope the Commissioner will agree that this is not enough. I hope you are not going to state in your presentation that all of this will be incorporated into existing procedures. We need an answer from the Commissioner on how we intend to implement the goals. I would like to hear how he intends to improve coordination of the national indicative programmes for Cotonou and about our involvement in the steering committee working on education in Africa. I also know that there is a promise of a communication on basic education from the Commission during the Belgian Presidency. I would like to know when we might expect to see that.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just touch on one or two issues. Priority for girls obviously, and I suspect that Mrs Junker will speak about that. Last in, first out; that is what happens to girls. Girls have a low status and therefore there is no priority for getting them into school. I would like to see a lot more training in ministries in developing countries and concrete programmes to ensure that we get girls into school. The impact of HIV is enormous. There are millions of AIDS orphans in the developing world and in a country like Zambia there are more teachers infected annually with HIV than they are able to train to put in their schools. These are clearly very critical issues for us to discuss.</p>
<p class="contents">Meeting the targets looks difficult. Is there sufficient political commitment in current circumstances to ensure that we will get all the girls into school by 2005? The reality is, and I hope that people will admit this very clearly at the UN Conference the week after next, that as things are going all of these targets are unachievable. Meeting the target of universal primary education looks extremely difficult. I would like to know from the Commission how its work in trying to achieve these targets includes NGOs and civil society and all those people who are involved in the Global Education Campaign. It is a very successful, active and dynamic campaign. I would hope that the European Commission is very much engaged with them but I suspect that is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Global Education Campaign, the targets on education would require USD 8 billion a year. This is the equivalent of four days of global military spending and 9 minutes of international currency speculation. Therefore it seems to me that if the commitment was there, we could deliver. It is a price worth paying. The current inequities that I have described are untenable and certainly indefensible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, it is fair that I begin my speech on behalf of the PPE Group by congratulating Mrs Kinnock on her excellent report and on the passion with which she is defending it.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the proposals in this report, together with the resolution which we approved at the last part-session in July, represent the best contribution this Parliament could have made to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children, because there is no question, unfortunately, that education is still the great unresolved issue within development cooperation, despite the formal declarations and the commitments given at the various international conferences which have addressed this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The figures on the millions of children not attending school, which Mrs Kinnock pointed out, speak for themselves in this respect. While it is a grave situation that so many children are being deprived of their fundamental right to education, it is even more grave that, as a result of the violation of this right, millions of people are immersed in poverty and under-development. Because the key to prosperity and progress, especially in the context of the information and communication society which we live in today, lies in the level of education the people have access to.</p>
<p class="contents">The conviction that, by not dealing vigorously with the issue of education in the developing countries, we will not only fail to eradicate poverty, but that the gap between the rich and poor countries will increase, has certainly led us to place education at the centre of the global strategy for eradicating poverty. In this respect, we have to recognise that the Dakar Conference on education for all represented a great step forward, but it is a step which will take us nowhere if action is not taken and if, in accordance with the decisions at Dakar, we do not quickly adopt a concrete world initiative directed towards creating strategies and mobilising the resources required to provide effective support for the efforts made on a national level – as one of the Dakar commitments states.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, as the main donor and insofar as it has made solidarity and the defence of human rights an essential dimension of its international action, has the responsibility to promote these strategies in close coordination with the other donors, including the Monetary Fund and the World Bank and with the participation of civil society and, with them, policies aimed at overcoming the obstacles which deny children access to a quality education. And the European Union has the moral and political obligation to provide the financial resources necessary to achieve free education for all between now and 2015. All of this can be done in accordance with the excellent proposals contained in the Kinnock report, which reflect both the practically unanimous feelings of the Committee on Development and the feelings of my group.</p>
<p class="contents">However, achieving this objective will also require us to urgently either cancel or restructure the debts of the developing countries in exchange for the funds made available as a result being directed to education programmes. It will require making the developing countries themselves responsible and encouraging them, through persuasive measures if necessary, to fulfil the commitments given in Dakar and to give absolute priority to education. Above all, it will require an increase in financial contributions and the allocation of at least 8% of official aid to development and to basic education, in line with the views of the people promoting the campaign for education for all. Only through resources which match the challenge we have to face will it be possible to win the battle against illiteracy in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that only in this way will it be possible for millions of children to exercise their fundamental right to education, an education which will allow them to open the doors to progress and one day become free men and women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The text gives figures which are often so scandalous that they should provide little comfort for our consciences, because, at the end of the day, they demonstrate the incoherence of almost all of us who believe that the education of children is important for the success of any development process.</p>
<p class="contents">There are plenty of declarations recognising that child education in the under-developed world is one of the main conditions if those countries are to be able to begin to free themselves from the situation of justice and backwardness they are in.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kinnock’s report mentions the numerous commitments made in this regard by the international community on different occasions. The latest was the world conference on education, which took place in Dakar last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, however, is also a compendium and a condemnation of incoherences and irresponsibilities. Incoherence and irresponsibility on the part of the developed countries which, despite their promises, have not only failed to increase their programmes in favour of education and care for children in the developing world, but in fact have reduced their efforts in that area. And incoherence and irresponsibility on the part of the countries of the South which, apart from very few exceptions, are still neglecting the education of their youngest citizens in the face of other priorities such as military expenditure which, in the majority of cases, is still above what is invested in education.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution which we are voting on should not remain, like so many others, as a worthless piece of paper. This call for coherence and responsibility is a genuine demonstration that our Parliament should promote this issue as a European Union objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, however, this report should serve as a reference for the action of the Union and many European States, members or candidates for accession, at the United Nations General Assembly which will take place in New York in a few days time. Glenys Kinnock will be there and will speak out clearly, in the knowledge that we all support her and with the strength which the support deriving from our approving her proposals will give her.</p>
<p class="contents">Documents such as this are the best way to respond with specific proposals to a form of globalisation which, since it is mainly focused on the market, is creating inequalities, poverty and exclusion on a world scale and is therefore becoming repellent to many people throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by offering our thanks and congratulations to Mrs Kinnock on her work. It will be important to implement what is expressed here, but we must start by broadly distributing the report. This will convince and guide many people and will increase the credibility of the European Parliament amongst the citizens of Europe. It will also contribute to some people outside our territory recovering their confidence in us as well as their own sense of hope. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, that good primary education is still far from being granted the priority status that it deserves. Good, free education is essential for development. Nine hundred million people are still illiterate. The Dakar objectives are in danger of not being achieved by a long chalk. For this reason, new impetus is necessary at the highest political level, particularly from Europe, America and Japan. There is an urgent need for a strategically developed initiative with a realistic timescale and more financial resources. Indicative programmes must be drawn up for each country.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to now, the European Union has paid far too little attention to education. The argument that other donors are already doing sufficient is simply and demonstrably untrue. The cause for the shortfall in educational facilities lies not only with the donors. Many developing countries themselves give it far too low a priority. It is outrageous that in Africa twice as much money should be spent on military equipment as on education. If India continues to spend less than 1% of its GDP on school facilities, of course, development will never come off the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of Mrs Kinnock is excellent. Certainly, special attention will have to be paid to girls, early school-leavers, and also former child soldiers. The basic rights of children will only be respected if adults draw the right political lessons from failing educational practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share her scepticism about the great conferences where people in expensive suits and large expense accounts meet to talk about priorities that they afterwards immediately forget, while the education budgets of the poorest countries are falling and the number of children condemned to illiteracy continues to rise. I really have the impression that a number of countries are acting like some governments in the nineteenth century: keep them poor and keep them stupid, then they will be less trouble. That is, in fact, the strategic reason I can identify behind the manifest neglect of primary education. That primary education has also had far too low a priority in our own budgets for development cooperation. Fortunately, fellow MEPs have already said much that is true. I will therefore restrict myself to a few suggestions relating to that primary education in Mrs Kinnock’s report, which are particularly pertinent.</p>
<p class="contents">That education must be free. Children must not be excluded because they cannot afford primary education; otherwise they are condemned to the street, condemned to exploitation through child labour, and so on. On the contrary, we should actually give scholarships to children from poor families, so that they can go to school, to cover the miles, to pay for their uniforms, etc. The teachers must also be paid, they must be trained and they must receive a wage that enables them to survive in a decent way, so that they do not have to leave the children to their own devices because they must urgently earn something extra to at least give their own families some food. It is clear that national action plans will need to be put in place. I expect much more from governments that are aware of the problem, but in that case we must also be prepared to support those governments and increase their administrative efficiency. We are far too inclined to sit on the sidelines with our expensive specialists and our expensive NGOs, while we, in fact, give far too little support to the meagre educational facilities in those countries themselves. That does not detract from the fact that I expect the EU to translate all those words into action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ACP countries of sub-Saharan Africa are some of the least developed countries. There are depressing educational deficits here and women and children are deprived of even the most rudimentary basic education. There are examples, however, which give cause for hope and it is these which I should like to address.</p>
<p class="contents">The government of Mali which, as you know, is a bitterly poor country in the Sahel, has imposed an ambitious political programme which courageously tackles decentralisation and comprehensive education reforms. Children in Mali, boys and girls, are to receive a good school education, where possible in their regional or ethnic dialect. That is easier said than done, however, because no teachers have been trained in the regional dialects and there are no corresponding curricula, let alone books. Teachers need to be trained first and books need to be written first; and that is not something which can be done overnight and it is not something which can cover the whole country straight away.</p>
<p class="contents">You only have to think of the nomadic groups in the desert. They require special schools and special arrangements, to name but one example. This is an enormous challenge in education policy and is being extremely well supported by numerous donor organisations. The radio can help, especially in sparsely populated regions. The numerous local and regional stations which have started up in Mali, as in other developing countries, could easily be used for decentralised education plans, even if the tapes used are produced centrally.</p>
<p class="contents">Lessons over the radio have always been a way of life in the Australian outback. In Africa, customised electronic methods and mobile schools could go a long way towards rectifying the education deficit. It would be rewarding for the development cooperation of the European Union if we were to be involved in these new methods.</p>

Your report rightly highlights the need for urgent measures to implement the framework for action set out in Dakar. The Commission has also decided to put development policy, especially the education and health sectors, at the top of its agenda in 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Child welfare is a fundamental concern and a basic objective. An objective that we want to pursue mainly though social policies in sectors such as education and health. Related questions were addressed last year in the Council and Commission declaration on the European Community's development policy in connection with the fight against poverty. They also play a pivotal role in the Cotonou partnership agreement. The Commission has also stepped up support in the education sector and focused measures on basic education, especially primary school education, in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, the Community has considerably increased the general funds allocated to this sector in comparison with others. In addition, most programmes to promote primary school education contain special clauses for the benefit of girls, in order to counter gender-based drawbacks.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the specific considerations and recommendations which relate to the Community are concerned, I have the following to say: first, the education sector is instrumental in the strategy to fight poverty, which is the overriding aim of the Community's development policy. The Commission shares the view that clear objectives need to be defined, that education aspects need to be included in the fight against poverty and that civil society needs to be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also takes this standpoint in negotiations with developing countries on strategies to fight poverty. The Commission is determined to play an active role in these negotiations and to further international development objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Community made a formal undertaking in Dakar last year by backing the vision of the world declaration on education for all based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that education is a human right. This means that the Community has also subscribed to the call for countries seriously committed to education not to be impeded in implementing this objective by a lack of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament that better coordination and more complementarity between Community measures and national projects, with the help of the Group of Experts on Education, and more intensive cooperation with UNESCO and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa are of paramount importance in improving the effectiveness of Community aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is therefore stepping up its collaboration with UNESCO, especially by supporting UNESCO in coordinating education for all partners. The Commission is also involved in the working party set up to implement the framework for action set out in Dakar. It is also promoting the objectives of education for all in its negotiations on the ACP countries' strategies for the ninth EDF.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the difficult question of setting up a global fund for basic education is concerned, the Commission feels, given the Commission procedure for programming and implementing aid, that this sort of fund is not a practicable solution. However, the Commission does not in principle reject the idea of a global initiative, as provided for in the Dakar framework for action, even if the implementation methods need to be discussed in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the question of children's rights is closely bound up with the gender problem in general. Education targets for children, especially girls, will not be met until women have an equal status in the family and in the various societies. The Commission is very firmly in favour of paying particular attention to the education needs of girls in developing countries. It is currently preparing an action plan on equal treatment for men and women which should deal with this problem. It is also taking gender-specific questions into account in all special education programmes.</p>

The least productive regions will be abandoned first. Those are areas that have been uninhabited over a long period, because it requires more effort to earn a living. The people who had nevertheless finally settled there, were the outcasts of society. Often they were ex-convicts, ethnic minorities and losers in the battle for the best land. The least productive areas where the losers wound up are not only the mountain areas, but also low-lying wetlands, that is, old bogs, the bottom of which consists of peat, a water retaining vegetable material that, when dry, shrinks and disappears. Farmers in mountains and wetlands now play an important role in nature conservation, recreation and water management. In a free, unprotected market, they are doomed to disappear. Then their working and living area will not return to primeval nature, but will go to the dogs. Mechanising and destroying the landscape to allow it to be cultivated more easily is not an acceptable alternative. That is why I should like to back the proposed supporting measures, but to register an objection if these are limited to the mountains alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>It is the task of the Commission and the Member States to ensure that Council Regulation (EC) No 1146/2001 of 11 June 2001 concerning certain restrictive measures in respect of Liberia is applied. Article 4 of that Regulation lays down that the Commission and the Member States shall immediately inform each other of the measures adopted under the said Regulation and shall supply each other with any other relevant information at their disposal concerning, in particular, violations, enforcement problems encountered, or judgments handed down by national courts. Moreover, under Article 6 of that Regulation, each Member State has to decide on the sanctions applicable in cases of infringement. Such sanctions must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>
<p>As to the specific question of the controls on imports of diamonds laid down by Council Regulation 1146/2001, the same applies here because those controls are carried out within the framework of existing customs provisions in Member States. In practice, the effectiveness of control measures can be considerably increased if the Member States of the EU agree bilaterally to introduce a specific programme of cooperation with the third country in question.

<p>Is the Council considering reviewing the EU’s common position on relations with Cuba?</p>
<p>Does it envisage including this issue as an item on the agenda for the Council of Foreign Ministers and, if so, when?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>As the Honourable Members are well aware, the Council, at its meeting of 25 June 2001, noted the ninth review of the common position of the European Union regarding Cuba.</p>
<p>The Council noted that, since the previous review in December 2000, there was no evidence of any significant fact which would indicate a change of policy on the part of the Cuban Government which would contribute to the achieving of the objectives of the common position. The Council therefore noted that the common position, the basis of the European Union’s policy on Cuba, remains valid. The Council will carry out a new review in six months’ time, as laid down in the common position.</p>
<p>The Council also reaffirmed that the objectives of the European Union with regard to Cuba are still to encourage a process of peaceful transition towards democratic pluralism and the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Although the social and economic situation remains fragile, the Council found signs of an improvement in the population’s standard of living.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council stated that it is essential that the European Union and the Cuban authorities should engage in a constructive and frank dialogue on all issues of common interest. The Council demonstrated the European Union’s willingness to resume such a dialogue. As Honourable Members will know, the dialogue was broken off by the Cuban authorities when they cancelled an EU Troika mission at Director General level, which had been planned for 27 and 28 April 2000.</p>
<p>In the light of the ninth review of the common position, the Council also considered that the presence in Cuba of greater numbers of actors from the European Union would be a more effective contribution towards achieving the objectives of the common position, because this would provide opportunities for engaging in a process of dialogue, the exchanging of experiences, and apprenticeship for the future. The Council therefore encouraged the European Commission to step up its efforts to cooperate with, in particular, the civilian and non-governmental organisations in Cuba.</p>
<p>Finally the Council stated that it was in favour of holding a constructive dialogue with Cuba on a future framework cooperation agreement based on respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p>On 10 July, the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs met the Cuban Foreign Minister in Brussels. Although the meeting was a bilateral one, Mr Michel informed Mr Pérez Roqué of the Council’s conclusions following the ninth review of the common position and said that the European Union was willing to resume the dialogue as soon as the Cuban authorities were ready for a constructive and frank exchange of views on all issues of common interest including issues concerning democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Following this meeting, the Cuban authorities expressed a desire to continue discussions with the European Union. Therefore Mr Michel visited Havana on 23 and 24 August, in his capacity as President of the Council of the European Union, after having consulted the partners. Mr Michel led a fact-finding mission, and he was accompanied by representatives of the Commission, the Council Secretariat and Spain, which will be taking over the presidency. The aim of this mission was to assess the possibilities of engaging Cuba in an open and frank dialogue on all issues of common interest, in the light of the conclusions of the ninth review by the Council of the common position of the EU on Cuba. Mr Michel held meetings with President Fidel Castro, the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs, Felipe Pérez Roqué, and the Vice President of the Council of Ministers and Minister for the Economy, Mr Rodrigues. He also met four representatives of Cuban dissidents. This fact-finding mission resulted in agreement between the two parties on the need to resume dialogue, without any preconditions and as quickly as possible, to discuss all issues of common interest, including human rights.</p>
<p>Mr Michel will be reporting back to his fellow ministers at the informal (Gymnich) Council meeting on 7 and 8 September.</p>
<p>With regard to the next review of the common position, when the time comes, the Council will have to take into consideration the situation on the ground and any developments that may have taken place.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Following the ministerial conference on tourism held in Bruges on 1 and 2 July and in the run-up to the Commission communication 'Framing the future for European tourism', what practical form will the Council give to the possible application of the open coordination method to tourism policy? What role might the European Parliament play in shaping tourism policy?

<p>The European Ministerial Conference “Tourism for All”, which was held in Bruges on 1 and 2 July 2001, recognised that the working method adopted by the working parties set up to explore the priority areas listed in the conclusions adopted in June 1999 by the Internal Market Council had proved to be very effective. This working method consisted of bringing together experts from Member States and from the tourism industry and interested groups, and reaching agreement on priority areas for action.</p>
<p>This shows that the open coordination method, as defined in the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit, is an appropriate working tool for achieving closer cooperation between Member States in the field of tourism.</p>
<p>With regard to initiatives in the social tourism sector, we must remember that it is the Commission’s task to propose new initiatives in this sector. To this end, the Commission also maintains regular contact with the tourism sectors in all Member States.</p>
<p>On this point, the Council refers the Honourable Member to its conclusions of 21 June 1999, in which it invited the Commission and the Member States to cooperate closely, taking due account of the principle of subsidiarity and to consult experts in the tourism sector.</p>
<p>At the moment, owing to the lack of any consensus on this question, the Council is not in a position to adopt a multiannual programme of the "Philoxenia" type. It remains convinced, however, as indeed it has stated on more than one occasion, that the tourism sector plays an important role in the economy, and that better use should be made of its contribution to growth and employment, by means of measures aimed at improving quality and making the most of human resources, and by means of better information and better communications.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0655"></a>

<p>On 28 June 2001 the former President of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, was brought to The Hague. Mr Milosevic was handed over to the self-styled International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia despite the categorical opposition of Serbia's Upper and Lower Houses and Supreme Constitutional Court. The 'International Criminal Tribunal' has no international legal validity, but was set up at the instructions of the USA to carry out the New Order's political agenda. It was essentially founded by the very people who bombed Yugoslavia in breach of the most fundamental principles of international law, causing innumerable casualties and incalculable material and environmental damage. Mr Milosevic was handed over as part of a sordid financial deal following pressure on the country's present leaders. The Greek People has been - and still is - unanimous in expressing its revulsion at these developments. Typical expressions of this opposition are the letter signed by 83 Members of Parliament belonging to all parties (out of the 100 attending the summer session of the Greek Parliament) and the statements made by a large number of eminent public figures which appear in the press on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Will the Council say whether it condones practices of this kind which are in flagrant breach of the most fundamental principles of national sovereignty and international law?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council draws the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that the European Council, meeting in Gothenburg on 15 and 16 June 2001, invited the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia / Serbia in the region to continue to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The Council emphasised the importance attached to the handing over of Mr Milosevic to The Hague, at the same time pointing out that this decision constituted an important step towards a rapprochement between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Europe. On 25 June 2001, at its General Affairs meeting, it welcomed the adoption by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, on 22 June, of a decree on the subject of cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal. It saw this as a positive step towards the total cooperation which should be given to the Tribunal.</p>
<p>As to the method by which Mr Milosevic was extradited, that is a matter that falls within the jurisdiction of the internal law of the Federation and its constituent states.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member’s objections to the handing over of Mr Milosevic to the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague therefore go against the positions taken up by the Council, and the latter reminds the honourable Member that the International Criminal Tribunal is a body set up by the Security Council of the United Nations, and a body with which all the member countries of the United Nations, including the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, are obliged to cooperate under Resolution 827 of 25 May 1993. In conclusion, the Council believes that by transferring Mr Milosevic to The Hague the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has fulfilled its obligations as a member of the United Nations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0656"></a>

<p>During an exchange of views between the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr Louis Michel, who is currently President of the Council of the European Union and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 10 July 2001, the question of finding a solution to the Cyprus problem arose. Mr Michel indicated that he viewed Turkey's proposal for an 'vague federal solution' as realistic and acceptable (to him), and added that this could take place 'in the long term, because the other side will have to agree'. In adopting this position, the President of the Council appears to have forgotten that the Cyprus problem was created by invasion and occupation. Turkey's proposal for a federal solution which Mr Michel has relayed wholesale essentially legitimises the invasion and the occupation and is contrary to the relevant UN resolutions which the European Parliament has repeatedly endorsed.</p>

<p>For several months, European dealers in raw cattle hides have been forbidden to export their products to markets in Asia, because of the situation with regard to foot and mouth disease. Although exports of meat and other food products have now been resumed – from Belgium as well as elsewhere – Asian markets remain closed to European dealers in raw cattle hides.</p>
<p>This ban on exports is bringing heavy pressure to bear on the European market in raw cattle hides because Italy is the only country to which all the other European countries can sell them. Moreover, Italy is taking advantage of the situation by negotiating very low prices. What is more, countries outside Europe and America are steadily taking over as suppliers for the whole of the Asian market, so that firstly European dealers are losing all their Asian customers and secondly the market is being flooded with hides.</p>

<p>As the Honourable Member has explained, because of the restrictive measures applied in the European Union since February 2001 following the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in Great Britain (and to a lesser extent in France and the Netherlands), exports of animals and sensitive animal products to the Union’s trading partners were interrupted.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Community measures have been lifted as far as France and the Netherlands are concerned, since it proved possible to eradicate the disease in those countries. This was not the case in Great Britain where, even now, the disease is not fully under control, and where the measures remain in force.</p>
<p>In most cases, trade with third countries has gradually resumed its normal course. However, some of the Union’s trading partners have not thought it advisable to restore normal trading relations with the Union since the measures were lifted. The Council reminds the Honourable Member that it is the Commission’s responsibility to negotiate with third countries to obtain the removal of any obstacles to trade resulting from sanitary and phytosanitary problems. In fact, the Commission is the Union’s spokesperson in Geneva at the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures set up by the 1994 Marrakech Agreements.</p>

<p>Experience in Finland has shown that fire protection in city buses is inadequate. There are particular problems with ‘low-floor buses’, in which the engine space is cramped and very well insulated, which means that the temperature, particularly in summer, may rise above the danger level. On the other hand, large numbers of disabled people travel on these buses in particular, as do people travelling with prams and buggies, which means that it is hard to evacuate the passengers quickly. It is easy and cheap, in relation to the cost of the vehicle and the risk involved, to equip the engine space with an automatic fire extinguishing system.</p>
<p>Is there any information available from other Member States about fire safety in buses, particularly low-floor buses? Does the Presidency propose to take any action to implement common fire safety provisions in the Community? On what timescale will it be possible to bring the passenger safety of low-floor buses up to an acceptable level?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>During Council discussions on the draft directive on special provisions applicable to buses and coaches, the Commission stated its intention of considering the results of the regulatory work carried out by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) regarding low-floor buses, and of proposing any amendments to the directive in question if necessary.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes this undertaking on the part of the Commission, and will be ready to consider any proposed amendments resulting from the work of UNECE.</p>

<p>In its resolution of 5 July 2001<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Parliament 'commits the Belgian Presidency of the Council to reintroducing and this time bringing to a vote in the United Nations General Assembly of September 2001 a resolution on the abolition of the death penalty and to taking all steps necessary to obtain its adoption'. Given that 125 UN member countries now support abolition to varying degrees – and not 110 as certain NGOs suggest – a resolution aimed at establishing a universal moratorium on executions as a first step towards the universal abolition of the death penalty would have every chance of being adopted by the UN General Assembly provided that the EU acts decisively and coherently, whilst at the same time demonstrating openness and flexibility towards third countries.</p>
<p>Has the Council Presidency already asked or will it ask, on behalf of the 15 Member States, that the introduction of a universal moratorium on executions be entered on the agenda for the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly? What steps has it already taken to ensure that the Union speaks with one voice and with the determination necessary for this initiative to succeed?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council reminds the Honourable Member of the content of the declaration on the abolition of the death penalty which was annexed to the Amsterdam Final Act. The European Union is opposed to the death penalty whatever the circumstances and has agreed to work towards its universal abolition. The EU is concerned by the fact that about 90 states retain the death penalty, although only a minority (30 countries) carry out executions each year.</p>
<p>In the context of its objective of universal abolition, in 1998 the European Union set out a series of guidelines to determine the circumstances in which it should take specific targeted action. In order to obtain the principal objective, which is the definitive abolition of the death penalty, the European Union attempts, in countries where the death penalty still exists, to limit its use progressively, and it insists that the penalty is carried out in a manner that observes certain minimum international standards. The European Union’s efforts to achieve the abolition of the death penalty are the expression of a deep conviction shared by all the Member States of the European Union. The abolition of the death penalty helps to improve respect for human rights.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council reminds the Honourable Member of the European Union’s memorandum on the death penalty, issued in 2000 and included in the annual report on human rights in 2000, and of the policy guidelines of the European Union regarding third countries in relation to this subject.</p>
<p>By virtue of these guidelines, the European Union also raises the question of the death penalty within multilateral bodies. Thus in 1999, 2000 and 2001 the European Union succeeded in having a resolution against the death penalty adopted by the Human Rights Commission. That resolution contains, amongst other things, a request to those states that still use the death penalty to limit its use progressively before abolishing it completely and, while they continue to use it, to observe certain fundamental criteria.</p>
<p>At the 54th United Nations General Assembly in 1999, the European Union attempted, for the first time, to have a resolution on the death penalty adopted which incorporated the wording of the text adopted on the Union’s initiative by the Human Rights Commission. Despite gaining a large measure of support (72 countries cosponsored the motion), the European motion for a resolution came up against strong opposition from those countries in favour of retaining the death penalty, which were determined that the text include a series of amendments that would to some extent have rendered it meaningless. At the time, this led the European Union not to pursue its initiative within the General Assembly.</p>
<p>In 2000, after having considered the timeliness of a European initiative on the death penalty at the 55th United Nations General Assembly, the European Union found that the political and diplomatic climate did not yet make it possible to remove the obstacles that had arisen at the 54th United Nations General Assembly. In those circumstances, it appeared that to adopt a resolution which might have constituted a step backwards, in comparison with what had been achieved by the Human Rights Commission resolution, would be unthinkable. Therefore the European Union took the decision not to submit its resolution.</p>
<p>As far as the 56th United Nations General Assembly is concerned, no decision has yet been taken. The European Union’s experts are continuing to examine all the elements relating to a possible initiative against the death penalty. That assessment will take into account, in particular, the difficulties encountered during the first half of 2001 in the context of the negotiation process, in particular on HIV/AIDS, racism and the treatment of children, and the current events which are threatening to overshadow the work of the United Nations General Assembly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Community aid to the countries of south-eastern Europe which are involved in the process of stabilisation and association, that is to say Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, amounts to EUR 4.65 billion for the period 2000-2006. This aid is provided, essentially, in the context of the CARDS programme launched in December 2000, which follows on from the previous programmes for the region, OBNOVA and PHARE.<span class="sup">1</span></p>
<p>The CARDS programme covers very different types of aid, including aid for recovery and reconstruction after a conflict. The European Agency for Reconstruction was created after the conflict in Kosovo, and initially it concentrated its efforts on the reconstruction of Kosovo. Since then its activities have been extended to cover the rest of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, that is, Montenegro and Serbia<span class="sup">2</span>.

<p>The European Ministerial Conference “Tourism for All” was held during the Belgian Presidency in Bruges, on 1 and 2 July 2001. On that occasion the Commission submitted the final recommendations of the five working parties set up following the conclusions of the Council of 21 June 1999 on tourism and employment.</p>
<p>The Commission’s objective is now to adopt the communication “Framing the Future for European Tourism: a Strategic and Cooperative Approach” and, in November 2001, to send it to the Council, the Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. This communication will propose, in close consultation with all the parties involved, a contextual and strategic framework for tourism activities and policies within the Union.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to use the open coordination method proposed at the European Council in Lisbon in March 2000, so as to facilitate the convergence of Member States’ policies on tourism and the coordination of policies and measures which have an impact on tourism. Representatives from the various tourism sectors will be consulted. An initial joint meeting between representatives of the industry, other operators in civil society and Member States is planned to take place on 5 September 2001.</p>
<p>Parliament ought to play a full role here, as it did in 1999, through its Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in the case of the communication on increasing the potential of tourism for employment. The Commission is ready to submit to it the new communication and to respond positively and actively to any other request from Parliament that would help to clarify the proposals that will be formulated.</p>
<p>Since discussions on the working parties’ recommendations have not yet been completed, it is too soon, at present, to give any commitments regarding the Commission’s final proposals. The following basic principles will form the basis for those proposals:</p>
<p>- ensuring better coordination of the whole of the sector, by means of structured mechanisms for consultation, exchanges and information,</p>
<p>- improving knowledge of the sector at economic, social and environmental level,</p>
<p>- building on existing structure, bodies and centres of competence and knowledge, whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity and encouraging access by means of networking.</p>
<p>The social aspect is, of course, well to the fore in these reflections, both for tourism professionals (working conditions, training, career prospects) and for tourists themselves (the disabled, the unemployed and people on low incomes).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0654"></a>

<p>The issues raised by the Honourable Member are both complex and controversial. The Commission is fully aware of the Honourable Members concerns on the safety aspects of the association of small toys and food, and of the view that the situation is not adequately addressed by existing rules. It is aware also of opposite views within the Parliament, which insist that the existing rules are adequate to address any potential risk, and that any further measures would be disproportionate.</p>
<p>The Commission's approach will be guided by the Treaty obligation to take, as a base for any measures which may be proposed, a high level of protection. This means that, on the one hand where measures are objectively justified to protect consumers it shall act without reserve, and on the other hand it will fulfil its Treaty obligation to ensure the free movement of goods. This means also that it will not agree to the introduction of measures at the national level which cannot be properly justified.</p>
<p>In a very comprehensive reply of 19 October 2000 to a series of Questions on this subject, the Commission explained the legal and administrative aspects in relation to the combination of non-food products with foodstuffs. On the specific issue of accidents involving children, it outlined the results of its investigation carried out with the assistance of the Emergencies Committee set up under article 8 of Directive 92/59/EEC on general product safety.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Two type of effects of the industrial fisheries are discussed: the direct effect on the target and by-catch species and the indirect effects on the ecosystem caused by the removal of large quantities of the target species, which are known to be important prey for a large number of animals.</p>
<p>The impacts on target species and commercially important by-catch species are assessed annually by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). According to ICES the industrial fisheries are sustainable both in relation to the target species as well as the by-catch species.</p>
<p>Regarding the indirect impacts of fisheries on the ecosystem the Commission is unaware of definitive scientific results which indicate that current catch levels in the industrial fisheries have created deleterious effects. The only exception to this position concerns an apparent lack of breeding success of a species of seabird off the east coast of Scotland. In response to this, fisheries for sandeels were closed in the appropriate area of the North Sea.</p>
<p>The Community already has in place measures to control the activities of vessels conducting industrial fisheries.

<p>The long-term goal of the Community is a reduction of the energy intensity (energy consumption per gross domestic product (GDP) created) by 1% per year. A rapid implementation of measures launched or proposed by the Commission on, inter alia, co-generation, energy performance of building and efficiency requirements for electronic apparatus would help to achieve this goal and to reduce the growth in energy consumption in all Member States. Under the so-called "Burden Sharing Agreement" decided upon in Council in June 1998 in regard to the Kyoto Protocol, Greece agreed to limit its greenhouse gas emissions to a 25 % increase by 2008-2012, from 1990 levels. The first report on Community greenhouse gas emissions monitoring in 2000 notes an expected rise in direct CO2 emissions of 28.8% in Greece from 1990 to 2008/12. No data have been reported on the other five Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases. Greece has provided a list of policies and measures that cover most of the relevant sectors and sources, but has not quantified the expected effects. New projections incorporating the latest list of policies and measures would be useful in assessing the extent to which Greece is likely to meet its commitment.</p>
<p>The new directive on large combustion plants whose final adoption is expected later this year will apply new requirements for older plants from 1 January 2008 which will substantially reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide in particular from the energy sector in Greece. Implementation of the related proposal on national emission ceilings and new air quality limit values will also reduce levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.</p>
<p>Where waste recycling is concerned, the Court of Justice ruled against Greece in its judgement of 13 April 2000 (Case C-99/123) on the grounds that Greece had failed to adopt implementing legislation to incorporate the Packaging Waste Directive into its national laws by the stipulated deadline of 30 June 1996. The Greek authorities indicated that new legislation is being prepared. This was initially announced for March 2001.

<p>In view of the Spanish Ministry of Health’s ban on the sale of olive-residue oil and the consequences this has had for the sector, can the Commission say what progress has been made in its studies on benzopyrene and state its conclusions regarding the limit values it intends to propose?</p>
<p>Pending the legislation on benzopyrene, what provisional measures will the Commission take to ensure proper consumer protection, without jeopardising the olive-oil sector?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>On 3rd July 2001, as required by Community legislation, Spain informed the Commission’s Rapid Alert System for Food that it had withdrawn products from the market, in this case olive-residue oil contaminated with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as benzo(a)pyrene. PAHs are known carcinogens.</p>
<p>In these circumstances the Commission must immediately issue a Rapid Alert notification to Member States and request the necessary further details. In this case Spain was asked for details of test results, and distribution to Member States and third countries. Ideally such information should be submitted with original notifications, but this is not always possible, particularly where a general contamination problem is being investigated. It is important to inform the Member States immediately when urgent information is received, so they can begin their own investigations and consider whether national action is necessary to protect consumers.</p>
<p>Contamination of Spanish oil was first identified by authorities in the Czech Republic, at the end of May 2001. However, details were initially unclear and the Spanish authorities made an investigation. Spain notified the Commission after tests confirmed that products were contaminated. This contamination concerned only olive-residue oil and was a result of the production process.</p>
<p>On 6 July, at a meeting of the Commission’s Expert Committee on Contaminants in Food, Spain presented data showing levels of PAHs in olive-residue oil many times higher than guideline levels used by the vegetable oil industry. Subsequent investigations in Spain identified the precise stages of production where the contamination arose. This process is now being changed. In addition, the investigations in Spain revealed details of the distribution of products to several Member States and third countries. All of these destinations have been informed via the Rapid Alert System.</p>
<p>No harmonised maximum levels exist for PAHs in food, but the general food safety provisions of the framework regulation on contaminants apply<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span>. In such cases Member States may take action based upon national provisions to protect consumer safety. In this instance, Member States withdrew suspect products from the market. Spain offered to take back any contaminated olive-residue oil. Options on what to do with the contaminated oil are being considered, such as reprocessing or use in non-food products such as fuel oil.</p>
<p>The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) made an urgent assessment and concluded that there were no immediate risks from the levels of PAHs found, but the long-term risks from regular exposure to such high levels in food might be unacceptable, particularly regarding the risk of cancer. Therefore contaminated foods must be withdrawn. The SCF will perform the assessment of long-term risk whilst Member States collect data on actual levels of PAHs in different foods. The outcome of these activities will help determine whether harmonised maximum levels need to be set.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is presenting regular reports on convergence and approximation of applicant countries' legislative frameworks to the acquis. While some significant progress has been noted, the situation varies significantly among applicant countries and among different industries within each applicant country. During the period since it entered into its Europe Agreement, the Czech Republic has granted subsidies to its banking industry equal to approximately 20% of GDP, apparently without meaningful measures to avoid distortions to competition. This had led to the filing of a complaint with the competition service of the Commission.</p>

<p>The Commission has been following attentively the competition dimension of the various restructuring operations in the Czech financial sector, notably in the light of the Czech Republic’s obligations under the Europe Agreement. The Commission is of the view that greater transparency is first needed regarding these operations, before any conclusions can be drawn regarding compliance with the Europe Agreement. To this end the Commission is following up in detail these issues with the Czech authorities using fully the mechanisms of the Europe Agreement.</p>
<p>The overall track record of the Czech Republic in compliance with the competition acquis, including in the financial sector, is currently in the process of being assessed, as follows.</p>
<p>In the framework of the accession negotiations, the Commission is assessing for each candidate country whether the conditions are met that could allow for the provisional closure of the competition chapter. Three elements must be in place to reach that objective: (1) the necessary legislative framework with respect to antitrust and State aid; (2) an adequate administrative capacity; and (3) a credible enforcement record of the competition acquis. These three conditions, in particular the enforcement record, are currently being examined by the Commission with a view to forming its official position in the second half of the year, in line with the negotiation Road Map, agreed at the Nice European Council of December 2000.</p>
<p>The Commission last commented on the Czech Republic's overall progress in implementing the competition acquis in its Regular Report of November 2000. This concluded that alignment of Czech legislation on State aid was now well advanced, but that the main challenge was still to ensure the effective application and enforcement of State aid rules, where greater efforts were required. This year's Regular Report is currently under preparation and will be adopted in November.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0627"></a>

Such protection may also be derived from Article 24 of the Charter which stipulates, in paragraph 1, that children shall have the right to protection and to the care necessary for their well-being.</p>
<p>Such a principle should be respected by the Union, in accordance with the scope of the Charter which, under Article 51, is addressed to the institutions and bodies of the Union and to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law. Moreover, as far as candidate countries are concerned, respect for human rights, including the rights of the child, is one of the political criteria for accession laid down by the European Council in Copenhagen, and is examined by the Commission, in particular in the context of its regular contacts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0643"></a>

<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The European Commission Humanitarian aid office (ECHO) in Cuba is to be closed in March as Community emergency assistance to Cuba is no longer needed. However, the Commission is putting equivalent funds into economic assistance which needs a different kind of presence. The Commission aims to make its co-operation with Cuba as efficient as possible. One should not read into this shift that the Commission is less attentive to the Government's human rights record.</p>
<p>The Commission has adopted a Communication to the Council and the Parliament on 3 July 2001. It foresees a number of new Delegations to be opened by the end of 2002. As far as Cuba is concerned the Communication sets out that a regular presence on the island is to be considered in the light of internal developments and the forthcoming closure of the ECHO office.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Catalan is spoken by eight million people. In Spain, it is the joint official language of the autonomous communities of CATALONIA, the BALEARIC Islands, VALENCIA (in the form of the Valencian dialect), and the Eastern part of ARAGON. Outside Spain, it is the autochthonous language of the Pyrénées Orientales department in France and the town of Alghero in Sardinia. It is also the official language of Andorra. Catalan is therefore spoken by more people, over a wider area, than several of the official languages of the European Union.</p>
<p>Given that respect for cultural and linguistic diversity is one of the fundamental principles of the Union, does the Commission consider the status accorded to Catalan within the Community institutions to be keeping with this principle?

<p>In accordance with Article 290 of the EC Treaty, the Council adopted Regulation No 1 of 1958 (subsequently amended to take into account the accession of new members) determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community. It laid down the official languages and the working languages of the institutions as being German, English, Danish, Spanish, Finnish, French, Greek, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese and Swedish.</p>
<p>This regulation, which is concerned with the operation of the institutions, in no way casts doubt upon the cultural and linguistic importance of languages other than those quoted, including Catalan. For its part, the Commission attaches great importance to the respecting of cultural and linguistic diversity in the Union, without considering it necessary to propose any amendments to Regulation 1/1958. In this area, the Commission does not have any specific power of initiative.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Community has undertaken many initiatives to promote cultural and linguistic diversity. A good example is the European Year of Languages, the aim of which is to make the public at large aware of languages and to promote multilingualism and the learning of languages by organising information and public-awareness projects.

<p>As the Commission has explained on various occasions when similar questions regarding the National Land Register in Greece have been put by the Honourable Member and by other Members of Parliament, since the beginning of the year the Commission has held a series of discussions and exchanges of letters with the Greek authorities on the subject of the project being co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Those authorities, in reply to questions from the Commission, submitted voluminous files, in February and again in May, explaining their position with regard to the various points raised by the Commission.</p>
<p>This correspondence has been taking place in the context of the procedure laid down in article 24 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span> laying down provisions for the implementation of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>The Commission carried out an in-depth analysis of all the information provided by the Greek authorities. The conclusions of that analysis were sent to the Greek authorities in July, thus giving them an opportunity to inform the Commission of any new factors that might have arisen in the meantime or to correct any errors. We expect a reply from the Greek authorities by the end of September 2001.</p>
<p>On the basis of the file that was prepared and of any comments by the Greek Government, the Commission will take a final decision on this project, in particular on the question of whether to reduce or possibly cancel Community aid.</p>
<p>At the present moment, the National Land Register project in Greece is not part of any programme adopted by the Commission under the third Community Support Framework (CSF) and in particular the recently adopted Environment Programme. Consequently it is not eligible for co-financing under the third CSF.</p>
<p>When the present procedure finally comes to an end, then it will be necessary to decide whether, and if so subject to what conditions, the National Land Register project in Greece can once again become eligible for co-financing under the third CSF.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 1998 and 1999 the riverside plant cover was cleared from the Sierra de Baza Nature Reserve. Poplar trees were thus cut down, harming the riverside vegetation as a whole and the ecosystem which this constituted. Reports by the Spanish nature conservation service, SEPRONA, indicate that nearly 14 000 trees were indiscriminately felled, although, according to the administrative permits granted by the authorities, only the dead wood was supposed to be removed and put to use. The illegal felling has created eutrophication problems. Ecosystems protected by Community legislation have likewise been damaged, in particular deciduous Mediterranean woodland, a natural habitat of Community interest. Protected species have been endangered. No environmental impact assessments have been carried out, nor have remedies been proposed. Investment in the nature reserve has been financed by EAGGF funds.

<p>The site in question covers an area of over 53 833 hectares. This area includes up to 18 different types of habitat covered by Annex I to the said Directive, of which five are priority habitats (6110, 7220, 6220, 9561, and 9533).</p>
<p>Felling activities have to be carried out by an approved plan, but in this case it appears that they cut down trees irrespective of the prescriptions.</p>
<p>Felling activities are not supported by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), but the Honourable Member indicates that other activities for nature conservation purposes in these areas have been financed. This also does not exclude the felling of trees. On the same grounds EAGGF does not support actions of forest habitats restoration after damage. It provides only for actions that enhance the ecological functions of forests and not for restoration of damaged forest areas.</p>
<p>The Commission will be contacting the Spanish authorities to ask them what measures need to be implemented in order to comply with the Habitats Directive, in particular Article 6 thereof.</p>

<p>For several months, European dealers in raw cattle hides have been forbidden to export their products to markets in Asia, because of the situation with regard to foot and mouth disease. Although exports of meat and other food products have now been resumed – from Belgium as well as elsewhere – Asian markets remain closed to European dealers in raw cattle hides.</p>
<p>This ban on exports is bringing heavy pressure to bear on the European market in raw cattle hides because Italy is the only country to which all the other European countries can sell them. Moreover, Italy is taking advantage of the situation by negotiating very low prices. What is more, countries outside Europe and America are steadily taking over as suppliers for the whole of the Asian market, so that firstly European dealers are losing all their Asian customers and secondly the market is being flooded with hides.</p>
<p>Will the Commission take action to deal with this situation? If so, how, and can it do so soon, in view of the highly precarious situation facing European dealers in raw cattle hides? If not, why not?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is aware of the restrictions on imports which certain Asian countries have imposed regarding raw cattle hides originating from the Community. These restrictions were imposed following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in “continental Europe” in March 2001.</p>
<p>This external problem has also had internal repercussions on trading relations between Member States. The surplus of hides which some Member States are having difficulty disposing of has put great pressure on their markets. This does not appear to be a universal problem within the Community. Some Member States are still suffering from a shortage of raw hides on their markets.</p>
<p>The Commission does not have any legal instrument that would allow it to intervene in the internal market for raw cattle hides. In other words, the market is governed by the laws of supply and demand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as regards restrictions placed on imports by certain Asian countries, the Commission has successfully undertaken negotiations, both bilateral and multilateral, in the context of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), with a view to persuading third countries to apply European and international health standards.</p>
<p>The Commission has in this way succeeded in getting several measures restricting imports lifted, but there are still certain others in existence. Since the end of August, eleven Member States have been recognised as being free from foot-and-mouth disease under the rules of the International Office of Epizootics. Restrictions on imports of hides from the Community are therefore becoming increasingly unjustified. When restrictions are applied to hides coming from countries not affected by foot-and-mouth disease, they are no longer justified and must therefore be removed.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue its efforts at both bilateral and multilateral level and in particular within the WTO SPS Committee (Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0660"></a>

<p>The part-time work directive clearly makes it possible for pay and other entitlements to be based on the number of hours worked (the pro rata temporis principle) in order to ensure equal treatment. In some cases, however, benefits are accrued only through longer-term employment relationships, possibly because jobs in which fewer hours are worked typically do not possess the confidential nature that is an essential feature of salaried work. Nevertheless, the Danish Ministry of Labour takes the view that the limit on the number of hours worked laid down in the Salaried Employees Act has to be lowered from 15 to 8 hours so that Denmark meets the requirements of the part-time work directive.

<p>The Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the fact that Community law – notably Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span> - protects the social security rights of migrant workers by co-ordinating the different national social security schemes of Member States. One of the main principles of this co-ordination is to determine the social security legislation which is applicable to a migrant worker. As a rule, such a worker is subject to the social security legislation of the Member State where he or she is employed. Therefore, if a person works in Northern Ireland he or she is principally subject to the social security legislation of the United Kingdom. But the Honourable Member seems to refer to an important exception to this rule which is contained in Regulation 1408/71, namely the one relating to the posting of workers. A posted worker is normally employed by an employer in one Member State, but the employer sends him or her to another Member State to perform work there for a limited period of time. Under these circumstances the posted worker remains subject to the social security legislation of the sending Member State and contributions must continue to be paid to the social security scheme of this Member State. Nevertheless, the posted worker is entitled to health care in the Member State of employment on behalf of the Member State to which contributions are paid.</p>
<p>Although Community law determines which social security legislation is applicable, Member States remain free to determine both the conditions concerning the right or duty to be insured with their social security scheme (e.g. as concerns coverage for health care) and the conditions for entitlement to benefits provided that these do not discriminate between their own nationals and those of other Member States. It then remains for each Member State whose social security legislation has been determined to be applicable to ensure that its respective legislation, e.g. concerning the payment of social security contributions, is complied with. It should furthermore be stressed that the Commission can only ensure proper application of Community law in the field of social security by governments of Member States and does not act as inspector in the social field.</p>
<p>As regards minimum wages and holiday rights, which are working conditions, the rules of Directive 96/71/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span>, must be observed if the agency is a temporary employment undertaking or placement agency hiring out workers to a user undertaking in Northern Ireland, provided that there is an employment relationship between, in this case, the Portuguese company and the posted workers.</p>
<p>In the situations covered by the Directive, the Member States are required to ensure that, whatever the law applicable to the employment relationship, the undertakings concerned guarantee posted workers certain terms and conditions of employment in force in the host country. These terms and conditions - considered mandatory rules - include in particular minimum rates of pay and minimum paid annual holidays. Where such mandatory rules are determined by the law of the host country, the Directive covers all sectors of activity. Where the terms and conditions of employment are laid down by collective agreements which have been declared universally applicable, the Directive applies to activities relating to construction.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

However, Nicole Fontaine has already expressed the wish that the Irish should not be granted any derogations which would make the Treaty of Nice even less effective.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an opinion poll carried out in France (where no referendum has been held) reveals that over 54% of that country's people would reject the Treaty. Its parliament has ratified it nonetheless.</p>
<p>However, in the wake of the Irish referendum and in the absence of unanimity, any ratification procedure should be halted. How does the Commission intend to make good the democratic deficit and bring the EU closer to the people if it disregards the majority view?

<p>The malfunctioning of the United Nations International Drug Control programme (UNDCP) has already been the subject of a position adopted by the Commission and set out in the answer supplied by the Commission to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0392_EN.html">H-0392/01</a> at Parliament’s plenary session of May 2001.</p>
<p>Following the serious allegations concerning the operating methods of the UNDCP, an investigation was carried out, which resulted in two reports by the services of the United Nations Organisation (UNO).</p>
<p>Following a detailed analysis, it seems that the Board of Auditors and the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) identified certain practices that were subject to criticism, and in particular they criticised a management style which was too personalised, deficiencies in budget programming, poor management of human resources (especially at headquarters) and mediocre implementation of worldwide programmes. The reports in no way confirm the existence of fraud or the misuse of funds.</p>
<p>These criticisms have given rise to concern on the part of states which grant non-targeted subsidies to the UNDCP and which participate directly in funding the headquarters or certain worldwide projects. Those states are not involved in either the identification or the implementation of the projects.</p>
<p>Those states also second experts to the UNDCP, and they expect those experts to be able to work in good conditions and have real responsibilities.</p>
<p>As far as the Commission is concerned, although the Council Regulation makes provision for a lump-sum contribution to the UNDCP, there has been no Community financing destined for the worldwide programmes or the UNDCP headquarters. Funding is granted solely on the basis of projects which are sometimes assessed by the Commission. Before approval, such projects are examined in accordance with normal procedures and are referred to the Financing Committees. The Commission then monitors their implementation.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission does not second any experts to the UNDCP.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has decided to conduct an audit of each of the current projects. Like the majority of the Member States, the Commission does not envisage any change in its position, since it does not have at its disposal any new information that would justify such a change. In the context of the Major Donor Group, the Commission is participating in the discussions on how to improve the effectiveness of the UNDCP.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the "Protocol on the Protection and Welfare of Animals", which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Institutions have to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals when formulating and implementing Community legislation.</p>
<p>The Commission is taking full consideration of animal welfare issues, among others, by ensuring high standards for the welfare of animals on the farm, during transport and at slaughter, by improving the protection of wild animals by regulating trade therein and the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, and it is taking into account animal welfare concerns in its technical legislation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the competencies of the Commission are limited and Member States remain generally responsible for matters of cruelty against animals, such as mistreatment and the use of animals in competitions or shows.</p>
<p>Council Directive 1999/22/EC of 29 March 1999 relating to the keeping of wild animals in zoos aims to improve the situation of wild animals kept in zoos. In particular, Article 3, 3<span class="sup">rd</span> indent, specifies the requirements on zoos regarding accommodation and husbandry. However, the provisions of the Directive are not yet applicable, as the deadline for transposition of the Directive is 9 April 2002. Once it is in force, the responsibility for enforcing the national provisions adopted pursuant to the Directive lies with the Member States.</p>

<p>Mr Kinnock has said that reputable scientific studies show that the use of depleted uranium shells poses no threat to human health or the environment, despite the fact that fresh evidence to the contrary appears with every passing day; one example is the document by the US Department of Defense of August 1993 which states that the expected consequences of exposure of human beings to depleted uranium dust is an increased incidence of lung and bone cancer.</p>
<p>By letter of 13 February 2001 I asked Mr Kinnock to forward these studies to me. In his reply he said he was forwarding my request to the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Wallström, but so far - five months later - I have still not received any reply or any study.</p>

<p>In the Commission’s reply in the context of Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0055_EN.html">H-0055/01</a> by Mrs. Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou given during Question Time of the February 2001 plenary session of the Parliament, Commissioner Kinnock confirmed that there was well documented scientific consensus that the impact of test firing of depleted uranium (DU) shells in marine waters would be minimal compared to the ubiquitous natural occurrence of uranium.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member subsequently requested transmission of the studies that the Commission would have referred to. In fact the Commission did not have in mind any specific document on the issue but rather the above-mentioned scientific consensus.</p>
<p>Few days later the Commission received the opinion of the Group of Experts established under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty. This document was immediately released to the press, was available on the EUROPA web-site, and raised a wide interest at international level.</p>
<p>While the Experts dealt essentially with general uses of DU, against the background of military uses and the consequences DU shells impacting on terrestrial targets, the document also contains a paragraph (53) reading as follows:</p>
<p>“Test firing is being carried out in the sea. Due to the low corrosion rate and to the large volume of surrounding seawater, no detectable increase of uranium concentration in seawater or biota is expected.”</p>
<p>The Experts thus fully confirmed the position taken by the Commission.</p>

<p>Twenty-nine months after signature and ratification by the Greek Parliament of the transfer document for the Thessaloniki underground, negotiations are continuing for the conclusion of loan agreements; moreover the Commission representative told the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions on 9 July that in view of the risk that the transfer agreement would be declared void, written authorisation for extending the negotiations had been given twice and that the matter remained in suspension as the financial agreements between the contractor and the lenders had not been finalised and the works themselves therefore could not begin.</p>

As the delays have meant that the project cannot be carried out under the second CSF and as the handling of the matter by the Commission and the EIB is required to be in accordance with the treaties, Community law and the Community's interests, how will the Commission and the EIB safeguard the Community's interests in the timely execution of the project during the term of the third CSF for Greece?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Having already replied to questions in the same vein a number of times in the past few months and having presented in June and July its position in the petitions Committee, the Commission regrets that it is not in a position to add a great deal today to the information that has already been given to the Parliament.</p>
<p>According to the principles of subsidiarity and the methods which have been established for the implementation of the Structural Fund regulations the Commission can take no responsibility for the conduct of negotiations between the concessionaire of a particular project and those bodies from whom the concessionaire intends to borrow money.

<p>Denmark does not have any legislation on the production and marketing of raw milk intended for human consumption or of products based on raw milk, since the latter are prohibited.</p>
<p>Under Article 249 (ex Article 189) of the EC Treaty, a directive is binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but it leaves the national authorities to decide upon the form and methods.</p>
<p>As the Court of Justice has regularly confirmed, the transposition of a directive into national law does not necessarily require the provisions being transposed to be reproduced formally and word-for-word in a specific national provision. However, it is essential that the restrictive measures contained in a directive should be included in a national act in such a way as to create a legal context which will suffice to ensure that the measures are applied.</p>
<p>Consistent judgments by the Court also show that in cases where a directive lays down optional provisions or does not place a specific area entirely under regulation, the Member State has the right, within the limits of the general principles of the EC Treaty, either not to transpose the optional part of the directive or to retain or create national legislation to supplement the Community provisions.</p>
<p>In the case referred to by the Honourable Member, and with reference to the provisions of Council Directive 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992, it is necessary to point out that Community legislation has not laid down any instructions regarding health, except in cases where a Member State wishes to permit the use of raw milk.</p>
<p>The result, as the Commission has already stated in its replies to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0364_EN.html">H-0364/01</a> during Question Time at the plenary session of Parliament in May 2001 and written question <a href="/doceo/document/P-5-2001-1794_EN.html">P-1794/01</a> put by the Honourable Member, is that the requirements laid down in Article 4 of Directive 92/46/EEC are only applicable in cases where a Member State authorises the placing on the market of milk intended for direct human consumption, whereas under Article 7(A)(9), each Member State has to lay down its own health rules for milk-based products which are not made from heat-treated milk or which have not been subjected to any heat treatment during their manufacturing process, and those rules must be sufficient to enable such products to meet the health criteria guaranteed for every finished product.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Owing to the lack of consensus within Community industry, there are no harmonised rules at Community level on indication of the origin on products marketed in the Community, as this is a matter for the national legislation of the Member States. Where such national regulations exist, they generally refer to the non-preferential origin of products in accordance with the World Trade Organisation Agreement on rules of origin. Under the Community Customs Code<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, goods are deemed to originate in a country if they are wholly obtained or produced in that country or, where several countries are involved, if they underwent their last, 'substantial', processing or working in that country.

<p>The Commission regrets the rejection by the Parliament of the Proposal for a Directive on Take over bids. Although this Proposal did not intend to promote the take over bid technique as the only or preferable technique for corporate restructuring, it is clear that the continued absence of common rules for take over bids makes corporate acquisitions more difficult. This is particularly so because of the possibility for an offered company in the case of a hostile take over bid to continue applying defensive measures aimed at frustrating the bid. The Commission has therefore announced that it will come back with a new proposal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Given the extent of the corporate restructuring currently taking place among European telecommunications companies, it may be that the telecommunications sector will be one of the sectors most affected by the absence of common rules on take-over bids, but in itself rejection of the Proposed Directive is unlikely to affect the pace of restructuring in this sector.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
