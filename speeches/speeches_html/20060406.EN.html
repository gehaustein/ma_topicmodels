<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thierry Cornillet (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, the report on the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2005 is actually included on the agenda. I will not go back over the detail of the report and will merely refer to two sessions, that in Bamako in April 2005 and that in Edinburgh in November 2005, without forgetting the next session, which will be held in Vienna in June 2006. I should like to point out in this Chamber just how worthwhile it is, as was the case this year, for sessions organised in Europe to be held in the country holding the Presidency. It does, in fact, seem extremely logical to maintain and to perpetuate this system, which was adopted two years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to highlight the very solid contribution of our colleagues from the ACP countries, and we must congratulate them on that. We simultaneously conducted six joint missions, and allow me for the first - but not the last - time to emphasise the adjective ‘joint’. It is essential, in fact, that both the Permanent Assembly and the missions share a joint vision of matters. To do the opposite would make no sense at all. I should also like to point out that an increasing number of horizontal votes between the ACP countries and the EU representation have been held. In my opinion, the practice of separating houses must be drawn on as little as possible without it being necessarily removed from our Rules of Procedure. That being said, it is true that the objective, in the long term, would be to hold an increasing number of votes that make it possible to secure an ACP-EU majority.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it appears that our colleagues from the ACP countries are less involved in what we might call an ‘intellectual’ capacity. By that I mean that we are in agreement with them on the fact that what was an expense for us – namely, in actual fact, the EU expenditure that consists of the ACP budget – is revenue for them. The need for parliamentary control at these two levels is, moreover, becoming increasingly clear to them. To this end, we, for our part, have requested the budgetisation of the EDF in order to guarantee parliamentary control regarding the use of this Community expenditure but, at the same time, the parliaments of the ACP countries also need to submit to parliamentary control what they consider to be revenue. That is a joint battle that we will have to fight if the vital need for parliamentary control is to be recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the future of the ACP, I welcome the amendment made to the Cotonou Agreement. The budget for the tenth EDF now amounts to EUR 22.682 billion. We have already complained in this Chamber about this sum, which does not live up to our expectations of EUR 24 billion. The Austrian Presidency has already responded to us. I have no doubt that my fellow Members will shortly take the floor on this subject in order to request a realignment. It is not a matter of endlessly repeating the same questions, but we are awaiting more forceful responses than the ones we have been given.</p>
<p class="contents">The EDF surplus also poses a problem. To date, it stands at almost EUR 11 billion, which naturally raises questions about the procedure and the ambition of the projects dealt with, because it is unforgivable that EUR 11 billion should not have been spent in countries that have such glaringly obvious needs.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the future hold for the EDF? If we fulfil our political commitments in 2010 and if we succeed in devoting 0.56% of our GDP to development aid, then the European Union will grant an additional EUR 50 billion per year to this budget, even though it had made the political commitment to devote only half of that amount, or EUR 25 billion, to Africa. It is quite clear that if this policy is complied with, the additional aid that is available will actually correspond to one annual EDF budget. Nevertheless, if the way in which we spend that budget were to be examined, it would only raise questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I wonder about the proportion of the aid to developing countries that will be managed by the European Union and that will be in the region of 20%. In that case, even if my choice of term is a little strong, the EDF will be reduced to the status of a minor instrument of aid. The problem of its budgetisation, which is absolutely crucial and needs to be done as soon as possible, thus becomes even more acute, as does that of its ‘fungibility’, meaning the possibility of granting very ambitious regional projects, such as rail infrastructure, a place in the European Union’s general system for action. That is what would make it possible to ensure coordination between the member countries and the European Union. The EDF can become that coordination lever, and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly can become an element of specific control, in the knowledge that all of the least developed countries in the world are members of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is above all the problem of understanding European Union policy. What I was describing just now as Community expenditure earmarked for development aid is provided by our taxpayers. As such, action must be clear because it is no good the populists grabbing hold of the figures that I have announced to you and crying out: ‘What on earth are you doing with all of that money?’ We therefore need this matter to be viewed and understood from a political perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has summarised very well all the recent developments of the Assembly. It is indeed becoming an increasingly strong parliamentary pillar of ACP-EU cooperation. The establishment of the standing committees and the joint drafting of reports by the ACP and the EU members of the Assembly have led to more frequent and more intense contacts between parliamentarians.</p>
<p class="contents">The Assembly has become a mature forum, where issues of concern to ACP and EU parliamentarians are addressed in an open debate where broad consensus on many development issues is emerging and where votes by separate houses have become a rare exception. This framework has allowed the Assembly to discuss and reach agreement on a broad variety of issues ranging from governance over finance to trade questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution calls on the Assembly to organise meetings between EU and ACP Members of Parliament at regional or sub-regional level to strengthen regional integration and foster cooperation between national parliaments. The Commission is ready to make its contribution to the success of such arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to stress that the Commission shares your view on the Assembly’s role as a model for cooperation. My colleague Mr Michel has participated in all the Assemblies held since he took office. Commissioner Michel also looks forward to attending the next Assembly which will be held in Vienna in June this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also, at the outset, like to thank equally warmly our two co-presidents – the European co-president Mrs Kinnock, who is with us today, and, in her absence Sharon Hay-Webster, for their great dedication over the past year, which has been exemplary, and we look forward to their continuing with their work. The primary object of the Parliamentary Assembly is to reinforce the parliamentary dimension of the Cotonou Agreement. The many things that we do together are intended to help our counterparts gain influence in their own countries and gain the same self-confidence that we have gained over the years in our dealings with our governments and the executive.</p>
<p class="contents">Our shared experiences, and our journeys together to various places, have led us to shared conclusions, for example as regards the reform of the market organisation for sugar. It is good that the Commissioner for Agriculture is present with us today, since she knows the figures inside out and knows what we in Europe are doing to lessen the impact of reform of the market organisation for sugar and how little, in comparison with that, is available for the countries concerned. It is apparent from that that our reform directly impacts on these countries, two of which – Guyana and Jamaica – I have myself visited. In Guyana, we can – without intending to – contribute to the destabilisation of a whole country if we do not lessen the impact of our reform by making adequate compensation available to that country.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another important aspect that I would like to highlight. We call on the Commission to set aside an appropriate proportion of European development funding for the political education of parliamentarians and other persons in positions of leadership, enabling the development in these countries of the sort of political culture that will strengthen responsible governance in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to mention the official contact that we established with the Pan-African Parliament at the end of last year, when I was able, on behalf of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, to confer with Sharon Hay-Webster, and I have since become the chairman of this <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> delegation. It is important that we should foster an awareness in Africa that the continent shares a common destiny and of the important role there that Parliament can play in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The JPA is a permanent forum for political dialogue that tends to become an instrument of prevention, of conflict resolution and of support for the democratic process. The role of the JPA is therefore very precious in the context of the Cotonou Agreements. It is a unique tool for dialogue between the North and the South. In the future, it must work more effectively, particularly in terms of dealing with major crisis situations, such as the one in Darfur, provided that it is given the resources to do so. This aspect is above all the responsibility of the European Union, which must attach political priority to this partnership with the ACP countries, by respecting its commitments in the negotiations under way on the sum of the tenth EDF and by finally refraining from taking back with the one hand what it gives with the other, as illustrated by the sugar reform.</p>
<p class="contents">By finally giving the JPA the political respect that it deserves, let us thus definitively enforce what is laid down in the Cotonou Agreement, that is to say that the Assembly shall meet in Europe in the country of the EU Presidency. Let us not welcome our ACP partners in a half-hearted fashion, as that would be a downright poor political signal for us to give. However, it is also the responsibility of the JPA itself. It must make progress with its reform and its working methods, and the next development could result in regional conferences being held. This objective could be set by the beginning of 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we, as members of the JPA, also have a political responsibility, by abstaining, for example, from voting in separate houses, which is not only the negation of the JPA’s joint character, but also the means used all too often these days for the purposes of thwarting the outcome of a vote. I find all of that in the Cornillet report and I therefore believe that, as far as we are concerned, it constitutes a road map for 2006. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though, today, its continuation is probably a foregone conclusion, there are still a number of things wrong with it, and I shall sum some of them up.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still, among the ACP countries, six dictatorships, namely Zimbabwe, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, Swaziland, Cuba and Eritrea. It is a matter of fact that these countries’ dictators constitute an obstacle to their economic development. The Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and its Political Affairs Committee in particular, must make it a priority to bring real democracy to these countries. At the same time, the ACP countries also include a number of countries in which religious practices still prevail over the rule of law. The humanitarian tragedy in Darfur is a direct consequence of this, among other things. In some of them, women’s rights count for nothing and the mutilation of women – despite what has already been done to counteract it – is still a daily occurrence.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the Cotonou Agreement that first acknowledged that corruption was an obstacle to development. It is still going on; it has not yet been stamped out, and constitutes a serious obstacle to the alleviation of the needs of the least well-off in these countries. Let me close by quoting the Indian Nobel economics prizewinner Amartya Sen: ‘never yet has famine occurred in a democratic country’. It follows, then, that, in addition to the principle of ‘aid for trade’, we also have to consider the idea of ‘aid for democracy’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Good reports have been adopted, and the capacity for tackling burdensome tasks has been further enhanced along with the quality of political dialogue. That is important if we want to help build up political stability, which is what we accomplish by strengthening the parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day, though, what matters in development cooperation in the ACP countries is the concept of ownership, and it is that that we will take as the starting point for our work. It is still the countries themselves that bear primary responsibility for their own development. Through dialogue in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, we hope to further promote good governance, democracy and the protection of human rights, and I might add that I am also happy with the appointment this week – to which reference has already been made – of this House’s <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> delegation to the Pan-African Parliament, which can be an additional instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, I want to ask that particular attention be given to two projects that have been running over the past year, and will continue next year, namely the economic partnership agreements and the reform of the sugar market, both of which will have a great deal of impact on both Europe and the ACP countries. We must see to it that both continue to help put the ACP countries in a stronger economic position, and in that respect good consultation with them will be of crucial importance and must involve their parliaments too.</p>
<p class="contents">This House treats cooperation between the ACP countries and the EU as being of particular importance, since it involves a Joint Parliamentary Assembly consisting of 77 members of this House and 77 members of the ACP countries’ parliaments. We debate together and adopt resolutions together in what is a unique and valuable arrangement. What is needed for peace and political and economic stability in these countries is not just financial investment on our part, but also investment in contacts devoted to deliberation and dialogue, in order to get to know one another better and understand one another better. In that we cannot invest enough.</p>

<p class="contents">Anyone looking at our Joint Parliamentary Assembly over a number of years, as I certainly have for around 12 years, has seen a very heartening increase in confidence, maturity and, indeed, in engaging on issues related to trade and to political dialogue, to which we attach great importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone said that everything in Africa was terrible and things were not improving. I do not think that we can make that case. There are limitations, but we are there, working behind the Cotonou Partnership Agreement with parliamentarians in a unique way. There is no other North-South parliamentary assembly such as ours that has this opportunity to press on governance, democracy and human rights, and that is what we do.</p>
<p class="contents">On the EDF, briefly, we are concerned and we had a debate at the part-session in Brussels a few weeks ago. Many of us are concerned about the situation of the overseas countries and territories in relation to the EDF. We are concerned that allowance has not been made for the entry of East Timor into the ACP-EU relationship, and we have a number of other concerns. We are always puzzled about the 3% or 4% administration costs. I do not know why the Commission needs to put money in to pay itself for the job it is doing. I find that rather odd.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn briefly to sugar, with which the Commissioner has been directly involved. At the weekend I am going to Africa – Swaziland – and Mauritius to look again at the issues related to sugar there. The Commissioner must be aware that the figures we now have on the budget line, going from EUR 130 million up to EUR 170 million by 2013, are far short of what the Commissioner and others had promised, which was EUR 190 million. My own government talked about EUR 230 million. They are going to get EUR 1.1 billion at the end of 2013 and it is back-loaded. How can that be sensible? We urge the Commissioner to look at this and to try to make this more workable. Stop this back-loading and increase the amounts on the budget line for these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is not just about employment in sugar, as the Commissioner must know – because we made enough fuss about it in Europe – but also about the other developments that depend on and grow around that source of employment. Thousands and thousands of livelihoods are at stake in those 18 Sugar Protocol countries. You can rely on us in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to keep raising this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We have work in progress. Our committees are working well and I think that we can fairly say that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly can only grow in strength in future years. We will continue to fight on EDF, trade and other concerns and priorities that we share with our fellow Joint Parliamentary Assembly parliamentarians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not therefore talking now about the situation concerning the ACP countries so much as the work of the delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly I am grateful to the Bureau of the European Parliament for its decision to authorise the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly to be held in Edinburgh. The meeting was a success, and Great Britain, the country holding the presidency at the time, and the City of Edinburgh deserve praise for organising the event so well. I hope that it will be possible to organise the JPA in the country holding the presidency in future as well, because the place where the meetings are held brings true added value, as does the fact that the meetings are held by rotation in the EU-ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also excellent that representatives of the ACP and the EU were able to participate in the informal council of ministers for development cooperation organised by the UK Presidency in October. Hopefully the practice will also continue when my country, Finland, takes over the presidency in July.</p>
<p class="contents">The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has an important role in implementing the political dialogue provided for by Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement. The objective is to strengthen democracy, good governance and the human rights situation. It is just a slight nuisance that our meetings always partly coincide with Committee Week. For me it has meant that I have never been able to be continuously present at a meeting. I do not know whether other Members share the same opinion, but I would think that it would be easier to get away during the week when Parliament’s groups hold their meetings. It would perhaps be worth testing this option.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also happy that standing committees have been set up. They have made for better upstream cooperation between the European Parliament and the ACP members. I realised how viable the system was when I myself produced a report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should also like to draw attention to the conclusions of the Women’s Forum that took place at the fringe of the Assembly during the final session in Edinburgh in November. The discussion touched upon the issue of the trafficking of women and girls from developing countries and the poorest parts of Europe to the wealthiest areas of Western Europe. Some 600 000 to 800 000 women are trafficked every year across international borders, which corresponds to more than the entire population of some ACP countries, for example Cape Verde, Djibouti and the Comoros Islands.</p>
<p class="contents">The Women’s Forum established a bridge between countries of origin and destination. The debate was lively, with strong participation from the contingent from the ACP countries. In the final conclusions, the participants called on the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to draw up a report to identify the measures needed to combat this scourge in all ACP countries, including European, African and Caribbean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that the Forum was arranged for the fringe of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and that resources are not made available for it. I therefore call on Parliament’s services and the Conference of Presidents to consider harnessing funding for such a positive, results-focused organisation. On a more general level, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly last year discussed the situation in Darfur and West Africa, but did not address the breakdown in the rule of law and the electoral process, and the serious violations of human rights in countries of key, symbolic significance such as Ethiopia, where the African Union has its headquarters.</p>
<p class="contents">There have, however, been important developments in the fight against impunity in Africa; for example, the dictator Charles Taylor has been arrested and brought to justice. Other dictators such as Hissène Habré, and former Ethiopian dictator Mengistu, currently being harboured by ACP countries like Zimbabwe and Senegal, must also be brought to justice. These are further cases in which the Assembly can play a key role in ending impunity in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">On this issue, I must say that it would be most useful if the debates were more genuine. Sometimes, there are ACP countries acting more as the ambassadors of their governments and less as critics of the situation in their countries. I feel that as MEPs we have a duty to find ways of supporting our counterparts from ACP countries who are determined to tell the truth and to encourage them to take action to bring about change and better governance in their countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My message to the ACP is that we still wish on principle that ACP delegates should only be from among members of parliament and not ambassadors, and preferably from government and opposition parties, which would better reflect the balance of the European Parliament’s delegation. I am not sure whether one day we will have the EP meeting the AP – the African Parliament, including, of course, the Caribbean and Pacific – but certainly we must play our part in sustaining and developing that African Parliament concept.</p>
<p class="contents">My message to the European Parliament is that REACH has shown us how intimately the work of each of us affects that of the other. We had valuable discussions in Bamako and in Edinburgh and this Parliament, I am sure, will take the ACP views into account. Often, however, we legislate for all the right reasons in the European Parliament yet we have not heard the worries of the ACP, because we have not listened. That is why I say to the Commissioner that the ACP is not just for our good friend Mr Michel: it is for all the Commissioners in the College.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that this House overruled the Presidency of Parliament on the question of where the last JPA should be sited in the European Union. It was right for us to site it in the country holding the Presidency, just as we rotate our meetings in the JPA in the ACP countries. That gives ACP members an opportunity to see different aspects of different policies in Europe, for example the malaria vaccine research in Edinburgh. In the same way, we learned much from seeing the desertification of the Niger; or the implementation of the vaccine fund on the ground in Mali, where we could see the people who are most affected actually benefiting from the work being done. The flu pandemic threat and the avian flu pandemic reality show just how important it is that we continue to work closely together – Europe and the countries of the ACP – for our mutual benefit.</p>

<p class="contents">Many speakers have mentioned the women’s forum that takes place at every meeting of the Joint Assembly, and I would like to do likewise, for the in-depth discussion of the political and economic problems specific to women in the ACP countries is very helpful, not only to the women’s forum itself, but also to the Assembly’s ensuing plenary debates. I need do no more than remind the House of the exciting debate on genital mutilation that took place in Bamako in Mali – itself a country in which this practice is not yet proscribed by law – when the discussion went on for hours and we even managed to get it carried on the radio.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to share with you some thoughts on the work done by the committees, which has had the effect of markedly improving the work of the ACP-EU Assembly, in that fewer amendments are tabled in the plenary, and the higher degree of trust established between MEPs and the representatives of the ACP countries means that compromises are achieved more often. I would, though, like to reiterate something that has already been said, namely that it is important to give thought to the scheduling of the European meetings of the committees, which are held in Brussels. It is sometimes a real shame that we should have to take part in votes in our own specialist committees, which can go on for hours, and are thereby prevented from taking part in the exciting and important debates in the ACP-EU committees, which is sometimes – wrongly – taken as an indication of a lack of interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolutions adopted by this Assembly sometimes even launch debates that go beyond that forum. Mr Bowis mentioned the resolution on REACH, adopted here in November last year, which has led to a much more focused discussion about the impact of REACH on the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The next Joint Parliamentary Assembly also promises to be interesting. It will deal with such important issues as the role of regional integration in the promotion of peace and security, the problematic issue of energy in the ACP countries and the social and environmental aspects of fisheries in developing countries. I know from my colleague, Mr Michel, that he is very much looking forward to attending those meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">On the sugar issue, I am indeed familiar with the issue of funding for the Sugar Protocol countries. We have had this discussion before. I should just like to reiterate that EUR 40 million is available in 2006. What is more important is that we do not forget that the impact of the price drop agreed within the European Union will not have an effect on the ACP countries until 2008. They have another two years to try to adapt their production with the money available from the European Union. You know that considerable funds will be available from 2007 until 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union we have shown that we also have a responsibility towards those countries that will be affected by internal legislation concerning the need – that I am quite sure everybody feels – to adapt our agricultural policy to a more global trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quantitatively speaking, Europe is the world’s greatest donor, but there has been a growing global awareness over recent years of the truth that the way aid is targeted is at least as important as the quantity of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year’s Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness forms an important benchmark for action on this front and the Commission has recently responded to it by means of a package of measures on the effectiveness of aid which we will shortly be discussing in the Committee on Development Cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">My own-initiative report, on which we are to vote today, makes a few serious recommendations as to how to make aid more effective. The effectiveness of aid is dependent to a large degree on good governance, free from corruption, for not only is it the case that aid money is raked off, but corruption is also a hindrance to development and has a disproportionate effect on the poorest members of society. It makes access to essential services, such as basic education and health care, more difficult and sometimes impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Corruption is an enormous problem on a worldwide scale. Estimates by the World Bank suggest that in any one year, over USD 1 billion – that is, 1 000 billion in our terms – is paid in bribes. In Africa, the world’s poorest continent, the amount estimated as being lost – USD 148 billion – is more or less equivalent to 25% of the continent’s GDP, and corruption is present at every level of society and nearly everyone is affected by it: politicians, civil servants, the media, multinational enterprises and the international donor community. Responsibility for good governance and effective aid is shared by the donor community and the developing countries themselves; ‘it takes two to tango’. My proposals therefore deal with what we – the European Union, the Commission and the Member States – can do in practical terms, preferably together with the international community as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">My principal proposal is for the drawing up of a blacklist of corrupt regimes, which should receive no further loans from banks or other financial institutions. Those who do lend money to governments on such a list would be exposing themselves to the risk of debt and would be unable to ask the international community to bail them out. This would prevent the people from becoming the ultimate victims of the likes of Marcos, Kabila, Abacha or any of their successors.</p>
<p class="contents">I then propose that a small percentage – 0.5% – of the amount paid out directly to a country’s government be required to be paid as budget support to civil society watchdogs. Such groups, belonging to organised civil society, are engaged in the public monitoring of the government’s income and expenditure in terms of the development goals. There also needs to be support – paid out of the same amount – for national parliaments, enabling them to better discharge their monitoring function together with the watchdogs.</p>
<p class="contents">Another proposal is that businesses found to have been involved in corruption in respect of projects in developing countries should thereafter be excluded from European tenders. Here too, I propose the compilation of a blacklist of such businesses. Those who can show that there has been improvement, through, for example, changes in management, would get a second chance and could be removed from the list.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, all Member States of the EU must delay no longer in ratifying the UN’s anti-corruption treaty, which dates back to 2003. At present, only two of them have done so: France and Hungary. That state of affairs must change. This treaty is the first international agreement to use international law as a means of combating corruption, by, for example, preventing and penalising money-laundering, promptly freezing financial assets held in banks overseas, and seizing those assets where corruption is proven.</p>
<p class="contents">Such are some of the proposals I have put forward in my report. They represent, of course, only a couple of steps that Europe can take in addressing the enormous problem that corruption presents to society, but let us – the Commission, Parliament and the Member States – make them a priority, so that we no longer merely point the finger at the developing countries, but also own up to our own wrongdoing. I will be interested to hear how the Commission responds to these practical proposals, for, remember: ‘it takes two to tango’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mariann Fischer Boel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report. The Commission is particularly keen on ensuring that the aid it manages serves the objectives of combating and ultimately eradicating poverty, and in that respect the power management of financial resources is crucial. Hence the decision to make governance in general a horizontal and central theme in the programming of the tenth EDF, because combating corruption can only be successful when embedded in a broader agenda of capacity building.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context we share the view of the rapporteur, Mr van den Berg, on the importance and scale of the problem. Corruption is indeed a major obstacle to development. It hits the poorest in developing countries the hardest. It is responsible for political instability and the violation of human rights, and it reduces the level of resources available for development funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we agree that corruption is a very complex phenomenon which needs to be addressed through a whole range of different measures. International agreements are important, and the report notes that the UN Convention on Corruption still has to be ratified by several of our Member States. We need to work with private-sector organisations, and we need civil society watchdogs.</p>
<p class="contents">In our assistance programmes we have various measures to support good governance, such as reforms of the legal system, support for Supreme Audit Institutions, assistance for civil society, and support for national parliaments, which was the subject of a debate at the recent ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. We already support civil society watchdogs, for instance Transparency International chapters in some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on budget support, Mr van den Berg pays particular attention to that, and rightly so, not because it is especially prone to corruption, but because it is part of the solution. Its big advantage is that it directly addresses a major source of corruption in many countries, namely the weak management of public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">Our budget support goes only to those countries which are clearly committed to reforming their public finance system and, by strengthening sensitive areas like public procurement, it makes an important contribution to the fight against corruption. Project-type assistance, on the other hand, is heavily based on public procurement but cannot address weaknesses in the system.</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware of the special report by the Court of Auditors on public finance management in the framework of budget support in ACP countries, which supports the approach adopted by the Commission. I also want to highlight the importance of the harmonisation agenda, which was the focus of the Paris Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in March this year and emphasises the importance of strengthening beneficiary country systems of financial management and control, which is precisely one of the things that we are doing. One note of caution, however: budget support is not earmarked for a specific sector, but specific sectoral reform measures and targets can establish the conditions for the funds which are, of course, paid into the general budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness also underlines the importance of improving the transparency of public procurement procedures in our partner countries. Those procedures are often a source of corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns our colleagues in the field. One of the key objectives of the devolution process is to ensure that aid is more closely supervised in the field and to make the most of the detailed local knowledge of our ‘in-country’ staff. Delegations can check that aid is properly used. Moreover, for some kinds of contract we now require external audits before we make the final payment, and a comprehensive system for programming external audits was introduced in 2003, covering audits to be launched both by headquarters and by delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, we share much of Mr van den Berg’s analysis. We think more attention could be paid to public procurement issues, and we think some of the detailed measures proposed need to be reviewed and discussed further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that overcoming corruption in the allocation of development aid is one of the main obstacles that we face in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">While concern mounts over a deficiency in funding for MDGs, we must ensure that the aid is being provided to developing countries and is being allocated efficiently. With increasing levels of aid, there is growing concern that politicians and officials will misuse money intended for the world’s poor. As Mr van den Berg said, corruption is widespread, affecting every sector and bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember, however, that it is by no means solely a problem for developing countries. There is a common argument that aid should not be channelled through government. However, we are increasing budget support and I am pleased to hear what the Commissioner has said about strengthening institutions to eliminate corruption through budget support and the reform of the public sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Massive restructuring of civil service and public financial management is necessary. Often these reforms are the sole responsibility of a few select civil servants. Civil servants in developing countries, who live on low, public sector wages, are struggling to keep their families out of poverty. They are subject to bribes and often have to moonlight in order to supplement their incomes. How can we expect people to implement the necessary reforms if they are not paid accordingly?</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest to the Commissioner that we recognise and acknowledge about 200 civil servants in each developing country as the key players in the decision-making process and include them in budget support. Why do we not follow Singapore’s example and give these civil servants extra supplementary incomes, comparable to our standards, so that they are not tempted to take bribes to keep their families in the style to which they have become accustomed?</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to deregulate. Regulation is the mother of corruption. The power of the paper impels people to get permissions, and permissions are sought and bought by corruption. If we deregulate as much as possible in the developing countries, we will have a chance to address this problem. After all, regulation was used as a colonial instrument: the power of the paper, as opposed to the soldier in the village, to enact the imperial master’s wishes. When independence came, these countries kept those controls in place. They did not deregulate the imperial controls and, because of that, corruption has become endemic because regulation has been piled on regulation. We need to get the national parliaments in developing countries empowered with thorough investigative capacities to look at corruption in those administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are on the right track. I congratulate Mr van den Berg on an excellent report and I am very pleased to hear what the Commissioner has said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU, and its Member States, contributes over half of public aid to development, overall. Following the decisions taken by the 2005 Spring European Council and the Gleneagles G8 Summit, international aid is set to increase substantially over the next ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, if we are to properly accomplish the Millennium Goals, appropriate transparency mechanisms must be brought in to ensure that development aid actually reaches the people on the ground it is designed to help. As the van den Berg report says, the appropriate management of development aid is essential to the good governance of the recipient countries. I should like to turn to the example of Ethiopia, where despite the fact that it is the largest recipient of external aid, which accounts for almost 25% of the country's public budget, there have nevertheless been serious breakdowns in the rule of law, democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to Articles 96 and 97 of the revised Cotonou Agreement, serious cases of corruption can lead to political consultations. The EU should not hold back from using this tool. Naturally, in the medium and long term, it is crucial to foster a dynamic civil society with a free, balanced press. This is the only way in which the citizens of developing countries will be able to expose corrupt governments and to free themselves from them. On a more practical level, the EU must bring pressure to bear on the parliaments and governments of developing countries to step up control over military spending.</p>
<p class="contents">Shadow and parallel budgets are in themselves a form of corruption, directly affecting internal, regional and even global security. The lack of transparency in this area is a clear example of the link between corruption, bankrupt countries and security. In other words, when we speak of corruption, we also speak of war and peace, and as such the problem is not confined to developing countries, given that our own EU and western governments more often than not have a part to play in this. The G8 countries, for example, are responsible for more than 80% of world arms exports.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the efforts made by EU Member States towards ensuring the compatibility of arms exports from the Union with the technical and economic capacity of importing countries under the EU’s Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. It is vital to guarantee that money for development is not diverted towards arms. Unfortunately, we are still awaiting detailed reports from the Member States on the implementation of the rules of this code.</p>
<p class="contents">In this murky area of arms, corruption and violence, Europe has a responsibility to guarantee that the arms sold by European companies and by European governments reach their legal recipients, and only them, and do not fall into the hands of criminals, militias and repressive governments. The partial implementation by Member States, including my country, of the 2003 European Council common position on arms brokering means that there remain legal loopholes in this area in Europe. Unless we start being tougher on arms control within our own borders, it will be difficult to combat corruption in this area in developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The scourge of corruption is neither new nor rare. It has accompanied human activity since ancient times and is widespread amongst both the developing and the developed countries – the only difference being that in the developed countries, it is practised more professionally and more elegantly and is thus more difficult to recognise.</p>
<p class="contents">So, with corruption being so common and extensive, how effective have attempts made at international level to curb it actually been? Not very, I am afraid. The estimated amount of USD 1 trillion paid in bribes today is not less than the corresponding amount in previous years; in fact, it is more. The reason is simple: corruption cannot be controlled by signing conventions and declarations alone, but only by the strict implementation of such conventions and declarations by <span class="italic">all</span> concerned. To that effect, we in the developed world must set a good example.</p>
<p class="contents">While passing judgment on corruption in the developing world, let us look at ourselves. Also, let us consider critically our own state of affairs and let us analyse ourselves by asking some simple questions. How free from corruption is a system that allows United States Government officials at the highest level – names like Cheney and Rumsfeld come to mind – allegedly to be involved and have a personal interest in companies awarded multi-million contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan? How corruption-free is it to have the wife of the Prime Minister of Britain, Mrs Blair, working for a large law firm and taking up highly politically sensitive cases, which directly involve and are affected by political decisions taken by her husband? Should not the Roman proverb that Caesar’s wife must not only be honest but must also be seen to be honest apply here? How free from corruption is a system that allows United Nations officials and other related persons, including the son of the United Nations Secretary-General, to be accused of involvement in oil-for-aid scandals?</p>
<p class="contents">Closer to home, how corruption-free can the system be seen to be when Members, or their close relatives, of the European Parliament and other EU institutions, involved in making legislation, are at the same time members of boards of companies, or are stakeholders in companies which stand to make huge profits from such legislation? Is a simple declaration of interest really good enough?</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, may I draw your attention to two amendments by Mr Kristovskis, concerning recital N and paragraph 22. These amendments correct a mistake that was made in the original report in recital N, in which Cyprus was omitted from the list of EU Member States that have not yet ratified the 1997 OECD Convention. In fact, Cyprus has repeatedly attempted to participate in the OECD, but Turkey, for political reasons unrelated to the subject, blocked such participation. By voting positively for these two amendments, we will make it possible for Malta, Lithuania, Latvia and Cyprus to ratify the OECD Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marie-Hélène Aubert, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, I too should like to thank Mr van den Berg for his excellent report. He is going to be showered with praise as a result, which is something at least. It is clear that the fight against corruption is absolutely crucial, in terms not only of the effectiveness of European aid, but also of its credibility. How can we really convince our fellow citizens or the Member States to give more if corruption remains endemic? This is also the condition of the viability of a constitutional State and of an economy. This is therefore a crucial battle that we must fight to the end, one that has become somewhat more complex with the advent of economic globalisation, due to the ease with which capital can be moved and also due to the new budgetary aid process at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur does a good job of highlighting all of the questions posed by this new budgetary aid system with regard to the fight against corruption, as well as the heightened problem, in the present context, resulting from the increased pressure put on raw materials and, in particular, on scarce oil supplies. There is therefore also reason to fear both a resurgence of attempts at corruption for the purposes of gaining access to the last remaining fossil fuel reserves and an increase in conflicts linked to the trade and traffic in weapons. Weapons and oil are in fact the two large sectors, in the macroeconomy, in which a high level of corruption is developing.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur therefore rightly emphasises two issues: transparency and responsibility. Transparency, in actual fact, is a crucial element if one is to have a precise and clear idea of the budgets that are used. In this field, we must be far more enthusiastic in our support of a number of initiatives, such as ‘Publish What You Pay’ or the initiative of the extractive industries, which nevertheless have the disadvantage of being based solely on voluntary participation. We need to make progress in this area of legislation rather than merely to rely on the good will of economic or political actors to publish, if they so wish, the funds or loans that they give to the governments concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The budgetisation of the revenue from oil and mining is also a crucial aspect of budgetary transparency but, as far as the European Union is concerned, this must be a requirement so that budgetary aid cannot be granted to a government that does not clearly publish the profits that it makes from the oil, mining or forestry industries. Public opinion cannot understand why the European Union continues helping countries that should, by rights, have a sizeable budget and one that is able to finance the smooth running of a State.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the report points out that a government’s military expenditure must also be published. The role of national parliaments and of civil society simply must be strengthened, in financial terms too, by means of increased support enabling both parliaments and civil society to play their role in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns transparency with regard to the various donors. The governments of these countries are also helped by towns, regions or States, at all levels, and we lack a database that would indicate what is really paid by a given country to a given State, region or town. We do not have access to that information today, and that also fuels corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I therefore believe that we need to put matters in order, as has been said, and that corruption cases, too, form part of the current issues facing the European Union. The issue of exercising power and of funding political life is as relevant in the North as it is in the South. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that rooting out corruption is a key objective if we want to ensure the effectiveness of aid, and Mr van den Berg has outlined the instruments needed to make that possible: transparency, participation and responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of parliaments and civil society is crucial, and more transparent procedures and the circulation of information are vital. Furthermore, it is requested that all of the social actors become more involved in the process of defining anti-poverty strategies, which still attract little participation, even at national level. Finally, specific funding is necessary in order to monitor the cooperation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is impossible to talk about corruption in developing countries without looking at the other side of the coin: to what extent are we, as developed countries, responsible for their corruption and what benefit do we derive from it? Mr Matsakis gave some very precise examples; this in no way means easing the pressure on the actual corruption of many leaders and governments of developing countries and, at times, of NGOs too.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against corruption in recipient countries must also be extended to corrupting companies belonging to industrialised countries, and the fight against ‘corrupt corruptors’ should be conducted as part of an effective and transparent partnership. The institutions of donor countries located in recipient countries must commit themselves to fighting the phenomenon on the ground, by singling out corrupting companies and banishing them to whichever country they belong, as Mr van den Berg also said, and they must have the courage to act even when corruption is lurking in our own institutions on the ground. In addition to being a moral matter, the cost of corruption is a cost that everyone must bear, including European taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">Untying aid is another crucial aspect of the relationship between corruption and aid effectiveness. Untied aid – which is necessary for ethical reasons – guarantees greater transparency in relation to procedures and to the awarding and management of tenders, and would also increase the value of aid. The figures are quite clear: tied aid causes an average increase in the cost of goods and services of between 15% and 30%, rising to as much as 40% for food aid.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be helpful if we could also come up with an appropriate definition of ODA. I believe that official development aid, which is often swollen by massive sums for debt cancellation, for peace keeping, peace enforcing and conflict prevention efforts, for repatriating immigrants and for controlling borders, must not be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">In this kind of scenario, budget aid can become an important support channel to the poorest, most heavily indebted countries, for the purposes of eradicating poverty and of attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Nevertheless, I believe that it is crucial – as, moreover, it is claimed in the tripartite document on the European consensus on development policy – that the governments of the Member States and the European institutions try to coordinate themselves and harmonise their own policies, including within international financial institutions, with a view to becoming not only the leading donors in the world, but also the most responsible of donors and the most incisive when it comes to drafting policies that put an end to the spiralling external debt in the South of the world, thus helping to eradicate poverty and, if I may be so bold, to eliminate a little injustice, too, and perhaps even wars. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that aid is an important tool in this fight for a better world. The EU’s aid policy is in itself very poor. However, it is undermined by other policy areas too. Firstly, the EU conducts an agricultural policy in which absurd subsidies are given to relatively rich farmers. This, together with the duties that the EU imposes on agricultural products from poor countries, leads to a situation in which agricultural policy actively militates against aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the EU’s trade policy leads to poor countries being deprived of the ability to enter our market with their competitive products. A topical and instructive example of this type of damaging protectionism is the EU’s recent imposition of duties on shoes from, for example, Vietnam. Thirdly and lastly, I believe that development cooperation should take place at Member State level. If aid is to be as effective as possible, it is, of course, always crucially important that efforts be coordinated.</p>
<p class="contents">This coordination should, however, take place at UN level where donors from all over the world, and not only from the EU, work together in order to bring about effective aid which, as a matter of actual fact, leads to a reduction in poverty. This process really would lead to the world’s poor countries being given a better deal, an outcome that should be the main purpose of aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Corruption is the single biggest obstacle to the delivery of aid to the poor. We have to ask why the EU continues to channel aid to corrupt regimes. How can we stand by and watch starvation in many African countries, while the leaders are laden with the trappings of exceptional wealth? The EU must take a firm stance against governments that are exercising blatantly corrupt methods of governance.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for more transparency. The EU is the world’s largest donor of aid. The EU has a responsibility to monitor and approve the implementation of this aid. More aid must be channelled directly into specific projects rather than a handover to recipient national coffers, so it is absolutely clear where the money is being spent. The establishment of civil society watchdogs in developing countries must be seriously looked at and I call on the Commission to give the appropriate percentage of budget aid for such watchdogs.</p>
<p class="contents">Education and training needs to be improved and the number of women in higher level education needs to be increased in order to afford them the opportunity to become more involved in politics. Anyone who has visited Africa knows the important role that women play. They could play a far more important role if they were allowed to, so this needs to be looked at and encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">A major question facing development countries is the illicit acquisition of public funds by government officials who store them in offshore accounts. I call on the financial institutions that hold these stolen funds to freeze them or confiscate them. They know where this money is coming from. If I lodge EUR 10 000 in my bank account in Ireland, the bank manager is obliged to ask me where the money came from. In these countries they put millions in and nobody asks them anything.</p>
<p class="contents">I call for corrupt regimes or individuals to be blacklisted, to prevent them from borrowing large sums of money from wealthy countries. Only when they have made a noteworthy move towards democracy should they be removed from the list.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to examine ourselves. Take the case of Kenya and the Anglo Leasing scandal. Mr John Githongo, who is the anti-corruption tsar, had to leave the country because of what he found and he has asked that British citizens be examined concerning this scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">People in Europe are involved in scams and bogus companies that are lending and giving money to Africa and they have to be stopped. A number of years ago there was a campaign in all European countries. In Ireland we brought in legislation that meant that people involved in sexual offences in Third World countries could be charged in their home country. The same kind of legislation could be introduced in Europe with regard to corruption so that anybody in Europe involved in corruption or bribing officials in Africa or any other Third World country could and should be charged under legislation in their home country.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the sort of thing we have to look at if we are going to get rid of corruption. We cannot just blame African people. We have got to look at ourselves and how we are involved in schemes of this sort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What really is disappointing is where the ACP countries stood on the index and stand now, for there has been scarcely any improvement over the past five years.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a fine report, and makes clear that the rooting out of corruption could result in a significant increase in Africa’s gross domestic product. When one considers the fact that corruption primarily affects the poorest, it follows that, for many Africans, it makes the difference between life and death, and so it is a matter of life and death that the fight against corruption be pursued with adequate resources, rather than assuming that only a few prominent personalities are engaged in it, and that the fight against corruption is therefore of secondary importance.</p>
<p class="contents">What is equally important is that direct budget support be handled with care, for there is a risk of the EU writing out blank cheques to foreign bodies over which it has no control. Let us prioritise the giving of aid to NGO projects that are not only capable of producing tangible results, but which can be required to guarantee them and also to apply quality standards</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is of course mainly those who sit by the fleshpots in these countries who are criminally active, but it very rapidly becomes apparent that embezzled funds have to be deposited somewhere, and that is where we in Europe come into the picture very quickly. It is often our banks that offer dictators accounts where they can stash their money, and it is often European businesses that collude with structures in their countries to the eventual detriment of the people who live there.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us then see to it that we check carefully to see where budget aid goes; I have my doubts as to whether we in the EU really can give budget aid to 28 countries, as to whether the structures in them are such that we do that with any confidence. Let us use the legal means available to us to investigate banks in order to find where the dirty money has gone, and, for the good of the people who live in these countries, let us make sure it goes back there. Let us amend our legislation to prevent businesses from deducting bribes from tax as operating expenditure, and let us publicly name and shame those in Europe who do that, for naming and shaming is a good way of draining the swamp of corruption. Let us also use Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement to take action against notoriously corrupt regimes. I want to underline what Mrs Gomes had to say on this subject. I would like to see all these people – and their spouses too – barred for good from getting visas to come to Europe on shopping trips, spending the money they stole from their own people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today's order of business features Mr van den Berg’s report on the effectiveness of aid and on combating corruption in developing countries, and I too would like to join in the congratulations and gratitude to him that have been expressed; his report and what he said by way of introduction to it show very well the need for corruption to be fought and prevented for hampering development any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we need to get it into our heads that a significant increase in spending on development cooperation is needed, serious talking needs to be done about fighting corruption, so that corruption can no longer serve as an easy excuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Corruption, as a phenomenon, is both global and complex; it is not only in the developing countries that the causes of its occurrence there are to be sought. The OECD’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials is an important means of addressing the connections between corruption on our own countries and corruption in the developing world. I believe that we – that is, the European Union – must do everything possible to get Latvia, Lithuania and Malta – which are EU Member States – to ratify this convention as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something else about direct budgetary support. There is an increasing tendency in the European Union to opt for direct budgetary support rather than projects, and, basically understandable though that is, there are very many doubts about this, which have indeed been aired today. There are doubts as to whether we have at our disposal sufficient capacity and sufficient personnel to guarantee the comprehensive monitoring that will be necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just how necessary it is that action be taken to deal with this is spelled out by the African Union’s estimates according to which corruption robs the African national economies of some USD 150 billion per annum, amounting to one-quarter of their gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to start with the very same aspect to which Mr Gahler referred – the highlighting of the need for action on our part even when it hurts us the most. Bribes to the tune of a billion are paid every year – by whom? Who is it that regards the payment of this sort of money as an investment and remits it to closely-guarded accounts in the expectation of even greater profits? Important though it is to urge our partners to combat corruption and support them in doing so, our primary task should be to take off the field those in our own countries who are capable of paying such massive sums in bribes in the first place and using them to ruin Africa and other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to explicitly highlight Article 15 of the UN Convention against Corruption, according to which the Member States of the European Union must make bribery a criminal offence. In my own country, Germany, it was until recently the case that bribes could be set off against tax, and people can still not be punished for paying them.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House should sweep away this foul-smelling filth from in front of our own front doors first. Like you, like everyone on the Development Committee, I support the ‘publish what you pay’ campaign and would go as far as to demand that multinational companies be compelled to make public information on the payments they make to governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the others who profit from bribery and to whose activities we must put a stop are those banks that offer their services in completing such transactions and can rejoice in accounts full to overflowing with bribes. This cannot be permitted within the EU, and so we should call on the EU and its Member States to cut off the channels for slush money outside its borders as well. When we have criminalised bribery here at home, when our own standard of living is no longer financed even in part by the profits of corruption, when we no longer sing the praises of our banking houses for making profits from the management of corruption and when we equip our investigating agencies with the wherewithal to chase after those who pay bribes – then will we be able to stand tall before our partners and bid them make the same contribution towards combating corruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Corruption prevents aid from being as effective as it might be, so it is desirable that it should continue to be tackled, and this report offers concrete and rational instruments for reinforcing the machinery of control, resulting in an improved legal framework for combating corruption. The legal framework is not, however, the only factor. Rejection of corruption as a social phenomenon has just as much to do with the values that prevail in a society. It is, then, civil society organisations, and religious leaders in particular, who need to be challenged as to their role in promoting good governance and in fighting corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed is for this debate to become more than merely theoretical. In any case, both countries and aid organisations that give aid must be able to have confidence that their money is being used efficiently and for its intended purpose. An expert whose opinion I sought about the van den Berg report told me, the day before yesterday, that it was an outstanding one, and that he hoped the Dutch Government would adopt it without amendment.

This morning we are debating the scale and extent of it. I congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Members have mentioned the global problem of corruption. I think we are deluding ourselves if we say that it is just a problem for the developing world. I would suggest that they have learned from the developed world: much to our shame, we have taught them some tricks. We therefore owe it to them and to ourselves to clean up our own act. I would support my colleague, Mr Ryan, who said that the banks and the financial institutions need to be looked at in this entire process, because if there were no home to put the money into perhaps they might not be so corrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning I spoke to some aid agencies that have long experience in this area. Their key message to us is that we must build up the capacity within the systems and the civil service of the developing world, and then build that into all our aid programmes. They also said that this is a long-term process and we will not get results overnight. I think a big part of our crackdown on the corrupt is to take them out within the developed world first and then perhaps assist the rooting-out of corruption in the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever we do, we must not penalise those who most need our aid, money and assistance. I always feel when we talk about tackling corruption that it is they who will again suffer. That is the one message. Let us build it into our programmes, but let us ensure that we keep up our aid work, that it gets to the right people and that they do not suffer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this Parliament we have to be realistic about what we can do. The report looks at some of the aspects where we can make a difference. I would like to concentrate on the role of parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has well-established links with parliaments in many of the countries around the world, the countries with which we are concerned. Sometimes parliaments are the problem. I accept that. But in others, as the previous speaker has mentioned, national parliaments can be excluded; they can be bypassed in the process and corrupt officials can get hold of the aid without the involvement of government. Therefore, I believe we should do more to support democratically elected governments and help them to reinforce the mechanisms in their countries for distributing the aid and making sure that the money donated is widely used.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ryan referred to a very interesting point in the report: that there is evidence that corruption falls as the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women rises. We can encourage that. We can do more in democracies to make sure that more and more women are elected. I was very proud to be part of the European Parliament’s delegation to Afghanistan to support their first parliamentary elections. There we saw women voting to elect other women. The more we can do to help women and parliaments to develop, the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore of great practical importance that a society should possess an ethical framework and good practices in order to solve this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Weak moral principles promote both self-serving transactions and the concealment of those transactions. Those who provide aid are tempted to believe that their money is used for the correct purpose. Those who receive aid often succeed in making us believe that is the case. The corruption that accompanies the granting of aid is especially drastic because the actual people who are in distress suffer doubly. They not only lose the material assistance they should have received, but they are also robbed of the hope to improve their lives and of the hope for solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore it is our obligation to consistently expose and, even more importantly, prevent corruption and the gullibility that accompanies it. It is the opinion of the Court of Auditors that the European Commission’s aid programmes do not sufficiently take into consideration the risks of corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to offer two examples. Firstly, European Union aid to the Palestinian Self-Government. Today we must admit that one of the main reasons the extremist Hamas movement came to power was the previous administration’s deeply rooted corruption. Secondly, the Commission sends humanitarian aid to Chechnya. What has been done to determine whether those funds actually reach the local inhabitants who suffer from official corruption?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to emphasise a couple of important points in this very good report. Member States must ratify the UN anti-corruption convention. Secondly, budget support should only be provided to governments which are clearly striving to raise standards for the administration of public finances. I am glad the representative supports that course. A certain percentage of the aid granted should be allocated to supporting organisations that monitor civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">And last of all, the main problem, which is to put pressure on countries housing financial centres to freeze and repatriate illegal funds deposited there by corrupt rulers. This is a very difficult requirement, but its implementation is a test that will demonstrate whether or not we are serious about preventing corruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is truly amazing that, often both in the international community and in the European Union, the question of combating corruption has been a taboo. That is because political expediencies, the Member States' interest in exerting their influence and international customer relations were more important.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the Millennium Development Goals has been assessed as a failure. However, no one spoke about what the role of corruption was in that failure. I believe that the international community should set a new development goal: democratic governance and combating corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, I should like to add that the European Union, and especially the European Commission, must lay down strict conditionality mechanisms in the new development strategy formulated for Africa. The European Union needs to collaborate with the UN, with international financing organisations and with non-governmental organisations, so that we can jointly combat this phenomenon, by putting the emphasis on consolidating civil society and independent media. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Imagine how many excellent initiatives could be funded with that amount of money. Every year USD 1 billion could be spent and used to help those who really need aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Corruption restricts the access of the poor to goods. It decreases the effectiveness of public services and, most of all, leads citizens to lose confidence in centres of power. The European Union, as the largest donor of aid to developing countries, should play a particularly active role in ensuring the transparency of aid programmes funded from the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore not enough to create an international ‘black list’ of corrupt governments. Politicians, civil servants, NGOs, international corporations and the media should all become involved in the fight against corruption. It is only by coordinating the activities of international donors that aid can be spent more effectively, thus preventing misspending or the appropriation of aid money by corrupt civil servants.</p>

I think it is important to underline that the problem of fraud can never be considered as solved. Constant vigilance at all levels and in all circumstances is needed in the high-risk field of external actions. These actions are carried out in poorly governed States, where countervailing powers and capacities at the level of civil society are lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">As corruption cannot be isolated within the governance agenda, the Commission’s approach in preventing and fighting it is twofold. It consists of mainstreaming good governance practices in all EU-funded programmes and projects on the one hand, and in the implementation of specific programme interventions on the other hand.</p>
<p class="contents">Country strategy papers and national indicative programmes between the European Union and beneficiary countries generally include specific interventions in the fields of rule of law, democratisation, public administration reform, public finance management and reinforcement of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now make a few comments on some of the questions that have been raised today. On the discussion on companies, we must make sure that companies do not benefit from corruption. We must do the best we can. We can exclude companies from participation in our tenders if they have been found guilty of fraud or corruption. We can also suspend a project that has been financed if we discover fraud or corruption at some stage. We once used that option on a project in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">On support for national parliaments, the Commission sees the strengthening of the national parliaments’ supervisory role as an important means of trying to improve the overall effectiveness and impact of our development effort in these countries. For instance, through the EDF and the budget line for South Africa, the capacities of national parliaments of some 11 ACP countries have been strengthened to a total amount of EUR 35 million since 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of watchdogs, it is true that we work with private sector organisations. We would be worse off if we did not have these watchdogs.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members raised the issue of transparency, and it is a key issue. That is why we support several programmes in the field of budget supervisory functions. The promotion of efficient and transparent budgeting and public spending is at the heart of our budget support programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, through its permanent dialogue with the partner governments and the various regions, the Commission encourages the broadest possible participation of institutions at various levels, particularly at parliamentary level. I have noted the view on the positive influence of the participation of women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">‘We are writing to express our disappointment about the content of the Declaration on the final text of the Fluorinated Gas Regulation made unilaterally by the Commission in the course of the European Parliament plenary session of 4 April 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">‘As you are aware, the Regulation is an important step towards the achievement of the objectives set out in the Kyoto Protocol and in line with the European Climate Change Action Programme. We fear that the Commission’s Declaration was an attempt to compromise the difficult political agreement reached between the European Parliament and Council and with the support of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">‘On 31 January both the European Parliament and the Council demonstrated a clear will to find a political solution to the problem of national measures, already adopted by some Member States, to reduce F-gas emissions. The Declaration was made at the last minute and cannot be considered a positive step in the process of adoption of Community legislation. We sincerely hope that the Commission will consider carefully its next steps, not only from a purely legal point of view, but also in accordance with the spirit of the agreement reached in Conciliation.’</p>
<p class="contents">The letter is signed by my colleague Professor Trakatellis and me.</p>
<p class="contents">I was assured personally last night by Commissioner Verheugen, the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry and Vice-President of the Commission, that – and I quote him with his permission: ‘If the new regulation enters into force, I will propose to the Commission to withdraw the infringement procedures against Austria and Denmark.’</p>

This is an unsatisfactory state of affairs and must be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">When issuing residence permits, both Switzerland and Liechtenstein carry out exact examinations and inquiries, paying careful attention to security. I would also like to point out that both Switzerland and Liechtenstein apply in every case the same high-quality security standards as the other States, which belong to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to me that this statement of vote should be supportive of Switzerland and of those in it who are working towards its accession to the European Union.

<p class="contents">The resolution adopted, which is the product of the invaluable contribution of all the groups, exposes the seriousness of the situation for the refugees living in inhuman conditions, with virtually no basic sanitation or personal care. The resolution, however, makes it quite clear that Europe is highly responsible for what happens in Malta. It goes without saying that the delegation’s visits to reception centres throughout Europe are not intended for the purposes of rating centres as good or bad. However, the situation in Malta, although a far cry from that of Lampedusa in terms of the occupants’ living conditions, does call to mind that Italian island in terms of its size and reception capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the Council to adopt a clear and strong position so that, in line, of course, with the principle of solidarity, we arrive as quickly as possible at a common and fair immigration policy aimed at preventing the costs of these waves of illegal immigrants from burdening only the budgets of a few States on the periphery of southern Europe, which are totally unable to support themselves financially. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its resolution, the European Parliament speaks in no uncertain terms of the presidential elections having been manipulated. It sounds an alarm bell over the dictator’s armed suppression of a peaceful demonstration by the Belarus people. These people have stopped being afraid, even though they do not know what awaits them.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament’s attention is focused on the arrested opposition leaders and we are demanding their immediate release. The resolution acknowledges the immense enthusiasm of the young people who have now been thrown out of universities. It is these young people who need a helping hand, as they will be shaping the future of their country. Slovakia has already joined those countries that have pledged to help such students, and they will now be able to complete their studies in Slovakia. In voting for this resolution, it was my wish also to focus attention on the need for new elections in Belarus as soon as possible. Although Lukashenko has won the elections by rigging the vote, he has not beaten his opponents. The isolation of Lukashenko as a person will lead to his defeat.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to express my conviction that the request I made in the plenary of the European Parliament – that we should light a candle at 4 p.m. on the 16th day of every month in a show of solidarity with the Belarus people – will be heeded, and that everybody will be happy to do this. I believe that the flame of solidarity will never be extinguished in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have upheld that position in this House before, as I have in demonstrations outside it. Unfortunately, my group appears unable to give its unanimous backing to a resolution to this effect. Those opposed to this resolution are probably right for the time being when they say that workers and retired people in Belarus enjoy a higher level of social security than do their counterparts in any other former Soviet republics. That will only be the case, though, for as long as Russia thinks it can absorb that country by supplying it with cheap oil. This social security does not justify dictatorships or election frauds. My party, the Socialist Party, detests dictatorship. Socialism only has a future as a democratic movement, in open competition with other opinions, and certainly not as a dictatorship.

<p class="contents">Indeed, we are witnessing an absolutely appalling situation. In my country, France, a lack of foresight as to the healthcare needs of an ageing population, uninspiring career prospects and the application of the 35-hour week in public hospitals have led to a major shortage of staff. But a <span class="italic">numerus clausus</span> continues to limit access to these professions, and we recruit doctors and nurses from abroad. At the same time, people in the developing countries do not have access to healthcare, and we spend large amounts of money on sending humanitarian missions, often to restricted areas. It is completely crazy, particularly given that access to healthcare is now one of the reasons for mass illegal immigration: the French island of Mayotte, which is being overwhelmed, is a perfect example of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to denounce the immigration law 'chosen' by Mr Sarkozy, which will organise this siphoning off of elites on a grand scale, further compromising the development of the countries from which these elites come, and automatically aggravating emigration, while a bankrupt education system has given up on training a generation condemned to unemployment or dead-end jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The June List’s position is that aid should not be provided by the EU but by each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as the rapporteur points out, EU aid is ineffective. At the same time as relatively large amounts are invested in conducting a development policy organised by the EU, new EU barriers to trade are added to existing ones, making it impossible for the world’s poor countries to enter the EU market with their products. Moreover, the EU’s common policy on trade and agriculture is very harmful because, with its duties and subsidies, it renders developing countries’ agricultural products uncompetitive.</p>
<p class="contents">If the report had been about aid at Member State level, we should naturally have voted in favour of it, because inefficiency and corruption are two great obstacles to constructive and effective development cooperation.

We are closely following the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information available to the Commission, an outburst of violence started on 28 March, in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir following the funeral of PKK members. May I remind honourable Members that the PKK is included in the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The first victims were reported on 29 March in Diyarbakir and other fatalities were reported in the following days throughout the region. Over the weekend, riots also spread to Istanbul, where a Molotov cocktail was thrown into a crowded city bus. Three civilians were killed. Since then other fatalities have been reported, including among the security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear, the European Union unequivocally condemns terrorism. The PKK is a terrorist organisation. We are deeply concerned about its recent activities in Turkey. We feel that we are victims of these terrorist acts. But at the same time, we deeply deplore human casualties and call on the Turkish authorities to shed light on those events, through a comprehensive investigation, and to make sure that the security forces show the necessary strength in face of the demonstrators.</p>
<p class="contents">The people in the south-east of Turkey do not need violence and confrontation; they need peace, stability and prosperity. We urge the Turkish Government to address in a comprehensive manner – and not only from the security point of view – the problems of this region and of its people, who are for the most part of Kurdish origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish Government should take action with a view to enhancing and ensuring economic, social and cultural opportunities for all Turkish citizens. In this respect, we look forward to the follow-up of Prime Minister Erdogan’s speech in August 2005. The Commission recalls and stresses that under the Copenhagen political criteria, Turkey must ensure cultural diversity and promote the cultural rights of all its citizens as set out in the revised Accession Partnership adopted by the Council in January 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that Turkey facilitates the return of internally displaced people to their original settlements, ensures fair compensation for those who have suffered loss and damage as a result of the security situation, and addresses the abolition of the village guard system.</p>
<p class="contents">We will continue to monitor the situation in the south-east. We will raise these issues with the Turkish authorities as part of our regular monitoring of the political criteria. I am looking forward to a very interesting debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, at the same time, we must ask ourselves whether all the people who are protesting really support violence. Many analysts have drawn a completely different conclusion. They say that most Kurdish people do not want violence, they just want to have a prosperous future – with economic, social and cultural developments – within the state of Turkey. Now, more than ever, we need to invest in those people.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament’s report adopted at the end of 2004, we pressed for the development of the south east and for more cultural rights for the Kurdish people. It must be said that Prime Minister Erdogan has made impressive speeches since that time. However, at this difficult time these words must be followed more than ever by deeds. We must invest socially and economically so that people and their families have a prosperous future, so that they do not want violence for their children. We have to invest in more cultural freedom. If Turkish television and radio provided more air time for Kurdish programmes, then Roj TV in Denmark will not be that important any more.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the village guard system should be abolished and displaced people should be helped to return to their home regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time for wisdom instead of big words. It is time the Turkish Government tried to find interlocutors who are modest and want peace. I name Mr Baydemir and Mr Türk, the co-leader of the DTP. These people must continue to speak out against violence; but if they continue to do so, let the Turkish Government cooperate with them instead of a Minister of the Interior threatening to bring them to justice. I think cooperation is the way; wisdom is the way. Let us ensure that Kurdish citizens feel at home in one Turkish state. That is the only solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The PSE Group is calling for an end to the escalation of violence, and we welcome Prime Minister Erdogan’s indication of his intention to turn the tide of violence by bringing about more democratic and economic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">By doing this, he has extended a hand to the Kurdish community, which, though, has yet to accept this gesture. The PSE Group would also draw your attention to the appeal made by the Mayor of Diyarbakir to those Kurds who use violence, to abandon this strategy, because my group emphatically denounces excessive violence. If the violence stops, the tanks can, and indeed must, leave the streets of the towns and villages in the south-east. Tanks in the streets are not what people in Europe want to see when they consider the possibility of Turkey joining the European Union. I would like to stress that everyone in Turkey, including the Kurds, stands to benefit if Turkey’s progress down the road to EU membership is uninterrupted. Indeed, the protection of, and respect for, human rights of everyone in Turkey is a <span class="italic">conditio sine qua non</span> for EU membership.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allow agitators to sabotage the negotiations before they have got well and truly underway. It is unfortunate that the current violence interrupts a period of <span class="italic">rapprochement</span>, because some progress had already been made, for example, by the Turkish Government making Kurdish television possible. The agreements that were in place before the recent outbreak of violence must be further developed and, above all, implemented. That which has been committed to paper must be translated into reality.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a few words for the victims, for it is right that they should be remembered and mourned. There must be no more of them. I urge you to turn this difficult moment in Turkey into an opportunity for renewed solidarity in that country, which is desperately needed on the long and difficult road to EU membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are all doing their bit in their own way to impede Turkey’s progress towards the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish police and army are not serving the interests of the Turkish Government in their excessive use of force against protestors in Diyarbakir and other towns. The deep state is not under the democratic control of that government. The fact is the military has a vested interest in the prolongation of the violence, because that enhances its power, its importance and its resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The PKK does employ terrorist methods, and it has no doubt provoked and stirred up some of the recent violence, but its aims of achieving recognition of the cultural, linguistic and political identity of the Kurdish people are shared by many Kurds who do not espouse violence. To that extent, the PKK are seen as freedom fighters. The challenge, one where the Turkish authorities are failing, is to separate the die-hard opponents of violence and those who want to pursue a democratic route to a political solution.</p>
<p class="contents">A very hopeful development over the last few days has been the very moderate calls by people like Ahmed Türk and Osman Baydemir, the major of Diyarbakir, for an end to the violence and for political discussions. I somewhat regret that the Commission did not say anything about encouraging the Turkish Government to go down this route: not only of social and economic progress, which clearly is needed, not only of the recognition of linguistic and cultural rights, but of actually talking about political dialogue and a political solution in the Kurdish region in south-east Turkey in the construction of the Turkish State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission seems to baulk at giving the Turkish Government that encouragement. We all need to rally round and encourage Prime Minister Erdogan to carry on where he seemed to start last August but where he has stalled, no doubt because of the army. We all need to help him get the political dialogue for a solution going. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express, on behalf of my Group, our great concern about the situation in Turkey that we have seen in the media. Over the past week at least 15 people have lost their lives in clashes between demonstrators and Turkish security forces in the south-east and in terrorist attacks in Istanbul. We strongly condemn the disproportionate use of force by police forces in Diyarbakir and Kiziltepe.</p>
<p class="contents">But at the same time, we vehemently denounce the provocations by the PKK, whose leaders deliberately stir up violence and riots. After three municipal buses in Istanbul were burnt without any casualties, two young sisters were killed on Sunday evening when a bus was attacked. The majority of the Kurds, who wish to build a decent life in the towns or to return to their villages, should not be hostage to cynical leadership associated with the military wing of the PKK which wants to escalate the conflict, as well as some people in the ‘deep state’ in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the recent events we have the feeling that some of our colleagues in the European Parliament were not telling the whole story in the e-mails that were circulated recently. They give the impression of a black and white situation in which no Turk wants to grant more rights to the Kurds and every Kurd is an oppressed victim. That is why I believe it is important that we draw attention to the debate that is currently going on in civil society in Turkey, amongst intellectuals of Turkish and Kurdish origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me point out what they have said: first, Kurdish identity in Turkey must finally be officially recognised by the Turkish state; second, the policy for assimilating Kurds has been a complete failure; third, the Turkish state has to make sure that it gets back the trust of the Kurds and every citizen of Turkey; fourth, there cannot be any peaceful solution that insists that the PKK is the official negotiation partner of the state, because that will not happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I finish by quoting a former mayor of Diyarbakir, who has just pointed out: ‘If we are going to have real peace here, the PKK has to adjust itself to the new world situation. The Turkish state is becoming more democratic. The PKK needs to do the same. It should give up the idea of armed struggle and open respectful dialogue with Kurds who think differently. It also needs to renovate its leadership. This organisation was formed with a Cold War mentality. It needs to evolve’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For over a week, we have been seeing horrifying pictures, and getting horrifying reports, from a country with which the EU commenced accession negotiations in October 2005, to which, at that time, my group colleagues and I consented. Although, since commencing accession talks with the EU, the Turkish Government has initiated a reform process, it is not one that will be sufficient to resolve the country’s social and political problems and conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">Where these are concerned, there is one thing that should be clear to Turkey and to all of us, and that is that Turkey’s democratic deficits were and are closely tied up with the Kurdish question. For as long as Turkey tries to resolve this problem by military means, suppressing the civilian population and suppressing the free expression of opinions and ideas, there will be no peace in the land and hence no basis for a democratic state. The chasm running through its society must not be allowed to become even deeper, to the point of becoming unbridgeable.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish Head of State, Mr Erdogan, has described the murders of women and children as necessary interventions to deal with the instruments of terrorism. To date, 15 people have lost their lives, including three children, the youngest of whom was aged only three. Of the 278 persons detained in Diyarbakir, 91 are under the age of 18. If the Turkish security forces continue to shoot at civilians in Diyarbakir, Batman, Mardin and in many other Kurdish cities, and if the death toll rises still higher, then this chasm will become wider and the prospect of a peaceful solution more distant.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now high time for the Commission and the Council to use all the means at their disposal to bring pressure on Turkey to end the violence. The possibility needs to be discussed of the accession negotiations being suspended if the Turkish Government and the Turkish army continue to disregard democratic principles and violate human rights. I call for an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> delegation to be sent to Turkey to get to the bottom of what is going on there. I appeal to all those involved in the conflict to cease forthwith from violence, and I call on the Turkish Government to accept the Kurds’ lawfully elected representatives as negotiating partners and to drop the latest charges against them.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot – it must not – be tolerated any longer that 20 million Kurds should be denied their political and cultural rights and a say in how their society is shaped. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, this must not lead us to conclude that this is the only problem in Turkey: there is a major problem in connection with the rights of Kurds, which is something we should not sweep under the carpet in today's debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey has chosen its prospects. It has chosen European prospects and, thanks to these prospects, we have seen some progress over recent years on the question of the human rights of the Kurds, whose existence was barely recognised a few years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Turkey must continue on this course. The recent uncontrolled interventions by the army must not deprive the Kurds of the rights which they must have if Turkey is to become a member of the European Union, by which I mean the rights enjoyed by the citizens of European states.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Erdogan announced recently that Turkey would not step away from its objective of democracy and development and that it would introduce greater freedoms, more democracy, social assistance, rights and justice. This announcement is all well and good, but it needs to be more than just an announcement; it needs to be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures are needed on three levels: firstly rights are needed; secondly, economic and social policy is needed and, thirdly, the army, which has uncontrolled powers, needs to be restricted. If these measures are introduced, Turkey will have taken its European prospects seriously and if Turkey honours its commitments in both this area and in all the other areas stipulated by the European Union, this will be to the benefit both of the Kurds and of all the citizens of Turkey.</p>

I believe that the message to come out of our debate today must be a message of condemnation of the acts of terrorism against innocent civilians in Istanbul and other towns and of the military violence by the Turkish forces of repression against the Kurdish population.</p>
<p class="contents">The powers pushing for war and for the army to stay in power at all costs are responsible for the situation in south-east Turkey. The powers that be and the army in Turkey find in the action of the PKK a convenient pretext for continuing to intervene in political life and trying to define the terms of the resolution to the Kurdish problem. On the other hand, the PKK is taking advantage of the serious economic and social problems of under-development and poverty to feed with its actions the cycle of violence and bloodshed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact, and it would be a political mistake for us to underestimate it, that Turkey's European prospects paved the way for reforms by the Erdogan government. However, reforms are still at an early stage, are incomplete and are driven by the historic fear of the Turkish people against the Kurdish people.</p>
<p class="contents">We must support consistently and decisively the cultural, linguistic and education rights of the Kurdish community; we must support political rights; we must call for the electoral law prohibiting the democratic representation of the Kurdish community in the political life of Turkey to be amended.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish political leadership and the Erdogan government are responsible for proceeding with courage and decisiveness to complete the reforms and for the smooth political, economic and social integration of the Kurdish people. A strategy of peaceful resolution depends on dialogue between the two sides. It presupposes the renunciation, by both sides, of the philosophy of military conflict and of the solution. The Kurdish problem will be resolved not on terms of suppression and violence, but on terms of democratic dialogue, development and the flourishing of the rights of the Kurdish people.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has its political responsibility for formulating an integrated strategy for the Kurdish problem in Turkey:</p>
<p class="contents">-	it must remain a constant and consistent supporter of its European prospects, while at the same time controlling, without concessions and expediencies, the honouring of obligations by Turkey;</p>
<p class="contents">-	it must confirm its support for the territorial integrity and unity of the Turkish state and condemn the objectives of secession in the dead-end strategy of the PKK;</p>
<p class="contents">-	it must take initiatives to start democratic dialogue on a political solution to the Kurdish problem and on the safeguarding of the role and rights of the Kurdish community in the institutions and society of Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union, in cooperation with Turkish and Kurdish agencies, must help to formulate and implement economic and social reconstruction programmes to combat poverty and under-development, support the institutions and civil society and support the democratic moderate political forces in the area of south-east Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Violence and gross abuse of human rights, largely by the Turkish State, have been practised on and off in that region for decades and they will continue to occur for many years to come unless the Turkish Government recognises that the Kurdish problem will not go away simply by giving the army generals a free hand to deal with it in the only way they know how: by brute force.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish Government must understand that the millions of Kurdish people living in the region must have their human rights fully respected. They must have the right to use their own language, Kurdish, and to uphold their traditions and culture. Furthermore, the Turkish Government must accept that the Kurdish people are entitled to a degree of autonomy. If such an eventuality were to be negotiated, it would not adversely affect the wellbeing of the Turkish people; through the establishment of long-lasting stability, it would bring peace and prosperity to the whole of Turkey. In addition, the Turkish Government must take the brave step of acceding to the recent request by Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Masood Barzani to accept the federal structure of Iraq and to declare a general amnesty for PKK militants.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Erdogan’s Government has given signs of aspiring to achieve drastic democratic reforms in Turkey. We know that such reforms are greatly resisted by the deeply entrenched military establishment. The Turkish people must understand that those who resist change are in fact the real enemies of Turkey. Mr Erdogan is fighting a difficult battle, full of danger, with the army generals. We must encourage and support him because, if the generals win, Turkey’s progress towards democratisation will be halted, as will its progress towards EU accession, and the country will sink once again into the backwardness of military totalitarian control. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You yourself gave us a list, but I would like to bring to your attention the brutal murder of the elderly parents of the Kurdish Institute’s chairman in Brussels, although the other victims should not, of course, be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Rehn’s first response was to affirm his faith in the Turkish Government, an attitude that I find somewhat strange given that there is increasing evidence of those selfsame authorities playing an active role in this. I do not know whether you have seen the report of the IHD human rights organisation about the killing of Mr and Mrs Ferho, or the judicial inquiry into the bomb attack in Şemdinli. They both point in the direction of the Turkish army. When a few weeks ago, a public prosecutor wanted to investigate the direct involvement of the army’s second-in-command – who is also expected to become Chief of Staff – the army immediately vetoed the idea. These, then, are the authorities in whom the European Commission has blind faith.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, Commissioner, that these incidents do make it painfully clear that Turkey is in no way striving towards a peaceful solution to the conflict with the Kurds. Turkey simply refuses to recognise that the Turkish Kurds possess cultural and democratic rights of self-determination. A country that denies 15 million citizens all political and cultural rights is not what I would call a democracy. Nor, as I see it, can a country whose authorities are actively involved in serious violations of human and international law be described as a constitutional state. Ignoring this reality and failing to send out a powerful message from Europe makes us an accessory.</p>
<p class="contents">I really would like to know what the Commission intends to do in this respect. Will Commissioner Rehn at long last deliver on his promise and include the protection of the minorities in the association agreement or will he not? One crucial step, I think, could be for the European Union to do what Turkey does not do, or refuses to do, and enter into a direct and structural dialogue with representatives of the Kurdish community in Turkey on this matter. I would like to hear your opinion on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a characteristic of terrorist campaigns that their victims are, for the most part, ordinary civilians who want nothing more than to have a fair chance of bringing up their children in an atmosphere of peace, stability, freedom and increasing prosperity. None of that can be delivered while terrorists and insurgents pursue their own selfish ends, oppress, intimidate and mobilise Kurdish communities at home and abroad, and seek to inflame international opinion against the Turkish authorities. I do not imagine that there is very much freedom of opinion in those areas dominated by the PKK.</p>
<p class="contents">From time to time the PKK, an organisation with its roots in the Cold War, has declared a ceasefire. The most recent of those was last August, for less than a month. Since then it has continued its campaign of violence and murder. Since last weekend, as the Commissioner and other speakers have mentioned, over a dozen people have died as a result of terrorist violence. Over the years the victims of terrorism have numbered tens of thousands.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s EU accession negotiations are now under way. That is itself a factor in the PKK campaign. The PKK is not interested in a stable, thriving and democratic Turkey oriented to the West. It would prefer its own little Marxist state, living in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we want to see reforms in Turkey as part of a modernising agenda; of course we want to see great economic improvements in south-eastern Turkey. I feel enormous sympathy for people that live in poverty and fear. We want reasonable Kurdish concerns to be resolved in a just and fair way through negotiation. None of that can be achieved with a background of violence or the continuing threat of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Kurdish extremists must end their terrorism. The Turkish authorities can then respond in a spirit of goodwill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have listened with great interest to your remarks and these were duly noted.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we can all conclude that the situation in south-east Turkey is serious and, therefore, we all look forward to that situation being addressed vigorously through a comprehensive strategy, encompassing not just security concerns – which are legitimate – but also the socio-economic development of the region and the development of cultural rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to Prime Minister Erdogan’s speech of August 2005 – which I mentioned earlier – in which he emphasised the need to resolve through democratic means what he described as ‘the Kurdish issue’. The Commission will encourage the Turkish Government and its Prime Minister to take steps based on the commitment they made in that speech in Diyarbakir.</p>
<p class="contents">The stability of the region is key to properly addressing those issues and the continuation of terrorist attacks represents a serious threat in this respect. At the same time, it is very important that the security forces and the authorities show restraint and do not use excessive force when they deal with civilians.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on a few issues raised by Members. With regard to the Semdinli incidents, I should like to say that investigations are going on both in the judiciary but also in the parliament and we are awaiting the outcome of those investigations and we will continue to follow the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted the issue of progress and we are continually encouraging the Turkish Government to continue with the reforms and to extend more rights to the Kurdish people. I refer to the recent development – at least it is a positive step – of allowing broadcasts in the Kurdish language at certain times on the television and radio. We expect more to be done in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure Members that we will continue to monitor the situation in the south east. All these issues will be raised with the Turkish authorities as part of our regular monitoring of the political criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even in the few months that have passed since this year began, according to Mr Egeland, the UN Vice-Secretary-General with responsibility for Darfur, over 200 000 people have been driven from their homes and over 96 villages have been burned to the ground – and all this over a year since international action was taken with the intention of putting a stop to this sort of thing. This goes to show how incredibly feeble the international community is where Darfur is concerned, and the fact that the UN’s Vice-Secretary-General was prevented from travelling into the crisis zone in the first place shows that the Khartoum regime is quite blatantly defying and cold-shouldering the international community and thereby making of it a laughing stock.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is past high time that we put a stop to our recurrent feeble protests; what is needed instead is for the United Nations, NATO, the USA, the European Union and the African Union to get together around one table in order, at last, to implement a concerted Darfur policy that amounts to more than paper resolutions. What is called for, then, is a far more massive intervention there than has been seen hitherto.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, the African Union, above all others, that needs to do something, but we ourselves cannot stand idly by while, quite openly, genocide is being committed – and that is how the United States has openly described it, even though they have not drawn the necessary conclusions from that. What we are dealing with here is, quite simply, genocide. We are currently mounting sad commemorative events to remember the beginning of the genocide in Rwanda and Burundi – and we averted our eyes from those, too. Today, everyone says that we should have intervened then. We find ourselves in a similar situation today. We look away, we do not act, we do not use the means available to us – weak enough though they are – and instead content ourselves with verbal protests.</p>
<p class="contents">That makes Darfur not only a disgrace to the Sudanese regime, but also to the international and European institutions. That is why I am very glad that we in this House are again returning to this issue. To put it simply, it must be abundantly clear to us that normal or more or less normal relation with Sudan will be possible only if it for once does as it has promised and allows the international institutions to do their work there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We pushed hard at that time for a strengthening of the African Union monitoring mission, and in October 2004 it was indeed extended to include the protection of civilians who were under imminent threat.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragedy is that 18 months on, bombings, attacks and rapes are still taking place, despite the best efforts of the African Union both in the Abuja peace talks and on the ground in Darfur. There are simply not enough African Union troops to be able to control the high level of violence that is taking place, particularly near the Chad border and in the corridor between Tawila and Graida. That is why the UN must get involved in Darfur as a matter of urgency. The UN needs to back the African Union during the remainder of its mandate and be prepared to take over in October 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The Government of Sudan says that this is colonialism. It is not. It is a sad recognition that earlier initiatives to rein in the violence have largely failed. Even the humanitarian effort in Darfur is now under threat, because access to the humanitarian agencies is being obstructed. With over 3.5 million people dependent on food aid and medical aid, we cannot just stand by. The violence has to stop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is it that is happening there? Imagine a single friend being killed and the degree of tragedy and misery entailed in that death. Imagine, then, 180 000 friends having now died in the conflict. Imagine a single friend having his house burned down and being forced to leave his home. How does that feel? Imagine now those tears being multiplied by two million in Darfur today. Imagine the rape of a single relative, and imagine the same thing happening to tens of thousands of others. That is the extent of the humanitarian disaster to have hit Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">So what is the government doing? In resolution after resolution we have demanded that it disarm the Janjaweed guerrillas, yet nothing happens. In resolution after resolution we have demanded that it cooperate with the international community in order to help its own population, but very little indeed happens. Matters are not helped by the fact that the UN envoy, Jan Egeland, is refused permission to travel to Darfur whenever he considers it appropriate. The Commission is now already giving EUR 160 million and my own country SEK 330 million by way of aid. If this money is to be of any use, the regime needs to cooperate rather than seek to thwart our efforts. I think that we should impose an arms embargo, irrespective of what Russia and China say, and that all the countries that give their support to an arms embargo should help one another and help prevent the arms embargo from being breached.</p>

The refugee camps are packed as a result of the extensive and chaotic flight of people in need, attacked by rebels and by the Janjaweed, often with stories of pillage and rape to tell. This is a hopeless situation; the African Union is too weak and the Sudanese Government appears to be backing the Janjaweed and to be unwilling to give international rule of law, represented by the African Union and the United Nations, a chance. It seems to be backed in this by China and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, it became known that Mr Pronk, the UN’s special envoy in Darfur, is resigning from his post. If even Mr Pronk, who I know as an incorrigible go-getter and optimist, no longer sees a chance for the peace process, then it is really time for us to sound the alarm. In Darfur, an unprecedented brutal conflict is raging, one that gives the European Union the opportunity to show what its role outside of Europe can be. This week, the one-hundred-day Rwandan genocide is being depicted here in a photo exhibition. This event epitomises the failings of the entire international community.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now once again being put to the test. While China and Russia veto every action, the African Union is still trying to get the Sudanese Government on board, but it is too little, too late and too long-drawn-out. It is now up to the European troika, by means of money and backing of the African Union’s peace force, to establish an actual presence in order to provide logistical support, access to food aid and protection for the people. This chaotic massacre, characterised by an unprecedentedly cruel conflict of interests, must finally stop. Today’s appeal by our House in an excellent common resolution gives clear direction and impetus to Mr Solana, the Council, the Commission, and to our governments too. The credibility of Europe’s role in the world is at stake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Crop farmers tended to their fields, livestock farmers herded their animals. It is obvious that the Darfur region has a special attraction for some people. Secession attempts by potentially wealthy regions in Africa are nothing new. Let us not forget Biafra, Katanga and other problematic parts of a continent that is rich in natural resources. Where there is no such wealth, there are no such massive problems. After all, we will certainly find not only Russian and Chinese weapons in the region but also in the foreign military bases in Chad we will find weapons from other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The interesting aspect is that we are concerned that the UN General Secretary has not been allowed into Darfur. When there were similar events in Eritrea, Parliament approved humanitarian aid for the government. Why should our resolution, under paragraph 7, not call on the EU, the USA and others to help bring the situation in Eritrea to an end as well?

When it comes to human rights and the value of human dignity, we are dealing with variable geometry: when it is close to us, human life seems to matter, but when it is far away, we do not get our act together.</p>
<p class="contents">I have often driven in that part of the world. I know that barren land; I know how those people live – or rather, survive – in those conditions, even when there is no conflict. They are exposed to famine, shortages of food and a lack of drinking water. You cannot imagine how hard their lives are. Now, in their hundreds of thousands, they are being tortured, killed and the rest have fled their homes, and yet we will make another resolution here. That proves how powerless the international community is in dealing with human suffering. That is what it amounts to.</p>
<p class="contents">How many more conflicts do we need? Even in the Balkans we did not get our act together until far too late. And now Darfur is far too far away. China and Russia are very cynically blocking our efforts in the United Nations. Sudan’s rotten regime – I am sorry that I have to use non-diplomatic language – is blocking UN efforts, and we are powerless.</p>
<p class="contents">When we have international conflicts or problems, we need international governance. Otherwise, future generations will say to us: ‘You had the problem in your hand. You saw the dark clouds on the horizon and you did nothing’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Afterwards, here in Parliament and in the EU, we supported the role that the African Union has sought to play in resolving the conflict. This has been dragging on for three years now, has caused over 200 000 deaths and has made 2 million displaced persons or refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) has gone as far as it can and the talks in Abuja are not making progress. The conflict has worsened and is spreading to neighbouring Chad. Jan Egeland was prevented from visiting Darfur – yet another snub by the Sudanese regime against the UN, not to mention the terrible war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated by its forces, including the Janjaweed militia. The provocative threats by Khartoum to turn Darfur into a cemetery for UN troops should not intimidate.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must not abdicate its responsibility to protect. Consequently, it must send, without delay, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, a tough, well-equipped stabilising force, in so doing preparing the groundwork for a suitable-sized UN peace-keeping operation, both with a significant European contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">All Members of the United Nations Security Council must assume their responsibilities, including countries such as China that have protected the corrupt, criminal dictatorial regime in Khartoum. Furthermore, there will only be a lasting solution to the conflict if there is an end to impunity for the perpetrators of the crimes of Darfur. Accordingly, it is crucial to support the investigations of the International Criminal Court and to step up sanctions against Khartoum, strictly implementing the arms embargo and declaring an embargo on oil exports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The LRA lay siege to southern Sudanese villages: killing the adults, taking the children. Young girls are abducted to become sex and labour slaves and they are also sold, traded and given as gifts to the LRA arms dealers. Young boys are terrorised into virtual slavery as guards and soldiers. The LRA is only a small force, but it is increasingly expanding because abducted young boys are being used as combatants.</p>
<p class="contents">It is planting season now in southern Sudan. Civilians should be planting but they cannot, because of the LRA threat, which is again backed by their own government. If nothing is planted, famine will result. The situation is critical, they need our protection now.

<p class="contents">It is with sadness that we must admit that the Sudanese Government bears full responsibility for the fact that there is still fighting in this region. The government in Khartoum respects neither the international agreements nor the authority of the United Nations, regarding the most recent UN peace mission as a return to colonialism. It is worth noting, however, that the Sudanese Government only dares to behave in this way because it has not been isolated by the international community. As the honourable speakers before me stated, countries such as Russia guarantee arms supplies to this country.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us call a spade a spade. What we are dealing with in Darfur is genocide, which should be unequivocally condemned by the UN. It is highly inappropriate that some countries, such as Russia, are blocking the work of the UN Security Council in relation to this matter.

<p class="contents">The United Nations cannot do anything. We are realising that the United Nations, when faced with a regime that is prepared to do anything, whether involving nuclear arms in one country, or genocide or partial genocide of innocent people in another, cannot even visit the site where atrocities are taking place. On the other hand, we are witnessing independent action being taken by the military of a country, as happened in Iraq. And we are now calling for the Americans and the Europeans to save the innocent people in Darfur – and we are condemning the Americans at the same time for what has happened in Iraq, which was not the best of regimes.</p>

Periodic fighting continues to erupt between the belligerents and the civilian population. In particular women and children are the first to suffer from this continued violence and the persistent lack of security.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the worst possible scenario has been contained by the prompt intervention of the African Union, the precarious status quo cannot continue much longer. Almost three million people are depending on lifeline humanitarian aid, but access and security conditions for the humanitarian organisations are limited and hampered by continued violence, including direct attacks against relief operations.</p>
<p class="contents">The conflict is now spreading rapidly into neighbouring Chad and could jeopardise the fragile Sudanese conciliation process, initiated with the signature of the comprehensive peace agreement between Khartoum and the SPLM on 9 January 2005. There is international consensus that the only way ahead is a political settlement in Darfur. The Commission, Member States and the international community are very supportive of the African Union’s objective to reach a rapid peace agreement in the talks in Abuja. This could also facilitate a smooth transition of the current military responsibilities of the African Union in Darfur to the United Nations. An indispensable move, envisaged by the African Union itself, but still being opposed by Sudan.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that it is now high time for the parties, under the auspices of the African Union and with the support of the international community, to identify a roadmap to peace in Darfur and for the AU-UN transition with specific benchmarks and clearly assigned responsibilities. These would allow the international community to use all means of diplomatic pressure, including sanctions, to force the progress of the whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, to be sustainable a political conciliation in Darfur has also to be based on the provisions of justice and international support for the construction of the region. In this context, it is important that Khartoum and the rebels contribute and assist the work of the International Criminal Court on Darfur and that the donor community is ready to provide an immediate peace dividend once a positive outcome emerges from Abuja. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first issue is that of religious minorities, the second is that of prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the religious minorities, there have been extensive assaults recently on Christians and the concomitant lack of aid for the refugees who have fled – who happen to be Christians and Assyrians – into nearby Syria and Jordan.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say immediately that religious persecution is non-Islamic. The Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, declared that Christians would be the best friends of his followers, the Muslims. In the Holy Koran there are clear statements of respect for other faiths. Those who are carrying out these assaults are anarchists: they misuse the name of Islam for their anarchical aim to restore dictatorship with themselves in power.</p>
<p class="contents">What can we do? We can urge, as we do in our strong and powerful resolution, the current government at all levels of Iraq to protect religious minorities and – in this resolution – most particularly the Assyrian Christians. We in the European Union could provide support and call upon the international community to provide support for the refugees now numbering hundreds of thousands, I understand, in neighbouring countries such as Syria and Jordan. I urge you to support this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second issue – that of prisoners’ rights – let us remind everyone that the rule of law demands respect for the law on the rights of prisoners. That is something that all of the international community knows, as does the new Iraqi Government. Let us demand, therefore, that the rights of political and other prisoners are fully respected and let the European Union support the establishment of the rule of law from top to bottom, a justice system to support the Iraqi-elected Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In many of these cases, no specific charges have even been brought and these people have been denied the legal and judicial guarantees appropriate under the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">According to various sources, around 15 000 people are still in US detention centres in Iraq and an unknown number of people are not contactable and their whereabouts unknown, even to the Red Cross, which is a clear and flagrant violation of international law. They are what we sometimes call ‘phantom prisoners’. Furthermore, thousands of these people have been in this situation for more than a year.</p>
<p class="contents">Reports and evidence of torture, humiliation and abuse are not just increasing, but they are becoming increasingly frequent and alarming.</p>
<p class="contents">We must add to this the persecution of certain groups suffering as a result of their religious affiliations, as has been said, as I believe this Resolution stresses quite correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in addition to the Assyrians, who are especially mentioned in the Resolution, I believe that we should take account of other non-Muslim minority groups such as the Yazidi or the Turkmen, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to make two proposals which I believe to be fundamental, even though they are not taken up in the compromise Resolution itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to call upon the multinational forces and the Iraqi authorities to publish the names of the people being held, to guarantee them the necessary legal representation and to allow them family visits, as we also recently demanded in the case of Guantánamo.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that this House should call loud and clear for all of those people who have been accused of crimes under international law, such as torture and illegal detention, to be tried.</p>

We all know about what happened in Abu Ghraib and elsewhere. We very much support the resolution demanding the establishment of detention conditions that conform with international standards. We will be voting in favour of the amendment that asks for the names to be revealed of those people who are held in prison and that they be allowed family visits.

As someone who supports and is supported by the ‘Save the Assyrian Campaign’, whose Honorary President is Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, I am well aware of the forgotten people of Iraq. We hear talk about the Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds, but who has been talking about the 800 000 Assyrians that live in Iraq? They make up 8% of the population, which would be considerably larger if it had not been for the fact that, because of persecution, many have fled to Jordan and Syria, where they live in terrible conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge the Iraqi authorities to condemn all acts of violence against the Assyrians, the Chaldeans, the Syriacs and other Christian minorities in Iraq. We urge the Iraqi authorities and the multinational force to find the perpetrators of the crimes against them, to facilitate the return and resettlement of the Assyrians in secure environments where their customs and way of life are respected, and urge the Constitutional Committee of the Iraqi Council of Representatives to preserve the cultural and religious rights of all Iraqi communities in its proposals for constitutional amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Amnesty International does not mince its words when it says that the occupying powers – the USA and the United Kingdom – are, by keeping them prisoner, directly violating international law and that they have failed to learn any lessons from Abu Ghraib.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt about it; these prisons in Iraq are part of the policy of occupation. It is the occupation of Iraq that is the real political problem, and we should not beat about the bush in saying so.</p>
<p class="contents">A whole array of EU Member States are, alas, directly involved in this occupation – the United Kingdom and Poland among them. The EU itself has a hand in what is going on in Iraq in the shape – among other things – of the Eurojust-Lex programme, which, I believe, needs to be reviewed, since, if the present legal system is to be judged by the vast number of people in jail, the programme can hardly be effective in any real sense.</p>

<p class="contents">I have to tell him, though, that there are many points on which I agree with him. I was – and still am – a forthright critic of the intervention in Iraq, and I do believe that we have to very objectively assess what has resulted from it. The main justification for this intervention adduced by those who sought to justify it was the need to improve the state of human rights under Saddam Hussein’s brutal regime. There have indeed been some improvements, but we must, unfortunately, note that a number of things have also got worse.</p>
<p class="contents">First among these – and a major one – is the fact that the intervention caused the very complex ethnic balance in what was an artificial state created by the colonial powers after the First World War to be upset, and that nobody has any idea how to create a proper state in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The hardest hit by all this are the less numerous peoples and particularly the small minorities such as the Assyrians and other small ethnic groupings. I am very struck by the way in which so many in this House find it so difficult to stand up for the rights of Christians and to speak up in their defence. Here is a minority that is being persecuted for its Christian faith. Who shall plead their cause if not this Europe of ours, the inhabitants of which are 85% Christian?</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House must stand in solidarity with all those who are persecuted, with everyone whose human rights are violated, but there should be some sort of natural bond between the mainly Christian Europe and the ancient Christian minorities in this region, who have a very troubled history to look back on and who suffer in a particular way from the unstable conditions that prevail today. They are persecuted for being Christian, and their persecutors are extremist elements that – as Lady Nicholson put it so very well – misuse Islam for political reasons in order to subjugate and enslave the minorities they do not like. It is a politicised Islam that persecutes these minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have every right to be critical of the state of affairs in the prisons. What must be plain to us is that, while we have overthrown a dictatorship, and are engaged in building up democracy and the rule of law – an objective I endorse and that needs masses of support from the EU – we must then be willing to be judged by appropriate standards. The conditions under which prisoners are kept and the justice system are the first steps on the road to a functioning state under the rule of law, and this is particularly true of those prisons that are run by others rather than by the Iraqis themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">All things considered, one has to say that human rights are indivisible, and turning a blind eye is not an effective way for anybody to stand up for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the standpoint of a supporter of the intervention in Iraq by the United States and other democratic powers, I have to say that it is with great concern and sadness that I receive news of indications of human rights infringements perpetrated by a government which was supposed to be democratic and which should have brought democracy to Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, we find ourselves in an unfortunate situation if, after toppling Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship, we continue to witness human rights abuses in Iraq. That is precisely why, although I do not agree with many of the speakers before me and disagree with the use of the term ‘invasion’ to describe what happened in Iraq, in this case I have to admit that we should act together in this House and clearly demand that both the Western democracies and the new democratic government in Iraq should respect human rights. For it is only respect for human rights that will legitimise the actions that my country, irrespective of the government in power at the time, also supported.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to state very clearly that it is laudable that the House has found the strength to speak up in defence of a Christian minority. We must also acknowledge that Christians are persecuted not only in Iraq but throughout the world and we, as Europeans, should come to the defence of the community which the honourable speaker before me mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe today, and in the European Union in particular, the rights of minorities are guaranteed. The rights of religious minorities, Muslims and all other minorities one could possibly imagine and which exist on our continent are also guaranteed. It is the norm and forms part of the achievement that the European Union represents. It also represents the current state of European civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is precisely why we have the right to call for human rights for Christians. Events taking place in Iraq affect, and this is particularly important, an ancient people from that region. It is a people whose Christianity and ethnic roots, which are inextricably tied to Iraqi soil, are deeply embedded in history. It is not an immigrant people; they are not invaders. They are the autochthonous inhabitants of those lands.</p>
<p class="contents">As is often the case in this House, this resolution represents a compromise enjoying cross-party support. I hope that, in this resolution, we will be just as unequivocal in calling for the new Iraqi democratic government to respect human rights as in calling for the religious freedom of all inhabitants of Iraq to be guaranteed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the 29 January, for example, four churches and the Vatican embassy building in Baghdad, and two churches in Kirkuk, became the targets of attacks. Three people, including a 14-year-old boy, were killed and many more were wounded. This violence is directed against the Assyrian community in particular as well as against other Christian minorities. The Assyrian community is descended from an ancient people who inhabited these lands and it is threatened with forced displacement. As a result, world culture faces the disappearance of Assyrian culture in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important issue related to the rebuilding of Iraq remains guaranteeing the rule of law. The political situation bears many of the hallmarks of a civil war and it must not be allowed to deteriorate into a dirty war, where the forces of law and order constantly use torture, hostages are taken and lawlessness characterises the fight against rebel forces. Iraq needs more judges, a professional police force and a penal system which meets international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iraqi Human Rights Ministry and the EU Integrated Rule of Law Mission for Iraq Eurojust Lex should play a particularly important role in controlling this problem.

We are now learning from first-hand experience the answer to the question as to whether external intervention really can improve such a situation. It may well have done so for a handful of groups, such as the Kurds in the north, who had brought about a factual split from Iraq a long time ago, and also the political opponents who had fled the country.</p>
<p class="contents">To most people, Iraq is not a state in which they share but rather a battlefield between external interests and the very divergent group interests of, and the opinions held by, Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds and the Christian minorities who predated the Islamic era, and who, unlike the other groups, do not have their own territory as a possible federal state in a federation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we completely share Mr Posselt’s concerns about this group, nobody is able to offer a real solution under the current circumstances. The foreign occupiers have let the prison system deteriorate further, have allowed the re-introduction of the death penalty and cannot offer a future to a large majority of the people. Whilst the proposed resolution is right to identify a number of flaws, it is still far too optimistic and does not really contribute to a solution of the problems.

Whereas individual soldiers belonging to the international forces occupying Iraq are convicted of infringing the human rights of prisoners, the increased violence against Christians comes from Islamic extremists. They use blackmail and extortion, attack churches and carry out other acts of abuse which threaten the existence of the oldest Assyrian community in these lands, a community which speaks Chaldo-Aramaic.</p>
<p class="contents">Massacres of the Assyrian people are nothing new, as 33 of them have been recorded since the third century, but they have become increasingly frequent in recent times. However, aggression and violence are not a way of solving the complex problems in this region. Violence breeds violence, just as aggression breeds aggression. The situation thus requires national dialogue, acceptance of religious differences and, as the resolution states, it requires the perpetrators of the violence to be identified and brought to justice. It needs to be made easier for refugees to return home, and real aid also needs to be delivered to Iraqis to rebuild their country.</p>

In case some of you are not aware to which countries this refers, the next in line are the United Kingdom and Poland, followed by a number of other countries. Among other things, representatives from these countries have been training Iraqi policemen, and I am sure that they will have made use of this opportunity to urge the policemen to uphold international standards on treating prisoners. I am also sure that the prisoners will have been informed under paragraph 9(b) of this resolution how to raise an objection in court effectively. I believe that the other procedures to which the motion for a resolution correctly refers will also have been discussed with them. Unfortunately, I have not yet seen policemen in Iraq protesting against the situation of prisoners or the mistreatment of minorities. We must therefore take a firm line on these issues and adopt this motion for a resolution, in its amended form.

This is one of the key objectives for the European Union as laid down in the medium-term strategy of June 2004. This objective is just as valid today as it was then.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission emphasises the importance of effective protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and encourages the Iraqi Government to take appropriate action. This should also include the abolition of the death penalty which, to the strong disappointment of the European Union, was re-introduced by the Iraqi authorities in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">We join the international community in expressing our deepest concern at the cases of alleged torture and ill-treatment of Iraqi prisoners. We condemn any incidents of abuse of prisoners in Iraq, whether by Iraqi forces or by multinational forces, as contrary to international humanitarian law, and call for those responsible to be brought to justice. We have noted that the UK, the US and Iraqi authorities have launched investigations into reports of such abuse and some of those responsible for torture and ill-treatment have already been sentenced. We underline the obligations set out in the Geneva Conventions, that recourse to torture or inhuman treatment is a grave breach of those Conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is vital for Iraq and the international community to work together to reassert full respect for international law, including human rights and humanitarian standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is committed to actively supporting the stabilisation of Iraq. The Commission and the European Union Member States are working together to strengthen the rule of law through an ESDP – European Security and Defence Policy – operation called EUJUST LEX. It is an Integrated Rule of Law Mission providing training in EU Member States in the fields of management and criminal investigation for 770 senior officials and executive staff of the Iraqi judiciary, police and prisons. An essential element of that operation is training on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we support the promotion of human rights, an important component of which deals with torture prevention and victim rehabilitation, and we support electoral processes and the constitutional process, working with the United Nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in the European Union are rightly proud of our deep and profound relationship with Egypt. Indeed, Egypt co-chairs the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and, with Egypt, we have defined a European Neighbourhood Policy, which strengthens political dialogue and integrates us with Egypt – <span class="italic">primus inter pares </span>as Egypt is within the Arab League – to promote peace and stability. Egypt is instrumental in helping us in that task.</p>
<p class="contents">We bitterly regret, therefore, that after the recent presidential election and the parliamentary elections in Egypt in November and December last year, Dr Nour was arrested. It is hard to believe that the charges for which he has been given five years’ imprisonment could be true. Ayman Nour has hundreds, nay, thousands of supporters. It is very difficult to see why he would have bothered or needed to falsify some of the 50 signatures needed to have his candidature be legally effective. We are gravely disturbed at the deterioration of his health; deeply troubled that his appeal will be considered by a judge who <span class="italic">could</span> be considered to have a major conflict of interest; and indeed we wish to remind the Government of Egypt, and the courts of Egypt, that human rights are a fundamental basis of the European Union-Egypt Partnership and Association Agreement, which we value so very highly.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we want to stress that our view is well in line with the laws of Egypt itself and so we request the Egyptian Government to look at this again and to regulate the framework, so that opposition candidates can stand and perhaps even Dr Nour’s judge might be reconsidered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Dr Ayman Nour was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for the alleged crime of falsifying his political party’s registration documents. He came second in the last presidential elections and he remains in prison today where his health continues to deteriorate. It is positive, after a fashion, that his case will be reviewed by the Court of Cassation on 18 May 2006, but we must keep a watchful eye on this trial. In recital I of the resolution we commit ourselves to an ad hoc delegation at least trying to see him in the event that the trial continues his incarceration. It is clear, however – in the eyes of my group at least – that he should be released forthwith, because the crimes of which he is accused and indeed convicted do not appear to stack up in reality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Egyptian Government should be in no doubt that we will watch this case with interest. Dr Ayman Nour is an example of a wider difficulty in Egypt with human rights in general, and it is in this connection that this resolution presents some concrete steps forward. In paragraphs 7 and 8 of the resolution, which I would ask the Commissioner to comment on this afternoon, we call on the Commission to create a specific subcommittee on human rights in the framework of the EU-Egypt Association Agreement. There is a human rights deficit in Egypt that must be addressed. The creation of a specific committee to monitor and enforce the action plan will be a concrete way to give teeth to the warm words that this House too often produces.</p>
<p class="contents">Egypt is a valued partner of the EU and this House in the Middle East peace process, an ally in so much and a partner in development, but we must acknowledge that Egypt does not meet our standards. We must pointedly, if necessary, use the Association Agreement to assist in the development and building-up of Egyptian civil society for the betterment of the Egyptian people and a more constructive degree of EU-Egyptian partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Egypt is fundamental in the Middle East, it is crucial in the Mediterranean and it is, and must continue to be, a privileged partner of the European Union. For all of these reasons, however, there is no question that Egypt must be a democracy. Unfortunately, cases such as that of Mr Nour show us that that is not yet the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I met Mr Nour at the first session of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, following its creation in March 2005, in Cairo. Thanks to pressure from us, he was released. I met with him, together with Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs Flautre. He is a democrat and, as far as I am concerned, he must be released, and there is nothing more to say.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what we want from the Court of Cassation which will meet in May, as a clear sign that Egypt is going to allow freedom of expression, of association and of thought and that everybody will be able to express their views freely during future elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the post-Nasser era, this party no longer represents a common ideology, but merely the common interest which being in power involves. It is possible these days for individual outsiders to take part in the elections outside of this monopoly of state power, provided that they do not constitute a threat to those established powers that be. That is why opposing candidates constantly run the risk of being hounded, intimidated or locked up. Above all, they are not given the chance to surround themselves with a soundly structured and permanent movement.</p>
<p class="contents">The state of emergency proclaimed in 1981 is still an important instrument for sustaining this situation. This time round, it was Ayman Nour, ex-parliamentarian and former presidential candidate, who was its victim. Due to Egypt’s contribution to the stability in the Middle East, particularly the peaceful co-existence with neighbour Israel since 1978, there is noticeably little criticism from Europe with regard to this situation. Quite the reverse: the European Union seeks good relations with all states along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. My group wholeheartedly supports the demand for Egypt to become more democratic, to put an end to the state of emergency and no longer to obstruct opponents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The text is as follows: 'calls for the liberation of Dr Ayman Nour'. </p>
<p class="contents"> Mr President, this morning we had the Belarusian opposition leader, Mr Milinkevich, here. He is free, but Ayman Nour is not free, although the two men are in a similar position in their respective countries. Mr Milinkevich said that when he went to an election debate, he had to take his own drinking water with him. Well, every human being has an in-built aspiration to drink the clean water of democracy; what Mr Milinkevich is doing in Belarus, Ayman Nour is trying to do in Egypt. He tries to give Egyptian people hope. He wants to give hope to those people who believe in a free tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Egypt plays a crucial part, in many ways, in the Middle East. If it does not show the way to democratisation for the rest of that region, its future will be condemned in advance. Egypt plays an important part in terms of its relationship with the United States and its constructive approach to Israel, but if its relationship with the EU is to deepen, Egypt must take steps towards democracy. Egyptian people deserve democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is Ayman Nour in prison? He is there because of flimsy charges; he is detained for nothing; he is detained because he dared to stand against President Mubarak. If we want democracy to blossom in Egypt, we must ensure that Dr Ayman Nour is freed. If he is freed, that will also free the democratic forces in that part of the world, which is also an issue concerning future stability in that part of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has been following closely the trial of Mr Nour, the leader of Egypt’s opposition Al-Ghad Party, since his first arrest in February 2005. As you will be aware, in reacting to the five-year sentence given to Mr Nour last December, the European Union stressed that the imprisonment sent a negative signal about democratic reform in Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, the case should be seen in the context of the process of democratisation in Egypt, as well as being related to the independence of the judiciary. The Commission expects the Court of Cassation to consider the case in accordance with the Egyptian judicial process and international legal standards. The Commission is ready to engage in a political and human rights dialogue with Egypt, in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The negotiations for the conclusion of an action plan are well advanced. We are confident about making further progress in the coming weeks and we hope to finalise negotiations in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to monitor the implementation of the action plan – and this should answer Mr Smith’s question – a structure of subcommittees will be created in the framework of the Association Agreement. The subcommittees will deal with political and human rights reforms in Egypt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)Secure high-speed broadband networks are vitally important to the Commission’s ‘i2010’ strategy for boosting growth and jobs in the digital economy. Provision of broadband services acts as a catalyst for the realisation of the following goals of the i2010 strategy: (i) completion of a single European information area promoting an open and competitive internal market for the information society and media, and (ii) achieving an inclusive European information society that promotes growth and jobs in a manner that is consistent with sustainable development and prioritises better public services and quality of life. Bridging the digital divide in the area of broadband, in other words ensuring widespread availability and use of broadband services, calls for diverse, mutually agreed and coherent measures at different levels of administration.</p>
<p>All of the national reform programmes (NRPs) submitted by the Member States to the Commission following the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy last year deal with the subject of broadband provision and expansion, with competition viewed as the most important driving force for the development of broadband technologies. In less-developed areas of the Union, on the other hand, public funding is helping to accelerate the introduction of broadband. Many of the NRPs put forward extensive broadband programmes (AT, IE, EE, FI, FR, HU, IT, LU, LT, PT, SI, ES), and the topic of broadband connections for SMEs is dealt with in the broadband strategies of the Member States, of the Commission and of the Council.</p>
<p>As the Council emphasised in its conclusions of 1 December 2005, the i2010 strategy is a shared responsibility between Member States, the European institutions and stakeholders. That being the case, the Council invited the Commission, among other things, to ‘review the impact of digital convergence on the creation, circulation and distribution of European content, and if appropriate, bring forward proposals to promote a rich and diverse digital content market, increased use of broadband and the development of Next Generation Networks (NGNs)’, and to ‘prepare a European initiative on e-Inclusion in 2008 addressing issues relating to [inter alia] regional divides’. Furthermore, the Council called on the Member States to ‘promote the roll-out of advanced seamless networks through the rapid implementation of national strategies, aimed at increasing broadband coverage and multiplatform access, and stimulating take-up, making use, where appropriate, of EU structural funds, in line with the Commission Guidelines’, and to ‘encourage effective use of ICTs by public services and businesses (especially SMEs), by promoting the necessary skills needed for their deployment, promoting interoperability and open standards, and effective on-line public services through the introduction of organisational change’. The proposed Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) also includes a programme for ICTs, including measures to improve interconnectivity, and is currently under examination by the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p>In its communication of 20 March 2006 entitled ‘Bridging the Broadband Gap’, the Commission states: ‘The benefits of broadband are such that the inability to have access to it is an issue which should be addressed urgently.’ The communication contains a range of instruments aimed at improving the availability of broadband access. One of the Commission’s conclusions is that local/regional authorities are in the best position to plan broadband projects that take account of local needs and technical requirements. Measures might include strengthening national broadband strategies (as part of the Commission’s strategy for growth and employment as well as of the overall i2010 strategy), improved sharing of good practice, not least through the collection and shared use of information about projects and invitations to tender relating to extension of broadband services, as well as drawing up innovative, wide-ranging, pan-European pilot projects. A number of instruments are already available at EU level, including the implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communication, aimed at promoting competition and bringing state intervention into line with competition rules. The Commission’s communication is based on the Digital Divide Forum Report of 15 July 2005 and the ensuing public consultation and includes proposals for further policy guidelines for the Member States and the Commission. The Council will in due course look at all the proposals and examine whether further measures should be considered.</p>
<p>Two important conferences on this subject will be held during the Austrian Presidency. The annual Conference on the European Charter for Small Enterprises will take place in Vienna on 13 and 14 June 2006, where the state of implementation of the Charter will be discussed, and in April a seminar on ‘ICT-Tools for Providing Information, Advice and Services for rural SMEs’ will be held in Oulu (Finland).</p>
<p>In the longer term, and with a view to the imminent review of the electronic communications regulatory framework (Commission proposals are expected by the end of 2006), the Council will take full account of the convergence aspect of broadband technologies and ensure that the plans for an open, competitive and innovative market for electronic communication services are treated appropriately.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0243"></a>

<p>(DE)The honourable Member will undoubtedly agree that Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) make a substantial contribution to growth and employment in Europe and are thus an important resource for the attainment of the Lisbon Objectives. Moreover, investment in research and innovation is vital in order to enable the ICT sector to continue to make its contribution to the economy, in both the short and the long term.</p>
<p>In 2005 the Commission presented its strategy 'i2010' for a European information society, the second pillar of which is innovation and investment in research. In reply to the Commission, the Council stressed in its conclusions of December 2005 that the i2010 strategy was a matter for which the Member States, the European institutions and interested parties bore joint responsibility. The Council asked the Commission and Member States to promote investment in research and development in the field of ICT and to provide greater support for research and innovation by promoting private investment and cooperation between research and innovation programmes.</p>
<p>After the publication of the Aho report, the European Council called on the Member States at its spring summit to allocate more public funding to innovative research and to promote R&amp;D investment by the private sector in order to make more and better resources available for research and innovation. It also called for a broad-based innovation strategy for Europe, to translate investment in knowledge into products and services. In this context it called on the Commission and Member States to implement the new i2010 strategy energetically.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal for a decision establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013) is currently being considered by the European Parliament and the Council. For the information society, Chapter II of this proposal ('The ICT Policy Support Programme') seeks to promote innovation by making greater use of ICT and by means of investment in this field. The provisions of the programme serve as an instrument to support the measures indicated in the i2010 strategy. As regards Community support for research and technological development, the honourable Member will be aware that the Commission proposal for the Seventh Framework Programme is currently being considered by the European Parliament and the Council under codecision. It is proposed that research and technological development in the ICT sector should be one of the main thematic priorities of this programme.</p>
<p>Finally it may be noted that on 22/23 March 2006 in Vienna the Austrian Presidency also organised a conference on 'Investing in ICT Research and Innovation'. The conference was intended as a follow-up measure to the Commission's i2010 initiative and served the purpose of identifying practical measures to increase Europe's innovativeness in the ICT sector. At present a final report on the results of the conference and the recommendations of the eminent delegates is being drafted.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0113"></a>

<p>(DE)As the honourable Member rightly observes, enterprises have, in the past, pooled their resources in consortia with the purpose of operating the Galileo satellite navigation systems and setting up Airbus Industrie. In the same way, Siemens and ThyssenKrupp have united their work on Transrapid in a common enterprise bearing the name of Transrapid International.</p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2000, Transrapid International carried out feasibility studies into the possibility of using Transrapid’s system of electromagnetic levitation in rapid transit systems in Central and Eastern Europe and further eastwards. These studies were financially supported by the European Community, which also, in 2003, provided funds from the TEN-T budget for a study into a possible link between the main railway station in Munich and the city’s airport.</p>

<p>(DE)The honourable Members have posed a number of questions on the relationship between the environment and transport.</p>
<p>Economic growth and the resulting increase in transport demand have an impact in a number of areas, with implications in terms of traffic congestion, traffic safety, health problems and environmental damage. In response to the 2001 White Paper 'European transport policy for 2010: time to decide', the Council endorsed a shift from road transport to more environmentally-friendly modes of transport such as clean buses, ships and rail transport. Relevant concrete measures include guidelines giving priority to trans-European rail and inland waterway networks and legislation on the opening up of the market for rail freight services in Europe.</p>
<p>With a view to deciding on the most appropriate measures to be taken in future, the Council is awaiting the communication on the mid-term review of the White Paper. As this is expected to be submitted by the Commission shortly, the Austrian Presidency already has plans to present the communication at the Council meeting on 8/9 June 2006 and to hold an exchange of views on it.</p>
<p>The Council supports the use of the trans-European transport networks, the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund as European instruments for investing in transport. In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, cities with excessive traffic congestion may apply to the Commission for funding. The total budget available for these instruments in the period 2007-2013 will, of course, depend on the outcome of discussions on the financial perspective.</p>
<p>As regards the levying of charges for the use of roads, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a directive on 27 March 2006 amending the directive in force on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (Eurovignette). A particularly notable feature of this amending directive is a new provision allowing a mark-up to be added to the tolls for specific sections of the trans-European road transport network in mountainous regions which suffer from acute traffic congestion or the use of which by vehicles causes significant damage to the environment. The revenues raised by the mark-up are to be invested in priority TEN projects (mainly rail projects) which will contribute to reducing the problem. In addition to this provision on cross-financing of alternative infrastructure, the directive also provides for further possibilities for applying different charges within the trans-European network in order to achieve environmental objectives, and it specifies that the Member States are free to levy charges in order to combat traffic congestion and/or environmental impact (for example, the London congestion charge).</p>
<p>Pursuant to this directive the Commission is also required to submit within two years a model for the assessment of external costs. The model is to be accompanied, if appropriate, by legislative proposals, which - if submitted - will be examined by the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE)In April 2005, the Council adopted a partial general approach to the proposal for a Parliament and Council regulation on the second ‘Marco Polo’ programme for the granting of Community financial aid to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system (‘Marco Polo II’).</p>
<p>The ‘Marco Polo II’ grant programme, which is intended to facilitate a changeover to alternative modes of transport, is of particular significance and high priority in view of the disproportionate increase in the transport of goods by road. When it is borne in mind that Marco Polo II will be able, between 2007 and 2013, to bring about the transfer of some 140 billion tonnes per kilometre from roads to means of transport with less of an environmental impact, with a corresponding reduction of 8 400 million kg of CO2 emissions and an environmental and social benefit amounting to EUR 5 billion, the importance of this programme is plain to see.</p>
<p>On 15 December 2005, the European Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted its own position on the proposal, and the Presidency has already embarked on the examination of the amendments that Parliament proposed.</p>
<p>It is indeed the case that - as the honourable Member points out – the standpoints of Parliament and of the Council have moved much closer together. The Presidency’s concern is that agreement should be reached as early as first reading, although the amendments proposed by Parliament have yet to be discussed in greater detail by the Council. It should be noted that the financial aspects of the proposal referred to above cannot be settled until agreement is reached on the Financial Perspective for 2007 to 2013, and that there is a need for a successor programme to run on seamlessly from the first ‘Marco Polo’ programme. The presidency looks forward to honourable Members’ continuing constructive support in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0279"></a>

<p>The Council attaches considerable importance to closer cooperation between the European Union and India in many fields, including university education. The joint action plan between the EU and India (document 11984/05) states that the EU and India believe that cooperation between institutions of higher education and exchanges of students play an important part in raising the level of knowledge on both sides. It is therefore proposed that, on the basis of existing programmes, new initiatives be planned between India and the EU Member States to give students on both sides more opportunities to study at universities in the other region.</p>
<p>As regards the proposed European institute of technology in particular, however, it should be noted that the Heads of State or Government of the EU have yet to adopt a formal position on the Commission's plans and that a detailed proposal by the Commission on the establishment of such an institute is expected only later in the year. At present, therefore, it is probably too soon to assess the possible impact of such an institute and its possible role in promoting this cooperation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0215"></a>

<p>(DE)I would like to thank the honourable lady Member for this pertinent question on an issue that was of particular concern to the Austrian Presidency when it was preparing the European Council’s Spring Summit.</p>
<p>Negative population growth has long been a cause of concern for the European Union, and adaptation to it has become a political priority for an increasing number of Member States. The EU has, therefore, over recent years, developed political strategies intended to help anticipate the changes that result from increased life expectancy brought about by considerable advances in health care and by improvements in the quality of life in Europe, a larger number of workers over the age of 60, and consistently low birth rates.<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Following the Commission’s presentation, in March 2005, of its Green Paper entitled ‘Confronting demographic change – a new solidarity between the generations’, the Council, in December of that year, held a general discussion on the subject of ‘Demography and human capital’. The various contributions to this debate were mainly concerned with the need to improve the skills and qualifications of workers by means of lifelong learning, with the ‘work must be worth it’ concept, with the means of ensuring appropriate management of migratory flows and the need for work and family life to be reconciled.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware, this topic is also of particular concern to the European Parliament, and I would refer in this context to your resolution on the contribution to the 2006 Spring Summit of the European Council on the Lisbon Strategy, particularly to the part of it relating to the ageing population and the demographic challenges. Your House also, at the end of March, debated the issue of the demographic challenges and of solidarity between the generations.</p>
<p>The Council takes the view that competitiveness and economic development can be promoted in Europe irrespective of these negative trends and that the EU and its Member States are capable of adapting themselves to such changes. It has therefore given its support to policy measures and strategies intended to contribute towards the resolution of this problem, especially by means of the revised Lisbon Strategy, through which the EU is to be endowed with the necessary framework in order to create jobs for people, especially for more women, young people and older persons.</p>
<p>As I have already mentioned, this issue was raised at the meeting of the European Council on 23/24 March. In order to address the present adverse demographic trends in Europe, the European Council, in line with the 2005/06 Joint Employment Report that it adopted on 10 March, called on the Member States to adopt a lifecycle-centred approach to work that would ease the transition from one form of employment to another, to increase the number of hours worked, to develop a pro-active and preventive policy that would encourage people to seek paid work, focusing this on the less-skilled and less well paid; to reduce youth unemployment and to implement strategies for active ageing. All these measures should also take account of the situation of immigrants and minorities. The European Council also approved the European Equality Pact and agreed that the availability of high-quality childcare in line with the Member States’ targets should be improved.</p>
<p>The European Council called on the Member States to give attention to the topic of ‘Flexicurity – Flexibility through security’ and to act in accordance with an integrated flexicurity concept when reforming the labour market and social policy. The intention here is to achieve a balanced relationship between flexibility and social security in Europe. These two principles should not be seen as alternatives but rather as mutually complementary elements. The flexibility demanded by international competitiveness can be achieved in the labour market only on the basis of functioning social security and insurance systems.<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>At the 10 March meeting, the Commission presented to the Council the 2006-2010 timetable for the equalisation of women’s and men’s opportunities. This timetable sets out six priorities, namely: Equal economic independence for women and men, the promotion of the reconciliation of working life and private/family life; promoting the equal participation of women and men in decision-making processes; the eradication of sexual violence and of sex-related people-trafficking; the removal of gender stereotypes in society and the promotion of equal opportunities outside the EU. These targets and the associated core activities are intended to promote the harmony between work and family life.</p>
<p>I am sure that the honourable lady Member will agree that these are highly complex issues and that a concerted effort on the part of all concerned is therefore required if it is to be possible to overcome the problems that Europe currently faces.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In contrast to France and Germany, there is - in Europe - Finland, while the countries of Asia, led by South Korea, China and India, have been investing increasingly in recent years in their education systems, which is now bearing fruit. In particular, the OECD study shows that Europe is lagging behind Asia in terms of its education systems and, therefore, if it wishes to boost its competitiveness in this sector, it must invest more funding in education reform.</p>

<p>(DE)The Council assures Mr Mavrommatis that it shares the concerns expressed in his question and that – insofar as it is competent to do so - it is endeavouring to deal with these concerns at the highest level. It is now generally recognised that, with its adoption of the Lisbon Strategy in 2000 and of the ‘Education and Training 2010’ work programme in 2002, the European Council has begun a process through which education has come more and more to the fore in the economic and socio-political programme of the EU. In 2005, in the framework of the renewed Lisbon Strategy, the Council adopted integrated guidelines in which the Member States are asked to increase and optimise their investment in human capital and to gear their education and further education systems to new requirements in terms of qualifications. Clear evidence of this development was finally provided by the fact that, in February 2006, the EU education ministers accepted the joint interim report on progress under the work programme, which is to be fully implemented in accordance with the wishes of the European Council, and by the fact that the theme of education was given a prominent position in the conclusions of the Spring 2006 European Council.</p>
<p>In the light of the growing socio-economic and demographic challenges in a globalised world, the Council would therefore agree with Mr Mavrommatis that first-class education and training systems, which are both efficient and fair, are a factor crucial to increasing the EU’s competitiveness and economic performance and that, at the same time, they promote social cohesion. In terms of the reforms called for under the ‘Education and Training 2010’ work programme, considerable progress is already to be seen, since the Member States are making more efforts to put into effect coherent and comprehensive lifelong learning strategies that are to provide everyone with the skills and qualifications they need. However, further efforts will undoubtedly have to be made, in the context of which the issue of funding will certainly be of crucial importance.</p>
<p>In this connection, it should therefore be pointed out that, in its latest conclusions, the European Council calls on the Member States to facilitate, in line with national practices, universities' access to complementary private sources of funding and to remove barriers to public-private partnerships with businesses. In addition, the Member States are called on to do what they can to bring about closer connections between universities, research and industry and so increase investment and the potential for innovation and competition. In that way, the EU will be able to hold its own among the best in the world. The Commission’s impending report to the European Council on university education should be extremely relevant in this connection, since the report will deal above all with the education-research-innovation triangle, as well as with the connections between universities and industry.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0233"></a>

As the honourable Member will know, the European Parliament and the Council as the two legislative institutions are currently considering the Commission proposals for the seventh framework programme (2007-2013).</p>
<p>Pending the European Parliament's opinion and the interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspective, the Council reached a 'partial general approach' on the framework programme at its meeting of 28 November 2005; the corresponding text is publicly accessible. As the draft decision states, the programme will 'pursue the general objectives described in Article 163 of the Treaty (strengthening industrial competitiveness and meeting the research needs of other areas of Community policy) in contributing towards the creation of a knowledge-based society, building on a European Research Area'. Consequently the two institutions are now discussing the contribution that this programme might make to the knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p>On the question of how the benefits of new technologies can be made available in all parts of Europe, the honourable Member is referred in particular to the sections 'Regions of knowledge' and 'Research potential' in the 'Capacities' part of the programme, which contain the following objectives:</p>
<p>'Strengthening the research potential of European regions, in particular by encouraging and supporting the development, across Europe, of regional “research-driven clusters” associating universities, research centres, enterprises and regional authorities';</p>
<p>'Stimulating the realisation of the full research potential of the enlarged Union by unlocking and developing the research potential in the EU’s convergence regions and outermost regions, and helping to strengthen the capacities of their researchers to successfully participate in research activities at EU level'.</p>
<p>It might also be recalled that, alongside this framework programme, the planned framework programme for competitiveness and innovation (2007-2013) is also intended to support the introduction of new technologies across the Community.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0260"></a>

<p>(DE)The Austrian Presidency and the future Finnish Presidency attach the utmost importance to the issue of border controls. Particular attention is currently and will in future be focused on development of integrated border protection at external borders and increased cooperation with the countries of origin and transit of illegal immigrants, as set out in The Hague Programme and in the Global approach to migration: Priority actions focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean. The ongoing national and international cooperation between the authorities responsible and neighbouring States at the external borders on combating crime and the exchange of information will also continue to play an important role in the future.</p>
<p>The newly created European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) plays a key role in this context. This Agency is responsible for the coordination of operational cooperation between Member States in the field of management of external borders, among other things by carrying out joint operations at land, sea and air borders. A number of joint operations have already taken place and others are planned in the near future. The Agency also carries out risk analyses, gives assistance to Member States in the training of national border guards and in circumstances requiring increased technical and operational assistance. The Agency will also provide Member States with the necessary support in organising joint return operations.</p>
<p>It should, however, be pointed out that responsibility for the control and monitoring of external borders is a matter for the Member States. In order to support Member States in this task, the Council is currently discussing a range of further measures referred to in The Hague Programme and the Global approach to migration. These comprise, in particular, the proposed External Borders Fund and the inclusion of biometric identifiers in travel documents.</p>
<p>In addition, the customs authorities of the Member States are cooperating with a view to tackling drug smuggling, counterfeit goods and so on even more vigorously and effectively. Although operational activities still remain within the jurisdiction of the national authorities, the Customs Cooperation Working Group is continuing the long tradition of joint customs actions. OLAF and Europol provide the necessary support for such measures and, wherever possible, there is a cooperation with other authorities such as the police and border protection forces.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0264"></a>

<p>(DE)In its relations with third countries, the Council has always condemned acts of violence of any kind perpetrated by political forces.</p>
<p>With specific regard to the campaign in connection with the parliamentary elections in Ukraine on 26 March 2006, the Council has proceeded entirely on the basis of the information provided to it by the OSCE Election Observations Mission in Kiev and by its 52 long-term observers deployed throughout the country, as well as on the basis of the reporting by the embassies of the EU Member States, by the European Commission’s delegation in Ukraine and by other international organisations in the run-up to the elections and on the actual day of these.</p>
<p>The Council had no knowledge of the specific case to which Mr Pafilis referred. On the basis of the information supplied by the aforesaid organisations, as well as on the basis of reporting by the national and international press, the Presidency has issued the following declaration: ‘The European Union takes positive note of the preliminary conclusions of the OSCE/ODIHR-led International Elections Observation Mission to the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada elections of 26 March 2006. The Mission concluded that the elections were free and fair, consolidating the democratic breakthrough in Ukraine. The European Union welcomes these elections which stand as testimony to Ukraine's commitment to a truly democratic process. They provided the population with the opportunity to make an informed choice between distinct alternatives and to freely and fairly express their will at the ballot box. The Ukrainian people have assumed ownership of their democracy. This is a milestone in the democratic election process which began with the political events around the 2004 Ukrainian Presidential elections. The Rada elections in Ukraine set a new and very welcome standard for elections in the region as a whole.’</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0265"></a>

<p>(DE)The subject of Belarus is discussed regularly in the political dialogue between the European Union and the Russian Federation. As short a time ago as in the run-up to the most recent presidential elections, the Council on many occasions expressed its concern to Russia about the infringement of fundamental human rights and democratic standards in Belarus. At OSCE level too, the EU raises the subject of the situation in Belarus and emphatically calls on that country to comply with its obligations in the context of the OSCE. The problems in Belarus are also discussed with representatives of the Russian Federation at meetings involving the EU Troika.</p>
<p>Where economic relations between Russia and Belarus are concerned, we should also like to draw your attention to the announcements made a short time ago by Gazprom, according to which the price of the gas to be supplied to Belarus in 2007 is to be increased.

<p>(DE)The present answer, which was prepared by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor the Members of the Council, was not given orally at Council Question Time at the European Parliament’s plenary in Strasbourg in April 2006.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency of the EU pays particular attention to the development and transposition of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Cooperating closely with the Commission and the Council Secretariat, the Presidency is carefully monitoring the implementation of the ENP action plans already agreed last year with Ukraine, Moldova, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority and Tunisia.</p>
<p>The Presidency also intends as soon as possible to conclude the negotiations regarding action plans involving Egypt, Lebanon, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.</p>
<p>What is very important for the further development of the European Neighbourhood Policy is the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI). Early acceptance of the corresponding regulation and implementing provisions is accorded high priority by the Presidency. This is to be seen as particularly urgent in view of the automatic expiry of the TACIS Regulation on 1 January 2007.</p>
<p>The European Parliament plays a crucial part in this process, and the Presidency hopes for constructive cooperation with a view to reaching agreement on a compromise document at first reading so that the instrument might enter into force on 1 January 2007. In this way, a smooth transition from the current neighbourhood programmes (2005-2006) to the new cross-border cooperation programmes (2007-2013) would be possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0287"></a>

<p>As Mr Van Hecke will remember, the Council Presidency has already explained in its answer that, in accordance with Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, the political dialogue with Ethiopia has regularly given EU representatives opportunities to express their deep concern regarding the human rights situation in that country, on several occasions in face-to-face conversations with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. The EU representatives have talked about the situation of the detainees. They have also demanded that everyone arrested during or following the June and November demonstrations be released and that their relatives and lawyers, together with representatives of humanitarian organisations, be guaranteed access to them. EU representatives have visited detainees in several camps and prisons.</p>
<p>I should like to point out to Mr Van Hecke that efforts have been made to ensure independent international monitoring of the court proceedings against leading opposition figures and others. EU representatives have also expressly called on the government to prevent any harassment of the opposition and of civil society organisations by security forces. At a political level, the EU has also pressed for a dialogue between government and opposition to be unconditionally entered into and called on the political leadership to enable the private media to operate freely.</p>

<p>(FR)The issue of workers’ mobility in the EU’s outermost regions forms part of a wider process of reflection on the European Year of Workers' Mobility. Against this backdrop, a debate has got under way involving the various stakeholders – for example, public authorities, socio-economic actors – with the aim of looking into the conditions under which workers are posted in the EU. The objective is to ensure the primacy of the right to mobility and to enhance the available instruments, (the European network for information on employment and worker mobility (EURES) and the Structural Funds), and in turn to create an environment that is conducive to mobility.</p>
<p>The Structural Funds cover a significant proportion of the island population, with more than 95% eligible for Objectives 1 and 2.</p>
<p>In the current programming period 2000-2006, the Structural Funds provide a large amount of financial support for island, rural and geographically remote regions where development is lagging behind, less favoured regions or regions in decline, under Objectives 1 and 2 of the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>The objective of regional policy is to promote sustainable development in these territories, ensuring that those living and working there continue to go about their business under the best possible conditions. The European Social Fund (ESF) can also cofinance the costs of posting the trainee or the trainer where the type of training in question is carried out in an outlying region.</p>
<p>In the forthcoming programming period 2007-2013, which places the accent on developing human potential in the field of research and innovation, it will be possible to fund the posting of trainers or trainees, as well as other activities such as connecting people and businesses in these territories with transport networks and water, electricity and telecommunications services.</p>
<p>Development policy covers all rural areas in the Community, including island and geographically isolated areas, both for the current programming period 2000-2006 and for the next programming period 2007-2013. Rural areas account for some 90% of EU territory. The main priority of a number of measures under Axis 3 – diversification and quality of life in rural areas – will be job creation and the conditions for growth, thereby contributing to the objectives of more and better jobs and better quality of life in these areas.</p>
<p>Lastly, the future Axis 4 of the European Fisheries Fund also provides for measures aimed at creating jobs and at improving living conditions in EU fishing regions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0224"></a>

<p>(EN)In a Cohesion Policy and the Rural Development perspective, the Commission encourages the respect and implementation of the partnership principle, which consitutes a fundamental element for the implementation of European cohesion policy. This principle calls for close cooperation between the Commission and the authorities not only at national but also at regional and local level in the Member States during the different stages of the implementation cycle of the Structural Funds and of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development ( EAFRD).</p>
<p>Partnership with local authorities was already present in the guiding principles of the 1988 reform of the Structural Funds and the Rural Development policy and was strengthened with the subsequent reforms of EU cohesion and Rural Development (RD) policies, by enlarging the scope of partnership and the circle of partners.</p>
<p>For the next programming period, the partnership principle will be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the future Council Regulations for 2007-2013. The Commission’s proposal seeks to reinforce this principle since it considers that the participation of regional and local authorities contributes to legitimize the decision-making process by introducing a bottom-up approach. Regional and local authorities can also contribute to the transparency of decisions and decision-making processes through their involvement and through their channelling of information. Furthermore, in many cases the involvement of regional and local authorities contributes to the development of institutional capacity at territorial level. To facilitate the involvement of local or regional authorities, their institutional capacity has to be strengthened, their awareness on European structural policy has to be extended, and a more effective dialogue between the different authorities has to be established.</p>
<p>The regulatory framework proposed for the 2007-2013 period has many similarities to the current one in relation to the involvement of local authorities since it allows Member States to implement the partnership principle in accordance with national practice. There are a number of good examples where regional and local authorities can play a more active role in the future:</p>
<p>The urban actions, where the involvement of the local authorities both in the design and in the management of the programmes is critical to their success. The Commission proposes to the Member States the possibility to sub-delegate, within regional programmes, management responsibilities to these authorities;</p>
<p>Social inclusion actions, co-financed by European Social Fund (ESF), are typically small scale local bottom-up projects which have achieved important impact on the local level, and which will constitute, where appropriate, a priority for ESF interventions;</p>
<p>Cross-border and inter-regional cooperation programmes give an increased possibility to local authorities to take an active part in the programming and management of programmes and actions;</p>
<p>Local authorities qualify for Intermediate bodies which gives them a large responsibility and involvement in the implementation of the programmes and actions under the structural funds.</p>
<p>The new Regulatory framework provides new opportunities for local authorities with the extension of the use of global grants.</p>
<p>Local authorities can receive assistance thanks to the new JESSICA initiative (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas) which is a framework for enhanced cooperation between the Commission and the European Investment Bank, the Central European Bank and other International Financial Institutions on financial engineering for sustainable urban development. Its objective is to provide a ready-made solution to financing projects for urban renewal and development using a combination of grants and loans.</p>
<p>In rural development areas (diversification of rural economy, improvement of the quality of life in rural areas) local authorities can play a key role when it comes to implement local development strategies.</p>
<p>Under the Leader approach in rural development where the involvement of the local partners (including the local authorities) is a prerequisite for the partnership and bottom-up arrangements put forward by the Local Action Groups in view of the approval of their local development strategies within the RD programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0227"></a>

<p>(EN)Article 158 of the Treaty establishing the European Community lays down that the Community shall "aim at reducing disparities in the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, including rural areas." This implies that investment financed by the regional policy should have a permanent and sustainable impact in terms of real economic convergence.</p>
<p>Our means to achieve it are both financial and regulatory.</p>
<p>In financial terms, regional policy is based on the principle of the concentration of investment on the poorest areas of the EU. This principle was confirmed in the conclusions of the European Council in December 2005, which agreed that some 82% of the resources would be concentrated on the 35% of population living in the least developed Member States and regions.</p>
<p>Along with the money available for financial transfers, regional policy is based on the regulatory environment which determines how and where this money can be spent. For the next financial perspective the utmost priority is given to those investments which contribute the most – and in a sustainable way – to the growth, jobs and competitiveness agenda.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Commission’s proposed general regulation, the resources of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund should be used for investment in physical and human capital according to priorities set out in the Community Strategic Guidelines. In anticipation of the adoption of the regulation, and in order to create the conditions to allow Member States sufficient time to prepare new programmes for the beginning of 2007, the Commission decided to present the Guidelines in draft form to Council and Parliament in July 2005. The Guidelines draw on the relevant “integrated guidelines” for Lisbon strategy and set out three over-arching priorities:</p>
<p>-	to make the EU a more attractive place to invest and work in;</p>
<p>-	to transform the Union into an area of high growth, competitiveness and innovation;</p>
<p>-	and to return Europe to full employment, with more and better jobs.</p>
<p>Moreover, on a recommendation of the Commission, the European Council in December 2005 called for transparent targets to be set in order to ensure that a minimum percentage of the resources available under cohesion policy supports the Lisbon strategy. The setting of the percentages, known as “earmarking”, is such that a minimum of 60% of resources in convergence regions and 75% elsewhere should be invested in the implementation of Lisbon over the next period. Although, according to the December EU summit conclusions earmarking is compulsory only for those Member States which made up the Community before enlargement in May 2004, the Commission spares no effort to convince also the new Member States to adopt earmarking approach, on the voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the main objectives for the new programming period is to maximize the leveraging effect of the regional policy investments. Today, regional policy leverages €1,5 of the private capital (for each euro funded by the EU) in the Objective 1 regions and €3 in Objective 2 regions. In the future this effort must be intensified. To provide more financial leveraging the Commission encourages a better and wider use of the Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for the projects financed by the regional policy.</p>
<p>It is in the light of the concentration of resources on investment in the least developed Member States and regions, and a more targeted and disciplined approach in accordance with the Community Strategic Guidelines and the earmarking arrangements, that the aim of real convergence will be pursued in the next period.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0242"></a>

<p>(EN)Under the Interreg II cross-border programme between Ireland and Northern Ireland, which operated from 1994 to 1999, three Border Corridor Groups received support for the development of strategies and integrated plans for the border corridor. The Border Corridor Groups comprise 18 local authority districts on both sides of the border. In order to develop their roles the Border Corridor Groups agreed to form and promote the establishment of Interreg IIIA Partnerships to build a new model of cross border co-operation for strategic development under the current Interreg IIIA programme for 2000-2006.</p>
<p>The Irish Central Border Area Network Interreg IIIA Partnership (ICBAN) is one of the current three cross-border Interreg IIIA Partnerships, along with the East Border Region Interreg IIIA Partnership and the North West Region Interreg IIIA Partnership acting as Implementing Agents for Measures 1, 2 and 3 of Priority 1.</p>
<p>These Partnerships have been actively engaged in achieving their strategic and operational responsibilities in the programme and the Managing Authority has been proactive in the development and promotion of these Partnerships in recognition of their important role.</p>
<p>The Update of the Programme’s Mid-Term Evaluation<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, carried out by independent evaluators, supports this assessment. The evaluators state:</p>
<p>“A unique element of the current Programme is the involvement of the three Interreg IIIA Partnerships, which are responsible for delivering 30% of the Programme funds. The Partnerships, which were established by the Border Corridor Groups, endorse a bottom-up approach and involve a mix of statutory and social partners. The Partnerships have added value to the Programme by bringing local knowledge and expertise (…) and ensure a high level of engagement for local community networks. Furthermore, the work of the Partnerships as well as the array of projects funded across the Programme, have produced a collaborative ‘dividend’ through stimulating cross border dialogue, cross community working and contributed to objectives of the Peace Programme and delivery of the Common Chapter. Likewise the programme has offered a unique opportunity for Government Departments, North and South, to engage in genuine cross border cooperation.”</p>
<p>In the case of ICBAN, the participating Member States, have selected the partnership as one of the delivery vehicles for the cross-border programme between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The information available to the Commission, in particular the evidence from the programme’s mid-term evaluation, suggests that the work of ICBAN has been more than satisfactory.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Operating in the context of the national and regional cohesion programmes supported by the Structural Funds of the European Union for the period 2007-2013, the Joint European Resources for Micro-to-Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) initiative<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is designed to promote greater access to finance and risk capital for small and medium enterprises, and to develop micro-credit. Among the principal characteristics of JEREMIE are, firstly, that the resources contributed by operational programmes to JEREMIE funds are expected to lever in additional loan capital or equity resources from the international financial institutions, financial intermediairies or other investors, and secondly, that assistance provided through venture capital, loan or guarantee funds to develop micro-businesses and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) under JEREMIE must be repayable and recycled even beyond the end of the programming period 2007-2013,</p>
<p>In order to establish the conditions for both leverage and recyclability (which means that the same contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) would normally be used more than once in support of businesses), the Commission has proposed that the contributions made by the managing authorities under operational programmes to funds or holding funds as part of the JEREMIE initiative should be eligible, under ERDF rules, for re-imbursement as interim payments.</p>
<p>These particular characteristics do not apply to advance payments to aid schemes taking the form of non-repayable grants to enterprises. The appropriate treatment of the latter as regards the question of interim ERDF payments remains subject to negotiations in the Council in the Structural Actions Working Group.</p>
<p>In this context, it should be noted that, as today, the draft regulations for 2007-2013 provide for advance payments from the Structural Funds, which make resources available to the authorities immediately on adoption of operational programmes. Such advance payments vary from 5 % to 10.5 % of the total contribution of the Structural Funds over the seven-year period, which corresponds to between 40% and 70% of an annual allocation. This pre-financing of programmes by the Union is designed to provide the necessary liquidity to the authorities in the Member States so that they in turn can pre-finance projects as appropriate or make advance payments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Before preparing operational programmes at national and / or regional level, the Member States are now in the process of finalising the National Reference Strategic Frameworks (NRSF) based on the draft Strategic Guidelines for cohesion elaborated by the Commission<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>There is no standard practice followed by the Commission in order to ensure an overall European added value through coordination of all programmes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure coherence between neighbouring programmes and the NRSF is a tool which may be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Furthermore, cross-border co-operation among border regions has been supported via the Structural Funds for over 15 years. This will continue in the next programming period. This co-operation is organised through integrated co-operation programmes covering both sides of the border at the same time. Evidently, projects implemented through these programmes are automatically co-ordinated by both sides of the border. In some cases, where there is more than one programme per border, the neighbouring programmes maintain close contacts to ensure co-ordination and to avoid duplicating efforts.</p>
<p>In relation to the larger amounts of funding available under the “Convergence” and “Regional Competitiveness and Employment” Objectives, which is the main gist of the question, programmes are implemented on a national or regional basis within the particular Member State and they have therefore not necessarily been co-ordinated with the other side of the border thus far.</p>
<p>Given the amounts of funding available in the next programming period, especially for the new Member States, the Commission agrees with the Honourable Member that such co-ordination would indeed contribute to providing additional European added value. Co-ordination on large environmental and transport projects, for example, which are located close to borders, can only bring benefits to all participants.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore envisages raising this issue during programme negotiations with Member States and regions, in order to assess what steps will be taken to ensure the necessary co-ordination during programme implementation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission considers that the cross-border programmes could contribute to this co-ordination, as these programmes are one of the key meeting places for the two sides of a particular border. Such a co-ordination role for the co-operation programmes could certainly be increased in the future, provided that there is a genuine desire amongst the Member States and regions concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member on the paramount importance of ensuring that the new Initiatives, Jaspers (Joint Assistance in Supporting Projects in European Regions), Jeremie (Joint European Resources for Micro-to-Medium Enterprises) and Jessica (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas) are widely known inside Member States and regions. Accordingly, it has launched a communication effort based around four axes.</p>
<p>First, the three initiatives were launched at a major conference of the Commission with around 500 participants from the regions, financial institutions and social partners, held in Brussels on 24 November 2005. The Commission intends to use all opportunities provided by events on the theme of European Cohesion Policy to explain Jaspers, Jeremie and Jessica.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission, together with the European Investment Bank group and other international financial institutions concerned, has organised technical meetings, both on the ground in the Member States themselves and in Brussels, to inform the national and regional authorities on Jaspers, Jeremie and Jessica Initiatives. Participants have included representatives of managing authorities and (in the case of Jaspers) major sectoral ministries such as transport and environment, and (in the case of Jeremie) finance and economics ministries and regional financial institutions.</p>
<p>Third, modern information technology tools are being developed by the Commission, including the creation of web sites and web pages dedicated to Jaspers, Jeremie and Jessica. A web page on Jaspers is already online<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Draft versions of websites for Jeremie and Jessica have been prepared and are expected to go online in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Fourth, in the context of the recent first round of discussions on the National Strategic Reference Frameworks (NSRFs) for Regional Policy in the period, 2007-2013, the services of the Commission have systematically alerted managing authorities in the Member States to the new opportunities provided by Jaspers, Jeremie and Jessica. They will continue to do so in the course of 2006 in subsequent rounds of discussions on the NSRFs and on the Operational Programmes themselves.</p>
<p>The Commission is also grateful for the support and for the major contribution to the communications effort for these initiatives, on the part of the Parliament, the Committee of the Regions, and the Economic and Social Committee.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)European Union cohesion policy is committed to deliver progressively to the Lisbon agenda. Research, development and innovation will play a major role in the future cohesion policy. They are thus among the suggested priorities for convergence regions, for competitiveness and employment regions and for the European territorial cooperation objective.</p>
<p>The suggested guidelines for research and development in the forthcoming cohesion policy funding period cover better cooperation, both among business and between business and public research and universities, supporting research and development in SMEs, better cross-border and transnational cooperation in research, and strengthening relevant capacity building, including ICT, infrastructures and human capital.</p>
<p>The future cohesion policy programs can build on rich and comprehensive experiences from the current funding period, for which about € 10.5 billion will be invested in research, technological development and innovation. The three main areas of investment are projects for applied and pre-competitive research, research and innovation infrastructures and support for innovation and technology transfer. Seven out of ten € from the Structural Funds for these investments are spent in regions lagging behind in development.</p>
<p>Investment in Human Capital is a vital element in strategies to invest more in research and development. The Funds will co-finance a wide range of actions which will directly contribute in this respect, and ensure synergies to ensure coherent strategies on national and regional level.</p>
<p>The work on the National Strategic Reference Frameworks for the next cohesion policy funding period is ongoing, and of course other services are invited to participate, and Directorate General Research is doing so. Key elements for the research part of these documents, as well as for the forthcoming operational programs, are well elaborated and ambitious strategies, such as from EU supported actions carried out by Regional Foresight and Innovative Actions, improved cooperation and coordination between public and private research, to look for result oriented research paving the way for innovation, and increasing research relevant investments from abroad.</p>
<p>In addition to the fostered and more strategic focus of cohesion policy on research, development and innovation, the cooperation between the Directorates General for Research and Regional Policy also bears fruit in the opposite direction, with the explicit integration of the regional dimension in the seventh Framework Program as a cornerstone. One of the four programs in this framework, the capacities program, enhancing research and innovation capacity throughout Europe, will contain it. Amongst others it includes the development and use of research infrastructures and SMEs' research activities in specific areas. Thus, the latter, being the hinges between research and innovation on the one hand and commercialisation on the other hand, thereby driving growth and jobs, are supported by both policies, each from their specific angle.</p>
<p>Initiated by the Parliament the pilot action on Regions of Knowledge has progressed during the two call periods in a way that for the seventh Framework Program it will be a scheme of its own. Further, the suggested scheme on unlocking research potential in the European Union convergence regions will support the purchase of equipment and the roll out of conferences on technology transfer as well as seconding of research staff.</p>
<p>This enumeration is not exhaustive, but demonstrates that the cooperation to integrate regional policy and research is progressing substantially, and in both directions. This will allow for a real boost in contributions to all three levels identified by the Aho report<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>: market conditions that are favouring research and development, more mobility of researchers and the creation of European-wide lead markets for the most important technologies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In accordance with the auto de-commitment rule ("n+2") the financial resources from the EU Structural Funds for Poland for the period 2004 - 2006 (total amount of about €8.6 billion) should be spent by the end of 2008 so they would not have to be returned to the EU.</p>
<p>The Polish Government recently published a report on forecasted expenditure from the Structural Funds. The 'optimistic option' assumes that till the end of 2006 Poland will be able to spend at most 43.2% of the allocated amount i.e. €3.7 billion. This indicates that about €4.9 billion are to be spent over the next two years.</p>

<p>(EN)The target of spending 43,2% of the total 2004-2006 structural funds allocation by the end of 2006 means avoiding the risk of de-commitment due to n+2 rule for the whole amount committed in 2004 and for 2/3 of the amount committed in 2005. In reality, this would be a very good result for Poland because the payments for 2004-2006 commitments are not supposed to be distributed evenly between 2004 and the end of 2008 (the end date for claiming payments under the structural funds due to the n+2 rule).</p>
<p>In other words, it is difficult to expect that, by the end of 2006, Poland or any other new Member State spends 60% of its total structural funds allocation in the current programming period. The reason for this is a time gap between the moment when the commitment is made and the moment when the work on the project can start – due to the project selection, tendering and contracting.</p>
<p>For example, in the largest Operational Programme (OP), the Integrated Regional Operational Programme (IROP), claims for more than €200 million have now reached the Commission, meaning that decommitment of funds committed for this programme in 2004 is not in question anymore.</p>
<p>As to the major problems concerning implementation of Structural Funds in Poland they are mostly due to the lack of experience in the application of Community law (public procurement rules and environmental impact assessment). Another group of problems concerns too complex and bureaucratic procedures, especially with regard to payment collection and certification.

<p>(EN)The proportion of Structural Funds allocated to Research and Innovation in Ireland for the period 2000-2006 can be estimated to 7% of total Structural Funds allocation (or slightly above €200 Million).

<p>The new generation of cohesion policy programmes in 2007-2013 aims to increase coherence between cohesion policy and the Lisbon agenda and between cohesion policy and other Community policies. The synergies with research policy have therefore received considerable attention. They take two forms:</p>
<p>First, as set out in the Community Strategic Guidelines for Cohesion Policy, we propose to increase and improve investment in RTD through the Structural Funds. The guidelines identify four priorities for investment in this respect:</p>
<p>strengthening co-operation among businesses and between businesses and public research/higher education institutions by supporting the creation of regional and trans-regional clusters of excellence;</p>
<p>supporting RTD activities in Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and enabling SMEs to access RTD services in publicly-funded research institutions;</p>
<p>supporting regional cross-border and transnational initiatives aimed at strengthening research collaboration and capacity building in priority areas of EU research policy;</p>
<p>strengthening R&amp;D capacity building, including information and communication technologies, research infrastructure and human capital in areas with significant growth potential.</p>
<p>Synergy with Research Framework Programme 7 (FP7) is therefore present through both the general objectives and through specific links. The general aim will be to build up research and innovation capacity in all regions, thereby increasing their competitiveness and enable participation in FP7.</p>
<p>Secondly, there will be specific complementarities in terms of:</p>
<p>certain areas of investment (e.g. major European research infrastructures, increasing the potential of research teams in convergence regions, emerging and existing centres of excellence, researchers' training and conditions);</p>
<p>implementing of the research strategies developed under FP7’s 'Regions of Knowledge'.</p>
<p>There will therefore be links between the policies throughout the strategy-formulation and implementation cycle of the Structural Funds programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0244"></a>

<p>(EN)Asset prices in the EU have been rising steadily for several years, reflecting a global trend. Much of the increase in asset prices can be attributed to the conditions of ample liquidity, which have characterised the international financial system since the late 1990s. The expansion in liquidity has been associated with very low short-term interest rates and has encouraged investors to bid up the price of longer-term assets in a search for higher returns.</p>
<p>In some of the Member States, asset prices – including the price of housing – have risen very rapidly and have reached very high levels by historical standards. It is difficult to determine the extent to which these markets may be overvalued. However, such high asset valuations need to be monitored carefully because of the risk that an abrupt correction in these markets could have serious implications for the performance of the economy of these Member States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at an aggregate level, such as for the euro area or the EU as a whole, there are no particular risks arising from such developments in asset prices.</p>
<p>The Commission monitors the situation in asset markets on a regular basis in the context of its economic surveillance of the EU and Member States. On this basis, the Commission has the opportunity to discuss asset-price developments with the Ministers of Finance and the European Central Bank at the monthly meetings of the Ecofin Council and the Eurogroup.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0245"></a>

<p>(EN)In terms of potential growth, Europe is indeed lagging behind several of its main competitors. The reasons might be seen in lower utilisation of labour and secularly declining productivity growth. There is a wide consensus among analysts that this hardly satisfactory situation reflects to large degree structural weaknesses of the European economy. The Lisbon Strategy was devised to address these weaknesses and to raise the level of potential growth. However, since the launch of the Lisbon Strategy in 2000, it has proven difficult to make simultaneous progress on these two fronts. The increased contribution of employment to EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth was initially offset by a reduction in the contribution from labour productivity.</p>
<p>Commission analysis indicates that the deteriorating labour productivity performance can be attributed to a lower investment per employee and a slowdown in the rate of technological progress. The former can be partially explained by a higher rate of job creation, the argument being that the newly created jobs tend to be low-productivity jobs. Moreover, low incentives to invest are also associated with a poor business environment, especially as regards regulation. The latter reflects Europe’s industrial structure with a relatively low share of high value added activities and which has been slow to adapt to the intensifying pressures of globalisation and the associated acceleration in technological progress.</p>
<p>The Lisbon strategy was relaunched last year - as the growth and jobs strategy - with a clear focus on facilitating implementation of measures most conducive to raising growth and employment, as set out in the Integrated Guidelines. It is based on a partnership between Member States and the European Institutions. This comprehensive and coordinated strategy, which contains reform measures in labour, product and services markets at both national and Community level, is also the EU’s main tool to face the implications of ageing populations and the challenges posed by globalisation.</p>
<p>The Growth and Jobs Strategy attempts to promote labour market reforms that would guarantee appropriate security for workers while allowing the market to adapt quickly to changes in the economic environment. Further measures are aimed at enhancing the quality of human capital and promoting R&amp;D and innovation activities. In particular, furthering lifelong learning for low-skilled workers will also contribute to strengthen productivity growth. Also, improvements in the business environment, including better regulation, and the promotion of sound competition in markets are essential.</p>
<p>In the context of the renewed Growth and Jobs Strategy, Member States have presented their national reform programmes in autumn 2005. The Commission has evaluated the programmes in its Annual Progress Report. In that report it has also proposed to place a particular emphasis on near-term reforms in the four areas of knowledge and innovation, the business and regulatory environment, responses to globalization and ageing, as well as energy policy. The Spring European Council has endorsed the Commission’s Annual Progress Report, and the implementation of the National Reform Programmes and the Community Lisbon Programme at Community level are now under way.</p>
<p>The likely impact of the growth and jobs strategy on the growth potential of the European economy is considerable. A recent study commissioned by the Commission has shown that the full implementation of the objectives of the Growth and Jobs Strategy could raise per capita GDP in the EU by almost a quarter. This demonstrates the great positive potential of vigorous reforms as well as the opportunity cost of not doing so.</p>
<p>Any government measures that could impinge on the functioning of the internal market would go against the objectives of boosting efficiency through optimal allocation of resources and exploiting the growth potential of the European economy to the fullest extent.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0248"></a>

<p>(EN)The recent decision of Eurostat released on 9 March 2006 requests for long term contracts for purchases of military equipment that: "in the case of military equipment built over many years, the time of government expenditure, and thus the impact on government deficit, is at the time of actual physical delivery of the final product and not at the time of transfer of ownership, which is often staged during the building process."</p>
<p>At the same time in the case of unavailability of source data Eurostat has foreseen "as it is an acceptable practice, as an interim solution and pending improvement of accrual based source data, that government military equipment expenditure be recorded on a cash basis, or derived from cash-based information." This solution is acceptable only for the following three cases:</p>
<p>a)	cash data are corrected with observed and accurate data on receivables and payables associated with the contracts in question; or</p>
<p>b)	he cash data are used for small deliveries only, or are corrected for large deliveries; or</p>
<p>c)	the time of payment is close to delivery (within one year of the time of delivery).</p>
<p>It is Eurostat understanding that in the past, until 2004, Greece had decided to record military expenditures at the time of actual physical delivery.</p>

In the latter, the Council indeed recommended to Hungary, among other things, to "make the timing and implementation of any tax cuts conditional upon the expected achievement of the deficit targets". In both cases, the Council subsequently decided under Article 104(8) EC, on a Recommendation from the Commission, that the action taken by Hungary in response to its recommendations was not effective.</p>
<p>As Hungary is not yet a member of the euro area, the two steps of the EDP under Article 104(9) EC and 104(11) EC, and particularly the option of imposing sanctions in the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, do not apply. However, on a Recommendation from the Commission, the Council may issue a new Recommendation based on Article 104(7) EC. Such recommendation would take into account any relevant recent developments, such as an adapted convergence programme update to be submitted by 1<span class="sup">st</span> of September 2006. The Commission is following Hungary's budgetary developments and policy very closely.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Schengen Agreements and the British Government's decisions relating to them are creating a shocking situation in the Calais region. A constant flow of more than 200 migrants, fleeing war and misery, who are victims of international mafias which traffic in persons, converges on the Calais region, in the hope of reaching England. This situation is, first of all, intolerable for the migrants, who live in appalling conditions. It also makes unreasonable demands on the local population and causes considerable economic damage, with a very adverse impact on employment. The European Union is entirely responsible for this state of affairs.</p>
<p>What will the Commission do to put an end to this disastrous situation, to assist migrants who are victims of all manner of mafias, and to remedy the economic damage to the Calais region?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission has to recognise that the situation highlighted by the Honourable Member of illegally staying migrants congregating in the Calais area is not a new one.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to be absolutely clear about what has already been done to address this situation, where responsibilities lie regarding dealing with the migrants, and how we can address the problem in the global sense demanded by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>For or five years ago the shelter at Sangatte provided temporary refuge for migrants. This explained why people decided to undertake dangerous journeys across Europe. Some hoped to join friends or relatives. Some hoped to escape poverty. Some sought work. Some escaped persecution and/or racial discrimination.</p>
<p>The solutions that were found at that time – to close down the shelter; to grant United Kingdom (UK) work permits to some migrants; to return some to their countries of origin and to process asylum applications for those who asked for international protection – were effective in the short term. These solutions were not a panacea. They did not address the root causes of migration or any other reason pushing people to leave their own countries and to which the Honourable Member refers. The EU immigration policy seeks to tackle the root causes of migration and to find lasting solutions to the problems faced by several Member States.</p>
<p>The UK is not part of the Schengen area and the checks at its borders are the result of an autonomous, legitimate political choice. The Commission has no powers, nor any competence to oblige the UK to change its policy in this regard. One point is, however, clear. There is no correlation between the fact that the UK does not participate in Schengen and the serious problems in Calais.</p>
<p>These issues are complex and deeply-rooted. They require a series of comprehensive measures and actions, both at national and EU level, in order to deal with them effectively.</p>
<p>For those who may require protection, the situation has changed significantly since the days of Sangatte. The EU has agreed on a package of measures on asylum so as to ensure that those seeking protection in any country in the EU are guaranteed minimum standards as regards reception conditions, qualification as a refugee and procedural guarantees. This set of measures also addresses the issue of which country should be responsible for determining an asylum claim.</p>
<p>Our common migration and asylum policy went further in 2004 with the adoption of the Hague Programme – the European Council's workplan for Justice and Home Affairs adopted in November 2004. The Hague Programme promotes a comprehensive approach to complete a Common European Asylum System, foster legal migration for economic purposes, strengthen integration measures and introduce important new actions designed to combat illegal immigration with resolve.</p>
<p>In response to the Hague Programme, on 1 September 2005, the Commission adopted a set of policy proposals which included a Directive on common standards on returning third-country nationals and concrete ideas aimed at tackling illegal immigration and its root causes through the strengthening of links between migration and development policies in the countries of origin and transit.</p>
<p>With regard to the Honourable Member's concerns for victims of trafficking, the EU has intensified its efforts to address the issue of trafficking, including migrant smuggling, in its political dialogue with third countries. This approach supports anti-trafficking initiatives in third countries through development co-operation and other instruments.</p>
<p>An EU Plan on best practices, standards and procedures for combating and preventing Trafficking in Human Beings was adopted by the Council in December 2005.</p>
<p>The global approach set out by the Commission in September 2005 was broadly endorsed by the European Council in December 2005 in their paper on priority actions focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>That paper includes as priorities:</p>
<p>Increased operational co-operation between Member States, primarily with a view to tackling illegal migration in the Mediterranean region and to saving lives at sea;</p>
<p>developing dialogue and cooperation with Africa including joint efforts to fight illegal migration, and other measures to address the root causes of migration;</p>
<p>cooperation with neighbouring countries, particularly in Northern Africa to prevent illegal immigration and to improve the capacities of their asylum systems and measures to manage legal labour migration from them.</p>
<p>The Commission, in close co-operation with Member States and the FRONTEX<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Agency, is currently working on the implementation of these measures. It will prepare a written report on these measures by the end of 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to present a new Communication this spring which will evaluate the measures carried out until now, assess the need for additional initiatives and set future priorities to combat illegal immigration with resolve.</p>
<p>Obviously, longer term EU strategies and proposals take time to agree and implement – but there is more immediate, concrete and tangible assistance which the EU can offer to address the situation in the Calais region.</p>
<p>France has funds available under the European Refugee Fund to assist it in dealing with any immigrant claiming asylum and EU funding is now available to help with the return of illegal migrants to their countries of origin.</p>
<p>The existing programmes ERF, ARGO, AENEAS and the “Preparatory actions for Return” are all available to enhance Member States' capacity to manage migration and related issues.</p>
<p>As of 2007 the situation should substantially improve with the adoption of the new funds for Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows, proposed by the Commission for the period of 2007-2013, which include an External Borders Fund, a European Refugee Fund as well as a European Return Fund and an Integration Fund.</p>
<p>In addition to the existing AENEAS programme, a share of the EU’s financial instruments for external relations will also be devoted to migration-related issues.</p>
<p>As far as a remedy to the economic damage which may be caused by the presence of illegal immigrants in the Calais area is concerned – it would be necessary first to substantiate the precise nature of such "economic damages" and to establish the link with illegal immigration which the Honourable Member assumes. The Commission should, of course, underline that the responsibility for concrete operative measures to deal with illegal immigrants on their territories and with illegal work lies solely with the Member States themselves. The Commission is not itself involved in law enforcement operations on the ground and Member States have been encouraged for several years, within the framework of the Lisbon agenda, to tackle the issue of illegal work, which acts not only as a pull factors for migrants but also undermines the credibility of EU policies in the field of migration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The objective of the proposed Marine Strategy Directive<a href="#defann_43_1" name="refann_43_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is to achieve “good environmental status” of the EU’s marine environment by 2021. The proposed Directive does not identify specific measures to be taken to achieve this objective. This is justified by the diverse conditions, problems and needs in the different EU Marine Regions that require tailor-made solutions, so the planning and execution of measures are left to the regional level. A more prescriptive approach would neglect the diversity of situations across Europe.</p>
<p>On costs, the Impact Assessment<a href="#defann_43_2" name="refann_43_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> estimates administrative and policy costs to amount to about €90 million for the initial phase and slightly above €70 million after this period. As programmes of measures may greatly differ for each Marine Region, so will their impacts, costs and benefits. The proposed Directive requires detailed impact assessments of measures introduced to ensure cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>Today the EU is not in a strong position to deal with third countries with which it shares seas. Interaction with them takes place mainly within regional seas conventions. EU Member States often do not make every effort to co-ordinate their actions in the absence of clear EU policy. The Marine Strategy provides a platform through which the EU will articulate its views to third countries more effectively. This will improve our negotating position. The Strategy will also become part of the acquis with which many third countries have to approximate their legislation as part the European Neighbourhood Policy or bilateral agreements with the EU. We expect this to give an additional positive impact on the state of the marine environment in EU seas.</p>
<p>On the launch of a pilot project for the implementation of the Strategy, this has not been considered to date. The Commission will continue to encourage efforts to stimulate exchanges and cross-fertilisation between the regional seas conventions.</p>
<p>The Green Paper on Maritime Policy to be adopted by the Commission before the end of the first half of this year will raise questions and suggest answers with respect to further action to develop sustainable maritime activities on the basis of the ecosystem-based management proposed in the Marine Strategy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission is shortly to complete a review that it started at the end of October 2005 on bank accounts opened or operated by staff members other than the Commission’s Accounting Officer.</p>
<p>This review had two aims:</p>
<p>to confirm the existence of all assets and liabilities of the Commission in the form of bank accounts used for the purposes of the EU budget;</p>
<p>to clarify the rules with the various authorising departments of the Commission concerning the opening and use of these bank accounts, in order to assess their continued usefulness.</p>
<p>For this exercise a distinction has to be made between the bank accounts opened within the borders of the European Union (EU) and those opened outside the EU.</p>
<p>The accounts which have been opened outside the EU are for the most part managed jointly by the Cotonou Agreement states with countersignature from Heads of EC Delegations on European Development Fund (EDF) projects and programmes. They are still being reviewed and the completion of this verification will take some more time</p>
<p>18 bank accounts were identified within the borders of the EU. These accounts fulfil different purposes:</p>
<p>to manage revenue of sales of publications;</p>
<p>to comply with national legal requirements (a disputed lease guarantee for a Delegation building, source of pension contributions for local staff, contested recovery procedure);</p>
<p>to provide small loans to staff in urgent need of help under the terms of the interinstitutional Committee for Social Actions (involving Court of Justice, Parliament, Court of Auditors and Commission and chaired by the Head of Personnel of the Court of Justice);</p>
<p>to manage “Restaurant” and "Economat" activities in Brussels, Luxembourg and Ispra;</p>
<p>The accounts are held by the Publications Office (4), Eurostat (2), DG Communications (2), DG Administration (1), the Office for Infrastructure and Logistics in Brussels (5), Office for Infrastructure and Logistics in Luxembourg (3), and the Joint Research Centre in Ispra (1).</p>
<p>Nothing unexpected has therefore emerged from this review. No irregularities were found and no personal profit has been ascertained. The opening of an account for a disputed lease guarantee on the Delegation in Prague should have been formally opened by the Accountant, and should have been closed, if no dispute had occurred. This account still remains open in the Commission’s accounts. It has nevertheless been correctly accounted for and no financial loss or personal profit has been ascertained in this case either.</p>
<p>The Commission has lodged with Parliament a complete list of these accounts and their state as of 30th November 2005. That list contains details about the legal bases under which they were opened and operate. Where possible, accounts that are no longer really needed will be closed.</p>
<p>Such a review was already carried out in 2002, but not in such detail. It was repeated in 2005 in line with the modernisation of the accounts and the move to an accrual based accounting system to identify all assets and liabilities of the Commission.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission has found this inventory exercise useful and will repeat it regularly. The Commission expects to confirm the nature of the accounts mentioned by the Commission delegations by end April 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0216"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission received several complaints pointing out that the Royal Decree 1665/1991 of 25 October 1991 implementing Directive 89/48/EEC was applied incorrectly by the Spanish authorities with regard to the recognition of engineer qualifications.</p>
<p>After having obtained the academic recognition of their Spanish qualifications from an Italian university, the concerned persons passed the Italian state examination which confers the right to pursue the activity of engineer in Italy. They are therefore holders of an Italian professional qualification and are fully qualified to practise the profession concerned in Italy.</p>
<p>Their application for recognition of their Italian professional qualifications by Spain does not constitute any circumvention of the recognition system instituted by Directive 89/48/EEC. The Commission considers that the refusal to recognise the Italian professional qualification in question is contrary to the Directive.</p>
<p>In addition, the Spanish authorities make access to any promotion exam within the public sector dependent upon the academic recognition (by the Spanish authorities) of the diplomas acquired in other Member States. This requirement is also contrary to Directive 89/48/EEC which gives Community nationals who are fully qualified and hold the prescribed diploma to practise a profession in another Member State, the right to practise the same profession in that Member State under the same conditions as nationals. In other words, engineers who are fully qualified to practise the profession of engineer in Italy and who have obtained the recognition of their professional qualifications in Spain do not have to obtain any additional academic recognition of their title if this is not required from Spanish nationals practising the same profession.</p>
<p>The Commission opened an infringement procedure against Spain and sent a reasoned opinion on 5 July 2005 to which Spain replied on 20 September 2005.</p>
<p>Spain's response is under examination and the College will decide in its forthcoming meeting on infringement cases what further steps to take.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)In the context of the new Guidelines on national regional aid for 2007-2013, a distinction should be drawn between the indicators which are used for designating Article 87.3.a regions (those regions which are most in need of support in the EU and may therefore be eligible for the highest rate of aid), and the indicators which are used for designating Article 87.3.c regions (those regions which, although still lagging behind in terms of regional development, are comparatively less disadvantaged and may therefore be eligible for a lower rate of aid).</p>
<p>In order to ensure coherence with the cohesion regional policy proposals, and in agreement with a very large majority of Member States, the Commission has continued to identify regions eligible under Article 87.3.a of EC Treaty on the basis of regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (in Purchasing Power Standards). To take any other approach would mean that the State aid rules would not be fit coherently with the structural fund regulations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Member States have a broad margin of discretion in designating regions as eligible for aid under Article 87.3.c, provided that the necessary safeguards are in place to ensure that aid is targeted appropriately. It is the responsibility of each Member State to demonstrate that the areas proposed are relatively more in need of economic development than other areas, using recognised indicators such as GDP per capita, employment or unemployment levels, or local productivity or skills indicators. Within the limit of the total population coverage allowed for each Member State, it is the responsibility of the Member State itself to determine both the methodology for designating regions as eligible for aid, and the economic indicators that are to be used to target regional disparities, even where those disparities are very localised.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0230"></a>

<p>(EN)The creation of a High Level Group on Competitiveness, Energy and the Environment was announced by the Commission in its Communication of 5<span class="sup">th</span> October 2005, “Implementing the Community Lisbon Programme: a policy framework to strengthen EU manufacturing - towards a more integrated approach for industrial policy”. It is part of seven announced or already established cross-sectoral initiatives aiming at addressing the common challenges across groupings of different industries in order to create long-term stable framework conditions for the different sectors. The Group has been set up by Commission Decision of 23<span class="sup">rd</span> December 2005 according to the rules established in the Communication C(2005)2817 and Commission Staff Working Document SEC(2005)1004 which set out the general rules and procedures applicable to Commission expert groups (e.g. on structure, composition and terms of reference).</p>
<p>The overall purpose of the High Level Group is to foster greater coherence between competitiveness, energy and environmental policies. The main task of the group is to give advice to the Commission, as well as to policy makers and stakeholders on fostering the consistency of policy/legislative initiatives in the domains of competitiveness, energy and environmental policies through closer coordination. It will also advise on how to create a more stable and predictable regulatory framework in the policy areas concerned.</p>
<p>The group has only an advisory role with no other power. The High Level Group is not a comitology committee. It will not weaken the legislator’s capacity or restrict the Commission’s right of initiative. This is not an inter-institutional coordination or negotiation group. The Commission will not seek a formal position from the other Institutions involved and has no intention of by-passing the inter-institutional procedures foreseen in the Treaty.</p>
<p>The members of the group have been invited ad personam for their personal competence and responsibility in the areas of industry, energy and the environment. Even Ministers in the group do not represent their governments. The focus is on the voluntary personal contribution of knowledge and not on geographical distribution of the members of the group. In addition, the Commission has attempted to gather together those with a background in the specific fields to advise the Commission on how to find appropriate balances between public/private interests and also between civil society/industry interests, rather than looking at national interests or geographical balance. The group will gather information pertaining to the situation in the EU-25, inter alia through hearings and by collecting written material. That will ensure that the group’s advice is based on the actual situation in the EU-25. The Commission is not planning to set up any other groups in this field.</p>
<p>There is no direct link between the group’s activities and new legislative initiatives. Moreover, according to the Better Regulation principles new initiatives must undergo an impact assessment. Such an impact assessment may indicate the need for addressing the needs of new Member States specific requirements and such impact assessments are completely beyond the scope of the group.</p>
<p>The High Level Group shall not duplicate the work of other groups, committees or fora that already exist and the group’s activities are not focussed on the Lisbon Strategy. As far as the Lisbon Strategy is concerned there are specific fora where the discussion on the ways to achieving its goals, including reviewing the National Reform Plans, is taking place. Regarding the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, there are no groups addressing separately the challenges specific to the EU-10 or the EU-15 Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0232"></a>

However, in order ultimately for such cheaply produced US wines - which have met with a storm of protests from EU wine producers - to be imported into the EU, it is stipulated that the American methods must obtain prior acceptance by the European wine industry.</p>
<p>Will every bottle of wine produced by the American methods carry a warning so that European consumers are aware at all times that they are purchasing wine produced to a quality which is lower than European standards?

<p>(EN)As far as wine-making practices are concerned, wines imported from the United States (US) and offered for sale to European consumers will be labelled in accordance with Community rules as EU wines are. The consumer then makes the choice.</p>
<p>It would not be in the Community’s best interests to engage in unjustified negative discrimination against the wines of any third country the Community has negotiated an agreement with, especially when the parties are to continue negotiations to achieve additional mutual benefits in the future.</p>
<p>As regards the question on Community ‘names of origin’ (Community geographical indications), like ‘Nemea’, on the one hand and on the 17 European wines names, commonly known in the US as semi-generics, like ‘Retsina’, on the other hand, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>-	Community ‘names of origin’ will be recognised and protected in the US via the US labelling provisions.</p>
<p>-	When the change of the legal status of the 17 famous EU wine names, which are currently considered in US law as semi-generic names, is adopted by the Senate, these 17 Community names will then be reserved to wines originating in the Community.</p>
<p>As the change of the status of these EU wine names in the US is of extreme importance to the EU wine sector, the most important provisions of the Agreement for the US have been linked to this change, in particular the approval of the other existing US wine-making practices. This link creates a real incentive for Congress to act.</p>

How will the Galileo project be funded, given the lack of resources for this purpose in the TEN-T budget and the shrinking funds available in the proposed budget for the seventh EU framework programme?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)For the period 2007-2013, talks are ongoing to thrash out the terms of an agreement on the new financial perspective at interinstitutional level.</p>
<p>The Commission will draw the appropriate conclusions from the final results. It will take account of the funds available, and endeavour to propose priorities on sections with the highest value-added, in particular cross-border sections.</p>
<p>The appointment of six European trans-European transport network coordinators will not have any detrimental effect on the funding of specific priority projects. The coordinators' main task will in fact be to help certain projects that are currently dogged by uncertainty to move forward.</p>
<p>The Commission would also point out that work on the trans-European transport networks in the territory of the new Member States, for example most of the Gdansk – Warsaw – Brno/Bratislava – Vienna project (PP 23), could enjoy funding under the cohesion funds and the European regional development fund.</p>
<p>Lastly the Commission would inform the honourable Member that there is to be a special heading for the future funding of the Galileo project. Accordingly, funds under the trans-European transport networks heading or under the heading of the budget of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development should not be taken into account for the deployment and commercial operating phases of the project.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has decided today to introduce protective tariffs on shoes from China and Vietnam.</p>
<p>The Danish Government has carried out a study which shows that the costs to EU consumers are eight times greater than the profits to manufacturers and that, in total, the Union will lose € 2.4 million if the Commission introduces such tariffs. Overall, Swedish consumers can expect to pay almost SEK 60 million more for their shoes.</p>
<p>Has the Commission made a different estimate of the cost from the Danish Government? If so, what is the nature of that estimate and on what basis has it been made?

<p>(EN)Within the framework of the European anti-dumping legislation, the Commission is indeed bound to consider the wider European interest in determining its response to dumping practices. The Commission recognises that any action it takes can impose some cost – however small – on importers and European consumers, and the Community interest principle requires that it weigh these costs carefully and act on the basis of the wider European interest.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the fact that studies on the impact of measures on consumers and other economic operators have been carried out by the Danish Government. However, the Commission cannot comment on those results, in particular because the details of those studies have not been made available to the Commission.</p>
<p>What the Commission can however do, is share with the Honourable Member the conclusions that it reached with respect to any impact of measures on the overall European Union consumers.</p>
<p>When assessing the effect of the measures on consumer prices, one has to take into account the considerable margin that exists between import prices on which measures are applied, and consumer’s prices.</p>
<p>At the level of the provisional measures proposed, the duty would be just over € 1.5 on average import prices of about € 9 per pair. This duty of € 1.5 however only represents a fraction of the consumer prices, since these shoes sell for € 40 to 120 at retail level.</p>
<p>Given the margins within the supply chain, the Commission also believes that there is room in the sector to absorb a small duty on import costs by spreading it across product ranges and the distribution chain. It is therefore realistic to believe that the duty would on average not represent more than € 1 per pair. And it should be underlined that this case concerns only nine pairs of shoes from every 100 pairs bought by European consumer – a fraction of the product range.</p>
<p>Of course the cumulated effect of the measures should also be seen in the light of the considerable size of the European footwear market. At wholesale level it indeed represents about € 13 billion, and probably more than the double at consumer level.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be stressed that import prices for shoes from China and Vietnam have fallen by more than 20% in the last five years, while we have clear evidence that retail prices for these shoes have remained stable or even risen slightly.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission believes that the measures proposed constitute a balanced solution. It corrects the injury, but allows maximum predictability for importers and passes on minimal additional costs to consumers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0246"></a>

<p>Finally, it should be noted that the Commission has committed itself to review the RoHS Directive by 2008 at the latest in order to simplify and clarify its provisions, insofar this would be appropriate. In order to prepare for this review, the Commission has started a fact-finding exercise on the current implementation problems with respect to this Directive, including its scope.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As a result, no answer has been given to the question whether the Commission will take the opportunity offered by the forthcoming review of the existing legal framework for telecommunications to opt out of sector-specific price and access regulation in its draft directive, or at least to set a clear deadline for ending such regulation.</p>
<p>In addition, one wonders – particularly in the context of a European comparison of the market situation in the broadband area – whether it is true that in a number of European countries the demand for broadband connections has been boosted by tax concessions and the massive input of regional subsidies from the EU budget. What role does this development play in assessing the market situation, and how is it taken into account by the Commission when carrying out market comparisons?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)With respect to the first part of the question from the Honourable Member related to the withdrawal of price and access Regulation, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to propose an opt-out of sector-specific price and access regulation as part of the forthcoming review. It is already a fundamental principle of the current framework that such Regulation must be withdrawn once there is effective competition on the relevant market. For that reason, it is not possible to set in advance a clear deadline as by when Regulation could be withdrawn. The respect of that principle provides the requested level of stability and predictability which are key requirements for investment and innovation in the electronic communications sector.</p>
<p>Concerning the second question, broadband has experienced the fastest take-up amongst communication technologies in recent times. The total number of broadband lines has quadrupled in the past 3 years and the EU25 penetration rate has reached 13% of population in January 2006.</p>
<p>The impact of public intervention on broadband take-up is difficult to measure for various reasons. First, it is difficult to distinguish the impact of public intervention from the impact of competition and of other socio-economic factors. Second, public intervention often takes place at the regional and local level, while broadband statistics are normally available at the national level. One example where the impact has been measurable is given by Italy, where financial incentives (€75 for residential and business broadband access) have enabled more than 350,000 new connections in 2004.</p>
<p>Regional aid has been granted in the less developed regions of the European Union, in particular in rural areas. Indeed, broadband tends to be lacking in areas that are scarcely populated and remote as these characteristics entail high deployment costs. In January 2005, broadband reached more than 90% of households and businesses in urban areas, but only about 62% in the rural areas. Only about 8% of households subscribe to broadband in the rural areas, compared to an average rate of 18% in urban areas.</p>
<p>In general, in rural areas there is a positive relation between broadband availability and demand: take-up is higher in those countries where broadband is more widely available. This means that lack of access does constrain potential users, and that public intervention to bring broadband to these areas is likely to have a positive effect on take-up.</p>
<p>The Commission carries out market comparisons in various contexts. First, developments in broadband take-up are analysed by the Commission in the Implementation Report<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Implementation Report looks at the impact of regulation on take-up in the relevant markets. Market analysis is carried out at the national level with the purpose of assessing the potential significant market power of the incumbent operator. The analysis does not distinguish between entry stimulated by regional aid and entry brought about by market forces.</p>
<p>Second, the Commission compares markets in terms of broadband availability. The Digital Divide Forum report, for example, includes the description of several examples of regional aid, but the analysis is not comprehensive<a href="#defann_58_2" name="refann_58_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Regional aid is not always notified to the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission has recently adopted the Communication ‘Bridging the broadband gap’<a href="#defann_58_3" name="refann_58_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> as part of the implementation of the i2010 initiative. The communication recalls the broadband gaps and the instruments available at the EU level to help bridge them (regulatory tools, competition policy, cohesion funds), proposing the strengthening of the exchange of best practices and of national broadband strategies. Together with national broadband strategies, expected to provide information on concrete actions and measures, a web site will collect information from regions and provide further examples. This information will hopefully help the monitoring of the various regional and local initiatives and facilitate the analysis of their impact.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)As set out in its recent biomass action plan<a href="#defann_62_1" name="refann_62_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and biofuels strategy<a href="#defann_62_2" name="refann_62_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission agrees with the Honourable Member in favouring increased use of crops for energy purposes.</p>
<p>It is taking this objective forward through efforts to promote research and development; develop technical standards; and establish an appropriate framework for trade in biomass.</p>
<p>Alongside this, the European Union has adopted the Biofuels Directive<a href="#defann_62_3" name="refann_62_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and the Directive on Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources<a href="#defann_62_4" name="refann_62_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. These directives require Member States to promote renewable energy and to set national indicative targets for its use. Biomass energy is the dominant source of renewable energy in transport, and also has a key role to play – alongside wind power – in the electricity sector.</p>
<p>Member States are implementing these Directives through measures such as tax exemptions for biofuels, biofuels obligations for fuel suppliers, feed-in tariffs for producers of electricity from renewable energy and green certificates. These measures work by stimulating the demand for renewable energy. The Commission is currently examining the scope for similar measures in heating, although it should be borne in mind that the problems are different here and perhaps more difficult to solve through Community legislation.</p>
<p>On the supply side, the Community has no dedicated support programme for renewable energy but there are already existing support tools, which will be continued in the next programming period and of which Member States may decide to make extended use. The Commission's most important tools to support renewable energy projects are the regional and rural development funds. In this context, energy efficiency, the promotion of renewable energy and sustainable transport have been put forward by the Commission as strategic priorities for the next budgetary period. For example, the Community strategic guidelines for rural development in the next programming period<a href="#defann_62_5" name="refann_62_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> place climate change mitigation among the prominent objectives to be pursued with this policy, and the rural development regulation<a href="#defann_62_6" name="refann_62_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> provides for several measures to contribute to this objective. The Commission calls on Member States and regional authorities to take initiatives in these areas.</p>
<p>In the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Reform 2003 a specific aid for energy crops has been introduced. The amount of this aid is €45 per hectare for a maximum guaranteed area of 1.500.000 hectares at EU-25 level. In the 8 new Member States (including Poland), however, which have opted for the application of the Single Area Payment Scheme (SAPS), according to the present rules this aid scheme cannot be applied. However, these new Member States may decide to grant their farmers a complementary national direct payment for energy crops after authorisation by the Commission. Poland has used this possibility in 2005 and was authorised to grant a payment of €55, 46 /ha for short rotation coppice with a maximum area of 5 500 ha from the national budget. According to our information, Poland is planning to grant complementary national direct payments for energy crops in 2006, as well.</p>
<p>The Commission shall submit a report to the Council by 31 December 2006 on the implementation of the aid for energy crops scheme and, where appropriate, accompanied by proposals taking into account the implementation of the EU biofuels initiative.

<p>(FR)The Commission would note that, once the financial perspective 2007-2013 has been adopted, the budgetary authority will, on an annual basis, be responsible for setting the amounts and for the breakdown of appropriations among the various Community budget items.</p>
<p>The Commission would also point out that the initiative and responsibility for realising trans-European transport networks priority projects rests with the Member States concerned. According to the programme provided by the Greek authorities, the following timetable has been set out for the Greek priority projects:</p>
<p>Priority Project 7: the via Egnatia is expected to be completed by the end of 2008 and the Pathe axis by 2013;</p>
<p>Priority Project 21: work is planned for some of the major Greek ports for 2007-2013;</p>
<p>Priority Project 22: the Athens – Promahonas railway line is expected to be completed by 2013;</p>
<p>Priority Project 29: the construction of the Kozani – Igoumenitsa section is planned for 2007-2012 and the Ioannina – Kalamata section for 2009-2014.</p>
<p>During the 2000-2006 period, Greece used trans-European transport network appropriations for the cofinancing of studies, whereas the work has been cofinanced by the European regional development fund and the cohesion funds. Given that the priority projects in Greece are largely cofinanced by the structural funds, any reduction in trans-European transport network appropriations would have a comparatively limited impact on the development of these projects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0274"></a>

<p>Since China became a member of the WTO, Chinese textiles and other products have been completing the destruction of the industries of certain EU countries. The EU restricts imports of only 10 categories of Chinese textiles. However, imports of such products as socks and tights, coats, jackets and linen have increased dangerously. This transfers production of these articles outside the EU. While imports from China are increasing, Community imports are not, because such developing countries as Indonesia, Bangladesh, etc. are being supplanted on the European market. The Commission has given a political commitment to cease imposing market protection measures on China in accordance with the special provisions relating to textiles adopted when China acceded to the WTO Protocol. However, another mechanism exists, for example the Transitional Product-Specific Safeguard Mechanism (TPSSM), which applies to certain products from the People's Republic of China. Does the Commission not intend to apply these measures?</p>
<p>A study by the Commission of the textile and clothing industry and the scope for expanding its markets reveals that there is a growing threat from Chinese exports, State aid to Chinese enterprises, the existence of sectors financed by the State and violations of the WTO's anti-subsidy agreement.

<p>(EN)One of the reasons why China has been gaining market shares all over the world and in the EU in recent years is because of its comparative advantages, such as low labour costs, which has attracted investment in labour intensive industries (China accounts for 60 percent of the world’s textile machinery). Therefore, Chinese success in the textile and clothing sector is not down to China’s World Trade Organisation (WTO) Membership. On the contrary, being a WTO Member obliges China to abide by internationally agreed trade standards, i.e. fair trade practices.</p>
<p>The EU’s policy cannot be regarded as accelerating delocalisation and outsourcing in the textile sector. In 2005, EU imports of textiles and clothing increased slightly, showing a trend similar trend to previous years.</p>
<p>The Commission shares the concerns of the Honourable Member as far as China’s market economy status is concerned. This question is relevant in the context of trade defence policy. The Commission addresses this issue, among others, in the EU-China Market Economy Working Group, which was set up in 2004. While progress in some areas can be acknowledged, other areas still leave room for considerable improvement. The Commission, together with other WTO Members, has repeatedly aired its concerns in the WTO Committee on Subsidies regarding trade distortions caused by Chinese subsidies and has reminded China of its transparency obligations in this field under WTO rules.</p>
<p>As far as the specific textile and clothing trade policy is concerned, the Commission reiterates the rationale of the arrangement reached in 2005 by the Commission, which was backed by the Member States at the Coreper meeting of 7 September. The compromise of June and September 2005 (Memorandum of Understanding of 10 June, as complemented on 5<span class="sup"> </span>September) is a once and for all deal. The Commission takes the view that this overall deal strikes a reasonable balance between the legitimate need for the EU industry for protection while granting additional breathing space to adapt to a quota-free world. It also reflects the difficult balance the Commission has had to strike between retailer, importer, producer and consumer interests in the EU Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that an overall deal of this kind is preferable to a unilateral imposition of quantitative restrictions, as permitted by China’s special WTO safeguard mechanism. The Commission wants to avoid a situation of permanent negotiation in our overall relations with China. The above-mentioned overall deal gives a degree of clarity and predictability to operators, including in the EU industry. Any other option would be detrimental for both parties. Furthermore, this agreement covers the most sensitive EU products (the 10 categories referred to). It is the most favourable possible in a context where more than half of the Member States have gone to considerable lengths to accept quantitative limits that are detrimental to their retailers, thus showing solidarity. Reopening negotiations is not an option. In this context, it is the maximum that could have been extracted from China in terms of an agreed limit on their exports against the background of their WTO obligations.</p>
<p>Other WTO members (e.g. the US, Brazil) have taken the EU approach in this strategy, and have reached similar agreements. Both the US and the Brazilian agreements cover 2008, although it should be noted that they entered into force only in 2006 (not yet in Brazil’s case), and do not cover the year 2005, unlike the EU agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0285"></a>

<p>(FR)In conjunction with the committee of aviation safety experts, the Commission deems that, in spite of their recent efforts, the civil aviation authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continue to encounter difficulties in complying with applicable safety rules. These shortcomings are among the common criteria that the Commission is obliged to take into account when determining whether a carrier should be subject to a total or partial ban.</p>
<p>Other failings on the part of Hewa Bora Airways (HBA) have come to light in the past. Here again, these problems are among the criteria that the Commission has to take into account. Nevertheless, Belgium and HBA have provided information showing that, in the case of this carrier, these shortcomings have largely been rectified for one aircraft.

<p>Consequently, the Commission has decided to place all registered carriers in DRC, except HBA, on the list of carriers subject to a total operating ban (Annex A of Regulation (EC) 474/2006). HBA may continue its activities in the Community but solely with the equipment mentioned in Annex B of the above-named Regulation.</p>
<p>The Community list is updated where necessary. An inspection takes place at least once every three months.

<p>(EN)With regard to the debate in France on the introduction of more flexible labour contracts for young people (i.e. "Contrat Première Embauche"), the Commission would like to refer the Honourable Member to its analysis on flexibility and security in labour markets.</p>
<p>In the framework of the relaunched Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, the Commission has considered that the current balance between flexibility and security in many Member States has led to increasingly segmented labour markets, with the risk of augmenting the precariousness of jobs, damaging sustainable integration in employment and limiting human capital accumulation. Greater attention should therefore be given to establishing efficient conditions of "flexicurity".</p>
<p>Recognising that each Member State starts from a different position, the Commission has identified four elements it considers essential to strike a good balance between flexibility and security in labour markets.</p>
<p>Firstly, the availability of contractual arrangements providing adequate flexibility for both workers and employers. Proliferation of different forms of contracts should be avoided and sufficient homogeneity between these forms of contracts should be preserved to facilitate transitions between them.</p>
<p>Secondly, active labour market policies should support transitions between jobs, as well as from unemployment and inactivity to jobs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, credible lifelong learning systems should enable workers to remain employable throughout their working life.</p>
<p>Fourthly, modern social security systems should adequately support workers during absences from the labour market and facilitate labour market mobility and transition.</p>
<p>The Commission would also refer the Honourable Member to the Conclusions of the European Council of 23/24 March 2006 which reiterate the urgency to improve the situation of young people in the labour market and to reduce significantly youth unemployment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0292"></a>

<p>(FR)Since 1 May 2004<a href="#defann_69_1" name="refann_69_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, when the new regulations entered into force, 908 EU officials have retired under Annex XIII, Article 22 of the regulations. This encompasses all of the institutions, namely the Commission, Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors and the agencies. It should be noted that this provision simply provides the rules on normal retirement of officials who were in service before 1 May 2004.</p>
<p>239 officials have retired under Annex XIII, Article 23 (before retirement age).</p>
<p>The regulations actually provide for a minimum pension. As regards the minimum amount payable for a pension, however, there is not a flat rate applicable across the board.</p>
<p>Under Article 77(4) of the regulations the individual minimum pension is calculated on the basis of how long the person has worked in a European institution. This minimum amount corresponds to 4% per year of service in the European institutions of the basic salary of a grade 1, step 1 official, and currently stands at EUR 2 393.13.</p>
<p>In the case of early pension, under Annex XIII, Article 23 of the regulations, this amount will be reduced further in accordance with the rules set out in Annex VIII, Article 9 and Annex XIII, Article 23 of the regulations, and in all cases up to a maximum of 70% of the last basic salary, under Article 77(2) of the regulations.</p>
<p>The pension can moreover be affected by weighting, based on the country of residence, in light of the living costs in different countries, although this only applies to one part of the pension, based on the proportion of pension rights acquired before 1 May 2004. For Germany and Austria, this rises, respectively, to rates of 101 and 107.1 against 100.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission has undertaken a number of important initiatives towards improving its cooperation with Mediterranean partner countries and thereby contributing to an increased protection of the Mediterranean environment.</p>
<p>The enlargement of the Union in 2004 prompted the Commission to propose the now agreed European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), under which Action Plans have already been agreed with five partners in the Mediterranean, and consultations are ongoing with further two partner countries.</p>
<p>These ENP Action Plans foresee concrete cooperation to enhance good environmental governance in the partner countries, to address sector specific environment issues (e.g. water management, waste management, marine environment, desertification, nature protection, air quality, sustainable maritime transport) as well as vigorous pursuit of international and regional environment cooperation (including ratification and implementation of multilateral environmental agreements, including the Kyoto Protocol and the Barcelona Convention and its Protocols).</p>
<p>The implementation of the Plans is pursued in the context of the Environment and Transport Subcommittees set up under the Association Agreements. In this context, we will be supporting, as well as monitoring, the implementation of the agreed actions of the Action Plans, including with regard to implementing the obligations the partner countries have undertaken under the Barcelona Convention and other relevant legally binding environment agreements. Future financing under the 2007 - 2013 EU budget will also be important here.</p>
<p>The 10<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary Summit of the Barcelona Process celebrated in November 2005 agreed on a Five Year Plan of targetted cooperation with the partner countries. One of the targets agreed is the "de-pollution of the Mediterranean by 2020". The Commission is currently preparing a proposal for a timetable of actions towards achieving this target. The resulting "Horizon 2020" initiative is expected to promote financing of environment infrastructure in the region. It may also seek to enhance the capacities of the partner countries’ environment administrations as well as to promote environment research, in so far as these issues are not already dealt with within the implementation of the ENP Action Plans. Horizon 2020 will seek to bring together all important environment actors in the Mediterranean, such as the Mediterranean Action Plan, toward a common goal. The Council and the Parliament will be informed on this programme of work through a Communication in 2006.</p>
<p>The Commission has made protection of the marine environment one of its priorities, through the adoption of the European Marine Strategy,<a href="#defann_70_1" name="refann_70_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which will deliver the environmental pillar of a Future Maritime Policy. The Strategy, which includes a proposal for legislative action, is intended to set in motion a process by which EU Member States will cooperate between them as well as with non-EU States to develop and implement regional strategies for the protection and conservation of the marine environment. This will necessarily rely upon better use and implementation of all relevant EU enviromental policies (bathing water, Habitats Directive, Water Framework Directive, etc) as well as relevant regional policies (those developped within the Mediterranean Action Plan, for instance).</p>
<p>The Green Paper on Maritime Policy to be adopted by the Commission before the end of the first half of this year will raise questions and suggest answers with respect to further action to develop sustainable maritime activities in the Mediterranean on the basis of the ecosystem-based management proposed in the Marine Strategy.</p>
<p>Also, as a result of the Pollution prevention and response Protocol adopted in January 2002 and entered into force in March 2004, an ad hoc Strategy was adopted in 2005 by the Contracting Parties of the Barcelona Convention. This strategy will be implemented by the Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea (REMPEC) which operates within the framework of the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP). It contributes to bridging the gap between the Mediterranean countries that are not members of the EU and those that are members, through promoting a coherent, effective and uniform implementation of the relevant international conventions and rules aimed at better protection of marine environment in the Mediterranean region by preventing pollution from ships. To this end, in January 2006 the SAFEMED project<a href="#defann_70_2" name="refann_70_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> (€4,5 million financed under the MEDA<a href="#defann_70_3" name="refann_70_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>) started in order to promote the achievement of the above objectives.</p>
<p>The proposed legislative action, along with the fact that the implementation of the above Strategies requires the cooperation of non-EU States, make this process extremely useful as platform for environmental cooperation at regional scale.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
