More than seven weeks have now passed since what is commonly described as Ukraine's Orange Revolution. The events during that period have shown that the people of Ukraine are committed to democracy and also that the EU Member States, by acting together, can play an important role.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to three questions. First, how far has Ukraine come since the first running of the second round of the elections on 21 November 2004, and what does this mean for the country in the future? Second, what role has the EU played to assist Ukraine to find a peaceful solution to the crisis? Third, what are the challenges now in European Union-Ukraine relations?</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin with the developments in Ukraine and what they mean for the future. Most importantly, Ukraine has succeeded in finding a peaceful solution to the crisis it faced after the serious shortcomings in the conduct of the presidential elections and, notably, the first run of the second round on 21 November. The situation posed a threat to the country's legal framework and its territorial integrity, but both of these were preserved. The International Election Observation Mission, led by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, found that the re-run of the second round of the presidential elections on 26 December brought Ukraine closer to international standards. That is a positive sign.</p>
<p class="contents">The political compromise reached on 8 December 2004 was important in that it paved the way for a new second round of the presidential elections. It is our firm hope that the compromise will also help promote further democratisation in Ukraine. Important constitutional changes were agreed, establishing the framework for the country's internal development in the years ahead, and the role of Ukraine's parliament has been strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent events have demonstrated the Ukrainian people's strong attachment to democracy. We very much welcome this development. Further efforts will be needed to build on this and to take the democratisation process forward in the years ahead. We very much hope that the conduct of the parliamentary elections next year will reflect further progress towards democratisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the second question: how has the EU helped Ukraine to find a peaceful solution? The EU has given sustained political support to help the people of Ukraine find a peaceful outcome to the crisis. It spoke with one voice, urging the Ukrainian authorities to show restraint and all parties to express themselves exclusively by non-violent means.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU also helped to prepare the ground for the political compromise of 8 December 2004, with European mediators, including High Representative Mr Solana, Polish President, Mr Kwasniewski, and the Lithuanian President, Mr Adamkus, playing a very useful facilitating role.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union also made a major contribution, together with the broader international community, to help ensure that the re-run of the second round of the elections would be fair and free. In concrete terms, the EU sent 587 short-term election observers from the EU Member States for the elections on 26 December. The participation in the election observation of a team of nine Members of the European Parliament, led by Mr Siwiec, was an important contribution. The European Commission financed the participation of a further 150 short-term observers from the non-EU OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) Member States, as well as voter education activities. Overall, the EU played a highly significant role in helping secure correct conduct of the elections on 26 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what are the challenges ahead in European Union-Ukraine relations? Clearly, now is the time to take a fresh look at our relationship with Ukraine as a key neighbour and partner of the European Union. Through the developments of the past weeks the people of Ukraine have already clearly demonstrated their commitment to the development of Ukraine into a society that fully respects democracy and fundamental freedoms. However, this is only the beginning of a long process which will require our continued support.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of Ukraine entering the European Union is not on the agenda. The European Neighbourhood Policy is distinct from membership. It will allow us to shift to a higher gear in cooperation with Ukraine. Within the framework of the European Union-Ukraine Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, it opens new partnership and economic integration and cooperation perspectives and offers significant upgrading in our relationships. The key tool for putting this into practice is the action plan. Last December, the Council endorsed the EU-Ukraine ENP Action Plan and agreed to forward it to the European Union-Ukraine Cooperation Council 'as soon as developments in Ukraine allowed'. We all believe that the time has come to move ahead with this action plan. It identifies key priorities such as further strengthening the stability and effectiveness of the institutions, guaranteeing democracy and the rule of law, ensuring the democratic conduct of elections in Ukraine in accordance with OSCE standards, and ensuring respect for the freedom of the media and freedom of expression. It also provides a comprehensive programme for our work with Ukraine in all areas of cooperation, with actions identified in the fields of political dialogue, justice and home affairs, economic and trade relations, people-to-people contacts, cross-border activities and shared responsibility in conflict prevention and conflict resolution. We hope that the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council meeting on 21 February will endorse this action plan, thereby paving the way for Ukraine and us to begin work on its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Council's request, the High Representative and the Commissioner are working on concrete proposals to strengthen cooperation with Ukraine making full use of the action plan, thus enhancing Ukraine's relationship with the European Union. From the Commission's point of view, this proposal should, as far as possible, also take into account Ukraine's requests.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that the European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan is a sufficiently comprehensive and flexible tool to allow us to respond to the new situation. The offer the EU makes in the action plan can be modulated to reflect the progress made by the partner. The further a partner is ready to go in taking practical steps to implement common values, the further the EU will be ready to go in strengthening our mutual links. The pace of progress in the ENP will thus depend on the pace of progress made by the new Ukrainian administration. There is therefore no need to renegotiate the action plan with that administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has repeatedly acknowledged Ukraine's European aspirations and welcomed Ukraine's European choice. Recent dramatic events in Ukraine have reconfirmed the country's place on the European map. We have no doubt that these events will enter into history as a milestone, not only for Ukraine but also for the EU's relations with that country. The European Union and Ukraine have a common interest in further reinforcing their political, economic and cultural ties. If Ukraine fully respects its commitments, as expressed in the action plan, the Commission is willing to help ensure that the European Neighbourhood Policy results in significantly enhanced relations between the European Union and Ukraine. We trust that the European Parliament will support us in all these efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important sign, which reflects our interest in the changes and our positive attitude towards them. It also reflects the special role played by the European Parliament, which was one of the first to react to the victory of democracy in Ukraine. The time for words is past, and it is now time for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The empty chair of the Luxembourg Presidency, which has chosen to be absent during this debate, is telling. During a debate held in this House yesterday, I highlighted the fact that there is no mention whatsoever of Ukraine in the Luxembourg Presidency’s list of priorities. I am also deeply disappointed at the extremely conservative, modest and static position adopted by the European Commission on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the changes that have taken place, it would be wholly inadequate to offer Ukraine the old Action Plan. Democracy and values that are also shared by us have triumphed in Ukraine, and this calls for a change in the European Union’s approach to the country. We must offer Ukraine a new strategy and a new quality of relations, which means that we need new instruments, not instruments negotiated with President Yanukovych’s government in a previous era.</p>
<p class="contents">The numerous expressions of sympathy and support should be transformed into decisive and rapid action, and it should not be forgotten that time is a key factor. We cannot afford to wait, and we must move beyond mere rhetoric. We therefore expect both the Council and the Commission to undertake immediate measures. The old Action Plan drawn up in a previous era is no longer appropriate to the new conditions in the country, and therefore needs to be revised and extended beyond the scope of the neighbourhood policy. We should support Ukraine in its attempt to achieve market economy status, and ensure that a free-trade zone is created between the European Union and Ukraine. The latter should be helped to gain membership of the World Trade Organisation and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), and to approximate its legislation to that of the European Union. Political dialogue should be initiated on structural issues and, as part of this dialogue, talks opened with Ukraine on energy security and the fight against terrorism. A simplified visa regime should be considered for the country, and an Association Agreement with Ukraine should replace the Action Plan. Work on such an Association Agreement should begin now, so that it will be possible to replace the Action Plan after three years. Finally, we should offer Ukraine the prospect of membership.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures should act as a strong incentive for continuing and far-reaching political and economic reforms in Ukraine. This is in our clear interest, and in the interest of the victory of democracy across Eastern Europe. I thank you.</p>

What has come out of the crisis in Ukraine is a major victory for democracy and freedom in a country which has, over the past decade, always been on the brink of becoming an autocratic state. Moreover, it is a pleasant surprise for the European Union and not least for this House, both of which have played a major role in the positive outcome of the events in Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">At long last, democracy has done what it is meant to do in Ukraine. Since the Ukrainians were able to speak out freely about the direction their country was going in, the outcome reflects the will of the people. What has happened in Ukraine over the past few months is a fundamental departure, a sort of democratic uprising which has not culminated in violence, as is often the case elsewhere, and for that we should be grateful to all those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the beginning of a new chapter in the development of Ukraine. The new president’s government should, as its first task, entrench democracy and the rule of law, as well as develop the economy. I believe we are all agreed that the European Union must, as a matter of urgency, implement the action plan which the European Commission has tabled in the framework of the neighbourhood policy in order to strengthen our ties with Ukraine as much as we can in this context. It follows that the maximum use must be made of the scope offered by this action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">It was, though, not only Ukraine to which these events posed a major challenge. The European Union will need to reconsider its approach to Ukraine. It is no longer sufficient for the EU simply to intensify the limited dialogue which has always been maintained, despite the outgoing President Kuchma’s policies, with the former regime. Europe is now facing the task of changing political relations with Ukraine, for the country has elected a president who has never concealed his European orientation and aspirations. Those who marched in favour of democracy, marched in favour of Brussels rather than Moscow, and I think that we should give due consideration to this in our policy. I share the view expressed by Mr Saryusz-Wolski of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that we should really ask ourselves whether the Commission’s policy, as described by Commissioner Potočnik, is ambitious enough. In any event, the resolution which Parliament is discussing today goes quite a bit further than what the Commission and Council have been prepared to do so far.</p>
<p class="contents">What also matters at the moment is that we give active support to those in Ukraine who really want to carry out reforms. They will need to take a number of difficult decisions, and support from the European Union, clear signals from the European Union, can certainly help them to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken much of the responsibility for a good outcome of the elections. We are now also responsible for the further consolidation of democracy in that country. I should like to add that what has happened in Ukraine comes at a time when we need to revisit the EU’s policy with regard to all countries in that region, and gives us cause to do so. It is also important to formulate responses, and to anticipate questions that Ukraine, and also the other countries in that region, will certainly be raising. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a great day for Ukraine, because following weeks of peaceful protests, and despite especially foul weather conditions, it was decided to hold a third round of presidential elections. Eventually, all those involved agreed to this with great maturity. It was an important moment for the European Union, because its unanimous action made it possible to achieve a positive outcome, and also because the European Union made most of the efforts in the field of electoral observation, to which my group has, of course, also contributed. Finally, the correct manner in which the elections were conducted made it an especially great day for democracy. I should like to underline that 300 000 Ukrainians were also involved in this electoral observation, which is quite a gigantic effort. The run-up to the elections as a whole made Ukraine a stronger society.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to emphasise that there will also be a great need for free and independent media, and that the new president and the government that is to be formed will need to set to building and strengthening the market economy and the constitutional state. I am not sure if I understood you correctly, Commissioner, when you said that the action plan offers plenty of scope for intensifying relations between the European Union and Ukraine. I should like to have this confirmed by you, because, should that not be the case, let it be clear that we too would call for the action plan to be renegotiated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off by reminding you of Article 49 of the Treaty of the European Union, which stipulates that a European country, provided it meets the conditions, can apply for membership of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, now, are we to do with our Ukrainian friends who have turned towards Europe? The fact is that, in the streets and in the icy cold, the Ukrainian people have, in the course of a month, chosen the camp in which they are to build their future: the camp of democracy, non-violence and Europe. I believe that Mr Yushchenko’s victory is a victory for our European values.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself was one of the 1 200 OSCE observers who oversaw the poll on 26 December, not in Kiev but in Belgrade, in the Odessa region situated close to the border with Romania and Moldova, where certain villages are neither Russian nor Ukrainian-speaking. Thanks to the new law that has been put in place, the way in which it had been possible to prepare for the second round of the presidential elections was remarkable. We noted how smoothly matters went at the polling stations when the votes were being counted, and we were able to keep track of the ballot papers until they were finally recorded by the Regional Committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine’s unshakeable desire to join the ranks of democracy will cause a shake-up in our policies, Commissioner. One has only to read the plan of the new team I was able to meet at the conclusion of our mission. I can inform you of their proposals. Of the two objectives that emerge very clearly, the first is integration into the European Union, an issue already being examined by working parties. The second is decentralisation, which should prevent the country from splitting. Nor must the massive trauma of Chernobyl be forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore surprised, Commissioner, at your speech removing this prospect from Ukraine. With their orange revolution, the Ukrainian people have raised, and are raising now, the issue of our capacity to respond to the aspirations created by ourselves. Just recently, and with more than 70% of the vote, we again gave a huge endorsement to Article 1 of the Constitution, stating that ‘[t]he Union shall be open to all European States which respect its values and are committed to promoting them together’.</p>
<p class="contents">We need now to reflect upon the relevance of the New Neighbourhood Policy for countries such as Ukraine if they have no prospects of accession. I think it would be a mistake to send them this message. For us, Ukraine definitely has its place as an EU Member State.</p>

I agree with Commissioner Potočnik that, essentially, everything proceeded without bloodshed, and that the elections were run according to European standards in organisational and technical terms, although in no way without certain points worthy of comment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my visit to Ukraine for the re-run presidential elections confirmed my opinion that the reality of life is dramatically different from the media portrayal. I regret to have to say that even Euronews reports have been surprisingly biased towards the orange faction. I do not understand why we have to manufacture antagonists artificially, and why we are exporting mass misunderstandings from Europe to the east.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that our present task is not to preach to Ukraine, or Russia, or the media, but to work towards the ideals of understanding in Europe. I should therefore like to recommend that we give our support to the working groups, which are starting their analysis of the terms and conditions for the accession of Ukraine to the European Union. This is not just a matter of assisting Ukraine and the Union with mutual links; we must make a contribution to stabilising the political situation in Ukraine by helping to keep one of the new president’s pre-election promises. We can also help to achieve a goal which was never at odds with the wishes of the blue faction, but was just misrepresented by politicians and in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I recommend that we open discussions on a code of democratic elections. It is essential not only to establish unified principles, which must be observed so that elections can be recognised as democratic, but it must also be stated to what extent we are willing to tolerate divergences between real life and our ideals.</p>
<p class="contents">My third recommendation is to establish tolerance criteria for foreign interference in the process of democracy. It is undeniably true that every state has a legitimate right to defend its own interests, so that every country has a government which is well disposed towards it. But can we, in such a situation, talk of the legitimacy of the elected government?</p>
<p class="contents">We must find answers to these questions. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whether we can be proud of our involvement will become apparent from future events, yet what does the future hold?</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, Ukrainians are aware that the European Union lent its support to Mr Yushchenko. The handshakes with Mr Yushchenko before cameras on Independence Square and the orange orgy in this House, to which the media devoted much space, made it quite plain to Ukrainians that we were not neutral. If it were merely democracy that had been at stake, MEPs would not have got dressed up in orange. Once Mr Yushchenko takes office as the new president, any criticism of him will also be directed at the European Union as the force that helped him to victory.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions will also soon start to be asked, and in fact have already been asked, pertaining to the sources of funding for the Orange Revolution. Thirty-three thousand of Mr Yushchenko’s representatives in district electoral committees were provided with satellite phones, yet who paid for them? Tents and food were supplied to the demonstrators in Kiev, yet who paid for them? We have been told that President Yanukovych brought his supporters in from Donbas on buses, almost certainly paid for with state funds, but who paid for Mr Yushchenko’s supporters to get to Kiev, and on what form of transport? Ukraine is a poor country, and all this must have been funded by someone. Russia, the USA and the European Union are all accusing each other of interfering in the affairs of others. As it becomes increasingly apparent that Mr Yushchenko is unable to fulfil all the expectations held of him, more and more criticism will be directed at the European Parliament, as it was the most visible external force that became involved on Mr Yushchenko’s behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">Questions will also be asked regarding the external bodies that profited most from Mr Yushchenko’s election. Ukraine is currently a poor country, but it has the potential to become a rich one. Who will try to get their hands on this wealth? Who will exploit it, and how much will the Ukrainian people profit from this? It is time for us to realise that there is still a long way to go until the political situation in Ukraine is stabilised, and the use of force is still a possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped that the methods of dialogue and mediation will become established as standard features of political life. Yet are we in a position to guarantee this? If the situation were to culminate in the use of force, what would we do then? I hope the people of Ukraine will find answers to their problems in a peaceful fashion, and I hope the changes that have taken place there will yield positive results. If they do not, the European Parliament will share in the blame. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our donning of the colour orange and the visits made by many of us to Ukraine were not expressions of support for one of the candidates, and this is something that should be stated very clearly. Irrespective of political differences within this House, as I see it, we did not stand up for one specific political candidate or participate in political debates within Ukraine. What we did do, however, was to support democracy and the process of democracy. If we had been sure that President Yanukovych had been victorious in a fair and democratic election, we would have respected the choice made by Ukraine. By becoming involved and helping the Ukrainian people, we supported democracy and freedom ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">and demonstrated our respect for Ukrainians, who showed enormous courage and determination in defending the values which are shared by people from Ukraine to Portugal and throughout our entire continent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make it very clear that the courage shown by Ukrainians during the weeks of the Orange Revolution should now be shown by the European institutions. Unfortunately, after the Commissioner’s speech today I can only conclude that, to put it mildly, we still lack this courage. The people of Ukraine made it very obvious that their choice related to matters of geopolitics and civilisation, and that they wish to be part of our Community, whilst being aware that this is not a political act that can take place rapidly and painlessly. Realistically, this House must admit that it is a process that will necessarily last some time. Yet Ukrainians, and many of the European Union’s citizens, now expect the EU institutions to offer Ukraine the prospect of membership in the European Union. I thank you.</p>

I too have been able to assist with monitoring the elections in Ukraine and I can now report, as an observer, that the elections were free and democratic. I should like to point out that I know what I am talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Council of Europe, I have for ten years had the opportunity to monitor various elections and this has been a critical period for some countries, I might mention the elections in Croatia, Albania or even the last parliamentary elections in Ukraine. In comparison with all these elections, it can be said that the elections were well prepared, the atmosphere was calm, they were transparent and monitored by observers for both candidates.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority achieved in the results of the election show that the president was indeed elected. This does not mean a victory for the west or a defeat for the east. It can be said that the Ukrainians were victorious. Ukraine now has the feeling for the first time that it has achieved independence, that it has come of age as a state.</p>
<p class="contents">The saying goes: ‘Glory to the victor, honour to the vanquished!’ It is important now for the Ukrainian president to unite the nation in an effort to revive the historical importance which Ukraine has always enjoyed in Europe, to make it an important bridge between the European Union and Russia. And of course, I also support the proposal made here for Ukraine to become a future member of the European Union, but only if its citizens so wish, of course. I support the proposal made by the president of our delegation, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, that a committee should be formed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There, a people has stirred itself into action and, using peaceful means, forced the holding of free elections. Those who have seen the young people in Kiev’s tent camps cannot deny that this was accomplished – and was exemplary in showing what can be accomplished – with the persuasive power that peaceful democrats possess, and that this was comparable to the situation in which many of our peoples found themselves in 1989, 1990 and 1991.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be in no doubt that we in this House helped to bring this about, as did the other institutions, which we had to win over in order that they might join in. Moreover, it has to be clear to us that this happened in order to set in motion a democratic process and, at the same time, to enable Ukraine to decide where it belongs. The fact is that, ever since the Helsinki Final Act, the vitally important thing about Europe is that every country possesses the right of self-determination – but its people have to fight for it. Where it goes once it has it is for the people themselves to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">We should no longer be thinking in terms of spheres of influence. In this Europe of ours, of course, balances have to be struck and bridges built in order to prevent new tensions from arising, including with our great neighbours in the East. If this is to work, we have to support the democratically elected President in such a way that it becomes apparent to his own people that deciding for democracy is worth it, and that there are rewards to be found in looking westwards. For that, the action plan is inadequate, and we have to do a lot more thinking. It must surely involve Ukraine having the prospect of joining the EU, and whether or not to do so it will have to decide for itself.</p>
<p class="contents">That means, though, that the European Union must create the conditions under which that can happen – and this is where I urge this House to help. Today, a remarkably large number of those who supported the idea of Ukraine joining the European Union were the same people who, yesterday, did not vote in favour of the Constitution. We must put ourselves in a position to welcome other countries as members; today, we are not, and we have to wait until things are really up and running in the ten new Member States. That is why we need to add to full membership the development of other options, such as Article 47 and a sensible neighbourhood policy including the possibility of participation in the European Economic Area.</p>
<p class="contents">If this is done in the right way, Moldova too will soon be moving towards democracy, as well as – I hope in the next few years – Belarus. We will end up with what happened in the Balkans happening on a wider scale, and to these countries we must offer something; not just membership in 20 years’ time, but something that is meaningful today.</p>
<p class="contents">I also ask the Commission and the Council to address this issue with less reticence and more imagination. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, Mr Potočnik, trains are powered by modern electric motors. If we cannot offer Ukraine a modern electric locomotive, we should at least offer it a decent diesel one. We need a new Action Plan, with a new timetable where the terminus station is membership. There may well be other stations along the way, but membership should be the terminus. The Delegation to the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, which I have the honour of chairing and which is appointed by the European Parliament, will work to achieve such a timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been presented with an opportunity to fan the flames of the people’s revolution in yet another European country. It is a revolution that did not begin in 1989, but in 1980 in Poland. In order to support this process, the Ukrainian people and their new government need to make clear declarations and demonstrate their determination and willingness to undergo sacrifices. We will listen carefully to what Mr Yushchenko says as president, not on Independence Square, but when he is sworn in. Renewed institutional support is needed for market and democratic reforms, and this is a task for Europe and the international financial institutions. We must hold realistic talks and cooperate with the United States, and we must also hold realistic talks with Russia in order to ensure that it views the developing situation in Ukraine as an opportunity and not merely a threat. Courage and caution are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The revolution in Ukraine has come to an end. We should not forget that the divisions it brought to light cannot be described in simple terms, with the ‘goodies’ on one side of the barricades and the ‘baddies’ on the other. In the end, both sides took part in round-table talks and resolved the problem peacefully, with the Supreme Court, the President and other institutions being involved in this process. New elections were held, and a new President was elected, whom we recognise as such.</p>
<p class="contents">Work is now getting underway to put the revolutionary slogans into practice, and the consent of both the opposing camps is needed. A better Ukraine cannot be built without the 44% of voters who supported Mr Yanukovych. Finally, a large country is always a source of uncertainty and a threat to cowards, but a source of interest and opportunity to adventurers. We should take our place amongst the adventurers. I thank you.</p>

I would ask this House to regard Mr Barroso’s statements yesterday as also relating to Ukraine, as this is another instance in which we should not be timid and apprehensive.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not all fully appreciate what happened in Ukraine. I am aware that Ukraine is a long way away, and that it is a country with which we are unfamiliar. We know a great deal about Cuba or Iraq, and almost nothing about Ukraine. Yet Ukraine is a powerful country in Eastern Europe, and recent events in this country can easily be compared to another fall of the Berlin Wall, albeit the Berlin Wall in the East.</p>
<p class="contents">Up until the Orange Revolution, democratic principles were unheard of to the east of the European Union, with the exception of the tiny country of Georgia. They remain unheard of today in Russia and Belarus, as well as in the other former Soviet republics. Apart from the tiny country of Georgia, which dared to make a stand for democracy a year ago, the only other place where such principles are currently adhered to is a powerful country of 50 million inhabitants. This country covers an area greater than that of France, and its people vigorously and resolutely called for democratic principles to be applied in practice and not just on paper.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a major revolution, and our actions should be equal to these events. Up until now, the European Union’s actions have indeed been equal to events in Ukraine. I will be honest and admit that I was amazed to see the European Union react so rapidly, and to see that it was mediators from the European Union, and not from the United States, who played a leading role in the resolution of conflict in Ukraine. I was proud of that, but I certainly did not feel proud as I listened to Mr Potočnik’s statements today. It would appear that the Commissioner, the European Commission and the European Council are regretting their involvement after 21 November, and now wish to withdraw. We cannot give our consent to this. We became involved, we acted as mediators, and we ensured matters were resolved peacefully. Our duty is to continue providing assistance to the Orange Revolution and to democracy in Ukraine, and to open the European Union’s doors to a country that lies entirely within Europe’s geographical boundaries.</p>

Were it not for the presidential elections in Ukraine being overshadowed by the disastrous floods in Asia, that would have been for me the second-best Christmas in political terms since Prague in 1989.</p>
<p class="contents">I was with Parliament’s delegation in the electoral districts to the south of Kiev and can confirm that the election not only ran peacefully, but also in a very correct manner. We congratulate the democracy movement, and Mr Viktor Yushchenko on winning the election.</p>
<p class="contents">His victory is an outstanding one, gained under difficult economic circumstances and in a region still suffering the effects of the Chernobyl disaster, and, most of all, of the Soviet regime. We support the democracy movement and the renewal of an ancient European country, Ukraine, as it moves towards the rule of law, human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">This tremendous movement will extend its influence into Russia and Belarus, but I wish to refute Commissioner Potočnik’s claim that accession to the EU is not on the agenda. I believe that Ukraine is part of Europe, and, if that is the case, Ukraine also belongs in the EU, provided that it fulfils the conditions. We should do everything necessary to ensure that it does.</p>

That is something that I, as a convinced Calvinist, should like to mention.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday evening, 10 January, Ukraine’s central election committee officially declared Viktor Yushchenko to be winner of the presidential elections and with this, a stunning fact became reality for the West and East alike. In a large former Soviet republic, the opposition managed, by democratic and peaceful means, to beat the post-Communist <span class="italic">nomenklatura</span>. It stands to reason that the democratic forces in neighbouring Belarus, in particular, draw courage from this. It looks as if they will need a great deal of patience, though, to repeat the political masterstroke achieved by Mr Yushchenko and his supporters. At the same time, I expect the Council and Commission to give their support to the reformist citizens of Belarus to the best of their abilities. Incidentally, the Yushchenko camp cannot manage without the same level of European backing either.</p>
<p class="contents">In very practical terms, Mr Klich has illustrated this backing in two useful amendments. Europe helped promote Ukraine’s accession to the World Trade Organisation and its speedy recognition as a market economy, Europe’s support is just as much needed in combating the widespread evil of corruption and strengthening the legal system. Meanwhile, the new Ukrainian President and Government are faced with two sensitive tasks. Domestically, they will need to deal with the supporters of the bad loser, Mr Yanukovych, with much tact and reconciliatory skill. Externally, the most important thing is to be self-assured in striking up the necessary good relationship with Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">So we see Ukraine, 15 years after 1991, being given a second chance in the form of a new start. Under President Yanukovych, this would certainly not have been possible. Striking in this respect is the historical parallel which Ukraine specialist, Professor Gerhard Simon, recently drew in a presentation at the University of Eichstätt. Ukraine’s so-called Orange Revolution is as politically significant as the fall of the Berlin Wall or the end of the Soviet Union.</p>

Ukraine will never be the same again. There have been public demands for the right to mobilise the people not only in action against fraud in the presidential elections, but also demands for democracy and the rule of law. Wide-spread public participation has helped Ukraine to achieve tasks for which revolutions have in the past been necessary. </p>
<p class="contents">Significant changes in the move towards democratisation have already had an impact on the Supreme Court, security services and media. Several risks, however, remain, which may hinder the Ukrainian people from implementing their choice. The dangers of a divided country may well be exaggerated, but they do exist. There is no reason to doubt that the mass media, which is loyal to the Russian president and retains significant influence in the eastern part of Ukraine, will continue to call into question the choice made by the majority of the Ukrainian people. Other risks include Ukraine's dependence on Russia for energy. The Russian market is also Ukraine's most important destination for exports. Quite recently, at the end of the 1990s, the Baltic States, in particular Latvia, still felt the impact of Russia's wish to make use of similar dependency. </p>
<p class="contents">The weakness of previous reforms, particularly in the court system, may threaten the quality of future reforms in Ukraine. The European Union must help Ukraine to overcome these risks, we cannot lose this opportunity for historic change: economic assistance, investments, but above all trading opportunities. The European Union must provide Ukraine with the opportunity of entering its internal market, in particular Ukraine's few competitive steel and food enterprises. Ukraine's entry into the World Trade Organisation must be encouraged. The rapid preparation of a plan of action between the European Union and Ukraine is also important and a clear signal must be given at the earliest opportunity to western and eastern Ukraine, the general public and politicians that, if it meets the stringent entry requirements, the road to membership of the European Union will be open to Ukraine. </p>
<p class="contents">The world has focused its attention on Ukraine; the European Union must now do so. Ukraine should be given the opportunity to join the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet it is now time for the celebrations to end and the hard work to begin. There is work to be done in Ukraine, in order to ensure that Mr Yushchenko’s victory is not wasted and becomes a Pyrrhic victory, but we also have our own homework to do here in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Ukraine needs to set itself two objectives. Firstly, it must put democracy on a firm footing, and secondly, it must implement essential and far-reaching economic reforms. Our tasks are as follows. Firstly, Ukraine, as Poland’s closest neighbour and thus a neighbour of the European Union, must be offered a privileged status and an easy-to-understand ‘road map’ of its journey to membership, even if this road will take many years to travel. Secondly, support should be given to reforms of the Ukrainian administration and judiciary, as well as to a genuine reform of the local government system. The Ukrainian authorities should be expected to have a clear vision of these changes.</p>
<p class="contents">President Yushchenko’s first visit will be to Moscow, but I believe Kiev will import standards of democracy and the free market from the West, not the East, as otherwise its road to Brussels will become even longer. There is a long and rocky road ahead of Ukraine, but it is the right road. We should provide assistance and accompany the country on its journey, even when Western television cameras disappear from Ukraine, as they undoubtedly will soon. Ukrainians must carry out the main bulk of the work for themselves, yet they need to know that we are waiting for them and that we do not want to wait too long.</p>

<p class="contents">This was an essentially corrupt alliance between the former communist hierarchy, economic oligarchs, and state bureaucrats. This alliance developed its own ‘guided democracy’ model, originally patented by the Indonesian dictator Sukarno.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Ukraine’s new course towards real democracy is a choice, a choice in favour of fundamentally different values. In the words of Russian political analyst Piontovski, it is a choice between the past and the future, between Soviet Ukraine and European Ukraine. A choice which, according to him, the Russian people will also have to make sooner or later. Europe must be bold in welcoming those choices, and must not be dismayed or disoriented by possible changes in the present balance of power.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be the greatest of tragedies if the people of Ukraine were to become disillusioned in their faith in freedom and justice. It is therefore the duty of the EU to make a long-term commitment to support the reforms in Ukraine and to give the Ukrainian people a European perspective. It is important that the resolution calls for a change in the Neighbourhood Policy action plan in the light of the recent events. We also propose additional measures, such as the convening of a donors’ conference for Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, in addition to the European Neighbourhood Policy, we have to offer Ukraine other forms of association that will open the door to closer cooperation. This is in accordance with the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the Ukrainian people, and could eventually culminate in Ukraine’s accession to the EU.</p>

<p class="contents">The elections were perfectly in line with OSCE standards, and the few irregularities, such as the sudden decision by the Constitutional Court, were handled relatively well. What did, of course, help the elections to be properly conducted was the public interest in Europe and throughout the world, but that public interest and that attention must not flag now, for the democratic process is not yet complete. We observers were impressed by the commitment and determination showed by the citizens – as demonstrated by the high turnout – and not just by experts and elites. We saw a vast number of people walking great distances – as they were obliged to – in order to reach the polling stations.</p>
<p class="contents">What I found impressive and heartening was that the interest and involvement of women in this democratisation process and at the polling stations went without saying. I cannot produce a quotation from the Bible to illustrate that, but these are signs of a society composed of citizens who do not wait for their government’s decisions. I hope that this democratic process will also prove an incentive to Ukraine’s neighbouring states, specifically to Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">What is Europe to do now? For a start, the country has been divided and polarised during the election and we must not make these divisions any deeper. Secondly, we must consider what help and what prospects we can give Ukraine. The existing concept of neighbourhood aid will have to be radically rethought if we do not offer the prospect of membership within the next two or three years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we must go on pointing out, we owe this victory for democracy to, above all, the Ukrainian people themselves. Day after day and evening after evening, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians gathered and mobilised to demand quite simply that they be able freely to exercise their right to vote. It is thanks to their courage and determination that Ukraine has been able to attain democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also owe this victory to Ukraine’s institutions. I am thinking in particular of Parliament and the Supreme Court which, despite the very many pressures exercised upon them, acted with respect for the law and with a great sense of their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is also a victory for Europe. For once, Europe said ‘no’ by rejecting rigged elections and fraud on a huge scale. When, moreover, we were in Kiev at the beginning of December, we were proud to be Members of the European Parliament. For once, Europe was able to speak with a single voice and, when Europe decides to bring its weight to bear, it comes into its own and is able to change the course of events. Today, the challenges, like the expectations – of reforms and democracy – are huge. Europe has been equal to a tremendous and significant historic event. The Ukrainian people must continue to be able to count on us both now and in the future. We have a responsibility for their being able to do so. We must not, indeed cannot, disappoint them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Then, for unexplained reasons, Ukraine is labelled a 'neighbour of Europe' with no prospects for EU membership, only closer integration with the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The Orange Revolution, which heralded a remarkable change in democratic thinking in Ukraine, occurred without any EU carrots being held out to change its system of government. That contrasts markedly with Turkey and the western Balkans, which are offered full membership – clearly, in my view, a morally unsustainable position in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">I always supported Ukraine's EU-membership aspirations. The denial of EU prospects to Ukraine reflects the unfounded fears in the Council, on the part of the French in particular, of serious agricultural competition, and, on the part of the Germans, of serious industrial competition, notwithstanding the fact that the common agricultural policy will be obsolete by the time Ukraine is ready to join in 10 to 15 years' time, and that industrial relocation is much more likely for a Ukraine in the WTO but outside the EU than it is for a Ukraine as a Member State of the EU with all the onerous single market requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also recommend the OECD to Ukraine, but full OECD membership requires WTO membership first, one of the new government's pressing goals. Curiously, the Commission continues to deny Ukraine – unlike Russia – market economy status. Given the expectations now raised with Ukraine's people, unless the EU accepts that Ukraine can have some kind of long-term aspiration of EU membership, it will be difficult for President Yushchenko to implement the much-needed political and economic reforms and win the parliamentary elections of 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">One major policy change that the new government of Ukraine could make and which would demonstrate Kiev's independence from Russia is to help solve the Transnistria problem. That breakaway territory of Moldova is a haven for criminal activity, including money laundering and arms smuggling, and poses a serious security problem for the EU after 2007, when our borders will extend to Moldova. This could be a useful way of showing Brussels that Ukraine really is now independent from Moscow and seriously wants to do business in the international arena. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will, as long as it does what is necessary, and as long as we do what is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we have to go much further than President Kuchma’s stagnation-period action plan. We need to concentrate on the essential reforms with which the EU can assist Ukraine, since Ukraine’s achievements during the following two-year-long window of opportunity will largely determine whether Ukraine is cut out for Europe or not. The EU must focus on the practical questions holding Ukraine back: corruption, low administrative capacity, crony capitalism, freedom of the press. Solutions do not just require money, but also thousands of experts from the new EU Member States, which have faced the same problems and have resolved them successfully; their membership of the EU is proof of that. I call on the Commission to considerably extend their development plan for reforms, primarily using citizens and officials from the countries that have successfully implemented the same reforms. We should be pragmatic and use the EU’s human potential to help Ukraine, and we should do so now.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Russia’s behaviour throughout the Ukrainian election saga indicates that it is time for the EU to end its ostrich-like policy on Russia. In addition to a significant backslide in democracy and freedom, which according to Freedom House has taken Russia into the <span class="italic">Not Free</span> category, we must not ignore Russia’s foreign policy actions. Just recently, Russia announced that it would not honour the commitment it made at the 1999 OSCE summit in Istanbul to withdraw its troops from Georgia and Moldavia. Russia’s blatant interference in the Ukrainian elections, the growing hostility towards EU institutions, and the unacceptable declaration regarding the EU leaders and officials who resolved the Ukrainian crisis demonstrate that the EU must rethink its policies in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We reacted appropriately and rapidly, and we can be pleased with our efforts. It was not for our own satisfaction that we undertook these efforts, however, but in the clear interest of the European Union, because a stable and democratic Ukraine, with a market economy, is in the interest of the European Union. What can be done to ensure that this is achieved in the long term? The Ukrainians themselves must of course undertake major efforts, and election pledges must be met. We are entitled to expect this of Ukraine, and we can also make the EU’s readiness to open its doors to Ukraine conditional upon it, but we must then ensure that these doors are flung wide open.</p>
<p class="contents">In all honesty, I am astounded by the Commissioner’s speech. It proves that the European Commission has completely failed to grasp the significance of what has happened in Ukraine. How can it be possible to extol the Action Plan’s virtues today, when it was drawn up for a Ukraine that was a completely different country? Ukraine should be offered the prospect of membership, as well as a road map for achieving such membership. This road map should include the following. Firstly, the rapid adoption and implementation of a much-amended and greatly extended Action Plan. Secondly, the urgent organisation of a donors’ conference, along the lines of the one organised by the European Commission and the World Bank for Georgia in April of last year. If EUR 861 million could be raised for Georgia, then it should be possible to raise an amount many times greater for Ukraine, a country of 48 million inhabitants. This project should be negotiated with US partners and the World Bank. Finally, preparations must be made for talks on an Association Agreement, as the recent enlargement taught us that this is the right instrument to use in order to achieve stabilisation and open the doors to future membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was deployed in a rural area about 80 kilometres from Kiev and saw, as any individual observer does, only a microcosm of the story across the whole country. However, I also saw the overall picture as reported by the OSCE election observation mission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that there was an essential integrity to this election that was lacking in the earlier one. The margin of victory was of an order of magnitude greater than any possible margin of fraud. It was clear that the majority of Ukrainians had chosen Mr Yushchenko and not Mr Yanukovych as their President. It was essentially a victory for the urban intelligentsia and the rural population over the urban working class. Yet at the same time it was also victory for cleaner politics over deeply soiled politics.</p>
<p class="contents">The celebrations in Independence Square in Kiev on Boxing Day evening, welcoming the rebirth of democracy in Ukraine, were an inspiration. I welcome the election result as an affirmation of democracy, even if doubts remain over all aspects of the social and economic programme espoused by President Yushchenko. The EU will need to look again at its engagement with Ukraine, at least in terms of quality, if not in terms of quantity. At the same time, if Ukraine is not to be torn apart between east and west, rural and urban, President Yushchenko must seek to build bridges, not with the deeply flawed politicians that preceded him, but with the constituencies that they represent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have also carefully considered the criticisms.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I will say a few words about what the European Neighbourhood Policy entails and, after that, I will provide clarification on the action plan, that is to say, I will look at its substance and how to proceed with it.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Neighbourhood Policy is a major step forward for the countries concerned, in the relations between these countries and the European Union. It is a very ambitious policy which entails a substantive upgrading of our relationship with partners through deeper political cooperation and a significant degree of economic integration, bringing partners closer to the internal market. Implementing this policy with Ukraine – the EU-Ukraine Action Plan – would send a strong message that the EU places great importance on the relationship and acknowledges Kiev's European orientation. The European Neighbourhood Policy is truly distinct from the issue of possible further enlargement of the EU but does not close any doors.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the action plan, let me stress the importance of making full use of the action plan, thus enhancing the EU's relationship with Ukraine. It would be difficult to say that an action plan is an outdated instrument before we have actually used it and implemented it in any countries. It is truly a new instrument which should be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the main characteristics of an action plan? It is true that, in principle, its approach is the same for all countries. However, it is highly flexible, always tailor-made for the country concerned and, with the concrete proposals on which the Commission and the Council are already working, we can go as far as the country concerned wants and can afford. I can assure you that, in the case of Ukraine, the Commission is ready to go far.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by saying again – because it is an important message – that the EU has repeatedly acknowledged and welcomed Ukraine's European aspirations. The recent dramatic events in Ukraine have reconfirmed that country's place on the European map. We have no doubt that these events will go down in history as a milestone not only for Ukraine but also for the EU's relations with that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nine days later the officials responsible reported this decision to the teachers themselves at a general assembly in Brussels. I should like to quote directly from what two of the teachers said on that occasion:</p>
<p class="contents">'We denounce the flagrant lack of openness on the part of the Commission, who waited until today to announce the breaking of the teachers' contracts. In a Europe which claims to be social, we also denounce the cynicism of the Commission, which has plunged these workers into great difficulties - workers, some of whom are main bread-winners with children, many of whom are women. Most of these teachers are of an age at which it would be extremely difficult to find suitable employment. In the March 1997 trialogue agreement the teachers showed their willingness to collaborate in return for a promise by the Commission to maintain their contracts until retirement. Not so long ago Miss Morelli, in charge of training in the Council, in the presence of Commission representatives, reaffirmed on several occasions that the jobs of the teachers were guaranteed until they retired. We wish to record formally the breaking of these promises by the Commission.'</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that lengthy quote sums up a sad story very well. I have met with the dismissed teachers many times in recent months and have read a great deal of documentation from the time leading up to their dismissal. From that a number of things stand out. First, that for the teachers this decision came like a bolt from the blue. They were given absolutely no prior information about the plans for their dismissal. They were not consulted at all about those plans. Documents from throughout 2003 and the first half of 2004 show that at a whole series of meetings the teachers were given the impression that everything was fine, it was business as usual. One set of papers from mid-2003 actually dismisses rumours of planned restructuring. Other papers show the perfectly normal forward-planning of language training for the 2004-05 period but suddenly, in June 2004, the teachers learned of their abrupt dismissal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it stands out that the Commission clearly feels that it is above and beyond the law. Any private entity behaving in the way that the Commission has would find itself in breach of EU laws on information and consultation, collective redundancies and transfer of undertakings. No doubt we will be told today that the Belgian laws giving effect to these EU directives do not apply to the Commission as a public administration, and yet these teachers were employed on Belgian employment contracts that are subject to Belgian employment law. This is the same institution that asks the corporate world to act in a socially responsible way and yet the way in which it has handled this matter so far has been totally socially irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission has shown a total lack of regard for the plight of these people. Over 60% of them are aged over 55. Six months after the Commission decision their worst fears about not finding work at their age have proved only too real. Worse still, because of the restricted hours they were allowed under the contracts the Commission agreed with them it appears, according to a document I have received, that: 'the teachers may not be entitled to unemployment benefits, early retirement and social security cover'. That would leave them without cover until the age of 65, when their entitlement would become about EUR 500 per month. Clearly a number of the families dependent on these teachers face the real prospect of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in relation to the trialogue agreement of 1997, the teachers and their representatives had the clearest understanding that they would be employed until retirement in exchange for agreeing new work practices and to work being put out to outside firms as teachers left. This was widely published at the time – in trade union newsletters, for example – and no-one from the Commission seemed to have contradicted that. A Commission official said something telling to us when we questioned her on this in committee. She said that sometime after the trialogue agreement the Commission's legal service was asked to give an opinion on whether such a guarantee was possible. The service said that it was not possible. An important question arises from that. Why was the legal service asked to give an opinion if such a guarantee had not been given at the trialogue?</p>
<p class="contents">It seems clear that, whether committed to writing or not, such a guarantee was indeed given and that the Commission, having sat silent at the many meetings at which that guarantee has been mentioned since, was quite content to allow everyone to continue with that understanding until it became opportune to go back to that legal opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has behaved in a disgraceful manner. However, it is never too late. I understand that a meeting will take place tomorrow between the Commission and the unions in Brussels. I hope that will be the first step towards reinstatement of these teachers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Potočnik,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, on 9 June 2004 the previous Commission took the decision to terminate the contracts of 43 language teachers. This decision has been perceived by certain parties as 'untransparent' and 'unjustified'. In this respect the questions put by the chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs reflect the concerns expressed by the teachers themselves. Before I reply in detail to the questions put by the honourable Member, I would like to make four introductory points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the decision was taken in order to conform to the principle of sound financial management. Since 1997, Commission language courses have been delivered either by internal teachers with direct contracts with the Commission or by language schools selected via an open tender procedure. Each formula accounts for approximately 50% of the courses.</p>
<p class="contents">Quality-wise, surveys have shown there to be no difference between the courses given by internal trainers and those given by language schools. On the other hand, there is a significant difference in budgetary terms: one hour's training delivered by an internal trainer costs four times as much as an hour delivered by a language school. On a yearly basis, taking 2003 as the reference year, the costs are approximately EUR 3.5 million as opposed to EUR 900 000.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the language teachers have been granted generous compensation. The Commission offered compensation payments that went well beyond the minimum legal requirement. Minimum compensation would have been three months' salary per five years of service. That would have resulted in compensation equivalent to between 12 and 19 months' salary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission opted, however, to calculate the compensation on the basis of the maximum amount ever granted by Belgian courts. This resulted in compensation of between 14 and 24 months' salary. This means gross amounts of between approximately EUR 19 000 and EUR 152 000. Furthermore, the Commission opted to pay this compensation without requiring the teachers to serve out their period of notice.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the decision to terminate the contracts in question is not a unilateral initiative by the Commission, but rather the outcome of moves initiated by the budgetary authority in the mid-1990s. In order to understand the decision of 9 June 2004 one must go back to the origins of this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole process started in the early 1990s, when Parliament externalised its language training in Luxembourg. At this time, the language courses at the Commission and the Council were delivered by internal trainers who were granted private law contracts, without any call for tender or selection procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">In the mid 1990s, the Committee on Budgets criticised both the Commission and the Council for the costs associated with this practice. After lengthy discussions, the trialogue – the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, the Secretary-General of the Council and the Commissioner in charge of personnel – concluded that gradual full externalisation was desirable. As a first step the parties agreed to launch a call for tenders for the supply of language courses, and also, by way of derogation from this principle, to allow existing internal teachers to continue their activities within their existing contract framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, the trialogue agreement did not constitute a commitment on teachers benefiting from lifelong employment. In detail, the trialogue agreed to allow the language teachers to continue working under contracts of indefinite duration without having to participate in the call for tender. This point was made explicit to the unions at the time, as the minutes of meetings show. At the same time, the possibility of terminating a contract of indefinite duration is governed by Belgian law and cannot be waived. Any agreement between parties not to apply the law is null and void.</p>
<p class="contents">After that basic introduction, I will now turn to the specific questions asked. The first is: did the Commission inform and consult the Council and Parliament before unilaterally breaching the trialogue agreement? There are three elements that need to be considered here. Firstly, the Commission did not breach the trialogue agreement because this agreement did not constitute a commitment on teachers benefiting from lifelong employment. Secondly, the Commission accepts that it could have informed the trialogue co-signatories – the Committee on Budgets and the Council – of its intention to proceed with the second phase of externalisation. Nevertheless, the Commission considers that its decision was broadly in line with the stated orientations of the trialogue and the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is: when did the Commission inform the teachers' representatives, the union representatives and the Local Personnel Committee? The Commission informed the teachers' representatives, together with the teachers concerned, at the general assembly held on 18 June 2004, before the decision was notified. Under the social dialogue agreement, staff representatives and the Local Personnel Committee represent persons employed under the Staff Regulations. Since language teachers do not fall into this category, no staff representatives were involved in the case in point.</p>
<p class="contents">The third question is: what kind of information was communicated to the teachers' representatives? The Commission informed the teachers and their representatives of the decision taken on 9 June 2004, giving the reasons for this and explaining the practical consequences and arrangements, which included the Commission's plans for compensation payments.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth question is: does the Commission consider that its handling of this matter stands as a good example of best practice in terms of prior consultation and the provision of information in good time? Looked at from a legal point of view, then I would reply in the affirmative: the Commission complied in full with all the relevant obligations, even if, as already stated, the Commission could have informed the co-signatories of the trialogue agreement before adopting the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth question is: does the Commission feel it has fully faced up to its social responsibility to the teachers concerned? The Commission has not only fulfilled all its legal obligations but has also interpreted its obligations in the most favourable way for the persons concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The sixth and last question is: can the Commission comment on and provide copies of any opinions given by the Commission's Legal Service on the dismissal of the teachers requested by DG ADMIN? The opinions given by the Commission's Legal Service are governed by the rules applicable to relations between lawyers and their clients. Therefore, the Commission will not release the opinions or comments of its Legal Service.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission's position can be summarised as follows. Firstly, as regards the substance of the matter, the Commission considers that the decision to terminate the contracts concerned was sound. It was no longer tenable to continue a dual system where half of the courses were provided by internal teachers at a cost approximately four times greater than the courses provided by language schools, with no difference in quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission implemented this decision in full compliance with its legal obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Commission accepts that it could have informed the co-signatories of the trialogue agreement before adopting the decision. However, the Commission considers that its decision was broadly in line with the orientations of the trialogue and the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has no intention of reducing the number of courses. It reaffirms its commitment to multilingualism and to continuing to provide its staff with opportunities for a high standard of language learning without compromising on quality. Obtaining better value for money without any loss of quality is obviously a means of attaining this goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was then that the bombshell was dropped and they were summarily dismissed. These specialised staff had been working for the Commission for decades, and over half of them were between the ages of 55 and 59. The Commission, over which, at the time, Mr Prodi presided, acted without prior warning and without consulting and informing the employees in due time, something that was in flagrant contravention of the 1997 trialogue agreements, which I have here in my hand. This was an agreement between the institutions, signed by Mr Samland for the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgets, Mr Trumpf on behalf of the Council, and Commissioner Liikanen on behalf of the Commission, which assured the teachers that their contracts would run until they reached pensionable age.</p>
<p class="contents">The language teachers have, by the way, told me that, as a contribution to the sound financial management that you have just mentioned, they made the savings demanded of them by working four extra hours a week unpaid. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and following discussions with the persons concerned, I will ask, as I have done before, what alternative employment there actually was for these teachers in view of the fact that the deadlines for appointments to other institutions had already expired at the end of June.</p>
<p class="contents">Your intervention has done little to dispel my misgivings as to whether Belgian law, according to which redundancies without agreed financial provision are legally void, has been complied with. The employer did nothing to discharge its obligations. Was the teachers’ lawyer consulted in due time, for example? I doubt it. How does your conduct square with the principle of good and responsible governance, and with the accountability of public authorities? Is the Commission even acquainted with the precise terms of its own communication on corporate social responsibility? Commissioner, the guardian of the Treaties is meant to set an example; it is meant to set standards rather than undermine them. Something urgently needs to be done about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As far as I am aware, this House was given no advance information about this either, and it is pretty dubious that the decision to dismiss the teachers was taken at the last meeting of the Commission before the European elections, as if it had been assumed that we would then hear nothing more about it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I want to say is that I do not think it acceptable that the Commission, which is, after all, engaged alongside us in the fight for a social Europe, should ditch its social responsibility and its obligations as an employer when it comes to safeguarding its own interests. How else is one to explain the fact, to which reference has already been made in this debate, that the teachers were not informed in advance of their dismissals, not to mention the way in which, for years on end, returns to the Belgian authorities described them only as part-time employees, so that their actual working time could not be taken into account?</p>
<p class="contents">We are told, thirdly, that teaching is, in future, to be provided only by language schools. The first tenders have already been invited, and it is reported that the first contracts have already been awarded. We can now therefore reckon with the possibility of some of the Commission’s language teaching being provided by the British Council, and, as that body has, as we know, a new head, it is interesting to consider the implications of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to have an independent inquiry into this whole affair, in order, if possible, to conclusively refute the accusations that have been made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The matter has been discussed several times in that committee, but it has in actual fact also been discussed in the Committee on Budgets in which we perhaps had to approach it at a rather more difficult angle, given that we also, of course, wanted to see administration that was as efficient and inexpensive as possible. When, as justification for this dismissal of the 43 teachers, the Commission refers to considerations of sound financial management and the need to ensure both that the costs do not get badly out of hand and that the language courses are obtainable at a third or fourth of the former price, it is difficult for people involved with the budget not to say that the decision is apparently a sensible one.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we in the Committee on Budgets have paid attention first and foremost to the way in which matters have proceeded. The administration must of course be efficient and inexpensive and, in recent years, we in Parliament have exerted considerable pressure to ensure that the Commission implements reforms and that, through these reforms, a more open and transparent system is obtained, which also means a system that is perhaps better in tune with the world around us. There is of course a general prejudice among our electorate that Commission employees are very cosseted, privileged and highly paid, and we must therefore do our best to ensure that remuneration is reasonable and that things are not bought at a higher price than they need to be. That is an important point of departure.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, I would point out that the Commission should also be an attractive place of work and should also comply with the current ground rules designed to protect employees. We have been assured that the Belgian rules have been complied with. I presume that this fact is reflected in the compensation that has been given to the teachers and which, according to the Commissioner, is apparently by far the most generous ever seen. That no doubt also reflects the fact that matters have not proceeded properly in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Hughes has pointed out, the Commission must also comply with some of the requirements we make of employers outside the confines of the Commission. The Commission too must demonstrate social responsibility and sound management. I would therefore recommend that an amicable solution be found regarding this matter, thus ensuring that it is properly resolved. Ways should also, however, be looked into of ensuring, in the future, proper administration that complies with the requirements of the law, is inexpensive and is suitably in keeping with the organisation’s social responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have heard the Commission’s reply. It is the usual reply of employers to laid-off employees, to the effect that all the conventions have been respected. In fact, that is not the case. Rather, this is a genuine labour dispute. These language teachers have worked for the Commission for decades. They have trained various Commissioners in the languages of the various countries, and yet they are being kicked out. That is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot believe for one single moment that the Commission might be compared to what are known pejoratively in France as the bosses. That is not possible. This is a labour dispute, so there need to be more negotiations and further discussion. I can well believe that there are unavoidable issues of progressive externalisation, but a few years might have been allowed to elapse before progressive externalisation led to language teachers within the Commission being dismissed. Where most of them were concerned, a delay of five, six or ten years would have been in order. There have, therefore, to be discussions in a dispute such as this.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I believe that, if the Commission wants attention to be paid to its views on the social dimension, which is defended by the European Parliament and by Europe as a whole, then there has to be discussion, and the Commission has, today in particular, a duty, at this level, to set an impeccable example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On 30 June last year, the chairman of my group, Mr Wurtz, sent letters to the Presidents of the Commission and Parliament, saying that the brutal decision to dismiss 43 language teachers at the Commission with open-ended contracts was in breach of the commitments undertaken by the Commission, the Council and Parliament in the trialogue of 18 March 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement stipulates that ‘representatives of the three institutions agree not to damage the contractual framework in which linguistic training is organised in the Commission and the Council as regards those employees currently benefiting from open-ended contracts’.</p>
<p class="contents">What, in that case, does the future hold for the credibility of this type of institutional agreement if one of the parties damages it unilaterally, using the argument that it complies with Belgian law? What kind of credibility can an institution have that claims to combat social dumping when its approach to budgetary savings is to outsource services? In so doing, it is jeopardising the social rights of people with 10, 20 or 30 years’ service, it is treating them like a disposable product to be thrown away after use, and it is overlooking the actual budgetary savings of around 25% that these workers achieved with unpaid work.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, how can the Commission claim to defend social dialogue and the rights of workers, women and the family, when, without prior warning and without any careers advice or alternative employment, it dismisses people most of whom have family responsibilities and are at an age when it is difficult to find a new job. Is this the management model and the model of social Europe that the Commission claims to defend, when it rides roughshod over the right to work and its social responsibilities? Is this the example that it wishes to set of a responsible public body, committed to linguistic training and to culture, when it dismisses people of great learning and of acknowledged professional and cultural ability and seeks to hire others at rates so low that it actually runs the risk of exploiting teachers?</p>
<p class="contents">Is this because the new executive Commission hopes to reemploy those workers who were unfairly dismissed by the previous executive? Our group will go straight to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, to find out how he will …</p>

The way in which these people were dismissed is reprehensible, and the Commission should apologise for the manner of their dismissal. I repeat, the Commission should apologise for the manner of their dismissal. From a legal point of view, however, the Commission had every right to dismiss them, and it did so not for its own satisfaction or to attract our criticism. The money saved will make it possible to create more jobs, as it cannot be denied that the EU is an over-generous employer. Outside the confines of the European institutions in Belgium an average of EUR 30 per hour would be paid for the same work, or in other words four times less than the figures quoted here. We wronged these people by dismissing them in such a tactless fashion, and they deserved compensation for this. It would be fair to ask, however, whether feeling guilty is sufficient reason to overturn a Commission decision. I thank you.</p>

The Commission maintains that it has fulfilled its legal obligations and acted in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, requiring high-quality courses at a reasonable price.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally wonder about the procedure used to calculate the cost of externalising or privatising this service, compared with the cost of the previous contracts. I would also point out that we miss no opportunity in this House to denounce the externalisation or privatisation of services that is undertaken by national or international companies in our Member States. Our institutions too engage in privatisation and externalisation, but without putting in place the social plans such as we – at least in my own country – impose upon our companies following negotiation with the unions.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it is necessary to devise a social plan for the interested parties in order to put an end to the veritable impoverishment to which the families concerned have been exposed. My fellow MEPs have talked at length about this.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I have a very specific question. How has the restricted invitation to tender been organised for the purpose of selecting the firms invited to replace the former teachers no later than February 2005? Is it true that the bidders in response to this invitation to tender of 30 June include the British Council,<span class="italic"> </span>where one of the posts of responsibility is at present occupied by the former Commissioner responsible for administration who arranged for these sudden redundancies?</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as Quaestor responsible for language courses in Parliament, I should also like to add that, there too, we are confronted with a similar problem. I hope that we shall resolve it in a much more socially-responsible manner, respecting the elementary rules of employment law as applied in all our Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Apart from expressing my disappointment and dissatisfaction with your reply, I shall simply take this opportunity to say to you, Commissioner, that I believe you have had the opportunity to listen to what is being said here this morning in order to reflect and not simply read the documents from the previous Commission or analyses by your officials. Please take account of the fact, Commissioner, that you have only talked to us about the budgetary elements of the issue, and you have completely forgotten the social elements relating to this problem, and consider as well, Commissioner <span class="bold">–</span> and this is my contribution <span class="bold">–</span> the cultural elements. This complete externalisation of services is being carried out and justified on the basis of budgetary arguments, and those arguments alone are being taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Parliament there is also a Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and a Committee on Culture and Education which you must listen to. With regard to the Committee on Culture and Education, Commissioner, there is a real risk that multilingualism, and quality multilingualism, may be affected by this decision. It is not possible to continue taking decisions of this calibre solely on the basis of monetary considerations. Multilingualism is a jewel which must be maintained, and it is not the case nor has it been proven that all needs can be covered by means of external sources; and it is not the case, Commissioner, that quality is equivalent, because all the analyses have been carried out on the basis of differing elements, comparing situations and languages which are not equal.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we shall be watching very carefully to ensure that, in the future, this Commission does not continue in the same way as the previous Commission, thinking solely in budgetary terms and always dealing with budgetary issues rather than quality, jobs and the weakest categories of workers in this Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So listen to the social arguments and the cultural arguments, Commissioner, and take another look at those documents which have been written for you by your high-level officials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This response by the Commission truly illustrates that there are no arguments and exposes it irreparably vis-à-vis the employees. In other words, it has announced, before plenary in the European Parliament, that the jobs of all the employees in the European Union services are insecure.</p>
<p class="contents">The dismissal of 43 language teachers after 15 to 30 years' service constitutes an unacceptable action by the Commission. It is an example of the social insensitivity which characterises its more general anti-grass roots policy.</p>

For this reason we must not remain indifferent, irrespective of the reasons that led to this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the dismissal of the language teachers by the Commission, I have received widely differing information, so I have found it difficult to decide who, in fact, is in the right. In spite of this I think that the status of the dismissed teachers has to be regulated, especially since they had contracts for permanent employment and also in view of their past work and the fact that some of them had worked for the Commission for more than 20 years. In the European Union we strive for the equal treatment of all institutions, and so the Commission and the European Parliament must be examples of such treatment. In addition, the new Constitution, which the majority of us support, states in Article 90: ‘Every employee shall have the right to protection from unfair dismissal in accordance with the legislation of the Union and national laws.’</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I propose that the case of the 43 teachers be re-examined and that, in view of their past work, an appropriate solution be found for them. Enlargement has brought about an increase in the number of Member States, so I cannot believe that there is suddenly no need for these teachers. I also recognise that the Commission has to act in a thrifty and economical manner, but this should not be at the expense of breaking the law. In view of the fact that the contracts were drawn up on the basis of the trilateral agreement, it would seem appropriate to find a solution within such a framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Multilingualism will suffer if we dispense with the work performed by skilled and experienced professionals in their difficult and complex job and outsource that work to people with dubious profile, experience and competence. After all, nobody can guarantee that the work will be done to the necessary standard expected and when it comes to the recruitment procedure and to guarantees of competence, there does not appear to be any accurate information available.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter should concern all of us and not only with regard to the teachers, but also to what might be happening here in Parliament. It might be useful for us to pay a little attention to what is happening with the interpreters, in particular the freelancers, who are highly qualified, have been providing professional services for many years, and the turnover of whom is lower and lower.</p>
<p class="contents">This is no way to solve financial problems that may arise in any of these situations. The construction of Europe, as we wish to see it, will be no more than a fantasy compared to the one that the Commission is offering us now, given the way in which it does not deem the trialogue as binding for the parties to it.

First, if your arguments prevailed in every country in Europe, we would have neither the Lisbon Charter nor even probably the Human Rights Charter. We would have a return to an industrial relations system based on rules that are unacceptable to all the political groups in Parliament, as I have heard.</p>
<p class="contents">The second remark I would like to make to you is this: you should realise that a decision like the one you insist on making sends a terrible message to Parliament, namely that a rule is coming into force in Europe, in Parliament and in the European institutions that was typical of peoples’ democracies during the Soviet era throughout the twentieth century, that is to say: ‘give little and expect little’. The signs are there already in the structures and relations concerning translations, and these are the results.</p>

We know of examples where employees have been unjustly thrown out of work. But they have not been lucky enough to have their cases taken up by a plenary session of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be grateful that the European Commission language teachers have brought their case to us. It gives us the chance to consider how to prevent wrongs within the European institutions. We are not just talking about some company or other which fires some employees in order to increase its profits.

If we, as Members of the European Parliament, are charged with overseeing the European Commission, then we must act in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I call upon the parliamentary Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to give priority attention to this matter at the highest level, to look at all cases similar to this one and to take the necessary steps. We must ensure that employment law is applied and that public servants and employees of the institutions are protected.</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, there are a few reasons why we cannot rehire the teachers, the first of which is financial: such hiring would be incompatible with the Financial Regulation in two aspects, the first of which is procurement and the second is the principle of sound financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is legal. If the teachers were rehired, language courses would continue to be delivered by internal teachers and teachers employed at the language schools. This coexistence has always constituted a legal risk. The difference in salary and other conditions was significant. In this respect, there is a risk that such a difference of treatment between employees who essentially carried out the same duties would be considered by the Belgian courts as an illegal contractual construction.</p>
<p class="contents">The third reason concerns assessing whether rehiring the teachers would mean having to negotiate new conditions. Experience shows that internal teachers were not particularly flexible vis-à-vis the Commission, despite the advantageous conditions it offered.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there was the question about procurement restrictions. This was not a restrictive procedure. The Financial Regulation obliges the Commission to issue an open call for tenders where the four-year amount is in excess of around EUR 155 000. In fact, the call for candidates was opened and published in the Official Journal. The selection procedure was conducted on the basis of financial and technical criteria. The successful candidates were then allowed to compete and, finally, contractors for different lots were then chosen on the basis of cost and quantity.</p>
<p class="contents">I will very briefly address the issue of total savings. They were calculated in terms of the difference between what it would cost to maintain the teachers' contracts and the cost of severance payments. The savings were calculated on the basis of the costs for 2003. The total savings also took into account the total cost of the language-training programme, each teacher being replaced at retirement age by a contractor employee, and the total cost of the same language-training programme executed exclusively by contractors as from September 2004. Finally, account was taken of the sum of annual savings over the 2004-2031 period, when the fewest teachers would, theoretically, retire. At the beginning there would be many such teachers, but the number would decrease towards the end of that period. The final calculation under this scheme showed that the savings would come to EUR 23.8 million.</p>
<p class="contents">A remark was made about the exaggerated figure. On the contrary, the EUR 23.8 million – cited in the documents prepared for the Commission decision – to which I referred corresponds to the cost of continuing teachers' contracts, and that was reduced to EUR 20 million. The decision was taken on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The real amount also depends on individual decisions by teachers to take early retirement or to leave on personal grounds of invalidity and sickness, and, lastly, on the salary and contract cost evaluation. In this context we wanted to err on the side of caution.</p>

<p class="contents">I am consequently very pleased that, in the resolution adopted by the European Parliament, we were considering arranging for a European Civil Protection Corps to be put in place, with the task of putting together another form of aid, free from the ulterior motives described and, especially, from the competition we have witnessed in the charitable and emergency relief stakes.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this, I should like us to do more to make use of the enhanced cooperation mechanism put in place on 23 October 2001 by creating a genuine European civil protection headquarters capable of training experts and sending them out in the colours of the European Union so that the EU might physically demonstrate its commitment in periods of emergency and reconstruction. I should also like us to take account of this within the framework of the Financial Perspectives adopted, given that the Solidarity Fund notoriously lacks the flexibility not only for mobilising the necessary help in transporting resources but also for channelling the emergency aid that presupposes completely mobile and available funds. I was expressing myself along these lines as early as 1999. I welcome the efforts successfully made by the Commission and the Council, and I hope that Europe will very quickly have available to it helmets painted with the blue of the European flag and signalling emergency aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we have been saying for several Parliamentary terms, it is essential that we should immediately set up a European civil protection structure with the capacity to take swift action to deal with any eventuality that may affect our countries or other parts of the world. We have globalised the market; now we have to globalise prevention and civil protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore delighted that the G7 has decided on a moratorium on debt repayments for the disaster-hit countries; we accept the decision to entrust coordination of the aid and the reconstruction of the affected areas to the United Nations, despite its poor record in the past; and we call on the European Union to equip itself with a civil protection structure that will 1. coordinate the national civil protection efforts, 2. harmonise the national regulations, and 3. establish a permanent European structure.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask that the funds allocated by the Union for reconstruction should not be taken from the budget headings for the development of the poorest countries and that a Commission representative should report back to Parliament regularly on how the funds allocated by the Union have been used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The unprecedented solidarity confirms that the brotherhood of nations can raise a tsunami of humanitarianism, sweeping away the hypocrisy of governments and organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The fury of the earthquake highlighted the insensitivity of the capitalism sweeping the area. The disaster mainly hit the grass-roots classes. The predatory interventions in the environment by large companies looking for excessive profits are largely to blame for turning natural disasters into humanitarian disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Capitalism is preparing to re-build the interests of the multinationals on top of the graves, to turn the human tragedy into contracts and stock exchange indicators, to turn any 'humanitarian aid' into interventions by the imperialist centres. A newspaper in the United States terrifyingly wrote that the rich nations are providing the aid and they will dictate the terms. This means funding for projects with a depressing economic philosophy so that the multinationals can reap the benefits of 'reconstruction', ignoring the needs of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The money raised as a result of grass-roots solidarity must not be embezzled. The peoples who ran to help must not allow it. The creation of a trustworthy observatory to implement and strictly control reconstruction programmes for the benefit of the peoples, the writing-off of the debts of these countries and the provision without cutbacks of the aid programmed for other third countries are just some of the measures for relieving the victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Tragedies sometimes have one positive aspect: they show that human nature – and the nature of the institutions – is also capable of good deeds. As well as the unspeakable horror that was visited on South-East Asia, and past, present and future suffering, what also hit home were the images of world solidarity on an unprecedented scale. The globalisation of everything, even suffering, responds to tragic events with decency.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the readiness to help shown by everyone, and in our particular case by the EU as a whole and by each of the 25 Member States, is worthy of praise, but only if the promises of help correspond to effective help. This time, also very much due to the efforts of its citizens, Europe lived up to what its stature should be. Let us hope, therefore, that this will set a precedent.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, this should also be an opportunity for the problems of the least-developed countries to be addressed from a fresh perspective, with a fresh approach and with fresh determination. Let us ensure that tragedy does not produce more commotion than action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also seen in the definition of the political domination structure of bodies such as the Security Council, a body that seeks to consolidate positions so as to ensure the legal status quo in world domination, bypassing differences of opinion as regards the attack on and invasion of Iraq, the violation of international law, the International Criminal Court and the fact that the Kyoto Protocol has not been signed, and suggesting that an ‘action community’ be created ...</p>

<p class="contents">This is wrong, it is immoral and it constitutes a major hindrance to development. It also diverts enormous amounts of money from the basic needs of the people of these countries, which more often than not earmark more money for debt repayment than for the total amount that they spent on health and education, thus preventing them from tackling diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis or problems such as illiteracy, and many others.</p>
<p class="contents">Maintaining the debt is unacceptable. It is worth pointing out that the countries in debt have already paid seven times what they owed in 1982 and have, worse still, seen their debt rise fourfold. Furthermore, most of them have a history of colonial exploitation, which makes them creditors rather than debtors of the industrialised countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This ongoing situation is all the more incomprehensible following the writing off of 80% of Iraq’s debt, due to the imposition of the USA military occupying power and given estimates as to the active exploitation of Iraq’s wealth and the lucrative ‘business’ of reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential that the debt of developing countries is cancelled, so that they can build a fairer world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This execution called forth both protests from around the world and a resolution from this House, which Beijing ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">In January 2003, we made efforts to prevent the execution of his spiritual leader, Lama Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, and did likewise in November 2004, when the two-year stay of execution expired. Yesterday, in a conversation here in Strasbourg, the Chinese Embassy assured me of the high probability of the death sentence being commuted to life imprisonment. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regards that statement as a triumph for the many initiatives taken by this House and others. We have never ceased from speaking out and winning support from parliaments and human rights organisations. Again and again, we have urged the Council and the Commission to press a change of course on those in power in China. Our demands are still on the agenda. A new trial is to examine charges of sabotage and involvement in bomb attacks. This trial must be in accordance with the rule of law and monitored by international observers.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, unfortunately, little has changed as regards human rights in China. Bishop Julius Jia Zhiguo, who belongs to the underground church, was recently arrested. It follows that the arms embargo must be maintained. The possibility of his being pardoned opens up a way ahead, and I hope that we will be able to go down it. What we are aiming for, and will continue to aim for, is the recognition of minority rights and the acknowledgement of the right to religious practice. One essential step in that direction would be the stepping up of dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We return today to his case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a reminder to us all that, even though this is 2005, some people in our world today still cannot practice their religious beliefs without the threat of violence or, in Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche's case, death. Since we last spoke about his case in this House, there have been rumours that his death sentence has been suspended and may be commuted to a life sentence. I am pleased to hear Mr Mann's comments. I suggest that we still urge the Chinese authorities immediately to clarify the situation and urge – as our resolution says – the Chinese Government to commute the death sentence handed down to Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche. We should also ask the Chinese authorities further to clarify where Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche is being held and whether he is in good health. For the time being, no one knows his exact location.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe this House should strongly support the continuation of the EU embargo on arms sales to the People's Republic of China until such time as the human rights situation has improved and China has taken the vital step of signing the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Further to this, we must continue to exert pressure on China to abolish the death penalty and place an immediate moratorium on capital punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be stressing to the Chinese authorities that Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche deserves a fair trial and not a sham trial.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, there are many like Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche out there in our world today who deserve our support and the right to live in a country where religious freedom and human rights are respected. I hope this House can support this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, it is urgent that we appoint a European Union special representative for Tibet, in order to demonstrate both the importance of the Tibetan issue within the context of European Union-China negotiations and in order to facilitate the path towards a Chinese-Tibetan dialogue to put an end to the repression suffered by the Tibetan population, religion, language and culture for decades. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an area in the course of colonisation by the Chinese and one where many newcomers fulfil the function of official, policeman or military. Violent means have for many years been used to repress opposition to this humiliating state of affairs. The death penalty, whether to be carried out immediately or delayed, has been used by the Chinese state as a means of quashing the wishes of a large part of the population of Tibet. We in this Parliament, right across the political spectrum, have every reason to be indignant about the death penalty and certainly about its use as a political instrument, and we hope to prevent the execution in two weeks time of a respected and influential Buddhist lama.</p>
<p class="contents">Present day China is akin to South Korea of recent years. In that model, economic growth is paramount, over and above man and the environment. If, on the basis of short-sighted European self-interest, we were to reason in the short term, there would be a considerable temptation to withdraw the criticism we have levelled at China. Indeed, China is the country with the largest population and the faster growing economy. For a century, that country stagnated on account of domestic wars, foreign occupations and idealistic, but ill-considered experiments, and has, internationally speaking, been placed off-side. It now looks as if it will be playing a vital role in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we resign ourselves to the fact that such an authoritative country applies the death penalty, treats its minorities badly, neglects its environment, pays its workers badly, tolerates unsafe living and working conditions and is not a democracy? Or do we in Europe want to promote over there our views about a democratic constitutional state, diversity of political and religious opinions, freedom of association and democratic majority decisions?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Europe must explicitly dare take sides with threatened minorities and movements, which, in future too, must be able to continue to play their role. In their relations with China, the Commission and Council must not work from the assumption that this is a big country with a fast-growing economy, but that this is a country which refuses to release colonised peoples, puts economic growth above anything else and for the rest also violates human rights. Only then can we expect results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation in Europe today has improved tremendously, although the fact that Mrs Estimirova and Mr Kovalev are present in this Chamber now indicates that much still remains for us to do in Europe in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth mentioning once again that Tibet has always been an independent state, which, being naturally cut off from the world, has never had any ambition to conduct any kind of foreign policy. This cannot be taken to mean, however, that China is entitled to declare Tibet part of China, as Tibet is most certainly not part of China. In spite of this, the Tibetan authorities and the Dalai Lama are prepared to hold a dialogue and would be satisfied with mere autonomy. Yet this is the bare minimum due to them, which we must call for on their behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">This House is to adopt a position on this issue today, and we must call on the Government of the People’s Republic of China to enter into an ongoing dialogue with the Tibetan people and to respect the rights of minorities. We must call, and indeed we are calling, for the death sentence imposed on Tenzin Delek Rinpoche to be lifted, and for him to be released from prison. We are also calling on our institutions to maintain the arms trade embargo against the People’s Republic of China, and not to lift it. The free world has an instrument available to it to prevent tyrants from abusing those subject to such tyrants’ power against their will, and this instrument is appropriate economic sanctions. We must therefore call for our institutions to apply these sanctions, as well as for dialogue to take place between China and the whole of Chinese society, above all the Tibetan people and their representative, the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like the President of Parliament to forward this resolution to the European Council, the European Commission, the UN Secretary-General and all those who can bring any influence to bear on China to encourage the country to start respecting human rights. We should not only feel pangs of conscience when a disaster such as the tsunami strikes. Instead, we must always be alert to the poverty and misfortune of people the world over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This wise saying must not be misunderstood; it counsels stubborn determination rather than inactivity, and it is when, as sometimes happens, we begin to become resigned to the persistence with which the same human rights issues resurface over and over again, that we must continue to speak out with tenacity and a clear voice; we must be unrelenting in the defence of human rights, whether this be in the face of the Chinese Government or of other regimes that trample these rights underfoot. We must not, though, misinterpret this saying to mean that we should do nothing. We must be impatient when we protest against the large-scale violations of human rights that occur in a country like China, which is such an important partner.</p>
<p class="contents">Our specific concern today is with the fate of a senior Tibetan monk and of a bishop of the Chinese underground church, the brutal persecution of both of whom violates the universally accepted principle of freedom of religion. Let me make it plain to our Chinese partners that it is unworthy of an ancient and highly-developed culture like their own to suppress another – that of Tibet, which is equally ancient and venerable. It ill becomes such an advanced culture to oppress and persecute faith communities such as the Buddhist community and the Catholic Church. China has no need of such a thing, and by doing this it does massive damage to itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans must back up our words with deeds and try to exert pressure to enforce the observance of human rights, even when the state violating them is a large one and an important trading partner, such as Russia in its dealings with Chechnya, and China where Tibet and freedom of religion are concerned. In these matters, we must apply the same standards, rather than condemning the small states while grovelling to the big ones. Only if we do will Europe’s human rights policy remain credible in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has, in particular, urged the Chinese authorities to preserve the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues have also been systematically dealt with in the context of the EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights. During this dialogue, the EU has regularly brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities, at every session, and most recently in Beijing on 24 September 2004, the situation of individuals who have been sentenced for having expressed their opinion or their beliefs. The case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche is one such case.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of 2004, the EU made an official démarche in Beijing to request information on his whereabouts and state of health, expressed the hope that the death sentence would not be upheld and asked for judicial review of the case. More recently, on 15 November, the EU Troika made a new ad hoc démarche in Beijing, during which the case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche was again highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is fully committed to urging China not to carry out the sentence and is prepared to contribute, in this respect, to finding an acceptable solution to the case under examination. It takes the view that the application of the death penalty to Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche would send out a very negative signal and would have an adverse impact on relations with China. We have just learned that the Luxembourg presidency - and the Commission immediately contacted it - is currently preparing a démarche that would also associate the Commission. The démarche will be sent to China asking it not to administer the death penalty and to re-examine the case.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general level, the EU has called for years, and will continue to call, as part of its overall policies vis-à-vis Tibet, for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities as the only realistic way of finding a lasting solution to the question of Tibet. In this context, we consider the recent third visit to China of the Dalai Lama’s special envoys to be an encouraging sign of progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In the dialogue with China, the EU has regularly expressed concern over the extensive use of the death penalty.

This is particularly the case if one wants to make progress with partners with whom one has little in common. I therefore accept the fact that, in some way, and even though the parties do not admit it, a deal has been done, one that involves, on the one hand, Iran’s compliance with the IAEA’s (International Atomic Energy Agency) demands on nuclear matters and, on the other, the resumption of negotiations on the partnership and cooperation agreement with the EU, as happened in January.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, one area in which no deals can be done, and that is in the field of human rights. Iran may well behave itself where nuclear energy is concerned, but this House, at any rate, will not reward it by turning a blind eye to what goes on there in the area of human rights, and I would also like to remind the Commission and the Council that any agreement has to be approved by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">If the human rights situation continues to develop as it has done so far, I have grave doubts as to whether it will be. Even the UN General Assembly, when it met on 20 December last year, denounced the deteriorating situation in Iran as regards the freedoms of speech, opinion and the media, as well as the arbitrary arrests without charges or court proceedings. It is journalists and those who write for the Internet who are on the receiving end of this sort of treatment, and I have learned from the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders that the Nobel Peace Prize holder Shirin Ebadi was yesterday summoned to the public prosecutor’s office in Teheran. The reason for this is not yet known, but my hunch is that this is another case of good old-fashioned intimidation.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from that, it is unacceptable that death sentences should still be being carried out, particularly on juveniles and the mentally handicapped, and there is still no confirmation that execution by stoning is now a thing of the past and will not be revived.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us then send out a clear message that we will not allow Iran to continue with such a policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is not only important in terms of defending our economic interests, but also and primarily in terms of building up networks whereby human rights, peacekeeping, respect for nature, and much else, can be demanded and put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an area in which many delegations from this House are active, and these contacts have enabled us to achieve a great deal. Parliament’s desire to establish and build up inter-parliamentary delegations with Iran in order to enter into dialogue with that country is something to be welcomed. During its preparatory stages, many sensitive issues will have to be addressed and stipulations made. As we have just heard, the Iranian Government has, in recent years, acceded to a number of UN Conventions, including that on the rights of the child, and signed up to the Declaration of Human Rights. Changes have also been made to its penal code, and execution by stoning prohibited, although this ban has been inadequately implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that this list does not include the Declaration on the Rights of Women. In this resolution, we highlight the very large gaps in many areas and the inadequate respect for human rights, with particular reference to the imprisonment of women and to arbitrary arrests. The treatment of journalists also leaves much to be desired, and the situation must be improved as a matter of urgency. What is going on in Iran must be carefully investigated and examined, and so there are two points on which I cannot endorse this resolution, and in respect of which I will be moving an oral amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must clearly express what we think joint cooperation means and stick to our principles, whilst also accepting that Iran has its own structures and must itself decide in what way it is to change, difficult though this may often be for us to understand. The only way for us to change anything is not to pass up the chance of a new start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted to learn of the efforts being made to foster dialogue with it, and of the pressure that the European Union is exerting in connection with the state of human rights there. During the fourth dialogue on human rights between the EU and Iran, held on 14 and 15 June 2004 in Teheran, Iran undertook to improve human rights, and that is a good thing, but we can also see that there is an urgent need that something be done about this, for international organisations estimate that every year still sees between 300 and 400 executions carried out, with some 80 people being flogged and an unknown number stoned to death – all this despite, as you have heard, these things no longer, officially, being in the Iranian penal code. What shows how much contempt a government can have for its own people is the relevant article – no. 119 – from the former Iranian penal code, according to which the stones used at a stoning must not be so large that the condemned person dies from the impact of one or two of them, nor so small that they cannot be described as stones.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a thing is torture, legitimised by the state with the intention of causing death, and it has yet to be demonstrated that it is no longer carried out today, at this stage in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has also been made to the human rights of juveniles; although death sentences are pronounced on them, the sentence is not carried out until they are 18. That means that minors aged 14 and over can spend up to four years in what are called ‘education camps’, waiting to be executed, instead of being able to have a proper education and a future to look forward to.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just heard what the UN has had to say on the situation in Iran. I am very glad that the letter sent by the President of this Parliament, Josep Borrell, to the Iranian ambassador has helped to get a stoning, due to be carried out at the end of last year, delayed and the sentence commuted. Let us continue to exert this sort of pressure, for only in that way will we, in the eyes of the world, do justice to our own objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am relieved to learn that the United Kingdom, Germany and France have managed to press on with the negotiations on the atomic energy programme. Above all, I am glad that – as we have just heard – there have been positive responses when we have raised individual cases of grave violations of human rights in Iran. We are evidently being listened to after all, and can hope that our intervention in the human rights sphere can meet with success.</p>
<p class="contents">In this process the European Commission is a partner in negotiation and dialogue, and so it is to them, in the first instance, that I appeal that human rights should not be treated as a secondary issue, but put centre stage in exactly the same way as economic relations with Iran or the issue of how to prevent it acquiring nuclear weapons. I also want to make it clear to our Iranian friends that dialogue and negotiation mean critical dialogue; Iran must listen when we criticise some of the things that go on there and that we cannot accept and never will, such as the maltreatment and oppression of women, the stonings and the executions. I do not see last December’s United Nations resolution as an interruption to this dialogue, but rather as a component of our policy and an admonition to us. It is also, unfortunately, evidence that our concerns about the human rights situation, the restrictions on the freedom of the press and the persecution of journalists are more than justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me once again appeal, as a matter of urgency, to the Iranian authorities to do something more than make announcements and instead cancel the stonings, give women real rights in practice, and offer more than lip-service to what this dialogue is about. We are also very concerned about the accusations levelled at the Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi. I believe that not only all Members of this House, but also the Commission’s and Council’s representatives, are making it plain that we expect her good work not to be hampered in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">Although my group will be voting in favour of the resolution, we will be asking for item 9 to be deleted, as this debate is not the place for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for this, or so we are told, is that Iran has now agreed to allow monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency and has put a stop, for the time being, to the enrichment of uranium. I ask myself how it is that Iran’s stance in the so-called ‘nuclear controversy’ can be the only criterion that the Commission considers when deciding to restart the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still serious problems where human rights are concerned, and every one of the European Union’s trade and cooperation agreements contains unequivocal statements on the human rights chapters on which cooperation depends. The Commission’s attitude gives the impression that human rights have, overnight, ceased to be a problem in Iran. This resolution presses home the point that there has been no improvement in the human rights situation in Iran. Sharia law continues to be imposed with its full rigour; executions, stonings, torture and arbitrary arrests continue day by day. The work of human rights activists and journalists has become even more difficult and even more hazardous; the Nobel Prize winner Shirin Ebadi has again been summoned before a court.</p>
<p class="contents">These facts lead me to regard the European Union as acting utterly deceitfully in resuming negotiations with the Iranian Government at this stage. I appeal both to the Commission and to the Council to take their own demands seriously and not to allow themselves to be bought – in the truest sense of the word. Rather than negotiating with Iran on cooperation in economic policy matters, the European Union should be sitting down with those forces that are actually doing something for democracy, to change Iran, to make it democratic. I think that what Mr Gahler came out with was another attempt at coupling one thing with another, so let me ask him, in plain language, to name one country that behaves in the way Iran does. If we are not to suspend trade relations with Iran, with what country does he want us to suspend them? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Public hangings are now an almost daily spectacle, often involving the execution of children, the mentally handicapped and even pregnant women. Six pregnant women have been executed this year alone. Stoning to death, amputation of limbs, floggings and torture are commonplace.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a fascist regime that has made a farce of democracy and has consigned human rights to the dustbin. Only today the Nobel Peace Prize winner has been summoned to the Office of the Public Prosecutor, which is an outrage. I hope you will write to the Iranian Ambassador and object to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, Maryam Rajavi, the charismatic leader of the Iranian opposition movement, came here to the European Parliament in Strasbourg and told us that the solution in confronting this challenge is neither appeasement nor a military invasion. The Iranian people themselves, through their courageous resistance movement, have the capacity to bring about change. But we have to offer them encouragement. So it is vitally important that we support Article 9 of this resolution which would enable us to look again at the EU terror list which, at the insistence of the mullahs, includes the name of the Iranian resistance, the People's Mujahedin.</p>
<p class="contents">As a major US intelligence investigation recently disclosed, there is no justification for keeping the name of the Mujahedin on the EU terror list. Indeed, by agreeing to this demand from the mullahs, we have given them a further reason to impose the death penalty on supporters of the resistance movement. Right now, three men are awaiting execution in Iran simply because they support the People's Mujahedin. They have been accused of no other crimes but, according to the mullahs' website, the death penalty is justified because the Mujahedin appears on the EU terror list. This is the result of our squalid attempts at appeasement and we must do something to stop it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a particularly positive development in the continuing Paris agreement of November 2004 between France, Germany and Great Britain, on behalf of the European Union, and Iran on the moratorium on uranium enrichment and control of Iranian activities in the nuclear sector.</p>
<p class="contents">These developments confirm the international credibility and the huge political potential of the European Union when it acts as one to resolve important international problems through dialogue and political means.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the negative experience in Iraq and in the face of the unilateral philosophy of the United States, the European Union is in a position to formulate its own alternative proposal on international problems, in close cooperation with the UN and its competent agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The ΕU is Iran's first trading partner, a fact which proves the importance of reinforcing Euro-Iranian relations as a tool in the European strategy for the democratisation of Iran, for respect of its international obligations and for reversing its internalisation and isolation. A balanced policy of, on the one hand, pressure and checks on Iran for the respect of democratic freedoms and human rights and, on the other hand, of incentives to develop relations, is the only effective way of establishing a climate of mutual trust and reversing confrontational outbidding and the unilateral strategic approach to the resolution of regional problems. We must continue to be constant supporters of human rights in Iran, of cooperation with civil society and of dialogue at all levels. Within this framework, the European Parliament must take specific initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the European Union’s main roles is to act as spokesperson for the needs of people in difficulty and to promote human rights, freedom, democracy and tolerance. We therefore all agree on pressing the Iranian authorities to comply with international conventions on the freedom of the press, on the outlawing of torture, and on respect for the rights of children, women and minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The ringing of many alarm bells tells us that the situation on political and social reform is in fact deteriorating rather than making progress. The United Nations, too, expressed growing concern about the situation in its resolution of 21 December 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">We all hope that Iran, a country with plenty of potential and in great cultural turmoil, can become a fully operative economic and political partner as soon as possible. All future trade, however, must be closely matched by careful monitoring of the true social situation in the country and must be made conditional upon the establishment of the required reforms and their effective and unequivocal application. The recommendations that the European Council made in December, which are in line with this approach, therefore need to be put into practice very soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Like the Council, which adopted conclusions on this issue at the end of 2004, the Commission is of the opinion that little progress has been made in the past two years, despite the commitment made by the Government of Iran to strengthen respect for human rights and promote the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Union has decided unanimously to co-sponsor the resolution on the situation of human rights in Iran adopted at the United Nations General Assembly of November 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution expresses serious concern in relation to a number of human rights issues, including the use of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, such as amputation and flogging. At the same time, the resolution recalls the announcement of a ban on torture by the head of the Iranian judiciary in April 2004 and the subsequent passing of related legislation by the Iranian Parliament in May 2004. Those are interesting developments and issues which, together with the recent allegations of torture, warrant being raised directly with our Iranian partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is committed to pursuing the human rights dialogue initiated in December 2002, which remains an important channel for dialogue, not only with influential representatives of the judiciary, but also with Iranian civil society. I would also like to highlight the visits undertaken by a number of United Nations special rapporteurs to Iran since our human rights dialogue opened. That is quite remarkable in a country which previously had remained closed to United Nations visits for 16 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to recall that following the positive developments on the nuclear front, the European Union is currently in the process of resuming talks with the Iranian Government on trade, investment and economic issues. These talks will provide an opportunity to highlight once again to our Iranian partners that all the relevant issues – political, nuclear, trade and human rights – are mutually inter-linked.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in favour of constructive engagement with Iran, but that engagement is not synonymous with acting irresponsibly as regards areas of concern that matter so much to Parliament, the European Union and the world at large. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Cambodia, women are the first to become victims of internal political instability. It is a problem which certainly cannot be solved by a discussion on a Thursday afternoon in the Chamber of the European Parliament, but I should nevertheless like to draw your attention to a broader phenomenon in this part of the world - sex tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about the abuse of children and women, we must have the courage also to talk about men, for it is men who bear special responsibility for this. Tourism is of course a legitimate activity with its own cultural and educational values. But when tourism is abused, it can destroy the morals and culture of many Asian countries, including Cambodia. This is a moral tsunami, resulting mainly in the abuse of young women and even small children through prostitution and people trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue to address those who are responsible. We must act with resolution. We should persist in confronting all media which are not fighting against the sex industry. The protection of women and children in Cambodia against abuse begins here, with us, in our Member States. The persistence of poverty and the exploitation of people give rise to extreme disquiet.</p>
<p class="contents">Asian women are well aware of their dignity. They wish to support their fundamental cultural values. This awakening is one of the most important signals of our times. But, despite this, poverty and the exploitation of women remain a serious problem throughout Asia. Illiteracy among women is far more widespread than among men and the right to life for female children is subject to far greater risks. The actions of our Member States must above all have regard for the values held by these women and ensure that their cultures are respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the Chai Hour hotel in Phnom Penh, prostitution was taking place and women and girls were forced to take part in it. On the initiative of the AFESIP organisation, 84 of them were freed and were transferred to that organisation’s refuge. The pimps were arrested in the same operation. According to our information, the next day the criminals were freed without charge and the same type of activity continued to operate in the hotel.</p>
<p class="contents">In the mean time, a violent group broke into the refuge, took away the women and girls and, undoubtedly, put them back to work as prostitutes.</p>
<p class="contents">So the organisations dedicated to protecting sexually-exploited women and girls, such as AFESIP, are seeing the girls they rescue and try to rehabilitate socially being sold back into prostitution. This process involves threats and often violence against the activists who carry out this work.</p>
<p class="contents">In this particular case, I would like to state that the Socialist Group supports, and calls on Parliament to support, the President of AFESIP, Mrs Somaly Mam, who is in great danger and has had to flee her country, having had her life threatened by the mafias who control this criminal business. It should be noted that Mrs Mam has received significant recognition in Spain, France and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">This impunity is the result of the corruption that is generated as a result of the huge financial profits created by sexual exploitation and people trafficking, and what makes this worse for us is that a large proportion of these profits come from sexual tourism by Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group’s appeal is addressed to the governments of our countries, to tackle sexual tourism and strengthen the fight against the mafias operating within it. We are also addressing our appeal to the Commission and the authorities of the countries in which child and forced prostitution is an everyday reality, such as Cambodia.</p>
<p class="contents">We should urge them, in their relations with those countries, to become involved in combating this type of activity, amongst other things by supporting the organisations involved in rescuing and rehabilitating the victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Cambodia alone, it is estimated that a staggering 8 000 to 100 000 women and children could be caught up in the sex trafficking industry. That is according to a Cambodian Government report. Those figures have increased dramatically since the 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also estimated that the judiciary fails to convict in 94% of the cases brought to court. Prosecutions need to be increased, but must also result in convictions, meaning that corruption has to be stamped out. Often it is the poor who are convicted – a mother selling her daughter, for instance, to put food on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">According to one Cambodia NGO, the police, military police, army and other state personnel are involved in this trade, and are running or protecting trafficking rings and brothels. Traffickers quite often receive assistance from immigration officials. The EU must work with governments and local and international NGOs to put an end to this trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation between Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, is absolutely imperative in order to stop the flow of sex workers across borders. We also need education and training for border police. Sex workers should have access to affordable legal advice so as to increase the conviction rate. Regarding HIV and Aids, prevention is also a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">NGOs need increased funding and assistance, not only for these areas, but also to rehabilitate victims. The EU must continue targeting development aid to the poverty-stricken areas of Cambodia so that young women who escape have an actual alternative and are not lured back into the trade through desperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Over recent weeks, public opinion around the world has been disturbed by reports in the media according to which child victims of the tsunami are being trafficked. What makes this case in Cambodia all the more disconcerting is the fact that it is only by chance that it has reached the public – us in this House – and is, unfortunately, not unsettling people around the world. Nonetheless, where the worldwide trade in women and children is concerned, it is but the tip of the iceberg. I believe that it shows how prevalent corruption is in Cambodia, that the country’s justice system has not been reformed, and that, no matter what the sex industry is up to, the Cambodian Government should have ensured that the pimps were not, within a matter of days, set at liberty to again be a menace to their victims.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also, though, ask ourselves questions about what lies behind this trade. The constant increase in the number of landless people in Cambodia is contributing to an ever-worsening situation, in that these people have no prospects unless they sell their sons and daughters. This is something we have to denounce; this is where we really have to point out where the problem lies and at last bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Cambodian Government, so that nothing like what has happened there can ever happen again. We also have to voice our concern that the committee that has been appointed may well be a mere formality, a sort of sedative pill to calm down the public and us as well. We therefore hope that the debate in this House will prompt others to bring these crimes more to light and to the attention of the world, and to combat them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it has rightly been said that none of this can be a reason to tolerate or accept what is currently happening there, and before our very eyes. What we see going on is a particularly unpleasant form of contemporary – I refuse to call it modern – slavery, in the shape of the sexual exploitation of this country’s women and underaged children. It is, of course, in the first instance, organised crime in Cambodia that bears responsibility for this to a massive degree, but that responsibility is shared by two other bodies, and so I see items 12 and 13 of our resolution as very important.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, on the one hand, the Cambodian Government itself, which must, at long last, ratify and implement the relevant UN Convention and the relevant agreement on the combating, firstly of trafficking in human beings, and secondly of organised crime. It is we, though, in the European Union, who share responsibility to an equal degree. This trade in slaves could not exist in the absence of a market for them; the demand for them comes not exclusively or principally from Asia, but, to a massive degree and not least, from Europe. For that reason, our responsibility is not only to use our foreign policy, security policy and development policy as a means to the end of doing away with this form of slavery; we must also be unrelenting in using all the means with which we, in Europe, combat cross-border crime and fight for our internal security, to hunt down the operators and organisers of this sort of sex tourism, for if we do not, we will have not the least right to point the finger at others. We must start by discharging our own responsibilities in Europe and then press home the point to our Cambodian partners that this is a fundamental human rights issue and one on which we will yield not an inch, and we must be willing not only to give them massive support in building up their justice system, but also, within the EU, to clean our own house. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Dramatic events that can only be described as the unleashing of the elements have however been happening on a day-to-day basis for many years, with such events being primarily a source of physical evil. By way of contrast, a person without a conscience or moral principles may cause much greater harm by insulting the dignity of human beings and making it impossible to live in the fullness of humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">We have witnessed both moral and spiritual destruction for many years in the countries of Southern Asia and in Cambodia, the country we are debating today. This destruction can be seen particularly clearly in the treatment of women and young children, who are forced into prostitution, taken away to work in warehouses, factories or on rubber plantations or sold for profit. Such treatment is plainly an insult to human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">According to overall estimates, over 2 million people are sold in this region every year, and trade in children ranks third in terms of profitability for the criminal world, after drugs trafficking and arms trading. According to such estimates and the UN’s reports, in Cambodia it is particularly difficult to combat the trade in women and children or their sexual exploitation, as both the police and the authorities are corrupt and accept large bribes from rich and depraved tourists. Exploitation of this kind is a barbaric form of modern slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 60% of women and young girls are forced into prostitution, and the majority of them are either infected with HIV or suffering from AIDS. The most obvious cause for this is poverty, or rather destitution, as in this region almost one quarter of the population, a population which amounts for one third of the world’s inhabitants, live on less than one dollar a day. In circumstances such as these, millions of women and children are forced into life-threatening work and tricked with promises of legal employment. This results in their sale and export abroad as slaves. There, they are exploited not only for work, but also for various deviant practices, including sexual practices, paedophilia and child pornography. Another cause is illiteracy and the Communist ideology of the Khmer Rouge, who attempted to build a new society by means of terror, threats and lies, claiming over a million victims in the process. After years under Pol Pot’s rule, both the country and its health service and medical care infrastructures were left entirely destroyed, and millions of children who had lost their parents were left without anything to live on. Unfortunately, over the past few years the state has also moved towards economic liberalism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not insignificant that liberal destruction of the family and the much-lauded utilitarian and hedonistic model of life are characteristic even of those who help humanitarian non-governmental organisations, some of whom accept a shameful form of payment in kind for this help by exploiting women and children sexually. It is for this reason that this House’s resolutions and debates will do little to improve the situation, as even educated people in high-ranking positions mock the sanctity of the human being and the family. It is not only financial aid and the much-praised market economy that are needed, but above all moral renewal and ethical principles. I thank you.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Potočnik,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission resolutely condemns all forms of trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation, especially of children. The Commission fully shares the concerns of the Members of the European Parliament about the existence and the extent of human trafficking in Cambodian citizens. It is particularly revolting that the perpetrators of this evil crime focus their attention on the poorest of the poor in one of the least-developed countries of south-east Asia, where the high level of poverty and the limited capacity of the national agencies, as well as local corruption and collusion, make it easier for them to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">These conditions have facilitated the development of trafficking of migrant workers for economic exploitation, the trafficking of women - both inside Cambodia and across its borders - for prostitution, and the trafficking of children for prostitution, begging and illegal adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s cooperation activities in Cambodia are directed ultimately at reducing poverty but are also designed to reflect the EU’s commitment to human rights and democracy, including equal treatment for men and women and the protection of children. More specifically, under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, the Commission has already committed almost EUR 1.9 million to UNICEF and Action by Churches Together/DanChurchAid in support of two large programmes to secure legal protection for children in Cambodia, as well as funds to support the development of local human rights NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the Commission’s programming document for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for 2005 and 2006 for Campaign 2, called 'Fostering a culture of human rights', for which Cambodia is eligible, it is planned to address the issue of trafficking in children and women. The campaign will also promote the rights of human rights defenders. It will improve the protection of, and raise awareness about, the situation of those who work, at personal risk, to advance human rights through non-violent means, taking into account the recommendations of paragraph 13 of the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Royal Government of Cambodia has recently taken a number of positive initiatives to address the problem, including the signature of memoranda of understanding with Thailand on trafficking in women and children and on the management of migrant labour between the two countries, participation in the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative against Trafficking and the establishment of a Department of Anti-Human Trafficking in the Ministry of Interior in 2002. I very much welcome these important initiatives and I have no doubt that these initiatives will also be welcomed by the Members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">But the practical realities and the evident difficulty of implementing these measures have been drawn to the attention of all of us by the recent events involving the NGO AFESIP, which has received support from Spain, the UK and the Commission. These events have rightly given renewed concern to all of us. The Member State embassies in Phnom Penh and the EC Delegation reacted immediately with a statement, calling for a full investigation and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">On 12 December, the government announced the establishment of an inter-Departmental Commission to inquire into the events. The Member State embassies in Phnom Penh and the EC Delegation joined other donors in a further statement to welcome this announcement and to express the hope that the conclusions of the inquiry would be credible and transparent. I can assure you that the EC Delegation to the Kingdom of Cambodia, in collaboration with the Member States' missions in the country, will follow closely the progress of the government inquiry and will continue to report on developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, the Council welcomed the Commission's intention to launch an Election Observation Mission as announced by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner on 22 November 2004 and which will be headed by former French Prime Minister M. Rocard, currently Member of the European Parliament. The Honourable Parliamentarian is kindly asked to enquire all further details of EU support to these elections directly from the Commission. Besides election observation and election support, the Council Presidency as well as the High Representative conduct continuous contacts with all relevant parties and partners at all levels in order to ensure that these elections will be organised in accordance with international standards and facilitated by Israel as called for by the Council on 22/23 November 2004.</p>
<p>It also recalls the Presidency Conclusions, adopted on the occasion of the meeting of the European Council met in Brussels on 16/17 December last, in which it states that the EU will support the electoral process financially, technically and politically, and its observer mission - in liaison with other members of the Quartet and of the international community - will help to verify that the electoral process is democratic, free and fair. The European Council also welcomes and supports the Palestinian Authority’s intention to hold legislative and local elections.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0529"></a>

<p>(EN)The Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament of 9 June 2004 entitled "The European Union and Iraq - A Framework for Engagement" was endorsed by the European Council on 17 June last. At the same time the European Council endorsed the joint letter from the Secretary General / High Representative for the CFSP and the Commission setting out further areas for engagement.</p>
<p>The objective of the EU is a secure, stable, unified, prosperous and democratic Iraq. The Council supports the transitional process in Iraq including elections in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1546. Accordingly support for elections has been an important element in the EU's assistance to Iraq. The European Council, at the occasion of its meeting in Brussels on 16/17 December 2004, reaffirmed this objective and reiterated its determination to support the Iraqi authorities and people, i.e. through election support, financing of UN protection, reconstruction assistance, strengthening the criminal justice sector and promoting respect for the rule of law, and developing political and trade cooperation with Iraq. It finally emphasized the importance of a broad, inclusive political process for the general elections in January 2005.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, substantial support for the elections has been provided mainly through the election cluster of the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) which is administered by the UN. The UN has a major role in supporting the Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq (IECI) in organising the elections. The Community is also providing training for 150 domestic observers as well as expertise to the UN and the IECI in Amman and Baghdad.</p>
<p>The total amount allocated by the Community will be € 31.5 million Euro, to which it is worth noting that several Member States are contributing additional funds in support of the elections, on a bilateral basis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0533"></a>

The international network of NGOs in Europe and Belarus has made it possible for children to travel to various countries to convalesce.

<p>Unjustified price rises in the European Union primarily affect the living standards of the poorest social groups and of citizens of the poorer Member States with low national incomes, making it difficult to achieve the Union's social objectives. These practices are made possible by pricing agreements between producers and vendors and between service providers on local, regional, national, European and world markets. A typical example would be the fact that fuel prices rise as oil prices go up, but generally do not go down as oil prices fall, and this is particularly relevant at a time when the dollar, in which oil purchases are calculated, falls against the euro. Among those who have benefited from changing oil prices are multinational concerns, most of them non- European, which have significantly increased their income over the last year. Similar price raising mechanisms operate in many of our countries. Only cheap products and services can lead to an increase in the living standards of the poorest social groups.</p>

Taking advantage of these subsidies, the lower cost of production in neighbouring countries and the non-existence of import duties, many undertakings have left Greece, so that their products are no longer produced in Greece, leading to the loss of thousands of jobs and the exploitation of the cheap labour force in Bulgaria through very low wages.</p>

<p>(FR)The Council shares the honourable Member’s concerns with regard to the social effects of relocations by industrial groups that have received significant public subsidies at national level. In this regard, and in general terms, it would remind the honourable Member of the resolution it adopted in December 2001 on the social responsibility of companies, which emphasises the ways in which they can thereby make a positive contribution, both to the implementation of the European employment and social cohesion strategies and to the sustainable development strategy. Within this context, the Council has already stressed the importance of involving the Commission, the Member States and social partners in the promotion of initiatives and innovations in this field. Within the framework of the implementation of the European social agenda, the Nice European Council of 7, 8 and 9 December 2000 urged the Commission, in order to enhance companies’ social responsibility, to involve them in the creation of an effective partnership with social partners, NGOs, local authorities and social service management organisations. In this regard, the European Council indicated the methods to be followed in order to anticipate and take advantage of the change in the work environment by creating a new balance between flexibility and security. The Council would urge the honourable Member to ask the Commission about the practical measures taken in this regard.</p>
<p>With regard specifically to the public subsidies mentioned in the question, the Council would point out that they fall within national competence and that their compatibility with Community legislation is monitored by the Commission. Hence, it is not the responsibility of the Council to guarantee controls or penalise the behaviour of companies receiving those subsidies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Luxembourg Presidency intends to deal with the issue of restructuring – and in particular its consequences for employment and the new opportunities which may arise from it – at the informal meeting of Employment Ministers scheduled for 7, 8 and 9 April 2005.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council would remind the honourable Member that, last May, the Commission produced a communication on the social dimension of globalisation, following the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

<p>(FR)The Council is very much aware of the threat posed by climate change as brought about by man-made emissions of "greenhouse" gases. The EU has made commitments in the context of the Kyoto Protocol to reduce emissions by greenhouse gases by 8% in 2008-2012 compared to emissions in 1990.</p>
<p>A new system for emissions trading will be starting from January 2005 and a number of actions are being taken to reduce the use of fossil fuels, e.g. by developing alternative sources for energy or improving energy efficiency. Climate change is a global problem and needs a global approach. The EU is a leading actor in the context of the UN Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol will enter into force on 16 February 2005. Discussions on actions after 2012 will be initiated in 2005. According to recent scientific work the emissions may need to be reduced in the order of 15-50% in a long-term perspective to keep the climate change at 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p>(EN)As the Honourable Member will recall, the Council adopted, on 26 October 2004, a Regulation establishing the European Agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders of the Member States of the European Union, which will become operational as of 1 May 2005. This Agency will ensure the operational coordination of Member States' activities at the external borders, including the Atlantic Coast.</p>
<p>Currently, two Sea Borders Centres exist within the framework of the Strategic Committee on Immigration, Frontiers and Asylum to coordinate joint operations and measures at sea and ports. These two Centres are the so-called Western and Eastern Sea Border Centres, located respectively in Spain and Greece. These Centres will become specialised branches of the European External Borders Agency as of 1 May 2005.</p>
<p>Furthermore, "The Hague Programme", adopted by the European Council on 4 and 5 November 2004, recognises the need for a better management of the migration flows in order to avoid the humanitarian tragedies that take place in the Mediterranean as a result of attempts to enter the EU illegally and it welcomes the initiatives by Member States for cooperation at sea, particularly for rescue operations.</p>
<p>Taking into account that the control and surveillance of the external borders fall under the responsibility of national border authorities, the European Council invited the Council to establish teams of national experts that can provide rapid technical and operational assistance to Member States that request it, following the proper risk analysis of the European External Borders Agency.</p>
<p>As regards maritime safety, the Council would like to highlight the fact that it adopted a Regulation establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency on 27 June 2002. This new Agency, created after the Erika disaster, contributes to the enhancement of the overall maritime safety system in the Community in order to reduce the risk of maritime accidents, marine pollution from ships and the loss of human lives at sea.</p>
<p>This Agency is tasked, among other activities, in assisting the Commission in the performance of any task assigned to the Commission by existing and future Community legislation on maritime safety and ship pollution prevention, notably legislation applicable to classification societies, the safety of passenger ships, as well as that applicable to safety training, certification and watchkeeping of ship's crews.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0544"></a>

<p>At his hearing before the European Parliament, the new Commissioner responsible for transport, Mr Jacques Barrot, said that one of the main objectives of the common transport policy through to 2010 was to devise and develop a comprehensive approach to transport safety and security (to combat accidents and terrorism) and stressed that the initial anti-terrorist security measures taken in the sea and air transport sectors should be reinforced and extended to the other transport sectors.</p>
<p>In the light of these events and the commitments given by the new Commissioner, does the Council intend to ask the Commission to take initiatives and propose practical measures to ensure the security and safety of all forms of transport and, in particular, road transport against such criminal or terrorist acts?

<p>(FR)The issue of security of the transport system has become an ever more important issue on the agenda of both the European Union and its Member States after the attacks of 11 September 2001 and March 2004. Transport constitutes a highly risky and vulnerable sector, given the fact that it supports complex economic and social relations and implies a high volume of passengers and goods likely to be the victims of terrorist acts.</p>
<p>The European Council acknowledged on 25 March 2004 the importance of this issue in its Declaration on Combating Terrorism and endorsed a revised Action Plan to combat terrorism, which includes in particular the security of the transport system. In its conclusions of 17 December 2004 it called for the establishment of a European Programme for critical infrastructure protection before the end of 2005.</p>
<p>In order to fulfil this task the Commission is preparing a study, which aims at identifying the infrastructure to be considered "security critical" at European level and suggesting supplementary measures which are necessary to increase the protection of these infrastructures against possible terrorist acts..

<p>(FR)The Council would recall that Israel is one of the European Union's partners in the Euro-Mediterranean process launched in Barcelona in 1995, one of the merits of which is that it seeks to promote a climate conducive to rapprochement between Israel and its Arab neighbours. The fundamental objective of the Barcelona Process is the establishment, on the basis of dialogue and exchange, of an area of peace, stability and prosperity. One important element thereof is the establishment of a free-trade area through the conclusion of bilateral association agreements. The Union has negotiated association agreements with all its partners: the agreements with Algeria and Lebanon are in the final ratification phase, while the agreement with Syria has recently been initialled. The agreement with Israel entered into force in 2000.</p>
<p>The Council emphasises on every occasion that respect for human rights and democratic principles constitutes an essential element in bilateral relations between Israel and the European Union. The Council is convinced that dialogue on these fundamental principles must be maintained and intensified. The suspension of a contractual relationship should constitute a measure of last resort so that the dialogue structure established by the agreement is not lost. That is why the Council welcomes the fact that, at the most recent meeting of the Association Council, which was held on 13 December 2004, Israel subscribed to some very specific commitments in connection with the Action Plan drawn up as part of the new good neighbour policy. The European Union will be closely monitoring the implementation of those commitments, since that will determine progress in other sectors.</p>
<p>The Council remains convinced that – as has been expressly recognised, including by Israel – the role played by the European Union, as a member of the Quartet, in stabilising its immediate environment implies that the dialogue structures, particularly those proceeding from the Association Agreement, should be maintained.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0554"></a>

<p>(FR)The Council would like, first of all, to stress the importance of OLAF’s operations in cooperation with the Member States. It considers them to be an essential element in the enhancement of the protection of the Community’s financial interests and the fight against fraud.</p>
<p>While the Council takes note of the honourable Member’s concerns, it would like to point out that OLAF has only recently been created.</p>
<p>On examining the first assessment report on OLAF’s activities, which the Commission produced in 2003, the Council indicated, in particular, the great emphasis the regulations place on the carrying out of internal and external administrative investigations and urged OLAF to take the appropriate measures in order to better organise these. To this end, it stressed the importance of OLAF’s creating internal procedures providing for the methods for implementing actions and measures relating to internal and external investigations. Furthermore, the Council has also stressed the importance of respect for the rules relating to the protection of fundamental rights.</p>
<p>Within this context, the Council would point out that OLAF is responsible for its own internal organisation.</p>
<p>As it has always done, the Council will continue to monitor OLAF’s operation very closely. In this regard, the Council is pleased with the Commission's proposed modification of Regulation No 1073/1999 on the investigations carried out by OLAF.

<p>(FR)The fifth enlargement comprising the ten new Member States as well as Bulgaria and Romania constitutes the biggest ever enlargement. The EU has responded to the challenges these countries have been facing and are still facing in coping with the legacy of the past and reforming their political, social and economic systems through the creation of several pre-accession instruments. Funding under these instruments has been increased over time, more recently for Bulgaria and Romania, following the Copenhagen European Council conclusions of 12 and 13 December 2002. The European Council decided that the high level of funding should be used in a flexible way, targeting the priorities identified, including in key areas such as Justice and Home Affairs. The EU continues to provide guidance to Bulgaria and Romania in their pre-accession work through the Accession Partnerships, which form the basis for programming pre-accession assistance from Community funds. In particular, the nature and dimension of the modernisation and restructuring needs of Romania call for the EU's financial assistance to support this country in its efforts. The total volume of pre-accession assistance available to Romania for 2004 (around €825 million) is substantial and increasing: it represents a very important financial resource for Romania, equal to around 1.4% of GDP.</p>
<p>Croatia is a candidate for accession, and accession negotiations will be opened in March 2005 provided that there is full cooperation with ICTY. Very recently, the Council, following the opinion given by the European Parliament, adopted a Regulation that will provide for the extension of the pre-accession financial instruments to Croatia from 2005 and the allocation of a certain amount of funds to Croatia under and within the limits of the current financial perspective. The pre-accession strategy for Croatia is aimed at promoting the Copenhagen political criteria, helping Croatia to align with the acquis, strengthening administrative and judicial capacity, preparing for Structural Funds and contributing to the sustainable adaptation of the agricultural sector. The regional dimension of Community assistance to the Western Balkans is receiving special attention through funding under the CARDS Regulation, and Croatia remains eligible for projects and programmes with a regional dimension.</p>
<p>The European Council on 16 and 17 December 2004 concluded that, also in the light of the Commission Report and Recommendation, Turkey sufficiently fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria to open accession negotiations provided that it fulfils certain specific requirements. Currently, pre-accession assistance to Turkey is governed by a financial instrument adopted in 2001. As has been the case for other candidate countries, assistance for Turkey from the European Union is focused on the priorities arising from the Accession Partnership. Financial assistance to Turkey is substantial (the 2004 Programme consists of an allocation of €235.6 million for the National Programme). In its Recommendation on Turkey, the Commission furthermore indicates that, in the context of the next financial perspective, the Commission will propose an increase in the amounts to be allocated to Turkey.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that the Council is currently examining a set of Commission proposals with a view to improving the effectiveness of the EU external aid. One of these proposals aims at setting up a new Instrument for Pre-accession assistance (IPA) that would replace the existing pre-accession instruments from 2007 onwards.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0565"></a>

<p>(EN)The proposal for a new capital requirements framework has been subject to an unprecedented level of consultation and impact analysis. The question of the financing of SMEs and the application of the framework to banks of all shapes and sizes have been central to the work carried out, over more than five years, to develop this new framework.</p>
<p>At the request of the European Council the Commission has had a study carried out by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) into the consequences of the new framework for the European Economy and SMEs. As the Member indicates this report concludes that there will be no adverse effect on the majority of SMEs deriving from the new framework. This stems from several aspects of the new framework: significantly lower charges for retail lending and a discount for loans to small companies. Moreover, following some recommendations in this report, the Commission has introduced into its proposal special rules for venture capital financing.</p>
<p>The PwC report looks at the implementation costs of the new framework. While such estimates are by no means an exact science, the report gauges that ‘Basel 2’ implementation costs for the EU are likely to be moderate. In addition the investment required will fall over several years, as many banks have already started their preparations.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the new framework is specifically designed to reflect industry best practice in risk-measurement and –management. Accordingly, many of the investment costs to comply with the new framework are costs that banks would in any event be incurring.</p>
<p>On the question of transparency of banks’ rating systems, it will be important that SMEs – and indeed borrowers generally – continue to have the information that they need in order to obtain timely and appropriate access to loans and other forms of financing. In order to help achieve this, the Commission will publish a ‘Guide to Basel 2’ for SMEs in the first quarter of 2005, and has started a series of one-day dissemination seminars on Basel II to help SMEs and industry organisations to understand the changes that will occur as a result of the Basel II. The Commission has also carried out an exercise on a voluntary code of conduct between credit institutions and SMEs<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> upon request of the Industry Council. This however has not achieved consensus.</p>
<p>In relation to the amount and detail of disclosure by banks – and as is the case at present – it is an important question of balance.</p>
<p>Banks will obviously have to make clear to SMEs the data and information that they (the banks) need in order to process applications for loans and finance. This is simply a necessary part of banks’ credit-granting activities.</p>
<p>There are also disclosure requirements in the directive concerning description of banks’ internal rating processes – including the definitions, methods, data and assumptions upon which the process is based. This will provide important transparency as to the methods used.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the rules which are proposed in the new framework are sufficient and balanced.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The proliferation of hedge funds remains one of the most striking developments in the international asset management industry in recent years. Hedge Funds increasingly attract investment from pension funds and life insurance schemes. Furthermore, in some countries there are moves to allow the retailing of hedge fund products, particularly of funds of hedge funds to small investors.</p>
<p>Hedge funds are now active in many EU-jurisdictions, although primarily targeted to wealthy and institutional investors, and only to some extent to retail investors. The listing of a few funds-of-hedge-funds makes it easier for retail investors to have access to alternative investment products.</p>
<p>Until recently, the majority of Member States have not allowed the distribution of hedge funds to retail investors, by means of specific legislation preventing unauthorised funds from being distributed on anything but a private basis or by means of tax legislation. Some Member States (France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg) have developed (or are considering) a national legislative framework, using the freedom to regulate on a national basis those non-Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) products. For the moment, by their very nature, hedge funds can not be accommodated by the UCITS framework. Although the UCITS III Directive allows the use of derivatives in UCITS funds, short selling, leverage and closed-ended structure are still restricted.</p>
<p>Until today, there was no strong demand from the industry to have access to an EU-wide market. The growth in the hedge funds industry (and the induced-risk for financial stability) and the “retailisation” of its investor base have raised the question of whether an EU-framework is needed. Before an EU-regime can be put in place, there must be a demonstrable case that a fragmented national approach prevents this area of asset management from developing optimally or that it fails to address cross-border dimension of risks arising from this activities of hedge funds and their managers (systemic risk falling on EU-regulated counterparties which act in the single market; protection of investors who may easily invest in a listed funds-of-hedge-funds; etc.).</p>
<p>The Parliament report (rapporteur: John PURVIS) makes a valuable contribution to this discussion. However, the Commission notes that some of the basic issues associated with operation of hedge funds in Europe are common to a wide range of other types of collective investment vehicles, including private equity funds. The Commission needs a global vision of the optimal treatment of these different types of activity from a European perspective rather than a product-by-product approach. The latter risks creating inconsistencies, artificial classifications and scope for regulatory arbitrage. This view was endorsed by the report of the expert group on asset management in June. Thus, the Commission’s view would be that these fundamental structural issues concerning the appropriate treatment of hedge funds from a European regulatory perspective should be addressed as part of the wider review of the functioning of the EU UCITS Directives which is foreseen for mid-2005. The UCITS review would be the best tool to consider the need for an EU-framework for hedge funds and to strike a risk-benefits balance of any proposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0551"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission is well aware of the concerns that the proposed Directive on services in the Internal Market may lead to “social dumping” as pointed out by the Honourable Member. However, the Commission does not think there is any reason to fear this, as explained in its answers to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0515_EN.html">H-0515/04</a> by Mr De Rossa and oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0528_EN.html">H-0528/04</a> by Mr Crowley.</p>
<p>First, the proposed Services Directive does not affect the existing Community acquis, namely the Posted Workers’ Directive from 1996, which precisely aims to prevent “social dumping”. The Proposal provides that posted workers, including temporary workers, enjoy a number of important protective provisions concerning working conditions in force in the Member State where the worker is posted. This Directive will continue to apply in full. Therefore, companies will not be able to use this proposal in order to establish themselves, for instance, in low wage countries in order to circumvent the social protection workers would enjoy in the host Member State. This also means, for instance, that companies from another Member State must abide by the health and safety rules in the host country, e.g., regarding the way the workplace must be organised, scaffolding erected, requirements as to protective gear, etc. This concerns not only working conditions laid down by law but also those laid down by certain collective agreements.</p>
<p>Secondly, the proposed Directive reinforces the control of posted workers because it establishes a system of cooperation between Member States and obliges the country of origin of the service provider to assist the authorities of the host Member State in the supervision of working conditions.</p>
<p>The proposal will also allow for more effective control of the real place of establishment of companies, that is, the place where the company has its infrastructure from which it pursues its economic activity in effective terms.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission believes that the proposed Directive will not increase the risk of “social dumping” and will, on the contrary, help to prevent “social dumping”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0564"></a>

<p>In view of the efforts that those countries find themselves having to make to overcome these obstacles, and of the increasing importance of the region to the EU, especially owing to the growing geopolitical role it is playing in our security policy and in the balances with Russia and the United States, could the Commission indicate what concrete measures it intends to sponsor, in the forthcoming action plan envisaged for the European Council in March, to move on from the current cooperation system to a closer partnership, especially as regards political stability and security. Will it work on the relations the EU maintains with the Caucasus, reinforcing its role in region and enlarging the scope of interactions to include a Black Sea dimension, which would also involve the candidate countries, other members of the New European Neighbourhood and the Russian Federation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission continues its work on the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) Country Reports for all three countries of the Southern Caucasus, i.e. Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. They are intended to provide a clear picture of the situation in terms of progress in political and economic reforms and also conflict settlement. The Commission intends to present these reports to the Council in March 2005. On this basis and for each of the three countries, the Council will then decide whether and when to prepare ENP Action Plans with those countries.</p>
<p>Prejudging the concrete cooperation measures under the ENP could seem premature, as the Country Reports are indeed yet to be finalised and no decision has been taken as of yet to establish Action Plans. Still, the Commission takes good note of the comments made by the EP, and you shall rest assured that we will continue to work on further developing and strengthening our relations with the region.</p>
<p>Commitment from both sides remains key, as the strong political will of the partner countries as well will be an essential condition for making this policy a success.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the EC continues to provide substantial support to the partner countries of the South Caucasus. To name but a few examples, the Commission could cite its deep involvement in the reform of the judiciary in Azerbaijan and Georgia, our support for institutional, legal and administrative reform in Armenia, or our rehabilitation efforts in those parts of Georgia affected by “frozen conflicts” (South Ossetia and Abkhazia).</p>
<p>The Commission continues to work closely together with the EU Special Representative to the South Caucasus, Ambassador Talvitie, whose main task is to support conflict settlement efforts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0571"></a>

<p>(EN)With the historic enlargement of the Union on 1 May 2004, Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus have become its direct neighbours. The coming years will therefore offer to the Union great potential for further deepening its relationship. The Commission in particular recalls the importance of civil society in promoting democratisation, as highlighted in the course of the recent presidential elections in Ukraine. Speaking to the Parliament on 1 December, the Commission confirmed its intention to persist with the support to democratisation and civil society in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Union has launched the European Neighbourhood Initiative which sets ambitious objectives for enhanced co-operation in a broad number of areas based on clear commitments to shared values and effective implementation of political, economic and institutional reforms.</p>
<p>To this end, the EU has adopted action plans that have been agreed with the partner countries setting out benchmarks for its cooperation. The Commission should underline that a significant number of the precise steps outlined in these plans concern commitments to enhance human rights in the countries concerned. Ensuring the respect for freedom of association and fostering the development of civil society are important components in this process. The question of support for the promotion of civil society in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, raised by the honoured parliamentarian, is in this perspective all the more pertinent.</p>
<p>While democratisation activities can be financed under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIHDR), it is important to recall that the main bulk of support in this area is provided under the bilateral instrument, Tacis. In order to make effective use of Commission’s limited resources, EIDHR support will only intervene to complement the Tacis assistance.</p>
<p>The EIDHR is particularly well suited for lending support to small-scale civil society projects. As concerns for instance Ukraine, the Commission between 2002 and 2004 allocated some 1,7 Mio € under the EIDHR for micro-projects to local NGOs. Out of this sum, a majority of the actions focussed on civil society enhancement and capacity building. Additional support under the EIHDR for actions in Moldova, Ukraine and Belarus has been foreseen for 2005-2006. Particular attention will be paid to the situation of local human rights defenders as well as promotion of freedom of expression and the media.</p>
<p>With respect to Belarus, the EU is exploring ways to further intensify its efforts with regard to assistance in order to meet the challenges arising from the self-isolation of Belarus. In view of the numerous administrative barriers for direct civil society support, the Commission is at present channelling support to OSCE actions implemented by ODIHR in Belarus.</p>
<p>The Commission will, in cooperation with Member States, be organising a workshop in Vilnius in March. The main objective of this meeting will be to co-ordinate assistance to democratisation and civil society in Belarus.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0543"></a>

<p>(EN)On 26th October 2004 the Council has adopted a Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, which will be operational on 1<span class="sup">st</span> May 2005.</p>
<p>The agency has been created in view of improving the integrated management of the external borders; it shall facilitate and render more effective the implementation of the Schengen acquis in this area, thus contributing to an efficient, high and uniform level of control on persons and surveillance of the external borders.</p>
<p>The Agency is in particular entrusted with the coordination of operational cooperation between Member States in field of the management of external borders as regards the movement of persons, including the organisation of joint operations and pilot projects at the external borders and inter alia in the Atlantic coast mentioned by the Hon. Member of the Parliament.</p>
<p>In addition, the Hague Programme invites the Council to establish teams of national experts that can provide rapid technical and operational assistance to Member States requesting it, acting within the framework of the Agency.</p>
<p>In 2007 the role and the functioning of the Agency will be subject to an evaluation. The Hague Programme requests the Commission in particular to review the tasks of the Agency and to assess whether the Agency should concern itself with other aspects of border management, including enhanced cooperation with customs services and other competent authorities for goods-related security matters, and the feasibility of the creation of a European system of border guards.</p>
<p>Without prejudice to these future developments, the Commission is currently considering the creation of a system of risk management in relation to goods traffic, which will give a high level of protection at all points of the external frontier. It would be possible to integrate criteria relating to specific geographical areas into this system of risk management.</p>
<p>As regards maritime safety, the Commission has taken all the necessary measures in order to ensure the setting up of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), created by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002. This Agency must support Member States and the Commission in the implementation of Community law, by monitoring this implementation and evaluating the effectiveness of the measures in place.</p>
<p>In addition, EMSA ensures the management of the Community traffic follow-up and information system developed by the Commission in accordance with Directive 2002/59/CE<span class="sup"> </span>of the Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system. This system establishes an information exchange platform between Member State maritime administrations and therefore allows to identify vessels navigating in Community waters and to know their movements and cargo. This Directive also lays down operational provisions regarding interventions in case of marine incidents and the establishment of places of refuge for ships in distress.</p>
<p>As concerns the response to ecological disasters, when a major disaster occurs, the affected State can get immediate assistance through the Community mechanism to facilitate reinforced cooperation in civil protection assistance interventions, established under Council Decision 2001/792/EU, Euratom of 23 October 2001. The mechanism is open to the 25 Member States, the three EEA countries Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, and the candidate countries. The assistance which can thus be readily made available covers all types of emergencies, including ecological disasters.</p>
<p>In order to support via the Community mechanism the pollution response actions of Member States in case of accidental or deliberate pollution caused by ships, the Regulation setting up the EMSA has been modified in view to confer to the Agency new tasks. It can involve, if necessary, operational assistance to Member States concerned with specialised additional means.</p>
<p>In addition, the European satellite radio navigation system GALILEO will be very useful for the monitoring of vessels, search and sea rescue. It will offer more precise and reliable services than current GPS, and in particular, a “search and rescue” service that will improve considerably current international humanitarian search and rescue system COSPAS-SARSAT.</p>
<p>Finally, the issue of a possible strengthening of the cooperation among the Member States within the Community in order to ensure ability to rapidly respond to problems of trafficking and ecological disasters and provide an efficient and coordinated search and rescue service at sea would also be considered in the Green Paper on the Maritime Policy, which should be published by the Commission by the end of the first semester of 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0549"></a>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>In July 2004, the Commission proposed a change to the current solidarity mechanism in the common visa policy (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2004&amp;nu_doc=0437">COM(2004)0437</a>/final). The proposal envisages the Commission entering into negotiations with those third countries which do not apply the principles of reciprocity to specific EU Member States.</p>
<p>Relations with the United States are, in this respect, of particular concern, as they have visa requirements for 10 of the EU Member States.</p>
<p>In the light of the above proposal, what view should be taken of the skill and credibility of the Commission in negotiations with the United States? Have talks to date brought about any results?</p>
<p>Is it not essential for Commissioner Franco Frattini, who very recently declared the need for good transatlantic relations, to solve this thorny problem, particularly as it appears so trivial against a background of such vital issues in relations with the USA as the fight against terrorism?</p>
<p>Can we expect from the Commission a plan of action with clear deadlines for the removal of visas by the USA, using as a point of reference the process of assessing the preparedness of the new Member States for membership of the Schengen Area (a process which should be set in motion at the beginning of 2006)?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission considers reciprocity to be an essential element of visa policy and its proposed modification of the existing reciprocity mechanism (in visa Regulation No 539/2001) is an illustration of this.</p>
<p>In fact, the Commission notes that this mechanism has never been used in the past, the reason for this being its dangerous quasi-automatic nature: a notification of a case of non-reciprocity automatically leads to the introduction of the visa obligation after 30 days unless the Council decides otherwise. In either case, the Union runs a great political risk: on the one hand, of a serious disruption in relations between the Union and the third country in question; and on the other, a significant denial of solidarity amongst the Member States.</p>
<p>It was therefore necessary to present a proposal aimed at making the mechanism more effective at a time when almost all the new Member States were victims of a situation of non-reciprocity.</p>
<p>In its proposed review, the Commission has been guided by three essential concerns: to ensure that all cases of non-reciprocity are discussed within the appropriate bodies, to end the quasi-automatic nature of the current mechanism and finally to allow for a diplomatic phase of contacts with the third countries responsible for the non-reciprocity with a view to normalising the situation. During this phase, the Commission intends to play a leading role, which is logical from a legal point of view, since the establishment of lists of third countries subject to visas or exempted from that obligation is exclusively a Community competence.</p>
<p>Parliament has been consulted on this proposal and its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is in the process of examining it.</p>
<p>In parallel, the Commission has established a series of contacts with third countries which are exempt from visas by the Member States and which maintain a visa obligation in relation to one or several Member States. In these contacts, the Commission has stressed the importance of reciprocity as one of the criteria underlying the common visa policy and has explained to those third countries that it believes the Member States, linked by this common policy, should be treated in a uniform manner by third countries.</p>
<p>The same position has also been defended in contacts with the United States. The latter, however, take a very different position with regard to admission to their Visa Waiver Programme. They continue to examine each third country individually, on its own merits (taking into account in particular the number of visa refusals and ‘overstayers’, that is to say, people who do not leave the territory after their visa has expired). Nevertheless, the Commission is convinced that the dynamic of accession and in particular the prospect of full participation by the new Member States in the Schengen system by 2007 will help to ensure that the situation evolves in a positive manner. Since the beginning of 2004, the Commission, supported by the Presidency, has systematically raised this issue in all relevant meetings with the United States, and in particular at the EU-United States Summit in June 2004 in Ireland.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission would like to end by emphasising the progress made since 1 May: the number of cases of non-reciprocity has decreased significantly. The efforts made by the Commission are not unrelated to the decisions taken by third countries to extend the visa exemption to nationals from the new Member States. The Commission was determined to continue its efforts in this regard. The Hague programme, adopted by the European Council of 4 and 5 November, now obliges it to do so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0557"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission does not support the establishment of “camps” outside the EU to which asylum seekers who lodged their application in a Member State or at its borders would be transferred. The Commission has not put forward any concrete proposals which would provide for the processing of asylum applications in third countries.</p>
<p>In fact it would not be legally possible to do so since the 1951 Geneva convention and the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits the removal of persons from the territory of a Member State before a decision has been taken on their application for asylum.</p>
<p>In any case, before any externalisation of processing of asylum claims could take place, there are a number of difficult legal, practical and jurisdictional questions to be answered. Any proposed new approaches would also need to respect a number of basic premises, in particular the international legal obligations of Member States: notably the 1951 Refugee Convention, the non-refoulement principle, and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>However, in its conclusions of 4-5 November 2004, the European Council called for a study to be conducted by the Commission, in close consultation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), on this issue. The study must look into the merits, appropriateness and feasibility of joint processing of asylum applications outside EU territory, in complementarily with the Common European Asylum System and in compliance with the relevant international standards.</p>
<p>This study will be complementary to a separate study on the joint processing of asylum applications within the Union.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Commission sees now a broad consensus among Member States on the need for a coordinated and systematic approach to addressing protection issues in the region. In its conclusions of 4-5 November 2004, the European Council welcomed the “Durable Solutions Communication<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>” and invited the Commission to develop EU-Regional Protection Programmes, in partnership with the third countries concerned and in close consultation and cooperation with UNHCR.</p>
<p>In the light of this invitation, the Commission intends to take forward work in this area to define a plan of action by July 2005 and a full EU Regional Protection Programme by December 2005.</p>
<p>The Commission also hopes that, in parallel, the Member States will commit themselves in the implementation of a European resettlement scheme; this would demonstrate the Community’s involvement towards international efforts to find balanced, comprehensive and effective solutions to protracted refugee situations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Member States meeting in the framework of the European Council in December 2003 decided to establish a Human Rights Agency for the European Union.</p>
<p>The Commission has responded by committing itself to submitting a proposal to establish such an Agency. This is foreseen to be adopted in May 2005.</p>
<p>However before tabling this proposal, the Commission considered it important to consult with the Member States, Parliament and civil society, on issues such as the future Agency’s precise tasks, scope of action, priorities, structure etc. Consequently, the Commission launched a wide-ranging public consultation on 25 October 2004 with its Communication on the Fundamental Rights Agency, to which the Honourable Member refers.</p>
<p>As this public consultation is still on-going, the Commission does not, as yet, hold any firm positions regarding the tasks, scope of action or structure of the future Agency. The Commission is open to all suggestions. The public consultation will end with a public hearing on 25 January 2005. Following this, the Commission will carefully analyse all contributions, both written and oral, when preparing a proposal for a Fundamental Rights Agency.</p>
<p>The budgetary implications will depend on the mandate and tasks of the future Agency. No precise proposals on the budget can be made before these issues have been decided. The Commission will include a financial statement with the proposal to establish the Agency following an ex-ante evaluation. Due attention will be paid to the financial perspectives for 2007-2013.</p>
<p>The Commission will be mindful to ensure that there is no overlap with the excellent work carried out by other organisations in the field of human rights, in particular the Council of Europe. It will of course also be important to take into account the human rights policy that has been developed already by the EU and the important role played by the Parliament in this context. The Commission is committed to the development of synergies between all the major players in the promotion of fundamental rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0562"></a>

<p>(FR)The term ‘coastguard’ covers a broad range of public authority activities at sea, including the monitoring of maritime traffic, safeguarding human life at sea, combating pollution, maritime security, and, within the framework of the supervision of the Union’s external borders, the control of illegal immigration.</p>
<p>With regard to the control of persons at external borders, illegal immigration by sea is a constant source of concern and results in many human tragedies.</p>
<p>A first programme for combating this phenomenon was adopted by the Council on 27 November 2003. It contains a series of measures to develop coordination amongst Member States and to promote relations with third countries with a view to better management of migratory flows at source.</p>
<p>A significant proportion of these actions are to be carried out by the Member States. In fact, controlling and monitoring external borders is primarily their responsibility. In particular, they are urged to put in place networks of liaison officers and to develop exchanges of data both amongst their ports and with third country ports.</p>
<p>Other measures are the responsibility of the current centres for the management of maritime borders established in Madrid and Piraeus. In particular, these include completing the inventory of the technical resources available for carrying out joint control actions and research into new more effective resources.</p>
<p>An initial evaluation of the application of this action programme was carried out at the end of 2004. The conclusions that the Council adopted following this evaluation were added to the list of actions to be taken at operational and legislative level.</p>
<p>In the future, an important role will be played by the European Agency for the management of external borders, which will be operational from 1 May 2005. It will be responsible in particular for coordination of tasks and assistance for national authorities, including in the organisation of joint operations, and will also play a significant risk analysis role.</p>
<p>Even though the idea of creating a coastguard service does not appear to have support at the moment, it should be noted that the Hague programme, adopted by the European Council of 4 and 5 November 2004, provides for the deployment of teams of national experts capable of quickly providing technical and operational assistance to Member States requesting it. These teams of experts will act within the framework of the Agency. Furthermore, the Commission is urged to carry out, in 2007, an evaluation of the functioning of the Agency, to re-examine its duties and to analyse whether it should become responsible for other aspects of border management. In particular, the Commission must evaluate the operation of the teams of national experts and, on that basis, the possibility of creating a European system of border guards.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0570"></a>

<p>(EN)Further to proposals of the Commission the Council took two decisions with regard to the Council of Europe Convention on Action against trafficking in human beings. On 28 June 2004, the Council adopted a Decision authorizing the Commission to negotiate the Draft European Convention on combating trafficking in human beings; this Council Decision covers those provisions of the Draft Convention that concern Community law (first pillar). On 25 October 2004, the Council adopted a Common Position on negotiations relating to the Draft European Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings being undertaken in the Council Europe; this Council act covers those provisions of the Draft Convention that concern Title VI of the Treaty on European Union (third pillar).</p>
<p>Further to the Council Decision adopted in June, the Commission negotiated on behalf of the European Community. This Council Decision was adopted on the basis of existing EC legislation, in particular on Council Directive 2004/81EC of 29 April 2004 on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities. The Directive provides for a reflection period allowing the persons concerned to recover in order to take a decision as to whether to cooperate. Furthermore, it includes a number of detailed provisions regulating the treatment of these persons during the reflection period and after the issue of the residence permit (Articles 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12). Consequently, in the negotiations in Strasbourg the Commission aimed at ensuring a level of treatment for victims, who are third country nationals, at least complying with the standards set out in the EC Directive. Taking into account the state of play after the last meeting of the competent committee of the Council of Europe this is likely to be achieved.</p>
<p>As far as third pillar issues are concerned (for example substantive criminal law, criminal proceedings), EU Member States negotiated themselves on the basis of the Common Position adopted by the Council in October 2004. The Common Position aimed at the inclusion in the Convention of provisions facilitating to the maximum extent possible the effective prosecution and punishment of criminal offences related to trafficking in human beings in accordance with relevant legislation under Title IV of the Treaty on European Union, in particular the Council Framework Decision of 19 July 2002 on combating trafficking in human beings. Provisions on criminal proceedings should address the special needs of women and children who have or may become victims of trafficking in human beings. Furthermore, the Common Position aimed at promoting the involvement of victim support systems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0499"></a>

Why? Furthermore, it is proposed to appoint four fishing industry representatives, without voting rights, as part of the administrative board.

<p>(EN)Following introductory presentations by the Commission in Council and Parliament the Council held a policy debate in October 2004 on the Commission proposal to establish a Community Fisheries Control Agency as a key part of the EU drive to improve compliance with the fisheries rules under the 2002 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. Work on the proposal will continue in the Council working groups in January 2005 and in the European Parliament, whose opinion is foreseen for February 2005.</p>
<p>As its title suggests, the work performed by the Agency will be in the area of control. Any involvement in research will be solely related to control issues.</p>
<p>The agency will also play an important role in combating illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing. It will provide support to the Member States not only in Community waters but also in relation to fisheries agreements concluded with non-EU countries. It will also be active on the high seas under international control and inspection schemes agreed within the framework of regional fisheries organisations such as the North West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC).</p>
<p>Following the decision of 13 December 2003 made by the Council meeting at Heads of State or government level, it became necessary for the Commission to draw up a proposal by March 2004. Given such a short period of time it was not possible to undertake the feasibility study before such a proposal was presented, as was originally planned.</p>
<p>The agency will be concerned with operational matters that directly affect those engaged in fishing. It is therefore appropriate that they will be represented on the Administrative Board. It is important that this body does not become too unwieldy. For this reason the number of members is restricted and the voting powers of the administrative board reflect the important requirement that the agency will act in conformity with Community interests.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0500"></a>

<p>(EN)The questions raised by the Honourable Member refer to three different but interrelated issues: first, unsolicited (commercial) communications and measures to address cross-border cases; second, illegal content in unsolicited email; and third, the protection of personal correspondence and the need to strike a balance between freedom of expression and the protection of minors and consumers.</p>
<p>Unsolicited commercial communications (or “spam”) are regulated under the Privacy and electronic communications Directive<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Following a Communication from the Commission on “spam”<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> adopted last year, the Commission has set up a contact network of spam enforcement agencies to facilitate cross border enforcement. In December 2004, the contact network agreed on a cooperation procedure to ease the exchange of information across borders. The Commission will continue – as indicated in the recently published 10th Report on Electronic Communications Regulation<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> – to monitor divergences in the national transposition of the Privacy and Electronic communications Directive.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as unsolicited commercial communications contain false or inaccurate information, they may have an adverse impact on the economic behaviour of consumers and therefore fall within the scope of the Misleading Advertising Directive 84/450/EEC. Although existing European legislation allows Member States to adopt or maintain more stringent consumer protection measures, the Commission is now proposing to introduce uniform Community rules on unfair commercial practices, which establish a high level of consumer protection and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market. National authorities competent for the enforcement of consumer protection legislation will be able to co-operate in cross-border cases within the framework of the Regulation on consumer protection co-operation no. 2006/2004.</p>
<p>The Privacy and electronic communications Directive, as transposed by the Member States, is applicable to all unsolicited commercial communications, including those which have illegal content attached. In the specific case of distribution of child pornography material using unsolicited communications, the Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography<a href="#defann_30_4" name="refann_30_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> is also relevant. Other illegal content in unsolicited mail must be addressed according to each Member State’s specific legislation. Member States authorities can also make use of the information exchange possibilities offered by Europol and Eurojust to deal with international cases of illegal content distribution, in so far as these cases are covered by their respective mandates.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission fully endorses both the principle of respect for private and family life, including communications, and the principle of the freedom of expression. These rights are incorporated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union and in the Convention of the Council of Europe regarding the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Commission has committed in 2001 to submit any legislative and regulatory act to a test of compatibility with the Charter<a href="#defann_30_5" name="refann_30_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. Although the Union has as such no general powers to legislate on fundamental rights and freedoms, Article 95 of the EC Treaty allows measures to be proposed and adopted to harmonise the Member States' legislation where these measures have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market. It is in that context that the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications should be seen and, in particular, its balance between privacy in electronic communications and their use for marketing purposes. Whenever needed in the exercise of its powers, the Commission will continue to aim to strike the right balance between the various rights at stake.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

As soon as the report becomes available, the Commission will proceed to examine it. If necessary, it will consult the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP). In light of the results of the assessment, the Commission will decide whether risk management measures are necessary. Pending the scientific evaluation of the study report, it would be premature to announce specific actions on the products in question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0504"></a>

<p>The European Union Council of Ministers has unanimously decided to cut agricultural spending by around EUR 800 million in the budget for 2005, without taking account of the real needs of the sector and the commitments given to producers. This unprecedented measure demonstrates the lack of political will among Member State governments (including the Spanish Government) to guarantee the sustainability of farming in the European Union.</p>
<p>Moreover, this decision could be interpreted as a way of signalling to farmers that they are virtually certain to be affected by further cuts in the unit amount of aid from 2007 onwards, when the Commission is to submit a report to determine whether or not it is necessary to conduct a fresh 'modulation' of direct subsidies. It is clear that those countries which are in favour of reducing Member States' contributions to the budget under the next financial perspective have won an initial battle here.</p>

<p>(FR)The Union’s relations with Cuba are governed by the Common Position, initially adopted by the Council in 1996 and reviewed and updated regularly since then. The Union’s objectives in relation to Cuba remain respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, encouraging a process of transition towards pluralist democracy and sustainable economic recovery, with a view to improving the living conditions of the Cuban population. In order to achieve these objectives, the Common Position promotes a policy of constructive engagement with regard to Cuba, by means of strengthened dialogue with the government and civil society. Neither the Common Position, nor its objectives or instruments have so far been called into question by any of the Member States.</p>
<p>Following the arrest and sentencing of 75 dissidents to prison terms of between 6 and 28 years, the Council is currently evaluating the measures adopted in June 2003. Several countries, including Spain, have called into question the effectiveness of these measures and have advocated that they be re-examined.</p>
<p>The Commission does not believe that the Union needs a new foreign policy with regard to Cuba, which would relegate human rights into second place behind economic interests.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the suspension of political dialogue with the Cuban authorities over the last 18 months does not appear to have had a significant impact on economic and commercial exchanges between the countries of the Union and Cuba.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a consensus amongst the Member States, shared by the Commission, on the need to seek more effective ways to achieve the objectives of the Common Position, the most important of which is respect for human rights.</p>
<p>Within this context, the Commission takes a positive view of the proposal on a new approach such as the one agreed at technical level by the Member States last December. It would be aimed at normalising diplomatic relations with Havana while at the same time intensifying relations with the peaceful dissidents by means other than invitations to official receptions. The Commission hopes that this new approach will serve to stimulate the release of the 61 dissidents imprisoned since March 2003. The resumption of political dialogue sought should also have the central aim of better pursuing the objectives of the Common Position on Cuba.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0514"></a>

<p>(EN)In the present Commission, the Enlargement portfolio has been expanded to include the responsibility for the Western Balkans. This is a clear signal that the Commission considers that in addition to the current candidate countries (Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Turkey), the countries of the Western Balkans have a vocation to become members of the EU when time is ripe and when they fulfil the Copenhagen criteria. This is in line with the conclusions of the Thessalonica European Council of June 2003.</p>
<p>The practice in the ongoing round of enlargement has been to condition the opening of negotiations on the fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria. This condition has proved an important stimulus for political change and in-depth reform in the candidate countries. Hence, accession negotiations should only be started with a country that fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria, thereby promoting the fundamental values on which the Union is founded.</p>
<p>The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe states that ‘The Union shall be open to all European States which respect its values and are committed to promoting them together’. Hence, if a European State has a vocation to become a member of the Union and is committed to European values and if it is able to take on the obligations of membership, it should be accepted as a candidate. However, we should take equally seriously the often forgotten element of the Copenhagen criteria: “The Union’s capacity to absorb new members, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, is also an important consideration in the general interest of both the Union and the candidate countries.”</p>
<p>So far, other countries have not been considered for accession in the medium term. For this reason, it was agreed to include them in the EU’s Neighbourhood Policy, which paves the way for free trade and political dialogue. This involves also cooperation in the field of Trans European Energy Networks, given that a number of countries included in the European Neighbourhood Policy are and will remain important for the security of energy supply of the EU. Being part of the Neighbourhood Policy does not mean that the door is closed for Membership.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, Europe is a political concept: its future evolution should be developed jointly between the Member States and the European Institutions, and with the civil society at large.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0517"></a>

<p>The objectives of the Community legislation cannot be achieved without effective application in the workplace and it is the responsibility of the competent authorities of the Member States to ensure appropriate control and monitoring of the national laws transposing Community directives.</p>
<p>The Commission actively cooperates with the Member States, in particular with the assistance of the Advisory Committee on health and safety in the workplace, which the Council established, with a view to harmonising approaches, facilitating exchanges of experiences and jointly producing non-binding good practice guides intended to illustrate the measures to be taken with a view to compliance with the provisions of the directives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 15 December the Swedish media reported that the undertaking Duni was planning to relocate its manufacture of paper plates from Halmstad to Poznan in Poland. Duni has stated that it intends to seek grants from the EU for the training of its 40-50 new employees in Poland, and the undertaking expects to receive a one-off grant of approximately SEK 35 000 for each new recruit. It is also possible to apply for grants for investment in new machinery, but not for moving the old machinery from Sweden to Poland. Commenting on this, Björn Erlandsson, who represents the undertaking, said: 'Personally, I think it is remarkable that grants are available for relocating industrial production from Sweden to Poland. This is money which the states contribute, and it seems that the EU has plenty of cash.'</p>

<p>(EN)Like other Structural Funds, the European Social Fund channels its support into strategic long-term programmes which are planned and drawn up by Member States and negotiated with the Commission. The programmes are implemented by the Member State through a wide range of provider organisations both in the public and the private sectors. These organisations may include national, regional and local authorities, educational and training institutions, voluntary organisations and the Social Partners, and individual companies.</p>
<p>The Structural Funds take part in the financing of operations as they are defined in the regulations on the various funds. As mentioned above, these operations have to fall within the priorities and measures agreed in the intervention of the Funds covering the Member State or region. To benefit from financing from one of the Funds, the operation has also to meet the selection criteria, which are approved by a monitoring committee responsible for monitoring the effectiveness and quality of the implementation of the intervention. Under the principle of subsidiarity, the Member State is responsible for selecting the individual projects to be funded, for their implementation, audit and control, monitoring and evaluation.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the efficiency of and the durable impact of the Funds' assistance, the current Structural Funds General Regulation introduced a new rule aiming to ensure that the Structural Funds objectives are attained in a sustainable fashion (cfr.Article 30.4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>). Pursuant to this Article, Member States must ensure that an operation retains the contribution from Structural Funds only if it does not, within five years of the date of the decision concerning the Structural Funds contribution, undergo a substantial modification which could affect the nature of the operation, its implementation conditions or give to a firm or a public body an undue advantage. A change in the nature of ownership in case of infrastructure or a change in the location in a productive activity is a substantial modification.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission Regulation on employment state aid establishes a minimum period of job maintenance in case of public aid to job creation or recruitment (3 years for big companies and 2 years for SMEs).</p>
<p>A fundamental freedom of the Single Market is the possibility for companies to locate in any part of the Union. The exercise of this freedom must, however, respect Community legislation particularly the abovementioned rules for Competition and the Structural Funds.</p>
<p>Relocation has always been a challenge for regional policy and has become an even greater concern within an enlarged Union. Therefore, the Commission proposes for the future 2007-2013 programming period for Structural and Cohesion Funds to reinforce the provisions related to relocation of enterprises. The time span required to maintain a productive investment has been extended. To retain support from the Funds, undertakings shall maintain their productive investment for a seven year period following the date of the decision granting the Funds' support. The Commission has also proposed that those firms that have to reimburse funds as a result of a change of location within a Member State or between Member States will not be entitled to receive support from the Funds in future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Within the European Union there are languages with a centuries-old history which are neither national nor official EU languages but which nonetheless often have many speakers living in different regions in a variety of Member States. In those regions, such languages sometimes enjoy official status and in certain cases they have a number of speakers, a literary tradition and a vitality comparable to those of national languages which enjoy official EU status, even though the latter may actually have only a similar or even a smaller number of speakers.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that respect for linguistic diversity is one of the EU's democratic and cultural foundations (as acknowledged in Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights: 'The Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity') and since - in accordance with the EU's values - it would therefore be wrong to discriminate against a language merely on the grounds that it is not spoken throughout a Member States, does the Commission not think that the EU should take greater account of the realities of such languages?</p>
<p>The Spanish Government has already submitted a Memorandum calling for the language arrangements within the EU institutions to be amended in order to accommodate Spain's co-official languages. What attitude is the Commission likely to adopt in response to such a request?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of the importance and use of certain regional languages in Spain and neighbouring Member States</p>
<p>The Commission is also aware that there are cases, where more EU citizens have one of these languages as their first language than those that speak other languages in other Member States.</p>
<p>However, the Commission recalls that in accordance with Article 290 of the EC Treaty, the rules governing the languages of the institutions of the Community are determined by the Council, acting unanimously and without proposal of the Commission.</p>
<p>These rules are laid down in Council Regulation No 1 of 15 April 1958 (Council Regulation No 1/58), last amended by the Accession Treaty concerning the accession of the ten new Member States joining the European Union on the 1<span class="sup">st</span> of May 2004. Council Regulation N°1/58 lists the official and working languages of the EU institutions.</p>
<p>However, as the Commission stated already in its reply to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0650_EN.html">H-650/01</a> from Mr Miquel Mayol I Raynal and written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-2004-1305_EN.html">E-1305/04</a> from Mr Erik Meijer, the fact that certain regional or co-official languages are not named as one of the official languages of the Union in Council Regulation No 1/58 does not call into question the cultural and linguistic importance of these language.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Commission respects and supports the principle of linguistic diversity as it is inscribed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Constitutional Treaty. However, it is the view of the Commission - without prejudice to recent Member State initiatives - that the implementation of this principle does not necessarily mean that all languages spoken in the Union have to be recognized as official and working languages of the European Institutions.</p>
<p>There are other means to promote the linguistic diversity in the Union. For instance, the Commission has recently adopted, on the basis of its own – limited – competencies an Action Plan Promoting language learning and linguistic diversity, which aims at encouraging Member States to promote linguistic diversity as well as the teaching and learning of a wide range of languages, including regional and minority ones.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0526"></a>

The unprecedented scale of the damage caused by the above epiphytotic diseases means that the farmers affected must be immediately compensated, otherwise they will go bankrupt and be wiped out.

<p>Member States are obliged, under the Community’s waste legislation<a href="#defann_46_2" name="refann_46_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and harming the environment. The selection of the precise disposal methods and of suitable disposal sites or installations lies within the competence of national authorities and development consent should be granted prior to establishment. In the particular case of landfilling of wastes, this must be done in accordance with the technical standards and procedures laid down the Landfill Directive<a href="#defann_46_3" name="refann_46_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Landfills for hazardous waste must also be subject to an environmental impact assessment pursuant to EIA Directive<a href="#defann_46_4" name="refann_46_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, as amended by Directive 97/11/EC<a href="#defann_46_5" name="refann_46_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. Other landfills and waste treatment facilities are also subject to such an assessment if they are likely to have significant effects on the environment. According to existing Greek legislation, an environmental impact assessment is required.</p>
<p>The examination of the project’s impact on the cultural heritage of the archaeological site of Vergina is a matter for the competent national authorities to address. As the Central Archaeological Committee has given its approval to the project, it is assumed that these impacts have been duly addressed.</p>
<p>The impacts of the project on the Natura 2000 site need to be addressed according to the provisions of Article 6 (2), (3) and (4) of the Habitats Directive. On the basis of the information provided by the Honourable Member, the development is not directly affecting the Natura 2000 site. While indirect effects are equally important, no information as to such effects has been provided.</p>
<p>On the basis of existing information, it appears that the construction of the waste treatment facility is currently undergoing the approval procedure of all the competent authorities under national law. This procedure must comply with Community legal requirements as mentioned above. Based on the available information, the Commission is of the view that, at this stage, there is no ground for considering that a breach of applicable EC environmental legislation has occurred. If the Honourable Member has any further detailed information that indicates that Community law is being breached, the Commission will be happy to give further consideration to the issue.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Yesterday, on Marathon Avenue in Athens, an intercity bus was hijacked by armed foreign nationals who took 26 passengers hostage.</p>
<p>At his hearing before the European Parliament, the new Commissioner responsible for transport, Mr Jacques Barrot, said that one of the main objectives of the common transport policy through to 2010 was to devise and develop a comprehensive approach to transport safety and security (to combat accidents and terrorism) and stressed that the initial anti-terrorist security measures taken in the sea and air transport sectors should be reinforced and extended to the other transport sectors.</p>
<p>In the light of these events and the commitments given by the new Commissioner, does the Commission intend to take initiatives and propose practical measures to ensure the security and safety of all forms of transport and, in particular, road transport against such criminal or terrorist acts?

<p>It is therefore necessary to seek, at all levels - because subsidiarity must come into play in the case mentioned by the honourable Member as in other cases - measures to reduce the risks of such actions.

<p>(EN)Like many railway enterprises within the Union, the Société Nationale des Chemins de fer français (SNCF) is a publicly owned enterprise. However, concerning the assessment as to whether or not unfair competition exists the ownership structure is not relevant as the European State aid rules apply equally to publicly and privately owned enterprises. Consequently, State aid rules do not permit national authorities to grant large subsidies to their national railway enterprises, while at the same time banning any form of State aid for privately owned airlines.</p>
<p>In the assessment of the Commission of possible State aids to the railway sector, several elements have to be taken into account. First, the promotion of railway transport is one of the key elements of European transport policy as is laid down in the White Paper of the Commission<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Secondly, in accordance with European legislation railway enterprises do have to pay for the use of the infrastructure. This puts other modes of transport in a better position compared to rail. Thirdly, as the high speed trains in France are currently not loss-making there is a margin to lower some fares without causing unfair competition.</p>
<p>Currently, the Commission is closely monitoring the financing of railway enterprises not only in France but all over Europe. This is done in order to assure that the financing of railway enterprises is in accordance with European legislation, in particular with Council Directive 91/440, on the development of the Community’s railways, as modified by Council Directive 51/2004<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, and the State aid rules as laid down in Article 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

However, in 2005, only the EUR 216 m budget line was maintained. Thus the continuation and scope of this food aid programme are under threat.</p>
<p>Many associations are alarmed about the problems they will be faced with.</p>
<p>Meeting our fellow citizens' food needs must remain a priority of the European Community, in which extreme poverty is spreading and the number of people suffering from malnutrition is unfortunately steadily rising.</p>
<p>What does the Commission propose to do to offset the disappearance of intervention stocks and thus ensure that the European food aid programme can continue and that the food needs of the most deprived persons are met?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission is aware that the free distribution of foodstuffs from the intervention stocks represents an important supply for many associations actively assisting deprived people in the Union.</p>
<p>The Commission has ensured that, from 2004, the appropriations are increased from EUR 200 to 216 million in order to accompany the enlargement to 25 Member States. A budget of EUR 216 million had also been scheduled for 2005. This budget funds the provision of intervention stocks and is distributed in accordance with Eurostat statistics amongst the Member States wishing to participate in the programme.</p>
<p>Furthermore, following the 50% reduction in the intervention price for rice brought about by the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the quantity of products provided for 2005 has increased.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that significant under-use of the budget for this Community programme has been noted for recent years.</p>
<p>From the outset, the Commission has been concerned to adapt the methods for assisting deprived people in the Community to the development of the context for this measure. This has led it to modify the applicable regulations on several occasions, in particular by introducing two significant relaxations: the possibility of purchasing foodstuffs on the market in the event of the temporary unavailability of these products in intervention stocks, and the practice of exchanging products from intervention stocks for foodstuffs of the same kind.</p>
<p>The Commission takes very good account of changes to the environment in which this measure operates and will certainly carry out the necessary modifications to the application regulations where appropriate. It is aware of the challenge presented by the gradual reduction in public stocks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0563"></a>

<p>(EN)The Treaty does not contain stipulations that address explicitly the question of how Member States should design allowances for children and young persons. The organisation, structure and financing of social protection systems, including minimum income, are a competence of Member States.</p>
<p>Regarding people who exercise their right to free movement, Article 39 EC enshrines the principle of equal treatment for migrant workers in the host Member State. This means that a migrant worker or a member of his family may not be treated differently than national workers as regards, for instance, access to social advantages as provided for in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) 1612/68. The allowances for children and young people can in principle be considered as social advantages, and therefore a migrant worker must be given access to them under the same conditions as apply to nationals of the host Member State. However, the principle of equal treatment does not impose a harmonisation of such social advantages at European level and each Member State is free to determine which advantages to grant and their amount. What Article 39 EC guarantees is that a migrant worker and members of his family are granted those advantages on an equal footing as national workers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0568"></a>

<p>In November 2004 the European Parliament once again expressed its views with regard to Cuba. Cuba's democrats are criticising manoeuvres designed to soften the EU's stance vis-à-vis Fidel Castro's dictatorship; these include recent statements by the Commissioner Louis Michel. It is shocking that invitations issued to democrats in order to enable them to attend ceremonies organised by the EU and its Member States in Havana should be regarded as 'diplomatic sanctions' (subject to revision). The issue of such invitations is a procedure typical of free countries, which are not a mere extension of a dictatorship and which do not discriminate against the persecuted.</p>
<p>Does the Commission take the European Parliament's views into account? Does it deem acceptable an EU policy which is so subordinate to the views expressed and the pressures exerted by a communist dictatorship that it should result in EU diplomats' bowing before Castro's political police and censors in connection with invitations to their own houses?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The Commission agrees with the opinion expressed by the honourable Member in his question, to the effect that the invitations to dissidents to attend the ceremonies of the Member States and the Union in Havana should not be seen as a sanction. It is an entirely normal and standardised practice in other countries for the Union’s missions to invite members of the political opposition and representatives of civil society to receptions on national holidays. It is, however, the case that the Cuban authorities have seen these invitations as a provocation and as aligning the Union with United States policy.</p>
<p>The Council is currently evaluating the measures adopted in June 2003 with regard to Cuba, including the invitation to dissidents to receptions on national holidays, which is the most controversial.</p>
<p>Within this framework, the release by the Cuban Government, in November and December 2004, of six new dissidents, including some of the most symbolic, such as the journalist and poet Raul Rivero, is a positive gesture. The Commission believes that the Union should respond to positive gestures, even if those gestures are not yet sufficient, in order to promote and stimulate further significant steps by the Cuban Government. Our objective should still be the release of all political prisoners in Cuba.</p>
<p>Within this context, the Commission takes a positive view of the proposal on a new approach such as the one agreed at technical level by the Member States last December. It would be aimed at normalising diplomatic relations in Havana, while at the same time intensifying relations with the peaceful dissidents by means other than invitations to official receptions. Cuban officials would not be invited to those receptions either.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes that this new approach will serve to prompt the release of the 61 dissidents still imprisoned since March 2003. The resumption of political dialogue sought should also have the central aim of better pursuing the objectives of the Common Position on Cuba, which remain respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, encouraging a process of transition towards pluralist democracy and a sustainable improvement in the living conditions of the Cuban people.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0573"></a>

<p>(EN)Protocol N° 33 to the Treaty establishing the European Community on the Protection and Welfare of Animals introduced into Community law by the Treaty of Amsterdam incorporated into Community primary law the principle of protection of animal welfare in the sector principally concerned, namely Agriculture, Transport, the Internal Market and Research.</p>
<p>Council Directives on the Protection of transported animals have existed since 1977. These Directives were motivated on the need to “eliminate technical barriers to trade in live animals and allow the market organizations in question to operate smoothly, whilst ensuring a satisfactory level of protection for the animals concerned”.</p>
<p>Based on a Commission proposal, the Agriculture Council of 21-22 December 2004 adopted a new Regulation which will introduce strict and innovative standards for the transport of animals from the beginning of 2007. The new provisions aim to provide higher standards of protection for animals during transport and to improve the efficiency of enforcement tools, with a beneficial effect on competition. Extensive consultation of the stakeholders concerned took place during the elaboration of the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p>These new provisions are to apply in parallel with other measures of the Community veterinary legislation aiming at establishing and enforcing the principle of free intra-community trade in live animals (Article 1 (4) of the newly adopted regulation).</p>
<p>Indeed, Community veterinary legislation explicitly recognizes that the harmonious operation of the common market organizations in animals implies the dismantling of zootechnical and veterinary barriers to intra-Community trade and that the free movement of animals is a fundamental feature of the EU markets and facilitates the rational development and the optimum use of the factors of production. This must of course happen in conformity with the established requirements on animal welfare.	</p>
<p>The adoption of the new rules on animal transport to which the Commission has referred aims notably to better reconcile the requirements concerning free circulation of animals with the principle of protection of animal welfare enshrined in Treaty Protocol N° 33.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
