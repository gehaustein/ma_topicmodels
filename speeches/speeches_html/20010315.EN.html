<p class="contents">This report, which I am pleased to present on his behalf and on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is an important part of the Legal Affairs Committee's remit on behalf of Parliament to encourage simplification and good-quality drafting of Community legislative instruments. In this particular case, quite a lot of important work has been done by the Commission in incorporating and simplifying three texts related to life insurance. The source text dates as far back as 1979 and, apart from the codification process of incorporating amendments that have been made over that period into the legislative text, the reason for this more substantive report is that the Commission has found it necessary to propose a number of amendments to reflect changes that have taken place in the market since that time and to improve the overall quality and integrity of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not need to detain the House with a lot of the technical details relating to those texts. Those of you that are experts on the subject will clearly want to refer to the Commission's own text and the Commission has provided an extremely helpful and clear explanatory statement for those of us who are not, unlike Lord Inglewood, distinguished lawyers – which is why he has been able to make such a good job of scrutinising this text on behalf of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the work that has been done, our job here is just to ensure that there are no political issues arising out of what is largely a set of technical amendments. Lord Inglewood has taken soundings of the industry. He has looked particularly at the texts of the six amendments, to make sure that they do not introduce any principles outside the directives' original political remit and he is satisfied in this case. Therefore, so far as his report is concerned, he is pleased to recommend adoption of the Commission proposal to the House without any further amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of general conclusion, we in the Legal Affairs Committee regard the quality of drafting and simplification of legislation as an important remit. It is worthwhile reminding colleagues throughout the House who are working on legal texts that this is a principle that we all need to bear in mind when we are amending legislative texts of any kind. When we see and look at work in other committees it is not entirely clear that colleagues bear simplification in mind. In many cases we see far too many complicated texts coming out of work done by this House. It is an important principle – maybe this is an uncontroversial issue but the principle of the quality and clarity of legislative instruments is important. I commend this report as a good example of that process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I welcome the Commission’s basic principle that legislation that has already been amended several times and no longer gives a clear and coherent picture should have to be codified.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with my recently completed report on the pension funds directive, I also believe that simplification and consolidation of the life assurance directives is urgently required, because that will create clearer distinctions between the different activities and pillars. It is possible that when the pensions fund directive is accepted, insurance companies that are active in the third pillar and therefore also subject to the life assurance directives will in future be subject to the pension funds directive for their company pensions business. Since this likelihood will exist, it is important that what we are doing should be as clear, simple and transparent as possible. The Inglewood report and the simplification and transparency it initiates are therefore a welcome contribution to making things easier for the citizen to understand and therefore a contribution to a living internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Your objective is to facilitate the comprehension and application of the insurance directives by setting them out in a legal text that is clear, coherent and complete. Mr Karas has just asked for texts to be as clear and transparent as possible and that was the Commission's aim in the text which is in front of you.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the codification of the provisions, some minor amendments which do not affect the substance of the texts were considered to be necessary. The exercise has gone beyond a pure codification and that is why this is a ‘recast’ version. A purely recodified text would have included a considerable number of repetitions, inconsistencies and obsolete provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend shortly to present to the Commission and, if the Commission agrees, to Parliament, a parallel proposal for a recast – again recast – version of the non-life insurance directives. Clearly the Community's insurance legislation is not going to be stopped because of the codification exercise. New proposals are being discussed which, once they have been adopted, will require new amendments to the recast directives. We cannot stop the legislation tree growing but we can prune and train it so that it does not become an overgrown tangle as it has been in the past. I am extremely grateful to Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and particularly to the rapporteur, Lord Inglewood, here represented by Mr Harbour, for their efficient handling of this matter. Mr Harbour also just said that this is a good model for other legislation and I entirely agree with him. It is an example of efficiency which Parliament may well want to adopt in other instances as well.</p>
<p class="contents">They have appreciated the fact that, although the proposal exceeds the limits of pure codification, it does not really contain any legislative change. It therefore calls for more expeditious consideration than a normal legislative proposal and that is what has happened. They have recommended to Members of Parliament that you should approve this proposal without any amendment and I invite Parliament to follow the recommendation of the rapporteur and approve the proposal without amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission hopes a directive will soon be adopted, if possible with only one reading by this Parliament. That would be a very good example of a fast-track procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This sound ecological principle is enshrined in European law. The Spanish government tried in vain to block this framework directive on water because of its National Hydrological Plan. This megalomaniac and wrong-headed plan of the Aznar government aims to pipe water from the River Ebro over 900 kilometres down the coast to Southern Spain. The cost will be in excess of EUR 18 billion between now and 2008. The Aznar government wants Europe to give an annual subsidy of EUR 1 billion. This injudicious plan contravenes both the spirit and the letter of the framework directive on water. It contravenes the habitat directive on 82 counts and the birds directive on 108 counts.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course the Aznar government will label this plan a national economic priority, but it will also have to prove to the European Commission that there are no alternatives. However, there <span class="italic">are </span>alternatives! Desalination of brackish and salt water will be 50% cheaper for Central and Southern Spain than the Aznar plan, and apart from that is much more flexible, small-scale, and demand-oriented. Another method would be to introduce cost-covering prices for water and to irrigate plants individually rather than submerging the fields and allowing between 90% and 95% of the precious water to evaporate. Israel provides a good example of this. This is why the European Commission should reject the Aznar plan and stop the flow of EU funds into it.</p>
<p class="contents">This Aznar plan is 200 times worse than the plan for an industrial estate between Aachen and Heerlen. On the German-Dutch border the European Commission has rightly cut off the flow of EU funds because of the threat to the hamster population. Surely it cannot be that the European Commission as the Guardian of the Treaties is operating a double standard?</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware that the Aznar government asked 83 Spanish scientists to carry out studies into this injudicious water plan and that that same government is now refusing to publish results it deems unfavourable? Does the Commission approve of 60 villages in Spain being wiped off the map? Does the European Commission find it acceptable that a landslide could dislocate the operation of the Itoiz dam and threaten the Ascó nuclear power station? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that we are here to try to provide some answers and, more importantly, to be able to discuss with the Commission a particularly important subject, which is the uneven distribution of water resources on European territory, which is related to variations in geographical, geological and climatic conditions, but which also results from human activity such as urbanisation, deforestation and pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to uneven distribution, it is logical to consider the possibility of carrying out water transfers in some regions. It is unacceptable to let some areas run dry, when other areas have adequate resources to help them.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament mentioned this idea in January 1998 in its resolution on the technological feasibility of trans-European hydraulic networks.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow Members in the European Parliament and I believed, quite rightly in my view, that trans-European hydraulic networks, which would carry out large scale inter basin water transfers, could perhaps be an appropriate solution, enabling water resources to be shared within the European Union. In addition, however, and it is important to stress this, it is obviously completely out of the question to take over a Member State’s water resources unless that Member State gives its express consent.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost three years after the vote on this resolution, questions are still being asked. Basically, the European Union has no experience at all in establishing such networks. In order to bridge this gap, prospective studies should be carried out on the feasibility of this work, as well as an analysis of the physical impact that this type of trans-European hydraulic network would have on aquatic environments and other areas protected under Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">To this day, information on possible conclusions of these studies has not been passed on to us. I find this deplorable, and I do not know if the Commission will have anything to tell us today about this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to bear in mind the irreversible nature of any projects that might be undertaken. It is hard to imagine these facilities being challenged in the short or medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, essential to investigate every possible way of improving existing structures and, wherever possible, to apply the principle that it is advisable, first and foremost, to optimise our water management, rather than to invest money. It is, therefore, important, in the long term, to establish a system in which responsibility is assigned for the quantity and quality of the water transferred, if there is a need for it to be transferred, and to establish a process to monitor this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, and I am in agreement with my fellow Member on this particular point, we have the framework directive on water, which has come into force. We must ensure that it is implemented correctly in national law and that it is respected in the potential and more technical context of water transfers being carried out between Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As spokesperson for <span class="italic">Convergencia Democrática de Cataluña</span> in the European Parliament, I would like to express that my party, and also the Catalan Government, of which we are a part along with <span class="italic">Unió Democràtica de Catalunya</span>, do not agree with the proposals from the Spanish laid down in the aforementioned plan. In the case that most directly affects Catalonia, we suggest an alternative based on transferring one fifth of the volume of water proposed by the Spanish (specifically from the river Ebro, which has been mentioned here) the use of desalination plants (which have also been suggested here as a valid alternative), better use of what is available in the current channels and finally, transfer from the Ródano.</p>
<p class="contents">And this is where this plan enters into a European dimension. We have been saying for years that one of the most serious problems that the most-developed societies, such as European societies, have to solve, in the medium and long term, is the shortage of water caused by the development of our urban centres and the locations of our new economic activities, which requires a new type of water management. We cannot escape from this reality and we also need to consider it from a European perspective, because the situation demands it.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not understand the resistance against limiting transfers between basins, while maintaining State borders. In the case of Spain, there is complete opposition from the Spanish to this possibility, but it is, however, accepted for Portugal. We therefore stress that water management needs to have a European perspective, that transfers from basins irrespective of the borders between the Member States need to be considered because, among other things, the aim of the European Union is a Europe without borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">‘Much of the policies, legislation and standards needed to achieve our objectives for water quality and use have already been put in place. The main challenge is ensuring the full and proper implementation of the existing legislation and achieving the integration of the Community’s water quality objectives into the other sectoral policies such as agriculture, industry and regional policy… Member States also need to take steps to ensure that they are integrated into local planning and land-use decisions… national, regional and local authorities need, amongst other things, to introduce measures to improve the efficiency of water use and to encourage changes in agricultural practices necessary to protect water resources and quality.’</p>
<p class="contents">It goes on to cover some aspects of saving water, efficient use of water, land-use planning and other aspects. It is true that this debate has arisen here because there have been a great number of floods in Europe that are probably the result of bad water management, but it is also true that currently the biggest plan proposed in Europe for radical change in water management is in our country. We are focusing on saving water, efficiency, different agricultural practices and land-use, which is what the forthcoming Spanish water plan should be. We are very concerned, Commissioner, that directives such as the framework directive on water, the habitat directive, the directive on environmental impact assessment and the birds directive can be violated. These four directives are now the backbone of the forthcoming sixth environment action programme. If they were violated, the European Commission would be helping to make it impossible for the sixth plan to be implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It applies the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive does not prohibit water transfers per se. However it imposes a binding legal requirement that they should not harm the environment. It seems particularly important in this context that since the directive entered into force on 22 December 2000 a strict non-deterioration clause has applied, which should prevent a repetition of past errors. The possibilities for derogation are restricted and subject to mandatory conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive points out the importance of integrating the protection and sustainable management of water into other Community policy areas. When a Natura 2000 may be affected, the normal procedure as provided for in Article 6 of the Habitats Directive should be applied in sequence: a search for alternative solutions, assessment of the overriding public interest and as a last resort, compensatory measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The water framework directive will bring radical changes to Europe’s water industry. But the directive is also an opportunity for a thorough rethink of our various national water industries and water legislation and for opening up new fields of business for national suppliers and undertakings. Water offers industry tremendous opportunities to create more value added for all by opening up the markets. Increased efficiency through new forms of cooperation between private industry and municipal suppliers in the planning, construction and operation of plants is the first essential step in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">A second step must then be to increase value added through exports. Know-how in particular, where some Member States already have a number of strong undertakings, offers the opportunity of increasing exports by paying more attention to canvassing foreign markets – but obviously exporting only to an ecologically acceptable extent. Everyone would gain from that. Municipalities and consumers would save on costs. Producers would find new markets. I believe everyone would gain from exporting water in the same way as other countries export their gold in the form of oil; we in Austria, for example, have white liquid gold in the form of water. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Returning to the content of the previous answers from Mrs Wallström, I must point out to Mrs García-Orcoyen that I am surprised at the sudden change of position that there appears to be between the Commission’s reply to us and what the honourable Member says she was told. I would like to ask Mr Liikanen to clarify this on behalf of Mrs Wallström. Mrs García-Orcoyen said, as was reported by various Spanish media, that the Commission had answered to her that the Spanish plan did not violate Community legislation. I must ask you, honourable Member, not to distort the Commission’s position. What Mrs Wallström has been saying is that the Commission has not made any statement on whether or not the Spanish national water plan violates Community legislation because it considers it to still be a draft and that it cannot therefore make a decision, as it does not have all the necessary information to rule on this. I ask you please, Mrs García-Orcoyen, not to say something that is not true.</p>
<p class="contents">However, regardless of whether or not the Spanish national water plan, as it stands, violates Community legislation, we are going to take a brief look at it, not only because of the effects of the planned work on LIFE areas, on fauna and flora (and I thank the GUE/NGL group for picking up this issue from my previous questions) but also because of many other aspects that can be seen. Would you like an example? The framework directive says that no movement of water can take place unless there has been a rigorous prior assessment of the need for it and unless all the possible alternatives have been exhausted. Yesterday in Spain we found out that the government is now considering reducing the transfer from the Ebro by half through measures such as saving water in agriculture and re-using it. We strongly doubt that this reduction is a counter-proposal. It seems more like an alteration of concessions in order to ultimately distribute the same volume of water. However, whatever the case, it goes without saying that measures such as saving and re-using water are considered to be fundamental in the alternative plan put forward by our party the <span class="italic">Partido Socialista</span>. If the transfer could supposedly have been done from the start with the same amount of water that is now being proposed – i.e. half the amount – does this not show that the government did not look into all the socio-economic implications, the alternatives and the availability of the resource in detail before its proposal?</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, you are aware that the framework directive says that participation from citizens is very important and, so far, associations such as ADENA, <span class="italic">Ecologistas en Acción</span> or groups of experts have not received an official response to their very well-documented allegations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also talk about the deterioration of water, which is dealt with in Articles 1 and 4 of the framework directive. These articles establish the objective that the current state of water should not deteriorate, and it also says that this should be complied with from the entry into force of the directive, i.e. 22 December 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">This implies that the current Spanish national water plan is not compatible with the framework directive because, as the work involved is planned, there will undoubtedly be serious changes to ecosystems and to the quality of the water.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to briefly explain the Group of the Party of European Socialists views water management. We believe that water is a common resource and therefore something that is governed more by solidarity than by market forces. Any water plan should be more than a series of infrastructures and transfers. Transferring water should be the last resort, to be done only when all possible alternatives have been exhausted and when it has been proven that it does not damage the environment. Any water management measure should be accompanied by parallel plans on irrigation and forest resources, and taking into account climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that there is a great deal more that I could say, but I can assure you that what Mrs Wallström did say in the February part-session is that the European Union will never fund, and will never agree with, any plan that does not respect the environment.</p>

<p class="contents">Plans cannot be established by law behind citizens’ backs and without taking into account their opinions, the opinion of social agents and of the scientific community, the territories affected, through development considerations, which focus more on concrete than on where to get water from and actually assessing who needs it and why.</p>
<p class="contents">As Andalusians, from one of the driest areas in the European Union, with very considerable water requirements, due to the two main economic activities, agriculture and tourism, and with absolutely unpredictable weather, we are concerned about the efficiency of the project, the cost/benefit relationship, the real possibility of these projects supporting the area and not causing conflict between communities. Our hydrological plan would always start with the word ‘save’, and the last words would be ‘transfer’ and ‘desalination’.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the best reservoir is saving. Our duty is to ask for water, but also to demand that efforts first be made to make the best possible use of the existing resources, valuing this scarce resource as it should be valued, improving irrigation in agriculture, investing in optimising the efficiency of distribution networks – which are in many cases obsolete and have major leaks – regaining control of hydraulics and regenerating soil and vegetation.</p>
<p class="contents">Special attention needs to be paid to underground water, preventing it from being over-used, to sewage treatment and to the essential environmental impact studies, particularly in areas such as mine, where specially protected natural areas are a precious asset to be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">These plans also need to be in line with the Community directives on water, Natura sites, habitat, birds, etc., in conjunction with the national irrigation plans that should be in accordance with the forthcoming review of the common agricultural policy and rural development in order to deepen essential sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the opportunity to draw up a sustainable, innovative and model plan. Let us do so. Now, more than ever, we can’t please everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Water is a product that is essential to life itself. It is also a strategic factor for development and, as such, is an issue that concerns everyone, a point that has already been emphasised here and rightly so. If we accept this view, then today we must develop a joint vision for the planning and management of shared rivers. At European level and within the United Nations, the Helsinki Convention and, more specifically, its protocol on the protection and use of cross-border rivers and international lakes, represent a framework of international law that contains this vision and these new principles.</p>
<p class="contents">As is well known, Portugal has played an active role in the drafting of the directive on water management, in an attempt to ensure that priority was given to fundamental aspects concerning the protection and sustainable use of water, bearing in mind the climatic and geographic conditions of the Iberian Peninsula. It should be understood that Portugal has indeed played this active role. Portugal and Spain are in quite unequal positions, given that we are a downstream country, in other words, Portugal has no rivers that flow into Spain, but Spain does have rivers that flow into Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, when managing their water resources, our neighbours may adopt measures that affect Portuguese interests, but there is nothing that we, on the other hand, can do in terms of our water resources that would directly affect Spanish interests. The joint management of shared hydrological basins within the framework of international law imposed by the directive that I have already mentioned, is therefore a fundamental approach, which must govern the behaviour of those with political responsibility for this particular sector, both in bilateral negotiations and in a multilateral framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that Spain’s new hydrological plan is a step in the right direction, since it has stopped decanting water, mainly from the Douro and Tagus rivers, which are shared between Portugal and Spain. The directive in fact constitutes an extremely important protection network, since it adopts the coordination of the measures for hydrological basin management from the standpoint that these are not considered to be units defined by administrative or political borders. With the aim of establishing an integrated water management system which will make the best use of the appropriate objectives for the specific conditions of the European Union’s regions, the regulations of the framework directive will facilitate the implementation, both now and in future, with the cooperation of national governments, of hydrological plans that take account of such important factors as water quality, the preservation of sufficient water flows, the climate and the protection of biodiversity and the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can also be sure that we are far from paying the subject the attention it deserves. Of course it would be an illusion to think we can solve water problems by pumping water from areas of supposed surplus to areas where there is a shortage.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are saying that parts of Europe sometimes have floods and that the water could perhaps be more fairly distributed, we must bear in mind that those floods are themselves the outcome of mistakes in water management. It is high time far greater attention was paid to local and regional water management. Water problems must, as a rule, be solved where they arise, and there they must be dealt with within an acceptable financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The neglect of one potential source of water has been criminal: the conversion of salt water into industrial and process water. The prospects in this sector are tremendous. Complete liberalisation of water will result in it being used by industry in a way that will bring enormous ecological problems in the long term. We must stop that before it happens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr de Roo, about two months ago you said that the Spanish Government and the Spanish Members voted against the framework directive. Either you were not at that vote or you did not realise that, without exception, we voted in favour of the framework directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this is a framework directive that – and I agree with what has been said here by several speakers – is going to promote a new culture in terms of water in European countries, based on criteria of efficiency and quality of water resources. No one can deny this, much less so the <span class="italic">Partido Popular</span> or the Spanish Government.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me, Mr de Roo, that your Group is particularly interested in the Spanish water plan. You could have put the question more directly from the start. First of all, I would like to know if you have read it. Do you have precise knowledge of the Spanish water plan or are you echoing other people’s positions and a political opportunism that could of course be risky?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think that Mrs Sornosa should tell me where she has seen me saying that I said that the Spanish water plan might contradict the framework directive. The water plan is currently an open draft, in the process of consultation with all the parties concerned, although none of them has wanted to make use of this facility. It is therefore difficult for it to violate any directive, and therefore, any information either for or against this – such as some that has appeared in the press – is absolutely unwarranted. This is what I interpreted from the Commission’s position and what I have maintained throughout. I never said anything else, Mrs Sornosa.</p>
<p class="contents">There has also been talk in this debate about the matter of alternative plans and desalination plants. Unfortunately, I cannot answer all of that in detail due to lack of time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it is first and foremost, of course, something that must be decided in Spain itself. Taking a longer view, however, I have to say that the south’s water supply is our concern too. A question as important as this cannot be left to the Spanish alone. I can quite imagine that in 10 or 20 years’ time we shall have to be dealing with very different projects about which we dare not even think today.</p>
<p class="contents">But there is something else I should like to mention briefly, that is the growing willingness to privatise the water industry. People are thinking about it, and I expect the Commission is too. The Ministry of Economy in Berlin has now made a study of the pros and cons of these issues. Personally, I would be very reluctant to privatise water. I know that Great Britain already has experience of this, but it is at least a subject we should approach very cautiously. It would raise problems with far-reaching constitutional consequences for our Member States. To give just one small example, in Germany we have around 4 000 municipal water companies, in France 2 or 3 large companies. When we go for privatisation, this means that the small undertakings are simply bought up. That cannot be what such liberalisation is all about. It is something we surely do not want. I do not want to go into any more detail now, I have no time to do so, but I believe it is a subject we shall have to deal with more closely in the months or years ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Spanish national water plan is a general policy document to be followed by a large number of detailed projects. The national water plan is not comparable with a river basin plan under the water framework directive. Such river basin plans require as their basis a thorough analysis of the environmental impact and economic aspects – a task to be completed under the water framework directive by the end of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, a strict deterioration clause applies; impacts and measures that cause deterioration of a water body are prohibited, unless the Member State invokes one of the limited derogation clauses, which in turn are subject to meeting a range of conditions, including the environmental impact and economic analysis mentioned. Only on the basis of those facts will the Commission be able to fully assess whether the operational measures under the Spanish national water plan comply with the water framework directive and other directives, such as the bird protection or habitats directives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In our own lifetimes there have been massive and amazing advances in science and technology. New industries have appeared, become commonplace, and have provided a better quality of life, higher standards of living, new and better jobs and better working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">For Europe to keep its position in the economic forefront globally and to provide the standards we have come to expect, it has been essential for us to grasp these new technologies. Biotechnology is yet another of these industries. We ignore or side-step it at our peril. Like all new technologies, there are bound to be concerns: environmental, ethical and safety concerns. They must be fully and very openly discussed and studied with the public; they must be monitored and safeguarded by effective regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues such as privacy and confidentiality in an era of genetic predictions require further study and perhaps specific legislation. We signal this need in the report and take no predetermined position. This is for later, after proper debate. I would suggest that Amendments Nos 9 and 27 are premature in that they seek to close off such consideration and decision. It is incumbent on us to encourage our scientists, entrepreneurs and business managers to take full advantage of the potential of biotechnology and bring this potential to the people of Europe and to the world, especially the less well-provided developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">Biotechnology – the life and plant sciences which it encompasses – offers major advances in medicines and health care, to prevent and cure diseases and disabilities which for so long have blighted the lives of so many men, women and children in our constituencies and world-wide. Biotechnology offers major advances in the production of food in Europe to the advantage of farmers and consumers alike and benefits those parts of the world which struggle against drought and saline soils and fast-increasing populations. It offers crops that eliminate vitamin A deficiency and blindness for millions. It will use fewer pesticides and herbicides and therefore improve the environment and natural habitats.</p>
<p class="contents">With valuable opinions from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural and Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for which I sincerely thank their draftsmen, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has considered all the implications and decisively calls for us in Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the Member State governments to give this industry the support and commitment which it deserves and so badly needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Following several years of reticence and indecision, we are well behind our main competitors in the USA. American R&amp;D expenditure on biotechnology is three-and-a-half times that of Europe, employment is over three times and biotech revenues four times.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only the USA: Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel, Japan, Thailand, Singapore are all embracing biotechnology and actively promoting their indigenous industries. There is no time to lose if Europe is to take its proper place. We have the scientists, the research establishments and the scientific capability. We have the basis of a successful industry, with entrepreneurs, investors and business managers. But, for too long, these have been discouraged by negative and sceptical attitudes in government and political circles, public opinion and the media, by unsympathetic fiscal regimes, by a risk-averse culture and cumbersome legal structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Council promised to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. Now we look to the Stockholm Council to fulfil that promise on biotechnology, which is precisely one of the most important means for reaching that much-quoted target. We look to the Commission to rouse itself, to shed its reticence and give a resolute lead with a bio-Europe action plan. We look to the Member States to get on with the job of implementing the outstanding directives and providing the positive environment for their biotech industries to develop and prosper. Our scientists and entrepreneurs are watching intently. What happens here today, in Stockholm this month, in Brussels and the Member States in the next few months, will decide whether they emigrate elsewhere or seek their futures here in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask my colleagues in Parliament to give this report their full support. I ask the Commission to respond to it with vigour, determination and singleness of purpose.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It offers opportunities for the production of non-food goods, such as new biofuels, plastics, and so on. It offers opportunities for using fewer pesticides and having a positive impact on the environment. </p>
<p class="contents">What is essential for farmers is that they should derive some financial benefit when the new technology is introduced. That has not happened in the United States with regard to what are called first generation genetically modified products. The European aim must be to improve the financial position of farmers by achieving better quality and efficiency through the use of technology. Biotechnology could have immense importance for regional policy. It offers opportunities for regions where natural conditions are harsh. This also applies to the situation in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there are dangers associated with new technology, which are worth bearing in mind as early on as possible in any decision-making policy of the EU. Farmers may become dependent on large, multinational companies in the processing industry. To prevent the concentration of development, the EU must guarantee there are adequate public resources available for research, and support research and development in small biotechnological enterprises and plant-breeding institutes. It will be very important to guarantee competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee is satisfied with the work of Mr Purvis and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as our amendments were taken account of at the committee stage. We would hope that the Commission will read carefully those requests that appear in the report <span class="italic">inter alia </span>to measure the net impact on the environment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is probably most obvious of all within the medical sphere, but there are also opportunities in a number of other fields. However, biotechnology also raises a series of new and very difficult issues to which we must respond. These include ethical issues within the medical sphere, environmental and consumer issues in connection with the cultivation of genetically modified crops and global issues of justice in connection with patent rights and the dominance of the industry by large multinational corporations.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues must be taken very seriously if a credible overall policy is to be drawn up in this area. The opinion of the Committee on the Environment indicates some key areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Patent law must respect the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity which establishes developing countries' – indeed, all countries' – right to their genetic heritage. There must be strong, independent and open public research in the field so that there is also research into areas which are not of immediate commercial interest and into the problems and risks posed by the technology. There must also be public control of the research.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the controversial issue of the cultivation of genetically modified crops is concerned, it has to be appreciated that the adoption of Directive 90/220/EEC does not mean that there is at present adequate legislation in this area. We still do not have the necessary regulations on labelling, traceability and responsibility. Such regulations must be a precondition for considering whether to embark upon the large-scale commercial cultivation of genetically modified crops.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we would point out the risks of genetic confidentiality not being respected and of genetic profiling being misused, for example to refuse people jobs or insurance. That would lead, of course, to an increase in social inequality. We think it crucial that problems of this kind, too, should also be clarified, precisely so that the positive potential of biotechnology can be developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has presented a remarkable report and drawn attention to the great potential of biotechnology. We note that biotechnology is unable to develop that great potential particularly well in Europe. There are a number of hindrances to it in the European Union. The greatest one in my opinion is the de facto moratorium on the release of genetically modified organisms. We do not investigate which plants or organisms are particularly dangerous and therefore should perhaps not be approved; instead we do not approve any at all and no distinction is made between different organisms. This arrangement was a problem from the start. There was never a proper basis for it in law, and now it is even more of a problem because the Council and Parliament have adopted new rules for the release of genetically modified organisms, and I cannot understand why some Member States still do not want to end the moratorium. It is particularly harmful to small and medium-sized enterprises that are unable to transfer their work abroad. We have good rules for release and we can therefore end the moratorium now.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the dangers of green gene technology are much overstated. I also believe the prospects for medicinal use are overstated, that things are being painted in black and white – genetic changes in farming are bad, in medicine they are per se good. I think there are opportunities and risks in both, and that is also what the report says in item 32. Now that we have good rules for plants, we also need good common rules in medicine. There is room for improvement there.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we must set ethically-based limits for gene technology and biotechnology. We have already gone some way towards that in Europe and there is now a Committee on Human Genetics that must look particularly at this area again, because Europe is a community of values. This does not mean that we have to have the same laws everywhere, that we harmonise everything, but we must agree in Europe, too, on certain basic principles and I would like to press for that strongly.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Adam (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, this report should be welcomed for its well-rounded approach. It highlights in a factual and non-alarmist manner the enormous potential of the European biotechnology industry for assisting economic growth, for encouraging job creation and improving the competitiveness of our industries.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not all about growth. As we live longer we also need to ensure that we live better and the infirmities of older people have to be addressed. Diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, heart disease and even cancer have yet to be fully challenged by the biotechnologists. It is not only a question of living better, we have to be fitter so that older people can continue by their work to contribute to the wealth of society. Long life and a healthy life have to be earned.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that in plant, animal and human biology lie the biggest challenges of the 21st century. I very strongly support that section of the report which calls for more concrete proposals for action from the Commission and Council. We need the Commission to report on the present state of the industry and the comparisons between Member States and to give us better data for future action. The development of a plan for a bio-Europe – paralleling the e-Europe – for activities of the Commission and Member States to make the Union a competitor for the biotechnology industry is a worthy aim. The Council should also commit to biotechnology as a key new technology and the Stockholm Summit would be a useful time for them to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">The region that I represent has the lowest GDP per head of any region in the United Kingdom. It is not a comfortable position and one of the key developments in the regional economic planning is to support a company to stimulate growth in biotechnology industries. We call it Bio-Science-North. The aim is to draw on research in university departments, to establish incubator companies and stimulate growth in those that are already established. We believe that this is one of the most important instruments that we have been able to put in place in the last two or three years, with of course support from the European Regional Development Fund. I know that our region is not alone in that but I believe that this is something that all regions in the Community should be examining.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I would like to make is that we must reinforce the environmental possibilities of biotechnology. It should be recognised that it gives us tremendous opportunities for tackling pollution and reducing resource depletion and gives us opportunities in the food sector to improve the output from our agricultural industries. I hope that the biotechnology industry will get a tremendous boost from the adoption of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason we shall support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 25 and 27.</p>
<p class="contents">Biotechnology, along with information and communications technology, is among the most promising technologies of the twenty-first century; in the years ahead these sectors will provide much new employment worldwide. A precondition for this will be that the European Union develops a transparent and innovation-promoting regulatory framework, as well as an encouraging entrepreneurial climate. Up to now, the biotechnology sector has been the lame duck as regards legislation facilitating economic support. Consequently, I welcome the Anglo-Dutch initiative to make biotechnology a key priority on the Stockholm agenda. If the European Union wishes to become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge economy, it is now time to create a <span class="italic">‘B-Europe’ </span>alongside an<span class="italic"> ‘E-Europe’</span>. I am glad that the Dutch Prime Minister has realised this. Perhaps he can also persuade his party in the Netherlands parliament to withdraw its appeal to the European Court of Justice against the directive protecting biotechnological inventions. Because without sound patent legislation there will be no new investment by companies, no biotech start-ups and hence no innovation or employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that our Commissioner will inform Parliament speedily about the Stockholm summit and what has been decided there with regard to biotechnology. Perhaps he could suggest changing the acronym GMO to GEM, genetically enhanced materials, since ‘gems are precious stones’, and that is what biotechnology must become in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will say this: Mr Purvis is right about one thing. Biotechnological applications will develop rapidly in the next few years. But we do not need everything that industry would like to see for that to happen, such as patenting genes that already exist in nature, the free trade in manipulated genes, tax concessions for stock options for companies and their directors, the liberalisation of product labelling, subjective information, and the handling of biotechnology as an exclusively industrial operation, for which the EU’s Directorate-General for Enterprise in the has responsibility. Mr Purvis’s report contains many views that point in this direction, and our group cannot, therefore accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to see biotechnology as an opportunity that will open up new dimensions in science. The manipulation of nature must be approached in a more careful way than that which Mr Purvis is proposing. We have to set aside time to examine all the effects of unborn - and possibly unheard-of in nature - species and varieties on people and the rest of nature. We support the development of biotechnology and research in the field must not, for example, be allowed to be trampled on by information technology. The IT stock market bubble has now burst. We do not want biotechnology to become another such bubble, built of false expectations and empty promises.</p>

Based on a one-sided industry-oriented approach he calls on us to support the biotechnology industry. That is understandable from his perspective, in which the aim of Europe is to create wealth and employment. However, I have a number of peripheral comments to make.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no sign in the report of a balance between the advantages and disadvantages of biotechnology. The rapporteur calls the development of biotechnology good for the environment, the quality of food, health and the developing countries. However, it is very doubtful whether the developing countries will benefit. Probably they will become more dependent on the mainly Western suppliers of seed and pesticides. After all, food provision, besides being a problem of technological and biological shortcomings, is mainly a distribution issue. Unfortunately, the rapporteur imputes an exemplary function to the United States. Biotechnological agriculture there announced that it can no longer guarantee that its products are GMO-free because of cross-pollination.</p>
<p class="contents">Information on biotechnology should also reflect an even-handed balance. Leaving it to the sector leads to an entanglement of ethics and economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Ethical decisions should be taken as close as possible to the level of the citizen. That also applies to the direction of development in biotechnology. The report, on the other hand, instructs the Member States even on financial support, tax measures, education and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is premature for the rapporteur to call upon Member States to agree with a patent on life, to which there are ethical and legal objections, such as conflict with international treaties. The Netherlands and Great Britain have appealed to the Court and it is better to wait for the judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">The report gives responsibility for authorising GMOs to the European Food Authority. However, the latter has only an advisory function. Politicians remain responsible for the decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Policy for the biotechnology industry in the European Union should be based on the views of the Member States. In the light of this poor coordination, it is telling that this report should appear before the temporary Committee on Human Genetics has reported on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, it is odd that Europe, usually averse to state aid, should be calling upon the Member States to support an industrial sector. It is unclear for what reason this industrial sector deserves to receive support.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage it would have been better if the report had been restricted to cross-border industrial aspects, such as development barriers or a survey of options within the various possible policy directions, without simply advocating support.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the above misgivings, I am unable to support the report. Economic motives must not dominate moral considerations. Europe, which claims to be a community of values, should show greater sensibility in dealing with this question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an intelligent, integrated operation which interpreted and respected the different stances of the members of the committee, including their ethical concerns. For my part, as a scientist, I greatly welcome both the specific intrinsic value of the report, which, at last, places Europe on a level with the countries which invest more in scientific research, and the new horizons which are appearing in the fight to eradicate terrible diseases such as certain neurodegenerative diseases affecting the central nervous system.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in the agrifoods sector, the adoption of my amendment, which stipulates that genetically modified foods must be subject to obligatory mutagenisis, carcinogenesis and toxicity tests before they are placed on the market, will go some way towards restoring the citizens’ confidence at last, especially their faith in the institutions and the political world. I would like to thank John Purvis once again for consenting to the adoption of a number of amendments I tabled, which seek to ensure that our human resources are properly valued and enhanced, particularly young researchers, and that young researchers are offered attractive career prospects which are on a level with those offered by the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I feel that the Purvis report can be considered a valuable contribution to that complex, diverse mosaic which is the European Research Area, which, together with Mr Busquin and Mr Liikanen, we are doing an excellent job of establishing in Europe and which will make us competitive and enable us to take up this world challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is a good report.</p>
<p class="contents">Imagine if we could understand how algae produce oxygen from sunlight. Such things exist. We could imitate it. It would transform our energy industry completely. To understand that, for example, is an enormous challenge. Or look at a sea urchin’s spine under the microscope. You get a fantastic picture of how new materials might be built. To understand how that is made could dramatically change our industrial culture. We will only understand it if we are curious enough to find out, if we approach new technology, new science with curiosity and not with fear. That is John Purvis’ message and I would like to endorse it.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, as regards developing countries I would like to point out that there is one developing country that has made enormous strides in biotechnology. That is Cuba. For 40 years, Cuba has been investing in biotechnology like hardly any other country and today has a turnover in modern biotechnology of well over USD 100 million. I only want to mention that because other countries are named here. Despite all the criticism that can be levelled at Cuba in other respects, I think that is a major achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the energy industry we have tended to go the way of conventional thermodynamics. No living creature operates according to conventional thermodynamics, otherwise we would not live as long as we do. Irreversible thermodynamics, small changes, will perhaps show us a completely new way forward in energy. That is also something we need to understand. Then what we have been doing hitherto will perhaps one day be seen as an aberration. I think we should be showing a little more courage with this technology, paying attention to the risks of course, but there has never been any progress made without curiosity or courage, and the same applies for biotechnology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Biotechnology offers great opportunities, but also considerable risks.</p>
<p class="contents">We live in a democracy. That means that our citizens' fears and anxieties must be taken seriously. We can only succeed in doing this through debate and by making information easily accessible. However, we must not allow these fears concerning the risks involved in the new technology to overshadow what it potentially has to offer humanity and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that we can reduce the number of pesticides used in farming. I should prefer to focus on the possibility of using biotechnology to design new pesticides and chemicals which work where they have to work and are broken down when they have to be broken down.</p>
<p class="contents">We must have a truthful and open-minded attitude both to opportunities and difficulties. As far as food and agricultural production are concerned, we must have a deep respect for people’s clear right to information about the food they eat. Responsible and informed freedom of choice is fundamental to a democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that the report is to include paragraph 62 which addresses the protection of the individual's personal integrity whenever genetic information is used.

<p class="contents">I think these problems are the result not of a technology but of the power structures prevailing in this society. Firstly, there is twice as much food in the world as would be needed to feed everyone adequately. It is a question of distribution. Secondly, sickness is caused by environmental conditions, and these cannot be changed by technology but by changing the conditions. Thirdly, we will only get a better human being if we allow more self-determination, if we allow people more freedom, but we will not do it simply by means of a new technology.</p>

In the case of biotechnology, we must not forget that life is an exceptionally complicated physical system which has evolved over a timescale of millions of years and that, consequently, interventions which provoke change over a timescale of a few years may have unforeseen repercussions on the balance of the overall system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Purvis report completely ignores the risks and endeavours to ensure that biotechnology serves the monopolies’ interests. According to the report, the biotechnology industry should operate without restraint and beyond any form of control and its interests should come before any public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The interest in third world countries is hypocritical in the extreme, now that the pharmaceutical industry is dragging the South African government through the courts and the third world is overburdened by debt. The overall stance of the European Union is hypocritical because it has abandoned its earlier reservations precisely when the European monopolies are at the point at which they can compete with the American monopolies.

This is shown not least by the very large majority in support of the report in committee. In particular, the call for a coordinated European action plan was backed on all sides of the House and evidently also fell on fertile ground in the Council of Ministers and the Commission. Thank you very much, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting this week, the European Commission reaffirmed its desire to develop a consistent overall strategy for supporting and developing biotechnology in Europe and to present it to Parliament and the Council by the end of this year. I am particularly pleased that it is Commissioners Liikanen and Busquin who have stressed the importance of this technology for our economic and scientific future. At the same time or more or less at the same time, Heads of Government Tony Blair and Wim Kok sent a joint letter to the Swedish President of the Council calling for an economic action plan to promote the European biotechnology industry and giving due emphasis to that call with a raft of suggested measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liese has already said that we are dealing with other issues besides economic matters, and as a Parliament we shall be following all these actions closely. It is an important, essential prerequisite for the success of this action plan that all decisions should be taken on the basis of the best information available. We are therefore particularly anxious that full use should be made of the various advisory and scientific committees through which scientific and economic expertise is fed into the preparation and taking of decisions. I therefore most especially welcome the report’s call for greater use to be made of all these committees and would like to call on the Commission to make greater use than before of all the possibilities for consultation and groundwork, as we should do, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When I hear what some Members have to say, or when I read certain passages in the report, I am stunned and astounded. World hunger, unexpected climate change, protection of the environment, all these problems could be resolved tomorrow thanks to the benefits of biotechnology. I think that it would be just as naïve to simply disregard the possible risks, excesses and abuses, all the more so because we are already seeing some of them taking place.</p>
<p class="contents">The risks and excesses could either be curbed or increased depending on developments in legislation both in the European Union and internationally. I would like to make just two points. The first relates to drug patenting. We are now seeing the problems of access to generic drugs to combat AIDS in the African nations, Brazil and countries in Asia. Given the pharmaceutical industry’s propensity for the use of biotechnology in future drugs, I think that this problem will only grow worse and that we will therefore have to ensure that patent legislation does not prevent production and parallel imports of generic drugs to combat great scourges and serious diseases, which threaten the poorest nations.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to patents on genetic discoveries. I think that a clear distinction must certainly be made between patents on inventions and patents on discoveries, especially since biological riches are concentrated in the countries of the South, in tropical areas, because, otherwise, we will once again see the countries of the South being plundered so that major laboratories of industrialised nations can benefit. In any case, we must put an end to the ‘patenting of life forms’.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point, which will bring me to my conclusion, is that I believe fundamental decisions, particularly on releasing GMOs, must continue to come under political responsibility. The European Food Safety Authority will most probably play a crucial role in providing expertise, information and recommendations, but it is the competent authorities which must, on a political level, continue to authorise the release of GMOs. As long as problems such as traceability, labelling and determining responsibility for damage persist and as long as we have no guarantees on risks, I believe that we are justified in continuing the moratorium. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Purvis quite rightly emphasises all these developments. However, by almost exclusively falling into line with the approach of biotechnology companies, and by giving priority to economic and technological aspects, the report pays minimal attention to the major questions of ethics and safety, which are giving the general public so much concern.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a risk that the biotechnology industry, seen from a strictly industrial and mercantile point of view, will make all these problems worse; for example, unfair trade, environmental disasters, industrial mergers and unemployment and the increasing power of multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, therefore, find the report is too partial by far and is even prejudiced. It disregards the concerns that were even expressed in this House on GMOs. It questions the moratorium imposed by several Member States, one of which was France. I agree with what my fellow Member has just said. I think that, given all the problems we face – and since I heard you mention courage earlier – it would show courage to persevere with the precautionary principle and take time to verify the facts of the situation. While I do, therefore, acknowledge the advantages of biotechnologies, I cannot support the report as it stands. I hope that it will be amended, particularly in the light of the conclusions of the Sjöstedt report, which is, in the main, based on respect for the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Sixth Framework Research Programme, the Commission made biotechnology and genetic engineering priority areas. It is preparing a strategic communication on biotechnology to be completed by the end of 2001. I call on the Commission to do all it can to take full advantage of the contribution that biotechnology can make to economic growth and to the protection of the environment, but also to take full account of ethical, environmental and social issues, which I believe require dialogue between politicians, scientists and citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe is lagging behind the rest of the world and threatens to miss opportunities. The causes are mainly a fairly weak strategic vision, laborious approval procedures and non-transparent coordination between European and national legislation. The great value of this report is that it clearly describes where additional guarantees are required for producers, consumers, environment and health care. In that respect the report stands in a number of areas in glaring contrast to the letter addressed by the British and Dutch prime ministers Blair and Kok to the European Council. This letter is too bogged down in rather hollow rhetoric on opportunities, whereas Purvis rightly speaks up for the small and medium-sized business that is so important to Europe. In that respect, the government of my country has depressing examples of a zigzag policy, as was shown, for example, only last year in relation to the use of GM potatoes for non-food production.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the FAO has calculated that world food production will have to increase by two-and-a-half times in twenty years, and that there is insufficient scope for opening up new agricultural areas in the world. And those who, like the present Minister for Agriculture in Germany, Mrs Künast, retreat into small-scale production and organic farming, are in fact turning their backs on international society. A good balance between new techniques such as biotechnology, sustainability and their accommodation within a strategic food policy is indispensable. As far as that is concerned, a strong European food authority with supervisory and monitoring powers is in fact also indispensable for such policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I must say that with his report the honourable Member has taken an excellent first step towards a new discussion in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Purvis makes clear, it is a vital industry for the future of the European Union. It will provide jobs and opportunities for innovation with new products and new processes in such fields as agriculture, medicine and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Fifth Framework Programme we are already putting EUR 2 billion into the biotechnology industry and I hope that in the Sixth Framework Programme that will increase. But despite all that we are behind the United States, which dominates the biotechnology market in terms of revenue, R and D expenditure and even number of employees. It is between three and four times bigger than the industry in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are going to benefit from the biotechnology industry, we need to nurture the industry. We need to invest through the Sixth Framework Programme and other R and D funds. Balanced regulation is important. It is clear there has been a public loss of confidence in science and technology, scientists and engineers. The BSE and foot-and-mouth crises indicate a lack of confidence. It is also clear that there is an ethical dimension. We need public accountability and clear guidelines that command public support. In terms of research and genetic manipulation, many of us would support somatic cell repair but might have doubts about somatic cell enhancement or germ cell repair and certainly there will be grave concerns about germ-cell enhancement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable for insurance companies to refuse cover on the basis of genetic profiling or for manufacturing companies to recruit those with a low propensity to cancer for dirty jobs. We need to strike a balance between introducing regulations that will allow the biotechnology industry to thrive in the future and maintaining public confidence. Otherwise public concerns may well drive economic activity across the Atlantic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Genetic engineering applications will play a key role. I would like to thank Mr Purvis sincerely. In the last legislative term I drew attention to the importance of genetic engineering in my report on genetic engineering and its impact on agriculture. We must now at last give the green light to green genetic engineering. To stick with this theme of colours, consumers have long since given the green light to red genetic engineering, i.e. the application of genetic engineering in medicine. The advantages are tangible and easy to understand. In green genetic engineering, its application in agriculture, consumers are, as I say, sadly still showing the red light.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also show the red card to extremists. Biotechnology and gene technology must cease to be the poor relation. The EU must get on board the moving train of research and application or it will leave without us. I am worried by the trend of more and more small and medium-sized enterprises pulling out of green biotechnology and gene technology. The present EU moratorium means that while research is taking place the subsequent application of the product is not being allowed in individual countries. Undertakings, and with them jobs, are leaving Europe. In my view, the lights are on amber here. They must be allowed to change to green.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, whether we are talking about red or green genetic engineering, the ethical bounds to biotechnology and gene technology must be clearly formulated. I would like to say to the opponents of research that we have a moral obligation to use the opportunities this new technology offers for medicine and for caring for the world population as a whole. The public will give the green light to biotechnology and gene technology only if they have information and transparency with clearly marked out ethical bounds. I also appeal to industry to do their part in helping us with the public relations work so that acceptance will increase. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission supports the basic thrust of the report. We can only welcome it as a recognition of the economic, social and environmental impact of biotechnology. Biotechnology has a very important role to play in fulfilling the commitment made by the Lisbon European Council to develop a competitive, knowledge-based economy. That is also the basis for creating employment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already indicated the priority it attaches to biotechnology in its proposal for the next research framework programme. Therefore we share the report's view on the need to promote a competitive European biotechnology industry. A study on the position of the European biotechnology industry should be ready later this spring, and I shall make that available to Parliament. Further, let me say how much the Commission appreciates the report's particular merit of taking a comprehensive view on all major issues related to biotechnology. I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this successful attempt.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report to the Stockholm European Council, which takes place next week, the Commission underlines the importance of biotechnology as a frontier technology for growth and employment, and as a tool for sustainable development. The Commission also announces a broad policy paper setting up a strategic vision for life sciences and biotechnology after 2010, which will be ready by the end of this year. The policy paper and action plan will be the Commission's response to Parliament's wish for an initiative. Obviously, in preparing this policy document we can now carefully take into account the views of the European Parliament as expressed in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with those who say that we need a broad debate on the ethical and societal impacts of the issue. If and when we want to promote the biotechnology industry and its possibilities, we must always be open about it, otherwise we will not be successful. We will also base our report on the indications from the Industry Ministers’ informal meetings on 16 February and possible indications from the European Council next week. I expect the European Council will take a very strong position on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that we will have to build on expertise in many fields, as well as consulting a wide range of stake-holders. We need to hold discussions with a wide range of people: scientists, experts and citizens. There are no simple answers to the needs and questions raised by biotechnology, but it is the Commission's intention to provide – with you – a considered and comprehensive strategy before the end of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Stockholm will build on what was set out at last year's Lisbon Summit which outlined plans for a dynamic, knowledge-based and competitive economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said it before and I will say it again, jobs, jobs, jobs. That is what it is all about. Lisbon set far-reaching goals for the next decade – to create the world's leading knowledge-based economy by 2010, to create 20 million new jobs across Europe by 2010 and to promote economic and social reform which combine competitiveness and social cohesion, investing in people and raising skill levels. In simple terms, this means increasing the skills and mobility of Europe's workforce, encouraging enterprise, helping small firms and improving EU regulation. It also means boosting the EU's research and development effort and ensuring lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">This Summit is incredibly important to our citizens and we have to set out what Stockholm means for them. First and foremost, jobs is our top priority. We aim to establish a business-led skills taskforce and a jobs database to overcome the skills shortage. We must make full use of Europe's older workers, increase gender equality across the labour market, and encourage women to become entrepreneurs. Supporting SMEs is crucial for the EU to meet its employment targets, as small and medium-sized businesses provide two-thirds of all private sector jobs across Europe, and make up 98% of all businesses in the UK. The right regulatory environment, including cutting red tape, is of paramount importance to small firms and to job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we need to accelerate economic reforms and full energy liberalisation by 2003 is a priority in this agenda. Not only will this bring down prices across Europe, but it will encourage energy suppliers to be more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, all this is just a small sample of what we want to achieve at Stockholm. I very much hope that we can achieve our goals, so that, our citizens will benefit from a dynamic and competitive economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the other hand, you cannot keep any state lastingly together from above against the will of the majority of the inhabitants of a region, or maintain internationally recognised borders. Right across the area populated predominantly by Albanians run national borders they never wanted, and within Serbia and Macedonia they find themselves against their wills in the position of an ethnic minority. The Albanians believe they suffered an injustice in 1913 when a large part of their native region was not assigned to the new state of Albania that had just seceded from Turkey. Since then this has created a breeding ground for popular uprisings which aim at finally creating a Greater Albania. One way of avoiding this might be to quickly introduce a federal constitutional regulation into Macedonia, along the same lines as that which enables Flemings and Walloons to live peaceably side by side again since Belgium’s federalisation. Anyone wishing to combat nationalism must first remove its breeding ground by offering people a solution acceptable to them.

Apart from the many advantages that an integrated internal market for securities would bring, the report also contains a proposal for reform of the legislative process in securities matters which I consider to be a major step in the right direction. The present legislative process is much too long-winded and inflexible to be able to adapt to the much more rapidly changing securities markets. We simply cannot always be lagging behind market trends while at the same time setting ourselves such ambitious targets as the one decided in Lisbon, of becoming the world’s largest and most dynamic economic area within ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the broad outlines of the Lamfalussy Committee’s proposal, but I must insist on the ‘call-back’ mechanism proposed in Parliament’s resolution, which allows the European Parliament to call on the Commission to withdraw the proposals put before the Securities Committee concerning implementing measures in the event of a negative position being taken by itself or the Council. The Commission would have to comply with such a request and put forward a legislative proposal as part of the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">But the most important thing in all the squabbling about power sharing between Council and Parliament is that we should not lose sight of the objective of an integrated European securities market. We have set ourselves the year 2005 as a target date for an integrated internal market in financial services. Time is ticking by and rival markets and economies are not asleep. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This huge increase in our balance of trade deficit has little to do with the increase in oil prices.

Instead, it limits itself to repeating generalisations and to focusing on the sole objective of monetary policy, price stability and keeping inflation below the 2% limit set by the European Central Bank, without taking account of considerations concerning the real economy, particularly employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The report insists on the need to speed up the liberalisation of telecommunications, postal services, energy and transport, regardless of the consequences for employment, regional cohesion, working conditions and a high-quality universal public service. It continues to predict a healthy economic situation, despite signs that the EU’s economy is slowing down, as the rapporteur himself states, when we should be thinking about the slowdown of the US economy, the economic recession in Japan and the effects of these trends on the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report insists on the need for greater flexibility in the labour market, at a time when there are more than 14 million people unemployed in the EU and around 65 million living in poverty. There are striking inequalities in income and employment is becoming increasingly insecure, with the majority of new jobs created being temporary or part time. The report continues to insist on moving towards the euro without creating the mechanisms necessary to minimise the economic and social risks. This is all being done in the name of the inviolable principle of competitiveness and the abstract concept of the social economy of the market.</p>

Its first recommendation, and the only specific one, is to ‘demand’ that ‘all necessary steps be taken’ to keep inflation below the mythical threshold of 2%. But how can anyone have confidence in experts who think that investments represent 5,3% of the GDP in Europe, whereas, in the year 2000, the accurate figure is 20,5%? How can we accept this insistence on demanding, yet again, as always, these ‘suitable reforms’ of social security systems, and a ‘more flexible’ labour market?</p>
<p class="contents">The political hypocrisy of using the word ‘social’ to dress up an increasingly rampant capitalism is compounded here by a very foolish error. By making inflation the absolute barometer of good economic health, there is a risk that the current recovery will be stifled, and that the prospect of a return to full employment will be put off to a time which is decidedly not ‘reasonable’.

<p class="contents">The resolution contains a number of sensible statements that I would like to underscore here too, especially because they are not always written so clearly. It is quite amazing that Members of all groups are saying that the present demographic trends make suitable reforms necessary to guarantee the benefits of social security systems in an efficient and safe way and that incentives must be provided for older workers to opt to extend their working lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress how welcome it is that this Parliament takes the view that the economic and monetary policy not only of the European Union but also of the Member States should be guided by the principles of the social market economy, the main elements of that economic system being named as freedom and democracy, competition, price stability, sustainable growth, subsidiarity, solidarity and private property.</p>
<p class="contents">I also find it good, given the worrying inflationary trends in many Member States, to reiterate that all necessary steps must be taken so that the inflation rate can be kept below 2% in the second half of 2001.</p>

In 1991, to everyone’s surprise the moment suddenly arrived. The new, independent Ukrainian state, comparable in area and population with France, is now unfortunately a country in crisis. I visited the country in 1995, and saw factories at a standstill, stinking trains, dilapidated trams, beggars, money that had become worthless, and political polarisation between the Central Europe-oriented west and Russian-oriented east of the country. Things have not improved since then. A power struggle is going on uninhibited by any sense of decency, and parliamentary democracy is being given no chance to develop seriously. In general, I see no point in giving oppressive regimes money and simply hoping that things will improve as a result. The rulers of these countries are keen on the advantages of trade and subsidies, but absolutely refuse to allow openness or democracy. But the abuses in Ukraine are still less serious than those in Russia or Turkey, and resistance to them is greater. I agree that we should in this case take advantage of the opportunities for improvement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It highlights the progress made in the country’s development and in the partnership between the EU and the Ukraine, but is not afraid to refer to matters of criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to discuss three aspects. Firstly, the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1989 led to the rapid formation of sovereign independent states, a process that happened quickly, almost overnight, but which could not change the specialisation that had developed over decades or the cooperation between the various countries’ economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Although at a different pace, the process of transformation, for which the EU also pressed, went hand in hand with social breakdown and unknown poverty for large sections of the Ukraine’s population. The EU ought to attach greater importance to dealing with this problem in its cooperation with the Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">While the EU and the Member States pursued primarily market interests under the slogan of stability, little attention was paid to the cooperation established over many years between the CIS states, one might even say it was torpedoed. In its own interest, the EU should pay greater attention to this factor in future and, in its understanding of how the Ukraine fits into the world economy, should also bear in mind that other CIS states are engaged in a similar process.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Ukraine has been given a lot of advice, and in many areas this has no doubt been legitimate and helpful. But politics is always tied up with interests. And if the shaping of partnership shows a strong tendency to benefit one particular party, then there is a problem. Partnership with the Ukraine ought to promote economic stability and social security and prevent or help to reduce tension. This is where the EU’s and the Ukraine’s real common interests lie.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, no-one will dispute that the OSCE played an important role in maintaining stability in Europe during the cold war. Both sides were involved in this process and both sides gained from it. The cold war ended ten years ago, and the OSCE should now be developed primarily into an instrument for the peaceful political resolution of conflicts. But NATO is pursuing the opposite course, basing its new strategy on strength and displays of power outside the alliance’s borders, which are steadily moving eastwards, and the EU is following in its wake. I consider involving the Ukraine, which has a long frontier with Russia, in this strategy to be a very serious matter. The Ukraine – and other CIS states as well – ought to be more closely involved than in the past in political processes for the resolution of conflicts. The OSCE would be the appropriate framework for this. With the Union acquiring new external borders, this factor will be of increasing importance not least with regard to the Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to know that ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) was created in October 1998 in order to address American dominance in internet control, including DNS (Domain Name Systems) and the allocation of Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">ICANN consists of a 19-member Board of Directors, whose directors and external members are selected on the basis of criteria that will ensure a geographical balance. ICANN consists of four advisory committees, including the GAC (Governmental Advisory Committee), which includes representatives of the European Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking these factors into consideration, it would seem obvious that the European Union must invest in order to play a crucial role in the international management of the internet, and in order to strengthen the neutrality of ICANN by means of a strong presence from the European Union, in collaboration with the United States and other governments, through the Governmental Advisory Committee. It is also important that the Board of Directors of ICANN should be geographically representative. Its representatives should be elected, and Africa should now be represented, so as to ensure that all continents are represented.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise that the management structure and legal field in which ICANN develops must be based on transparency, neutrality and independence. This means that the budgetary and financing system of this organisation must be based on criteria of clarity. It is only in these conditions that the viability of ICANN can be guaranteed. The Union must make sure that ICANN observes the protocols of WIPO (the World Intellectual Property Organisation) and cooperates with WIPO in its role as a negotiator and protector of rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the rapporteur reminds us about the importance of closing the digital divide, and of providing the widest possible access to the Internet.

This is why the Movement for France delegation has not voted.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution, particularly in paragraph 32, attempts to amalgamate the issue of genetic engineering in the medical sector with the issue of biotechnology in the agricultural sector, perhaps in order to make the latter more acceptable. In reality, although both cases involve manipulating genes, the problems that arise are different. In medicine, it is a question of helping certain individuals whose lives would be seriously compromised if they were not given such treatment. In agriculture, on the other hand, the target is broad, or even undefined and infinite, since it involves setting in motion production methods which may affect the environment in general or the health of millions of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there is no doubt that genetic engineering in the medical field gives rise to ethical problems which are more serious than those elsewhere, and we note that the Purvis resolution, in paragraph 61, takes cover behind pious generalities, while avoiding specifically tackling the problem that is currently the most urgent: that of cloning for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">When voting took place, Parliament did not wish to ask directly for the abolition of the de facto<span class="italic"> </span>moratorium on the authorisation of genetically modified organisms. Nevertheless, it adopted a paragraph 34, which ‘regrets government actions to block or delay authorisation of GM products for reasons not based on objective scientific opinion’, which may amount to the same thing, depending on what one understands by the phrase ‘objective scientific opinion’. We would feel more reassured if the resolution had clearly said which government, in its opinion, was holding up these authorisations in such a blameworthy fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">Another defect in this resolution is the fact that in paragraph 36 it congratulates itself on the subject of the agreement drawn up a month ago between Parliament and the Council, on the procedure for authorising GMOs. Yet we ourselves criticised that agreement, on the grounds that it establishes authorisation procedures without establishing traceability, liability or compulsory insurance on the part of distributors. Admittedly, the resolution also calls for testing and labelling guarantees, but Amendment No 6, which lays down liability and insurance obligations, was rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as if this were not enough, the resolution calls for the European Food Safety Authority to be responsible for authorising GMOs, which we totally disagree with, because we would like each State to retain the right of international safeguard in this important field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It demands that Member States encourage private industry to penetrate further into universities and public institutions. It calls upon researchers to participate in setting up private businesses. It wants more mobility between universities and the private sector. It welcomes the progress achieved in the financial markets and is in favour of stock options. It invites businesses to play an active role in ‘informing’ the public about GMOs – as if we were not already subjected to massive ideological publicity campaigns from these industrial groups!</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution tabled by the Committee on Industry leads the way in favour of GMO production. It claims that there is no objective scientific opinion on which to base their non-authorisation. It calls for the immediate lifting of the ‘effective moratorium’ that is holding back the marketing of these products. It wants field trials to be authorised, even though this would mean the inevitable uncontrolled spread of GMOs. A few considerations on the need to draw up ‘ethical guidelines’ do nothing to hide the essential nature of this resolution, i.e. to oppose all the public movements that are currently campaigning on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, they cannot prove that there are no major drawbacks attached. Nor can opponents of a rapid deployment of biotechnology prove that the drawbacks are such that no deployment should ever take place. The truth will only emerge in the long term, perhaps in 30 or 50 years’ time. In the meantime, patience and research are called for. It is precisely that kind of patience that is lacking in Mr Purvis’s proposal. On the contrary, following on from what was discussed here last month in relation to the Bowe report, he wants to make it difficult for Member States to maintain the moratorium independently. His aim is to give scope for rapid commercial use wherever possible. It is remarkable that the parties grouped in the PPE, which call themselves Christian, are here throwing the door wide open to something, while they are still completely unsure as to whether they will have to explain it in retrospect as an improvement on God’s creation or as a further contribution to its progressive destruction. Instead of focusing all criticism on therapeutic cloning and voluntary euthanasia, it would have been more natural for these parties to be more critical on this of all points.

Our citizens have challenged us in the field of food production to safe food, with the guarantee of adequate precautions to ensure this goal and proper liability and penalties in place for any violation resulting in damage to the person on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are presently living with the tragic devastating results of BSE and FMD and there is a consensus in the EU that we must re examine the very basic of our agriculture industry: There is presently a united call for re examination of the CAD and organic food production in being promoted and supported within our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of these considerations, I believe the EU must exercise extreme caution in embracing the biotechnology industry without the outmost care and precautions being in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The US, a front runner in the field of biotech Industry is itself dealing with the difficulties of rapidly progressing GM food production sector where private sector involvement has lead to a market place dominated by global companies and the devastation of small producers who cannot compete with ‘corporate’ farming. The SME's of Agriculture do not appear to have been protected or supported in the world of GM food production.</p>
<p class="contents">I must vote against the Purvis report on a number of points. I believe that the promise of solving illnesses, increasing yield and cleaning up the environment etc remain to be proven. Indeed in the US, it is my understanding that many GM crops have been shown not to increase yield but even to possibly decrease yield. Widespread genetic engineering of crops and food will surely lead to further intensification of agriculture and what of the health risks from GM products; the EU Commission has banned the use of BST (genetically engineered Bovine Growth Hormone used to increase milk production in the US) for health reasons. BST is not allowed in any other country apart from the US. There is a documented large increase in allergies to Soya which is now 50% GM.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the suggested lifting of the Moratorium on GM crops, gene transfer is now a proven fact. In my own country of Ireland what hope is there of protected non-GM crops from contamination of this kind? How will we be able to pursue organic food production in crops such as wheat and the cereals?</p>
<p class="contents">How can we determine if future proposals for labelling and monitoring are adequate when we do not, as yet, know exactly what they are to be?</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the Cartagena Protocol, it must be aid that our own European Commission tried to resist clauses to introduce Cartagena into the Directive 90/220.</p>
<p class="contents">This report unfortunately dismisses organic food, as being at present incapable of providing enough food for Europe as it's not cost effective. Organic producers assure me that they refute this statement.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many other points including an almost unrestricted Patenting system that force me to vote against this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as the ethical problems surrounding genetic engineering, the US model we are using as a benchmark has without doubt, led to the breakdown of the protection of the dignity of the human being. We are now faced with some members of our human family being used as objects for research, and the cloning of children at the embryonic stage is imminent within our own European Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, having said that, I must admit that I am suspicious of a certain utilitarian philosophy which tends to affirm that the ends justify the means and that, ultimately, we should just let the operators get on with it and the market will sort it all out.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also suspicious of an ideology of progress, which was what also inspired the Nazis and Stalinists, and feel that the ethical concerns surrounding this issue are not of secondary importance but should take centre stage because biotechnologies touch on the very heart of life in all its mystery and sanctity. Biotechnologies are a vast sector, which ranges from the innocent use of natural fermenting agents, used since the dawn of mankind to make bread and beer, to the genetic engineering of human beings, which touches on the very essence of mankind in all its intimacy and heredity, leaving behind individuality in a bid to achieve immortality.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Purvis’s report is immensely enthusiastic on the subject of biotechnologies, from which he expects wondrous benefits for mankind; to be fair, he does refer to the risks inherent in biotechnologies and to the ethical problems which they raise, but I should like to draw your attention to the fact that, so far, these benefits have yet to be proven. For now, the benefits seem to be assets for the companies alone and the risks appear to be liabilities for our citizens and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall close by quoting from two small articles in Mr Purvis’s report which deserve to be highlighted:</p>
<p class="contents">Article 60: [the European Parliament] wishes the technology to be exploited to the benefit of society in accordance with the fundamental values and ethical principles of European citizens, their culture and civilisation, and to this end sees the need to develop ethical guidelines;</p>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Parliament’s report, drafted by Mr Purvis, does not address these issues and, dangerously, acts as a biased mouthpiece for all the interests of the huge multinationals in the sector. It follows an approach that supports, in the name of good causes, the liberalisation and increasingly widespread use of products, not all the consequences of which for the environment and human health are known, quite apart from the fact that these actions also raise far-reaching ethical issues, such as genetic modifications and the patenting of life and the environment, which is the heritage of everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach of squeezing profit from everything, without careful assessment, leads the industry, in order to compensate for high research costs, to try to put onto the market products whose safety cannot be guaranteed and which, furthermore, create an economic dependency on the part of their users, which is what is happening in agriculture with GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in terms of medicines and patenting them, developing countries and the poorest parts of the population are being excluded, which is what is happening, unacceptably, as a result of the behaviour of multinationals in Brazil and South Africa.</p>

If we consider that in South Africa 50% of new AIDS cases are young persons under the age of 25, that means that a 15 year-old in South Africa today has a 50% risk of infection, and if we consider the effects of that situation – that the most active section of the population is affected – on those young people and also on the country’s development, then I think it is long overdue that we say something on the subject and send a signal in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to encourage and create fair access to medicines and vaccines. We therefore greatly welcome Commissioner Lamy’s position and that he will give his backing to the developing countries and their right to a protection clause in the WTO and TRIPS Agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We must press for these life-saving drugs to be made available as cheaply as possible. For Europe, this means supporting the transfer of technology and local production capacity.

In this, preconditions, such as a sound local infrastructure and stability play a crucial role in the approach to health care. Drugs have an optimum effect if continuity in dispensing and expert supervision in treatment are guaranteed. Otherwise there is a real risk of incorrect or inadequate treatment. The combating of AIDS requires the structural improvement of local health care conditions and support from the World Health Organisation, and the work of the European Union directed to that end is therefore of the greatest importance. Only these factors will guarantee long-term development. In the short term many people are already dying, and for that reason a priority choice for affordable drugs now is advisable, as is rightly argued in the resolution.</p>

<p class="contents">This is a fundamental problem and I am doubly delighted that the main groups in Parliament have agreed on a joint text which sends out a very strong message. The first message is directed at the pharmaceutical industries, calling on them to withdraw their case against South Africa, which is important, and the second message is that we want a clear interpretation within the framework of the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property, or even for the agreement to be revised. We must certainly welcome the fact that the European Commission, represented by Mr Lamy, has undertaken to pursue this course and I therefore subscribe to what the previous speakers have said.</p>
<p class="contents">One last figure to conclude: as far as AIDS is concerned, patented drugs cost about one hundred times more than generic drugs, which have the same effect but which are manufactured in countries where patents are not yet the norm. This applies to India in particular. This should make us seriously aware of the advantages of having a system to protect intellectual property in an area such as this, where it is vital for people to have access to medication. I think that this process will re-launch the debate, as will the interesting position to be taken by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A duty to revolt for the 34 million people with AIDS, most of whom – over 4 million sufferers – live in South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">What could be more normal, in the face of a catastrophe which everyone agrees is a humanitarian, health, demographic, economic and social catastrophe, than to want to do everything to save one’s own people. Must we reiterate that, thanks to various treatments, we have considerably prolonged and improved the life of patients in the west, while in Africa and Brazil AIDS sufferers are dying because only 5% of them can obtain treatment due to the excessively high cost of drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why South Africa passed a law in 1997 so that its sufferers could benefit from suitable care. I think it is irresponsible for the pharmaceutical industry to block this legislation. During this period, 400 000 South Africans have contracted AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">In using the WTO to attack Brazil, which – by using its own treatment – has almost halved its AIDS epidemic, the United States have demonstrated an equally unfortunate cynicism. Not only should these proceedings be abandoned; more importantly, we should urgently help revise international trading rules so that they benefit human health. Mothers of families with no access to AZT are bringing babies into the world who already have AIDS and are condemned from the day they are born. Is that the humanitarianism and solidarity which inspires our resolutions? </p>
<p class="contents">I think, Mr President, that we need to retaliate against the indifference of the 34 pharmaceutical companies and affirm the principle of exemption for reasons of health. If this principle is not applied, we shall call on the Commission to suspend the investment aid granted to all the European companies until such time as they withdraw their complaint against South Africa. And then we should push for a World Solidarity Fund to be set up and cofinanced by the pharmaceutical industry. Because, faced with their indifference and given the huge profits which they make, we should force them to invest in research and invent a vaccination as a matter of absolute priority.</p>

A tragedy because the scale of the problem in South Africa, where millions of people suffer from AIDS, is almost impossible to grasp. South Africa is one of many countries contending with this problem. Ninety-five per cent of those infected with HIV live in developing countries. Africa has over 25 million AIDS patients, and South Africa 4 million. By 2010, life expectancy in Africa will fall by 20 years. In South Africa, half of all young people already run the risk of dying from this disease. It is a tragedy that all these countries have to cope with.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the dilemma of the pharmaceutical industry, which has meanwhile developed drugs that have reduced the number of deaths from AIDS in Europe and the US by 75%. But those drugs are so expensive – in Dutch terms, NLG 30 000 a year per patient – that they are out of reach and unaffordable for African AIDS patients. Hence it is understandable that these African countries should look for solutions, for instance imitation drugs and parallel imports. After all, the lives of millions of people are at stake. The price varies from NLG 30 000 to NLG 450.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view a court case is not the right way of solving problems. Solutions must be sought through discussion, as has happened meanwhile in Senegal, the Ivory Coast and Uganda, where five pharmaceutical companies are working with three governments on considerably cheaper drugs. For that matter, the pharmaceutical industry often exaggerates its costs: after all huge profits are also made in this sector, especially on cosmetics and on products like tranquillisers and vitamins. AIDS drugs constitute only a fraction of sales. We therefore advocate the dropping of the court cases in South Africa and the finding of an acceptable solution, and therefore ask the Commission to retract its previous letter to the South African government in which the case brought by the pharmaceutical industry is supported, and to do its utmost to ensure the application of the TRIPS scheme in the WTO. Europe must opt for solidarity with the AIDS patients and not for the rights of the strongest and wealthiest.</p>

You need funding for infrastructure, to test the patient, to diagnose and to monitor his progress. Then you have the access to medication. Of course price is important. The pharmaceutical companies have brought their prices down. But what is important, even if it is USD 10 for medication, do we have the will to fund the procurement? We are getting too emotional about this. Let us be sure that we have a strategy for funding the purchase. Governments in these poor countries do not have the funds, even if it is only USD 10 for treating a patient.</p>
<p class="contents">The good news is that the prices have come down and they can come down even further if we get the pharmaceutical companies on our side. The bad news is that we need the funding to be organised. I hope, as rapporteur, to devise a package that is deliverable and will benefit the poorest who are suffering, without being emotive, without recommending a solution that requires billions in funds, which I know will not be forthcoming.</p>

The fight against AIDS in Africa must therefore be given the highest priority. Essential drugs for AIDS and other serious diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, must be made available in developing countries free or at very low, and hence affordable, prices. For that reason I wholeheartedly support the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we must lend our urgent and unambiguous support to the South African government in its battle for cheap drugs. But we cannot combat AIDS with cheap medicines alone, I agree completely with the previous speaker on that point. Medical infrastructure is required, so that drugs can be dispensed in controlled conditions. Many more laboratories with competent staff must be set up. In addition, simple things like refrigerators are needed. But that is still not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The social infrastructure must also be called upon: women’s organisations, trade unions, schools; we must involve these much more in the battle against life-threatening diseases. So a great deal of money is needed, and also a new initiative. I propose the setting up of a European partnership, financed with European and national funds made up of public and private contributions, a combination of research money and funds for development aid. The research money must be used for scientific research, the development aid money on the construction of social and medical infrastructure. This concerted effort will make it possible to take decisive steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">This topic will remain on our agenda for some months to come. I look forward to broadly based cooperation in this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am basically referring to what my colleagues, Commissioners Nielson and Lamy, have already said at previous sessions.</p>
<p class="contents">For more than a year now the Commission has been strongly committed to addressing the urgent need for action on communicable diseases which have a dramatic effect on the lives of so many, in particular those most vulnerable living in the poorest countries or regions of the world. The Commission agreed one communication on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of accelerated reaction in September last year and recently adopted the subsequent programme for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Community policy framework is being discussed in many international fora and also at national and regional level with the developing countries, civil society, industry, the European Parliament, Member States, UN agencies, the US government, G8 and many others. This process of consultation will continue for some time until the Commission formulates specific work plans with all the partners involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In these discussions the issue of affordability of key pharmaceuticals often takes the most prominent position. This may be at the cost of the urgent attention still needed for prevention, for strengthening the health systems in developing countries and for long-term solutions to the problems, which means the development of an AIDS or malaria vaccine.</p>
<p class="contents">In our new policy framework we tried to combine the different levels of intervention needs in terms of both prevention and care, and even cure in the cases of malaria and tuberculosis, and in terms of country, regional, international or global level.</p>
<p class="contents">Addressing the issue of affordability of medicines should never exclude the focus on prevention efforts, nor negatively affect the debate on research and development. All these areas are complementary and we will continue to address them in a complementary, comprehensive manner, not allowing one to be played off against the other.</p>
<p class="contents">We strongly support the international commitment to tier pricing as the most efficient way in the short term to increase affordability of medicines. The Community will support, through its technical and development assistance programmes, the reinforcement of pharmaceutical policies and global production capacities in developing countries as a medium-term means of increasing affordability.</p>
<p class="contents">We would insist on keeping the debate on a broader level, including targeted action in favour of those millions who suffer and die from malaria and tuberculosis, and who, like those infected by HIV or living with AIDS, simply cannot afford to pay for medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, treatment for malaria and tuberculosis – however problematic – exists. It costs between USD 10 to 25 to treat a malaria patient and USD 11 to treat a patient suffering from tuberculosis. HIV/AIDS involves medicines which are priced way above the potential of the poorest and most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would urge Parliament not to lose sight of the need for the development of an AIDS and malaria vaccine. The crisis will continue to prevail and become even worse if prevention efforts are not sustained. It will take some time before vaccines are developed and available. However, we are on the right track and we urgently need to make progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">O'Toole (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner, the sad point that I have to make at the outset is that the statues have now been destroyed and so we have been overtaken by events. Nevertheless, as a funereal action and as a warning to the world, our resolution holds considerable resonance. Certainly the suppression of women's rights in Afghanistan continues apace. I come from a different cultural and religious tradition to those who created the Bamiyan Buddha statues in the 2nd century, but I feel that all of us share a common ownership of our heritage and the right to free movement, education and employment regardless of gender.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming particularly to the statues, this destruction was much more than just a mindless act of violence by a regime that apparently intends to catapult us back into the Middle Ages. All of us, whatever our creed, nationality, or political viewpoint, lost an irreplaceable piece of the common heritage that binds us together on this earth.</p>
<p class="contents">A founding principle of the European Union is that religious and cultural tolerance is integral to a democratic and civilised society. This debate therefore not only registers our disgust with the Taliban, it is also a reminder that there are forces we need to guard against. The Taliban may see the destruction of the Buddhas simply as the shattering of stones. But we in Europe know better. We know that the burning of books meant much more than the burning of books. It signified something else entirely. In commending my resolution to the House, I hope therefore that we in the Union will continue to work with all the governments and other agencies which sought to prevent this action and that together we can prevent any further catastrophes of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold"> Dupuis (TDI).</span></span>   - <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that, as Mrs Garaud said, we need to clarify straight away that this is not predominantly a resolution on the statues, it is a resolution on the situation in Afghanistan. As you know, the whole population is being held to ransom by fanatical clerics and the episode with the statues is just the umpteenth example of the fanatical nature of this regime, a regime which lives and thrives within these <span class="italic">madrasas</span>, these so-called schools which, at the end of the day, only teach one thing: intolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing which I think is important is that we have to dispel the widespread view that nothing much can be done about Afghanistan. I think the contrary is true. I think there are some very specific things which can be done. I can name three.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is probably the most important: Commissioner, the European Union, i.e. the Commission, should take an extremely firm stance vis-à-vis Pakistan because, without Pakistan, there would be no Taliban. That is an absolute basic. The Union must therefore make clear that, if Pakistan persists, as it is doing, in helping and supporting the Taliban, there will be no prospect of developing relations between the European Union and Pakistan.</p>
<p class="contents">A second possible line of action, for which we can, I think, thank a forerunner in our Parliament, General Morillon, consists of giving firm support to General Massoud over and above any hypocrisy. We cannot keep hiding behind alibis. It is, I think, the only organised resistance against the regime in place and we need to give it teeth.</p>
<p class="contents">The third line of action, which will perhaps seem a little more indirect, but which is just as basic, concerns aid given by the United Nations - fairly indirectly but not as indirectly as all that ­ via the UNDCP, the United Nations Drug Control Programme headed by Mr Arlacchi. The UN has given the Taliban substantial aid through programmes which profess to eradicate crops but which, in fact, do no more than shift them a few hundred metres or a few kilometres, to the point that the Taliban have had access both to UN subsidies and to the profit generated by cultivating banned substances. So we need to get the UNDCP with its back against the wall. I think that we also need to campaign to prevent Pino Arlacchi from being re-elected in June. This man needs to go home and study sociology and relieve us of his presence in an organisation of such importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN and the European Union, which is funding this programme, and the Member States, which fund the UNDCP, should therefore insist that all aid programmes to Afghanistan to eradicate drug crops be abolished. We should also persuade the Russians who have infiltrated Mr Arlacchi’s entourage and who have a certain number of dubious connections to say the least - and I shall not say more - to go home and let us clean up the management of this specialised United Nations programme and, in doing so, stop helping the regime in place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women who almost float along, who are kept apart by curtains on public transport, who are obliged to give up their jobs … time and time again they are kept apart, and time and time again they are humiliated, abused and sold short. This is why people are actually forced to move home, to emigrate in the face of the inhuman conditions prevailing in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">What must be done to get the Taliban to reconsider? In practical terms it is too late for many statues. That is a very tragic fact and in my view it is to be greatly welcomed that the international community protested against this iconoclastic fury of 2001. This protest came not only from the West or from the Dalai Lama, but also from their own fellow-Muslims, who realised that this was a matter of cultural heritage and not purely religious symbols. The protest was vociferous. It is to be welcomed that at the same time the discriminatory and inhuman treatment of women in Afghanistan is receiving the attention it has long deserved: there should be worldwide protest against this too.</p>
<p class="contents">This regime discriminates not only against its own women: the local correspondent of the BBC, herself a woman, has just been deported. Her criticism of the iconoclasm was too stinging and so the press bureau, which had existed since 1950, had to close. I am not very optimistic, not to say pessimistic about the Taliban heeding these resolutions. Hopefully no one will take it into his head to support them financially or by supplying weapons. It just shows you what can happen when dogma becomes law. It is to be welcomed that we, as the European Parliament, are responding. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fully supports this resolution.</p>

I would like to highlight these two points in our joint resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Heritage’ is not the right word to use because of its significance. I would prefer to take up the distinction made two days ago in a daily newspaper by a French philosopher, Jean Luc Nancy, between the symbol and the idol. The symbol represents the human being, whose capacity for truth will never be extinguished. The nature of the symbol in this case are statues which also serve as idols. The idol is the total yet limited presence of the symbol itself. It is perhaps the inverse representation of the symbol. But, in both cases, the symbol and the idol merge into the image and the ability of the human being to transcend itself. In terms of both nature and symbol, women in Afghanistan are totally deprived.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain what I mean by deprivation. Rather than describe it, I will talk about it in the appropriate terms. The word ‘discrimination’ in our joint resolution, as in the Council joint declaration of January and the texts of the UN and of the international institutions, disturbs me because discrimination operates in a space where a common minimum is allowed for there to be discrimination. Discrimination is a natural corollary of exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we have women who are denied access to employment and education and who are excluded from public life. This is called rejection. These are the words we must use.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it hard to believe that hanging and public beatings are the result of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that I believe we have become mired in a form of language, which I do not find very suitable and, as Members of the European Parliament, we must be very careful about this. This is because behind all this, all these words, behind this international language, which uses the same words to describe democracy in the West and for our Western democracies as it does to describe what is happening in Afghanistan, lies our capacity for doing anything at all. Who is protecting the Taliban? Who is supporting them? Pakistan. Who is protecting them? Do I have to answer? Can you answer with me? Why did we go to fight against Saddam Hussein? Why have we imposed sanctions against Iraq? Why do we not take sanctions against Afghanistan? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the orders of Taliban chief Mohammad Omar, the two world-famous Bamiyan Buddha statues have been completely destroyed regardless of all international protests. These millennia-old treasures that are part of our common cultural heritage are irreplaceable. Not even the promise of further aid for this totally impoverished country could deter the self-styled warriors of God from their scandalous acts. They control Afghanistan, drive out dissenters, exploit the country, human rights are trampled under foot, women are denied the opportunity to go to school, as my fellow Members have pointed out, and they are not allowed to appear in public. It is like living in the Middle Ages. The Koran says that freedom of religion and conscience together with justice are central elements of Islamic social order. These commandments have been misinterpreted by the mullahs, an abuse that is unpardonable. The Taliban’s closest ally, Pakistan, intervened without success. Commissioner, the European Union must act here.

<p class="contents">Firstly, it is unacceptable for us to support what I would call a lawless area, where there is no recognition of the basic aspects of human welfare. I do not think that Europe will ever be able to allow this situation and I believe that each and every one of us, whatever their attachment, can sympathise with it, given the two examples that Mrs Fraisse already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is clear that the abolition of many symbols, representing what men and women might believe in, is crucially significant, but what is even more serious is the fact that denying any dignity for women’s rights must stir us into action. This is obviously a serious point and it certainly needs to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to Islam. I believe we must have the courage to say that some people, who have a good understanding of Islam, have denounced the current situation in Afghanistan. By invoking Western values we must not deny this truth, which is that a certain number of men and women who are devoted to Islam oppose the events which are unfolding today in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the message that ideas and convictions can peacefully coexist, which must be adopted by Europe, must be disseminated far and wide. So, there must be no demonisation, simply the desire to take action.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, point 12 of our resolution calls on the United Nations to rapidly establish an independent committee of inquiry. We must arrange a meeting. If the United Nations does not have either the determination or the courage to establish this committee of inquiry, it may fall to the European Parliament to take the initiative on behalf of our shared values and set up such a committee. That is what is expected of Europe: it has its values; it is tolerant; it must demonstrate its determination, perhaps such a meeting has already been arranged. If the United Nations does not act, it is up to us to do so. However, we are sending a very clear message to the Taliban and I hope I have succeeded in obtaining your support.</p>

<p class="contents">The observers concerned were quick to point out that this indignation was rather late in coming and that it could have been voiced when the Taliban took power because of the archaic and barbaric regime which they established in defiance of the most basic rights of the Afghan people.</p>
<p class="contents">This criticism cannot be levelled at the European Parliament which has taken action several times over, the last occasion being on 30 November 2000, when it condemned the regime as forcefully as it could and set alarm bells ringing regarding the tragic humanitarian situation experienced by the entire population.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, our Parliament welcomes the common positions adopted on 22 January, and particularly those adopted on 21 February this year, but we think the time has now come to openly give all the necessary political aid to the very forces on the ground that continue to fight under Commander Massoud. I would very much welcome a clear response on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as you know, we are also concerned about the tragic situation which, according to the Under-Secretary General responsible for humanitarian affairs at the UN, is threatening one million people in Afghanistan with famine. I also asked you about this during the previous debate in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">May I ask you what the current situation is with regard to the aid that the European Union can give to all the populations under threat, including those of the North and the more isolated populations? Do you not think that parachuting food into these areas could and should be considered?</p>

It now appears from the press reports, that in defiance of appeals from world leaders, the UN General Assembly and international organisations including the EU, the statues have indeed been destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community despite its unanimity on this issue has been helpless to intervene, other than through direct appeals to Mullah Omar to reconsider. He has been unwilling even to meet the representative of UNESCO, who travelled to Kandahar to see him. The EU Troika has also sought a meeting from Islamabad without success. The Taliban faction is isolated by UN sanctions and has been consistently informed by the international community that military victory will not bring diplomatic recognition for the Taliban organisation in Afghanistan. Only a peace settlement involving all the parties to the current conflict can be the basis for lasting solutions to the tragedy of Afghanistan and its people.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly acts of cultural vandalism of the kind that appeared to have been carried out in Bamiyan this week are no encouragement to the international community to engage in dialogue with this group. Meanwhile human tragedy in Afghanistan continues, thanks to the effects of the worst drought in the country in 30 years and of course the ongoing conflict which has continued throughout the winter. It is now estimated that there are at least half a million displaced persons inside Afghanistan. In recent months, 170 000 have left Afghanistan for refugee camps in Pakistan and there are estimates that 1 000 people a day are crossing the borders from Afghanistan to Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">On the ground, the Commission, through ECHO and through its budget to aid for uprooted people, continues to provide humanitarian assistance via UN agencies and NGOs both inside Afghanistan and in Iran and Pakistan, including for demining. This totalled more than EUR 400 million over the past ten years. ECHO has already committed EUR 2.5 million for assistance to IDPs in Afghanistan and refugees in Pakistan this year. Further support for drought and conflict affected areas is planned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This democracy was to lead to an independent judicial system and separation of political and judicial powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty years after Zimbabwe’s independence, we can only establish that the Mugabe government has not achieved a great deal. The economy is in decline and, as for human rights, it is questionable whether the present situation is so much better than twenty years ago. But what is most surprising, is the fact that the rest of Africa, especially South Africa, is looking on in silence. My group is of the opinion that the European Commission must come down as hard on this regime as it did on any other regimes in southern Africa which rode roughshod over people’s rights. If not, this problem might well contaminate the rest of Africa, which could have disastrous consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It simply cannot afford a war, but instead of withdrawing from it, it seems that the Zimbabwean government has chosen to create new problems for itself and look for scapegoats. The way in which the land reform has been handled has made the economic and social situation even worse, and now that the success of the opposition parties, despite all intimidation attempts which we have witnessed with our own eyes, has become apparent, Mr Mugabe is resorting to human rights violations. Zimbabwe is not only in chaos, it is under a reign of terror. A Head of State who plunges his own country into chaos, and persecutes his own people does not really deserve our respect. The dialogue between the European Union and Zimbabwe must, therefore, in the context of the ACP, be employed to reverse this situation. We therefore understand that any official contact with Mr Mugabe is only acceptable to the extent that it is aimed at reinstating the rule of law and human rights, and takes place within the framework of the peace negotiations in Central Africa. In that sense, we distance ourselves from Paragraph 16 of the compromise resolution, because we make allowances for the Belgian government, the French President and Commissioner Nielson who received President Mugabe in the framework of those peace negotiations. We will therefore support the amendment from the liberal group, but our population and the people of Zimbabwe do expect to see results very soon. We expect the pressure to be stepped up in such a way that the cynical stance of Mr Mugabe, who is indeed still receiving support from his old companions, will be brought to an end and the rule of law restored instead.</p>

They told me that Zimbabwe is going through hell. Europe's efforts at quiet diplomacy just have negative results. Mugabe presides over a state that day in and day out subjects innocent Zimbabweans to untold misery, murder, brutality and intimidation. They pleaded for the same standards of democracy, the rule of law and human rights to be applied in Africa, as would be expected in Europe. They told me that they do not want some second-class status in these matters. They would like to see Mugabe arrested as soon as he sets foot in a European state. Instead, it seems there is one standard in Europe for handling right-wing dictators and another for socialist tyrants and terrorists, such as Mugabe. Instead of handcuffs he gets champagne in Brussels and Paris.</p>
<p class="contents">In our strong resolution, thoroughly approved by the MDC representatives we have seen today, we condemn Mugabe and his regime and call for suspension of EU assistance directed through Zimbabwe government channels, identification of Mugabe's extensive overseas assets, invocation of the Cotonou Article 96 procedures and insistence that the Zimbabwean government respect its own laws. Our message is clear. I commend the resolution unamended to the House.</p>

They have been tortured in the past and their colleagues have been killed. At lunch they told me very calmly: ‘We are here but when we go back we are going to be arrested and killed. We have passed our sell-by date: we were supposed to have been killed two weeks ago.’</p>
<p class="contents">We are sitting here, wringing our hands, writing resolutions, talking about human rights but, at the same time, we seem to have double standards. If black people kill other black people, we avert our eyes and let them get on with it. It is all right for a right-wing dictator like Pinochet to be arrested for human rights violations in Chile. Why do we treat people with a different skin colour in a different way? We are supposed to have one standard for all. We are supposed to be not only a global economy but a one-world family.

<p class="contents">What is clear is that Zimbabwe is in chaos. Human rights there are being trampled underfoot. Do we now need to erect a cordon sanitaire, which effectively means there will be no dialogue? No. We do need a cordon sanitaire but one which clearly expresses what we want to achieve when we meet with these interlocutors. I would like to say to the last speaker that there was no champagne in Brussels. There was a reminder of resoluteness and there was a reminder of values, because if we want to safeguard the interests of the people of Zimbabwe, we must continue to get our position across to everyone, including the authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, what I am asking is that the amendment we have tabled and which highlights the fact that we must invoke the law each time and we must specify what actually the scope of human rights is. This is an important element. So, let us not condemn those who defend this point of view, but let us call on the entire European Community – be it the Commission, the European Parliament or the Member States – to reiterate just how important human rights, and the law itself, are in this very sensitive area. That is why I sincerely hope that the European Parliament will vote in favour of the amendment we have tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, he is unwilling to listen to advice, whether it comes from his own country or from abroad, unless it is accompanied by concrete measures. That is why we are urging the EU to suspend all cooperation directed through government channels. It is also important to send Mr Mugabe the message that Europe no longer has a relevant political camp to act as his political sponsor.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would also like to hear the Commission and the Council speak the same clear language. It is true that bilateral cooperation for development has been greatly scaled down, but I would ask the Council presidency to make the necessity of joint action clear to the Jospin Government in particular. If France wants more influence in the region, it must back the forces of the future. In this part of Africa civil society sometimes manages to overcome autocratic structures unaided, and then they remember who in Europe backed the wrong horse. Please do not let us wait for everything to fall apart down there.</p>

I am motivated to do so because the shock waves and repercussions of what is happening in Zimbabwe have reached even my constituency in the in Yorkshire in the North of England in a number of ways in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">It started with a visit from a young Zimbabwean with our local asylum seekers' organisation. He was an active member of the MDC. He and his fiancée had fled in fear of their lives, first to South Africa and, finding that not safe, they had come to the UK, but unfortunately his fiancée is likely to be returned. We do not know to what, but we can suspect.</p>
<p class="contents">Then last week in Ripon in Yorkshire, I was asked to share a platform with a Member of the Zimbabwean Parliament, a shadow minister. Quietly spoken, he told of his aspirations for his country, a country of great potential but where, as we have heard, democracy and human rights are now denied and the rule of the law flouted. He told how he had been beaten, how he feared daily for his wife and his family and, just as we have also heard, he feared what would happen to him when he returns on 17 March.</p>
<p class="contents">When people are fleeing for their lives across the world and when democratically elected politicians are in fear of their lives, Europe needs to make a response that this is not acceptable. I believe our resolution is clear and I hope it gets the support it deserves.</p>

The reason why this topic is on the list of urgent questions today is because, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian government and pledges of President Arap Moi from Kenya, there is a chance of breaking the deadlock in this case in the short term. All it needs now is a little nudge from this European Parliament to guide it onto the right track. But the fact that we are discussing this case here today should not make us oblivious to the fact that the Limet case is only the tip of the iceberg. Many of us are involved in cases of parental abduction, sometimes even as a country’s go-between. I myself know of many dozens of cases of parents in Belgium whose children have been kidnapped and taken to Tunisia, Morocco, Lebanon and even to America, and also in the European Union many children are denied the right to one of their parents. Only recently, I was reading a report which stated that, in 1999 alone, cases were recorded under the Convention of The Hague involving more than 1 800 children. And that is only covering the 47 countries which have ratified the Convention and excluding the cases which are being considered under the Convention of Luxembourg. All these children are entitled to both their parents, and the European Parliament has ensured that this is clearly spelled out in the EU’s Fundamental Rights Charter, promulgated in Nice, even more clearly than in the Convention of New York. And that is another reason for making sure that this Charter is included in our Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that approval of this resolution will help guarantee the Limet children their right to both parents, but I am just as much convinced that the European Parliament, and the Commission too, I hope, will need to take many more initiatives in order to restore the rights of all these other children and parents. I am convinced that this House has the political will to carry this through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although it only deals with one case, it still reflects the issue which has a European and even international dimension. These are facts that are, unfortunately, increasingly common and which constitute a violation of the international treaties. It has a devastating effect on the life of a father or mother, of children and of an environment. Mr Limet has now been fighting for his children for more than two years. He had been given custody over his children, but they were abducted by his ex-wife and taken to Kenya. The mother of the children was recently found guilty of abduction and given a one year unconditional sentence, but despite the legal steps and mediation by both the Belgian and European political authorities, especially Mr Prodi, the chances of Mr Limet seeing his children again are as good as non-existent. A solution is therefore needed and, where this particular case is concerned, I would ask the Commission and the Council to call on the Kenyan government to ensure that justice ultimately prevails. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are all familiar with the many conventions, Article 24 of the EU’s Fundamental Rights Charter, the treaties of The Hague, and the many real-life cases, as Mrs Van Lancker mentioned a moment ago. I can foresee two large obstacles which will stand in the way of finding solutions. First of all, many of the existing agreements between countries, and even within the European Union, are different and not harmonised, as a result of which it becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reach a solution. This is therefore something we need to work on. Secondly, if a parent who kidnaps a child is domiciled in Germany, for example, but actually lives in Greece, then a solution is often ruled out. That means that the professional NGOs, of which Belgium has many, have to start their own investigations and try to track down children and bring them home. That is why the Group of the Greens/Free European Alliance hopes that this resolution will not be swept under the carpet but may signify the necessary step forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First I wish to reassure other victim parents, some of whom have expressed concern that this resolution deals with a particular case, that their tragedies too are just as important to me. My primary concern today is to ensure that the channels of communication, which seem to be opening for the first time since the onset of the Limet tragedy, are strengthened and that progress can be made to return the children to their home as soon as possible. This is the primary aim of this resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">All too often in Member States, the abduction of a child is treated by the police and other authorities simply as a domestic rather than a criminal matter. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Kenyan authorities, and in particular President Moi, for any assistance they can provide to ensure a positive outcome. It is my firm belief that the children have the right to know both parents and this right was scrupulously respected until the failure to return the children to their father in Belgium in August 1998. However, since then the children have been denied access to one parent, in this case their father. He has given undertakings that once the children are returned to his custody their mother will continue to have visiting rights as before, thus restoring the children's right to have a relationship with both parents.</p>
<p class="contents">Next week, I will be travelling to the Hague conference, where the special commission will meet to review the practical operation of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. We have a big task ahead of us, but I would like to take this opportunity to remind all the signatories of the Hague convention that they signed up not just to protect their own nationals who may become victims of child abduction, but also to use the convention to assist those who are victims of child abduction by their own nationals. It is not a one-way process. For the convention to succeed, full cooperation by all the signatories is essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a moderate motion, which is designed to condemn the unacceptable fact that innocent people have been kidnapped for political ends. The motion does not discuss the basis of the issue, simply whether it is legitimate for a so-called revolutionary organisation to kidnap innocent people from other countries and to use these kidnappings to put pressure on the political powers of other States in order to achieve some form of recognition. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">What is even less acceptable, however, is the fact that people who are political refugees – and I have a great deal of respect for political exiles, because I myself spent many years in exile – take advantage of the countries in which they now live, particularly France, for example, and make threats to exact reprisals on the interests of other countries, such as, for example, Portugal, in order to achieve a political end. This is totally unacceptable. I therefore call on this organisation – the LFEC, to accept that, by using these terrorist-style methods, it is discrediting itself and will certainly fail to achieve its ends. I also call upon Parliament and upon the Council and the Commission to adopt a position of total condemnation of these methods, which could encourage others to act in the same way. Many countries are undergoing major conflicts and it is crucial that people’s rights are always safeguarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also wish to express my sympathy for their families and to state my heartfelt desire that these hostages are unconditionally released as quickly as possible, and I therefore believe that the Portuguese Government must make every possible effort to achieve this. As a matter of fact, this was precisely the thrust of a letter that I sent to the Swedish Presidency, in due time and with the utmost discretion, asking it about the possibility of the various Member States adopting measures in conjunction with the Portuguese and Angolan Governments which would facilitate or improve the likelihood of the immediate release of the hostages.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I feel that it is appropriate to emphasise that these actions by the LFEC must be explicitly and roundly condemned. These are criminal acts that are designed to aggravate the political and military situation in Angola and which are also intended to give an international profile to a group that has no compunction about resorting to such actions in order to achieve separatist objectives, which are also completely unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, it is worth pointing out that Angola’s territorial integrity must be scrupulously respected, also because no legitimacy has been conferred on this type of separatist objective by the international community, specifically either by the Organisation of African Unity or the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must express my profound surprise at the ease with which representatives of organisations that carry out such acts and which threaten to continue with them if they succeed, and are given total freedom to make statements and express themselves with complete impunity, which is, in fact, what has happened today. I wish, by the way, to thank our President, Mrs Fontaine, and her staff, for their rapid and determined action, compelling the three representatives of the LFEC who were present this morning to leave Parliament’s buildings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These people are workers who were forced by necessity to leave their country and they are also citizens of the European Union to whom all the governments of the Union have responsibilities. The fact that, on our initiative, Parliament is discussing this issue is therefore to be warmly welcomed. We feel that a very clear position of principle is involved: it is unacceptable to imprison peaceful citizens in order to make political demands. I therefore call on all those who are detaining these Portuguese citizens to release them immediately, in a gesture of humanitarian good will, which is the only thing that can help their captors' cause.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation of our fellow citizens is obviously close to our hearts and, in order to ensure their release, we will do whatever is necessary, in accordance with our principles. This does not mean, however, that we are unaware that there are many conflicts, including the conflict in Cabinda, that do not reach the public’s attention as a result of the way we ignore Africa. We know that the current situation in Cabinda is extremely harsh for the Cabindese. Although they coexist with powerful international interests, in a territory that produces hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, they endure the most extreme poverty. Let no-one be under any illusions, because these ghettos of prosperity in which huge international companies set up on the coastline, protected by mercenaries and government troops, are an echo and a portrait of a colonial-style situation. We also know that there is no real political freedom, freedom of expression or free opportunity for the people of Cabinda to develop fully their cultural and religious identity which would allow them to argue for all that they want in a legal and peaceful way. We know that war is raging in most of the territory, together with human rights violations against the people of Cabinda, which have been condemned in all international reports.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no need to look any further than the reports by Amnesty International, which detail the extrajudicial executions, the systematic use of torture, the murder of civilians and the destruction of villages all suffered in Cabinda. These are facts that it would be hypocritical to ignore and that it suits many people to conceal. I shall not do this! Just as I call on those who are holding our fellow citizens to release them immediately, given the possibility of their release, I urge the Angolan authorities not to initiate or intensify military operations that could put the lives of the Portuguese who are being held at risk. They share responsibility for the situation that has arisen and we will be watching events closely. The adoption of a constructive position by the Angolan Government would obviously be welcomed by the international community. As a matter of fact, in the recent past, contacts have been established and direct negotiations have taken place between the Angolan Government and those fighting for independence in Cabinda, and the international community can only support this approach. Whatever reasons the men and women of Cabinda may have, making these Portuguese workers suffer will not help their cause. This is a unique opportunity to release these people in full view of the international community. We call once again for this to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Bearing this in mind, those who wish to see this initiative as an attempt to use the media to take advantage of a situation that is of legitimate concern to the whole Portuguese and, of course, international community, or to exacerbate political or party-political quarrels, which have no place at all in this context, are deluding themselves. We are acting on principle here and in order to achieve a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us clearly state the principles that are guiding us: we consider the use of kidnapping to express political opinions in any part of the world and for whatever reason to be unacceptable. This means that we cannot associate ourselves with any attempt to raise the profile of Cabinda’s political situation unless the Portuguese citizens are released.</p>
<p class="contents">The result that we wish to see forces us to make a sincere appeal that is not tainted by any party-political affiliations with the parties involved in the conflict in Cabinda. From this rostrum I appeal urgently to the sense of humanity of the leaders of the LFEC, so that they free our fellow citizens, some of whom have been detained for around nine months in extremely harsh living conditions. If I may put it like this, the LFEC must not be in any doubt as to the appreciation of the Portuguese and international communities of the historical aspirations that motivate their struggle. The simple release of the hostages, of their Portuguese brethren, from the very country with which the LFEC wishes to reopen relations that were cut off more than 25 years ago, will encourage a positive reaction and closer attention to the LFEC’s historical and political aims by these two communities. When the hostages are released, for our part, we shall not forget what we am now stating, particularly because we are aware of the difficult conditions in which the citizens of Cabinda are living. The release of the Portuguese citizens is, in this sense, also an act of political clarity and affirmation of humanitarian principles that we all need in order to bring about the resolution of this unfortunate episode. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, the international community has to take great care and must make sure that it is ready to grant the lawful government the necessary aid, for the poor are fighting the poor and, at the end of the day, this is an issue of poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a number of years, there have been problems in Timor, mainly concentrated in West Timor at the moment, as well as in the Moluccas, in Aceh, in Irian Jaya and now again in Kalimantan. The old Suharto regime has in the past forced more than 8 million Indonesians to move from overpopulated regions to regions with a low population rate. For example, a few hundred thousand people moved from the island of Madura to Kalimantan, formerly Borneo. The migrants are often given a considerable degree of preferential treatment. For example they receive land and living facilities, sometimes at the expense of the indigenous population. That is the case in Irian Jaya and the Moluccas, as well as for the people from Madura in Kalimantan. It is therefore understandable that difficulties should arise, and neither is it all that difficult to let the tensions between population groups escalate. Unfortunately, there are quite a few people and groups in Indonesia who stand to gain from an escalation in tension between regional population groups, causing the government in Jakarta to become destabilised. This whole situation has now led to hundreds of killings, and tens of thousands of refugees, in addition to more than a million internal refugees which Indonesia was already grappling with. It is a huge problem, which is threatening to get the better of the Indonesian government.</p>
<p class="contents">In our resolution, we call on the European Commission to address the Indonesian government in a bid to halt these brutalities, and we urge the Commission to implement this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indonesia is massive in geography and population. It is the world's largest Muslim country. It is a mega-player in its region and has enormous potential. Were it to disintegrate, the implications for its neighbours would be catastrophic.</p>
<p class="contents">I was there two weeks ago. It is a young democracy emerging from the oppressive years of Suharto. Habibi gave it press freedom, which is surviving, Wahid came in as symbol of the drive against fraud and corruption and there are still high hopes of his policy of devolution. He is under pressure from Parliament and street demonstrators and those ambitious to replace him.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the benefits of dictatorship, of course, is often that the lid is kept on social, religious and racial tensions. Sadly the end of dictatorship so often opens the box and releases these ills. Timor, Moluccas, Aceh, Papua and now Borneo-Kalimantan all show this. The situation in parts of Kalimantan is intolerable and I back this motion totally. But what Indonesia most needs is our support for their efforts to find and fund solutions and any criticism from us must be constructive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you do start to think about it, then you make a mistake. These are revealing words, with a double meaning, spoken by a German businessman working for the regime of President Saparmurat Niyazov, the Leader of the Turkmen people.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkmenistan, a republic in Central Asia, is blessed with generous oil and gas reserves. No wonder that the Head of State, Mr Niyazov, has promised his people an ‘Altyn Asyr’, a golden era.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Turkmenbashi, the pet name for the country’s great leader, has no intention of keeping his promise. Quite the reverse, in fact! President Niyazov has spared neither cost nor effort to glorify his own persona in the form of prestigious constructions. For example, word has it that every street corner in the capital, Ashgabat is adorned with a bust of Turkmenbashi in gold and bronze, while the ordinary citizen is somehow having to survive in a society overrun by corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">What is also shocking is the complete neglect of the national health care system and of education by Niyazov's regime. Examples of this are the decisions by the powers that be to close down hospitals in the provinces, and the imminent resignation of thousands of teachers, despite overcrowded classrooms.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkmenbashi’s megalomania and mismanagement have instilled a general climate of fear in the country. Whoever dares to speak up is immediately imprisoned for years. It is the frank belief of a Turkmen lecturer, who for obvious reasons prefers to remain anonymous, that human rights count for nothing at all in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of his fellow-sufferers avoid frank discussions about the abject conditions in their home country. In the final analysis, Turkmenistan’s political leaders are just as much at the mercy of Turkmenbashi Niyazov. In front of running cameras, the President brings shame on ministers in public, and sacks them at will.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former communist, President Niyazov has a great affinity with Sunni Muslims – he has already completed the pilgrimage to Mecca – and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Members of other religious communities in the country, on the other hand, are liable to downright persecution, which is completely at odds with their constitutional right to freedom of religion.</p>
<p class="contents">The present joint resolution asks, in this connection, for special attention to be given to the position of the condemned Baptist minister Shagildy Atakov. According to the latest reports, this prisoner is said, because of his faith, to be in a prison hospital in the town of Mary, where he is being administered highly infectious and tranquillising injections. I therefore also call on the Commission to obtain information about Shagildy Atakov and to intervene with the Turkmen authorities on his behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Netherlands, the Protestant churches held a prayer day yesterday. There is no doubt that the Turkmen Christians, as well as the entire Turkmen population, were placed before God on that occasion. In that spirit, due to Man being a Creation of God, we would ask the Council and Commission to employ all diplomatic means in order to improve the situation in Turkmenistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reasons for my action were that democracy is increasingly becoming a sham, and that there is even a president who has had himself appointed for life. There is no political will for reform in Turkmenistan, as that country is riding roughshod over human rights, especially the rights of religious minorities, both Islam and Christian. Additionally, the proper implementation of European-funded TACIS projects is being frustrated by poor management and by a lack of adequate information and sound financial accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is only natural that all fledgling democracies will struggle at first, but riding roughshod over human rights cannot be tolerated and cannot be reconciled with a new Interim Agreement between the European Union and Turkmenistan. As MEP and rapporteur, I warmly recommend the urgency declaration to my fellow MEPs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I shall start with Zimbabwe. In 1999, the Commission took steps to re-orientate its cooperation with Zimbabwe in favour of social sector actions – health, education and AIDS, democracy and support to civil society. The Commission and the Member States have opted for confidential political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement in order to influence the Zimbabwean government and to seek improvements in respect for the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Sanctions are not considered appropriate at this stage. The Commission believes that sanctions should be kept as a last resort to discourage major setbacks such as the suspension of the constitution or the cancellation of the 2002 presidential elections. While President Mugabe is closely associated with these undesirable events, his public demonisation is counterproductive since it encourages support for him by dissenting factions in Zimbabwe African National Union/Patriotic Front and by neighbouring states.</p>
<p class="contents">Overemphasis on the plight of whites risks encouraging a revival of the independence theme supported by many blacks in Zimbabwe and in southern Africa. It neglects the plight of many very poor black people in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on trans-nationally abducted children: the Commission shares the concerns expressed by the honourable Members in the case of international child abductions, often by one of the child's parents. Within the Community the Brussels II regulation entered into force on 1 March this year. This regulation sets out rules on jurisdiction, automatic recognition and simplified enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility for children of both spouses. Therefore custodial decisions at the time of divorce taken in the Member States in accordance with Brussels II can now be enforced throughout the Community. Admittedly the regulation does not go far enough in that it is limited to custodial decisions for the children of both spouses taken at the time of divorce.</p>
<p class="contents">Later this month, the Commission plans to present a working document on the mutual recognition of decisions on parental responsibility, to be followed by a proposal for a regulation extending the scope of the Brussels II regulation to cover all children and situations.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as cases that transcend the borders of the Community are concerned, the Commission also supports the ratification, or the correct application, of the 1980 Hague Convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction, which is indeed a very valuable instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">On Cabinda: the Commission agrees and deplores the situation of the eight European citizens who have been kidnapped in Cabinda. The Commission hopes that a solution can be rapidly found to allow them to regain their freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">On Kalimantan in Indonesia: the Commission shares the honourable Members' concerns about the conflict in Kalimantan, which resulted in injury and serious loss of life. Clearly several factors have influenced the outbreak of violence and massacre: a decade-old and badly implemented policy of trans-migration, genuine poverty in some parts of the area, misadministration and provocateurs who, for reasons we may only speculate about, create the violence.</p>
<p class="contents">To address the poverty in this region, the Commission has in place development projects in southern and eastern Kalimantan, which include support for sustainable management of tropical forests. The Indonesian leadership currently faces some extremely difficult policy choices. They must establish temporary shelter for the refugees in Kalimantan. However, they also need to consider whether to assist those who want to leave Kalimantan permanently and return to Madura. They must also show determination to restore law and order and pursue the perpetrators. Failure to do so would send bad signals about the commitment of the Indonesian leadership to the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is closely following the situation and would stand ready to assist if the situation justified it. However, our current assessment is that most of the 50 000 refugees intend to return to their place of origin – Madura – where they have families who will be able to support them.</p>
<p class="contents">On Turkmenistan: the Commission is fully aware of the case of Mr Atakov, a Baptist pastor, who was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. It supported the EU démarche in Ashgabat by the EU Presidency and the Member States in February this year, asking for the release of Mr Atakov. The Commission has expressed concerns about the human rights situation in Turkmenistan. It supported the EU presidency démarche earlier this year in order to release Mr Primukuli Tanrykuliev and Mr Nurberdy Nurmamedov. The release of these two prisoners was ordered by President Niyazov later in an amnesty allowing the release of 12 000 prisoners. The Commission fully supports Parliament's resolutions. External pressure has to be maintained to achieve results in the fight for human rights and freedom of religion in Turkmenistan.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to Mr Staes’s question about assistance through TACIS, I would add that EU assistance provided through the TACIS programme is mainly oriented towards agricultural development, which directly benefits the population. In addition, the Commission develops TACIS democracy projects mostly through local NGOs in order to enhance civil society. As requested, I will refer this to Mr Nielson and Mr Patten for further action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A certain degree of conscience, however, now seems to be dawning upon us. In 1972, we banned biological weapons. In 1993, we banned chemical weapons, and in 1997, we banned land mines. Nuclear proliferation is more or less under control, although we have been going through a very difficult phase since the signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968, which then came into force in 1970. Nowadays, however, the weapons that take most lives are light weapons. There are estimated to be five hundred thousand million light weapons on this planet. They kill 200 000 people a year, which is twenty times more than land mines. More than half of victims are in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">So it comes as no surprise that the Secretary General of the United Nations, who is himself a great African, has put on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, which is due to meet next July in New York, the debate on a convention to try to limit this dangerous and terrible proliferation. The idea is to identify weapons so that they can be monitored, to keep a register of weapons, to encourage all States to strengthen their controls and their domestic legislation on exporting and re-exporting weapons, to organise the prosecution and punishment of traffickers and, finally, to finance and push forward national weapons’ collection and destruction programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Against such a backdrop, the European Union, which adopted a moratorium on the sale of weapons three years ago at the behest of Great Britain, would do itself credit by having an effective common policy and playing its full part. I welcome the fact that six political groups were able to table a motion for a resolution which is an excellent and timely compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not say any more. We must support it. It is totally in keeping with our code of conduct and with what has already been decided by the OSCE, and falls fairly and squarely within the scope of the next UN Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">During voting time, Mr President, I will ask to table two oral amendments, which I know have already received general approval. The first is in the recitals. When the time comes, I will say where to add a citation to the Bamako Declaration of last month – a great historical first – in which 52 African nations took up a single position which was in perfect harmony with our code of conduct. The second addition would simply be a reference to the marking of weapons in the proposals of our compromise resolution. I know they have your backing and I will support them at the appropriate time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A lot of wise things have been said, but the most important action in this context is this EU initiative for the UN conference on the illicit trade in small arms. We know that this very trade is a major reason for the aggravation of conflicts and that the innocent civilian population suffers the most casualties. The positive thing about the EU proposal is that it involves both sides, users and producers, and that the EU is striving for more binding commitments. This conference must be the first step towards stopping arms exports. But there will have to be a permanent commission to check that it is enforced. It would be good if the EU would not only call for this but be the first to enforce it in its own ranks.</p>

First of all in order to arrive at this code of conduct, then in order that it should be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, our resolution has a fundamental objective: to help the next United Nations Conference in July to be successful. In order to do this we propose various points in the resolution. Taking into account the time that I have, I am only going to explain three. In the first place, preventing arms from being exported or transferred to groups or countries that violate human rights. Secondly, an international agreement on the trade and transport of arms that is binding for all countries. Thirdly, transparency and parliamentary control over this trade which causes low- and medium-intensity conflicts, something which you only have to be here for an afternoon of topical and urgent debate to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, without these arms, those conflicts would not happen. Parliament must therefore wish the United Nations Conference in July to be a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UN Conference is therefore more overdue than premature. I am of the opinion that the European Union must take the lead in New York. The 1998 European code of conduct can serve as a template for a worldwide agreement on the export and transfer of weapons. This code has proved its usefulness but is deficient in two important areas. First of all, it is not legally binding. Europe must press for an international agreement which is binding. Secondly, no provisions have been made for monitoring the end users of exported weapons. In Africa, for example, Togo and Burkina are officially known as end users of weapons from Bulgaria while, in reality, these weapons are being channelled to Liberia and to the rebels in Sierra Leone. Europe must call for the stricter monitoring and penalisation of transfer countries of this kind. The distribution of light weapons is, in fact, not only a problem in the Third World. In Europe and North-America too, the possession of weapons is on the increase. Half of all American families possess a firearm. Although these are often legal weapons, they cause just as much damage, as was once again demonstrated last week in California. That is why the UN Conference must also pluck up the courage to broach the subject of legal small weapons, and Europe must be able to argue for a total ban on the advertising of firearms.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the UN Member States are facing a difficult dilemma: either they opt for the arms industry and economic interests, or they choose human safety, stability and peace. We are very much counting on the Swedish Presidency to set the right tone at the preparatory meeting, and on the Belgian Presidency to make the right choices during the conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, there is the joint resolution itself, which expresses Parliament’s will to show solidarity; and secondly, there is the financial support that has already been announced and promised by the Commission. Unfortunately, Mr President, we are speaking once again about a disaster recurring in Mozambique, a new democracy. Following a civil war that decimated a large part of the population and left the country in the most abject poverty, we are now helplessly witnessing the swings of nature which appear determined to sacrifice the people of Mozambique. The country is facing a very worrying situation. It is true that the Zambezi river has stopped rising, but the situation could change at any time as a result of the rainfall levels that have occurred or that are forecast to occur. The Cabora Bassa dam is reaching maximum saturation point and discharges from it could make the situation worse. Maintaining the minimum survival threshold requires emergency measures, both for food aid and shelter, for rescue and reconstruction measures and for the supply of medicines. It is extremely important that we send health specialists because the first symptoms of diseases such as malaria and diarrhoea have already been diagnosed in the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, various problems have arisen in addressing the basic needs of those affected, due to the fact that bridges and railway lines have been flooded. Helicopters need to be used but, although these are resources that Mozambique does have, it does not have anywhere near a satisfactory number. The European Union and, particularly, the Commission, must play a very important role in adopting humanitarian aid programmes, which are, in fact, a distinguishing feature of the European Union’s external policy. The EUR 2 million – ESC 400 thousand million – which have already been made available are a good indication of the Commission’s cooperative approach, but are clearly insufficient to meet the shortages and the problems Mozambique is facing. Ultimately, Mr President, what we are asking is for the Commission and the Council to take the broadest and most sympathetic view possible of our joint resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A country such as Mozambique, which has had so much bad luck, is once again struck by heavy flooding. Once again, emergency aid turns out not to have arrived on time, and it proves not to have been possible to evacuate many people in time. Moreover, we must ask ourselves how such a desperately poor country is to survive another disaster like this.</p>
<p class="contents">A few years ago, we were able to delight in the prompt economic recovery in some parts of Mozambique, but the inland regions are so extremely poor – people have absolutely nothing – that I find it disgraceful that some countries have still not released Mozambique from its debts. Europe should lead the way in this respect. That country should not have to repay its debts. It is already paying such a heavy toll to nature that what we need here is the highest level of solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tomorrow, it will be exactly a year since, we were discussing and voting on a resolution in this Parliament on this very subject: floods in Mozambique. We have once again focussed on the communities that have been affected, which this time are mainly in the provinces of Tete, Sofala and Zambezi. Dozens of people have died or disappeared, around half a million people have been affected and almost one hundred thousand have lost their homes. The suffering of these people, many of whom are in an extremely weak condition, has been enormous and the problems they face are serious: there is a shortage of drinking water and food, a shortage of fuel and the threat of disease.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must therefore express its solidarity with Mozambique, translate its words into action and not forget the efforts of the people of Mozambique, who have tried, at great cost, to consolidate their process of transition to democracy, which is still a long way from being achieved. In this context, I wish to highlight the content of the final part of paragraph 5 of the joint resolution that we shall be voting on and which is ultimately designed to safeguard all the security and operational conditions needed to ensure that aid reaches its intended destination. We all have an obligation to ensure that this requirement is met – it is the right of everyone who needs help. Our intention must be to show solidarity and we must demonstrate our commitment to helping effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition to destroying infrastructures, these floods are causing a shortage of drinking water and food as well as a real danger of epidemics as serious and deadly as the floods themselves. The tragedy and the scale of this disaster are such that the Mozambican authorities cannot act efficiently or in isolation to resolve their serious economic, social and public health problems, particularly because Mozambique is a very poor country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and, in particular, the European Parliament, cannot turn their backs upon this tragedy, nor must we limit ourselves to simply expressing our sympathy. We therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to increase emergency aid to Mozambique, and to coordinate their aid in conjunction with third countries and multilateral organisations. We call upon the Member States to define a structural aid programme for Mozambique, within the Council and together with the Commission. We also urge the international community to be unstinting in its efforts to allocate human and material resources, to mobilise the emergency aid which is so necessary, to adopt economic and financial measures to contribute to the reconstruction of the regions that have been affected and to revive Mozambique’s economy, which has been so badly hit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is crucial and pressing that we support and help this slightly mythical country that has achieved the miracle of establishing democratic life in an environment which is seen to be so hostile. In addition to the intrinsic value of development aid and of immediate assistance to Mongolia, both to its human and animal populations, we must cherish an extraordinary democratic experiment which proves that democracy knows no boundaries, be they physical, geographical, religious, cultural or of lifestyle, given that many of Mongolia’s inhabitants live a nomadic existence.

Unfortunately, it is also a country that seems to have been completely abandoned by the gods. During the winter of 1999-2000, it experienced extremely harsh conditions with temperatures falling to –50º centigrade. It experienced the same conditions this year after an intervening drought last summer. All this has led to the death of millions of head of livestock. Livestock is Mongolia’s chief resource. No doubt you read in yesterday afternoon’s edition of the newspaper, <span class="italic">Le Monde</span>, that, in addition to these scourges, Mongolia has been hit by foot-and-mouth disease. It is easy to imagine the damage that may cause in a country whose economy is based primarily on the rearing of livestock.</p>
<p class="contents">In point 8 of its legislative programme last year, the Commission pledged substantial emergency aid to Mongolia. So far, it has only allocated a small amount of this aid. It has sent just a few hundred thousand dollars to add to the few hundred thousand dollars from other donor countries, which include Israel and the People’s Republic of China. Mongolia needs USD eight million. It is therefore crucial that the Commission’s pledges match the scale of the catastrophe that has now struck Mongolia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Without oil or other minerals, it is trying to gain a foothold in the new globalising economy. The country is making a name for itself in the world of sports, as was evident recently in the skating event in my own country, and it deals with political landslides well, as was apparent from the most recent elections.</p>
<p class="contents">In the tough fight for a place in the world, the country is, for the second year running, afflicted by extreme cold after a summer which was too dry. One hundred thousand families and twelve million cattle are on the brink of starvation. That problem is made still worse by the fact that, in the past, Mongolia used to supply countries like Russia and Finland with large amounts of beef. The accession of Finland to the European Union closed off the Finnish market to a large degree, and massive European food aid to Russia meant that Mongolia was sidelined on that market too.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union thus owes Mongolia something. The ECHO funds are appropriate here, and it would be to the European Union’s credit if more TACIS funds were to be spent on stimulating this democratic rarity in Central Asia. Democratically speaking, too, a good example will be keenly followed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to find out from the Commission what concrete steps it intends to take in terms of ECHO funding, extra funding and emergency aid, but also – and mainly – by way of democratic encouragement of that country through making extra funding available to it through the TACIS programme, possibly in advance of the 2002 budget. I feel I am in good company with Mr Staes, but also with our Vice-President, Mr Wiebenga, who is also committed to this region.

I agree with what many of you have said: that this country has really suffered more than his reasonable in recent decades.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's humanitarian aid office, ECHO, is in close contact with the Commission's delegation in Mozambique and also with governmental and non-governmental organisations in the country. The Commission's assessment confirms the need for new humanitarian aid intervention in Mozambique. Initial funding to the tune of EUR 2 million is currently being prepared. The evolution of the situation is being closely monitored. The Commission intervenes most appropriately from the relief phase onwards as search-and-rescue at such a distance is most effectively done by the South African and Mozambican air forces. The Commission's role can then be complementary after the initial phase. The neighbouring countries of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe are also affected by the abnormally heavy rainfall. The situation in Mozambique is likely to persist for several weeks as water continues to be discharged from the Kariba and Cabora Bassa dams.</p>
<p class="contents">Food shortages are likely to continue until at least autumn this year even if there is no more heavy rain. WFP estimates they are already feeding 80 000 people and are preparing to feed up to 150 000. The Commission pledged a package of aid totalling EUR 73.5 million to the reconstruction programme after the year 2000 floods including a total of EUR 10 million from ECHO funds. EUR 63.5 million has been committed, of which EUR 23 million has actually been disbursed.</p>
<p class="contents">As to Mongolia, ECHO, in line with its mandate, is providing humanitarian relief to the people affected by the extreme weather conditions in Mongolia since last year. Last year, ECHO allocated almost EUR 2 million of emergency relief to address the basic food needs of the most vulnerable families affected by the severe 1999-2000 winter and the subsequent summer drought in Mongolia. In 2001, in response to the appeal for international assistance by the Mongolian government and based on the humanitarian needs assessment by FAO and Red Cross Family, ECHO has launched an emergency funding decision of EUR 1 million. This decision, currently in the pipeline for adoption, foresees the distribution of food, agriculture inputs and medical items to the most vulnerable strata of society in the affected provinces. The aid will be provided by the International Federation of the Red Cross and two ECHO partners, Save the Children from the UK and Premier Urgence of France. ECHO is closely monitoring the general situation in the country to identify potential further needs for humanitarian aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rocard (PSE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, pursuant to the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is competent ‘to protect the conditions of life and work, including the work environment’. This fine definition authorises us, therefore, to examine the situation of our assistants. Indeed it obliges us to do so. It would be odd if the committee I have the honour of chairing were responsible for all workers in Europe, the sole exception being the assistants in the European Parliament. That has, in fact, been the strange situation up to the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">Far be it from me, however, to trespass on the competencies of the specific bodies of the European Parliament! That is why, Commissioner, when we heard the representatives of the assistants, we did it in the presence and with the cooperation of Vice-President Onesta, who was instructed by the Bureau of our Parliament to deal with these problems. Now the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wants to make its contribution to the quest for innovative solutions. Most of our colleagues are fully familiar with the problems faced by the assistants, which range from job insecurity to the difficulties of legal establishment on Belgian territory, where many of them live. </p>
<p class="contents">The Bureau of the European Parliament has already taken a crucial internal decision designed to improve transparency in the management of secretarial allowances, which was mentioned in Mr Onesta’s report. I welcome this decision. It will enable assistants to have an employment contract in the prescribed form, social security cover, which not all of them have, and occupational accident insurance. There are, however, other problems that have not been resolved. These relate essentially to the specific situation of assistants, who are de facto cross-border workers, without their rights as such being recognised. </p>
<p class="contents">That is why the expert study commissioned by the European Commission contemplated using existing European legislation on the free circulation of workers and to incorporate into it the specific situation of parliamentary assistants. This solution appears both realistic and reasonable. It is realistic because much vaunted Regulation No1408/71, which all my parliamentary colleagues are familiar with and which governs the free circulation of workers, students and pensioners, etc, is not a text which has been set in stone. For more than five years it has been subjected by the Council to a process of simplification, dusting-down and improvement, which is to be wound up under the Belgian Presidency. At least that is what the European Parliament hopes. </p>
<p class="contents">This year we are being presented with amendments to the text. During the last part-session I think I understood correctly that a large number of my fellow Members wanted a general overhaul of the text rather than just technical improvements. Nonetheless, in February we approved the last amendment that both the Council and the Commission asked us to approve. In other words this text could easily be modified and adapted to the situation of the assistants and it could enable them to choose the country of establishment when it comes to matters of social security payments and it could guarantee their other rights to social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">This realistic solution is also reasonable. The Council wanted the European Parliament to reform its relations with its assistants in the name of transparency. This first step was achieved thanks to the decision to which I have referred. It does not wish to tackle tax issues. Recourse to Regulation No 1408/71 does not make this necessary. Fine! The Council does not want to give assistants the status of officials. This is not what we are asking – it is very different. What we want is simply to guarantee their fundamental rights to social protection. In other words, all the conditions have now been met and we can now make real headway in this area. That is the reason, Commissioner, for our question to the Commission, which has always expressed its determination to make headway in this area hand-in-hand with the European Parliament. The Commission has the political initiative, but we now ask it to make use of it and to formally present a proposal to amend Regulation No 1408/71 by adding a simple subparagraph covering the situation of the assistants. It is then up to the Council to shoulder its responsibilities and to decide whether or not to keep our assistants and ourselves in a state of legal and social uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has already embarked on internal work to set the ball rolling. The way forward depends on the normal legislative process. It is up to the Commission to put forward a proposal now and Parliament will then be able to complete its work to issue internal regulations to deal with the question of the assistants.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the thinking behind our question to the Commission. Within what timeframe, Commissioner, will this crucial text be proposed? The best solution would be before the start of the Belgian Presidency, since our assistants work in Belgium. It is a pressing matter, Commissioner, and it also affects the ethics and image of our Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 1998 the Commission, with Parliament's agreement, drew up a proposal to amend the conditions of employment for other staff so that Parliamentary assistants would become auxiliary staff. I happened to be the Commissioner responsible at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">This would have ensured equal treatment for assistants in terms of their salary, employment conditions and tax, with a choice of a social security system. As you know, however, this proposal was not accepted by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">By agreement with the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission then commissioned an expert study with various solutions that would be compatible with Community law and the interests of the assistants and the Members of Parliament. The experts suggested that one aspect of the assistants' legal status could be dealt with by another Community instrument, namely Regulation No 1408/71, which coordinates the social security schemes of the Member States. The assistants are already covered by this regulation and it brings them, in principle, under the social security system of the Member State where they work.</p>
<p class="contents">Vice-President Onesta has contacted my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, suggesting that the Commission puts forward a proposal to the Council and Parliament for an amendment to this regulation, allowing assistants to chose between the Member State where they work, the Member State where they were last insured or the Member State of which they are a national. A similar option is already available to auxiliary staff of the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an amendment would only resolve a very specific and small part of the assistants' legal position and would not exonerate them from the obligations of national law in regard to labour conditions, tax and social security. However, the Commission has committed itself to finding solutions which are in the interests of both assistants and Members of Parliament. The suggested amendment can indeed clarify the legal position of the assistants as far as their social security rights are concerned. It seems that the application of Regulation No 1408/71 to this category of workers still gives rise to uncertainty, which can be removed by the amendment. Once they have made a choice there should be no further misunderstanding as to which Member State 's system they are subject to.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it seems justified to derogate from the general rules of the regulation for persons working on a temporary basis for members of Community institutions, such as auxiliary staff. My draft then reads as follows: ‘Therefore the Commission intends to propose shortly to Parliament and Council the suggested amendment to Regulation No 1408/71’. If asked what ‘shortly’ means, I can say that it will be before the summer. That means that this issue can be decided during the Belgian Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before this, I dealt with this subject as a journalist for a daily newspaper, so I think I know the subject from all three sides that are particularly involved here. I would therefore like to say that I welcome the fact that with our provisional arrangement we have found something that both preserves flexibility and affords security and that the Court of Auditors has also accepted as a sensible and workable system, although I do have a problem with changing the contract basis in mid-period. I think that should really always be settled at the start of the period.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are looking at the final assistants’ statute, and we naturally welcome such an assistants’ statute. But I would like to sound a warning against excessive bureaucracy and inflexibility. There are rumoured to be plans for all assistants to be subject to Belgian law. That would not only be a problem for the many staff we maintain in our constituencies, because the very purpose of that is to strengthen feedback to the constituency, but it would also fail to take account of the structure of our Parliament’s work, because following the Council’s decision this House has its seat in Strasbourg and holds its plenary sessions here. As a result, it is often more sensible for Members from southern Germany and from France, for example, to employ an assistant for Strasbourg and for their constituency than to bring the Brussels assistant to Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Strasbourg is the seat of Parliament. There is therefore no point in making assistants who work here, for example, subject to Belgian law. Brussels is an important place of work, but it is just a place of work, like Luxembourg. I therefore believe the system must be flexible, that there must be a freedom of choice here that does justice both to Parliament’s three places of work, to the seat in Strasbourg and to the need for constituency work. I therefore believe that the Council, Commission and Parliament must find an arrangement that gives our assistants security but which, as I said, takes account of this Parliament’s specific working conditions, which it did not set for itself, and which enables Members to make arrangements under the laws of the Member State where they were elected or to use an arrangement that does equal justice to their manner, structure and style of work and to the legitimate social interests of our assistants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is impossible not to be surprised at this inability to resolve a precarious situation which affects the parliamentary assistants, people who assist us on a daily basis, whilst we are competent to legislate on certain aspects of the conditions of life and work of all the citizens of the fifteen Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">It is in fact a question of finding solutions to crucial and fundamental issues concerning social protection, the employment statute, occupational accidents and all the issues of social cover with which we are so familiar, so that we can deal with them in relation to all the workers in the fifteen Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a question of making an effort to clarify the definition of their working conditions, which, I admit, are rather the preserve of internal meetings. This issue has been raised over a very long period of time by our group and, as we have just been reminded, by other groups as well.</p>
<p class="contents">During the previous legislative period of the European Parliament, proposals to formalise the statute came up against the reluctance of the Council to turn assistants into officials and to include the tax dimension of the problem in the equation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that today, however, we should be clear about what our objectives are. These demands are now no longer written in this way in the agenda. It is clear that we do not want to turn our assistants into Community officials, just as it would be out of place to want to link the issue of the assistants’ statute to that of Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Why, as was expressed so well by Mr Rocard, do you vie with each other to complicate an issue where the stakes are so clear and so legitimate, and which may find solutions in procedures that are perfectly ordinary, accessible and simple?</p>
<p class="contents">The real issue today is to see how the Commission is going to follow up the work, which it asked an expert to carry out on this matter. It is true that the recent developments introduced by the Bureau of the European Parliament – the provision of contracts in the prescribed form and documents testifying to membership of a social security system and of an occupation accident insurance scheme – are good decisions, but the matter does not end there. It would be extremely important, for instance, to be able to check the information which is gathered.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the proposal put forward to regard our assistants as genuine cross-border workers so that they can consequently have recourse to Regulation No 1408/71, to which we just have to add a subparagraph in order to cover them, seems entirely appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, our assistants expect the Commission to take the initiative. The Belgian Presidency would be doing itself credit by bringing this affair to a successful conclusion. However, Commissioner, you have just told us that proposals will be forthcoming before the summer. Thank you. We look forward to them. We thank you above all on behalf of all the assistants who work in this House.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Attwooll (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, if I may begin on a personal note it is now nearly two years since I was campaigning on an election platform that stressed the need for proper statutes for Members and their assistants. It is extremely embarrassing to have to admit to the public at home just how slow progress has been where both statutes are concerned. Of the two, I am more embarrassed in respect of the assistants' statute because this is a case where as MEPs we are directly responsible in matters affecting the lives of others.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is grateful to the Commission for its approach to Professor Vandersanden and for the proposals that he has made. We have not yet discussed in detail his substantive suggestions as to what should be done within the Parliament's own rules of procedure. We may therefore find ourselves disagreeing with these suggestions in various respects. We do however believe that his methodology which distinguishes between what might be achieved under these rules and what actually requires legislation are a promising route forward.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very glad to hear of the outcome of the trialogue and the Commission's statement today promising proposals for the revision of Regulation No 1408/71. We would add however that whatever scheme is ultimately adopted, and by whatever means, it must have certain characteristics. First, it must be simple. It must be simple both in terms of clarity and in terms of its administration. Second, it must provide the legal certainty. This means that it must be comprehensive in its coverage of the employment relationship. This need not mean rigidity and uniformity. It means only that, for example, all assistants must be properly covered for any accidents occurring to them in the course of their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, it must be transparent. In my own personal view we should be trying to move towards a system where there is equal pay for work of equal value. Given though that assistants may be employed in a number of different locations and have different tasks to perform, this may be difficult to achieve. We should at least however seek to ensure that no one is allowed to fall below a certain minimum and that the reasons for any differentials are clear. I believe that in the long term there can be no substitute for a proper statute but we do at least now have an initial path to follow. I hope that we move down it as rapidly as we can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you too Mr Rocard, in your role as chairman of the specialist committee, for speaking to you, Commissioner, on behalf of the European Parliament, because it is clear that, as concerns this statute, we are moving very slowly. Our Parliament has been in existence for so many years yet we are still trying to settle this issue, which should have been taken off the agenda years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">You have given us some good news. The pace is to be speeded up. We can all rejoice at that. What is the current state of play? The Council asked us to abandon the route towards turning our assistants into officials. We complied. We withdrew this document, which had caused the Council so many problems, from the negotiating table. The Council asked Parliament to get rid of any reference to taxation. We complied, and the assistants themselves acknowledge that they are prepared to relinquish any reference to taxation as long as they get a proper statute.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also asked us to take all the necessary measures to ensure transparency and, as our fellow Members have reminded us, everything is in hand. In a few weeks’ time, no Member of Parliament we will be able to have access to their budget line to pay their assistants if they have not first made an appropriate declaration to the parliamentary services – and I did my duty as an employer this afternoon. They will therefore not have access to their budget line until they have handed in a copy of all their contracts, in the prescribed form, together with proof that their assistants have full social cover and are well protected in the event of an occupational accident.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in a few weeks’ time, the whole of Europe will know the names of our assistants. We are really going to come out into the open, because, at present, no Member of Parliament is able to provide the list of all those people who work so hard to ensure that the European Community functions properly.</p>
<p class="contents">So, here we are. We have taken the steps we were asked to take. We would not understand it if, now, the Commission did not do what it always said it would do in the many varied contacts we have had, that it was ready, when the time came, to take the decisive step to finally enable us to have a legal basis to take us forward. We would not understand it if, once this step had been taken by the Commission, the Council, which has always told us, whether it be under the Finnish Presidency, the Portuguese Presidency, the French Presidency and now the Swedish Presidency, that it too was ready to do its bit, did nothing. Parliament has done its bit. It is now up to the other institutions to do theirs.</p>
<p class="contents">What can be done? I believe that the report by Mr Vandersanden, which you, Commissioner, masterminded and circulated, is a good working base. Modifying Regulation No 1408/71 is the right thing to do because then we will have something simple and consistent and we will finally be able to give our assistants a statute which does not suffer from any legal debate. It is not a question of seeking to harmonise social protection systems, but simply to coordinate policies, which amending this regulation will allow.</p>
<p class="contents">Let no one tell us that this is complicated, even though unanimity is required in Council. Since 1997, it has been possible to make no fewer than five amendments to this regulation and always unanimously. Give us a legal basis. In the working group I lead, in which all the political groups are represented, Parliament is finally debating this issue with a united voice. All the political groups are united in asking you to take this decisive step.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, once you have taken this decisive step and, we hope, the Council has followed your example, we will not have a real assistants’ statute. There will still not be a code of ethics, a collective agreement and a system of equalisation to ensure fairness amongst all assistants, as my colleague from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party said, where there is equal pay for work of equal value. This system of fairness can be introduced in the form of an equalisation fund at the level of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Give us this legal basis and we will do the rest. We need you to take this decisive step. Our fellow Members have said so. Legality, simplicity, transparency and a high level of social protection are called for. If you give us legality, we will guarantee simplicity, transparency and a high level of social protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For too long now our parliamentary assistants have worked without being protected by a statute. Although the vast majority of Members of Parliament have guaranteed them correct working and salary conditions, it must be acknowledged that the practices of a number of our colleagues has somewhat tarnished the image of the European Parliament. The lack of control and transparency in the management of secretarial allowances paved the way for abuse. And, as Jacques Loyau, President of the Association of Assistants, deplored at the time, in the absence of a safeguard, everything was possible and there were considerable disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">A survey carried out by the Association of Assistants more than a year ago highlighted a worrying situation. Fourteen per cent did not have a contract of employment; 12% had only external consultant contracts, even though they worked full time, and 53% did not have any social cover or accident insurance. This survey served as the basis for the action taken by the parliamentary assistants and their Association, which our group supported from its beginnings. Some initial results were obtained within the European Parliament with the adoption, by the Bureau, of the amendment to Article 14 of the rules on the costs and allowances of Members of Parliament. As our President, Nicole Fontaine, stressed at the time that the matter of the assistants had made significant and concrete headway and that the transitory measures which had been adopted reflected the will and determination of the European Parliament to move towards greater transparency and fairness in this area..</p>
<p class="contents">These measures, which came into force on 1 January this year, have indeed enabled us to strengthen our control over the use of the secretarial allowance and to guarantee each assistant a contract of employment, health insurance and occupation accident insurance. This progress, which has been made thanks to the perseverance of the Association of Assistants and to the efficient work of our Vice-President, Gérard Onesta, served as a base for our negations with the Council. However, as we have heard, for months now, despite our best efforts, this matter seems to have been deadlocked. I am therefore very interested to hear that an agreement has been reached in principle between the Commission and the European Parliament to amend the free movement of workers regulation along the lines the assistants would like to see. I welcome this. It seems that the way is now clear for us to be able to move forwards very soon towards a European statute whereby, in the words Parliament chose in its opinion of 11 March 1999, assistants are treated equally and in accordance with the work they carry out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Naturally, that does not mean that Members are not first and foremost responsible for their assistants’ having sound labour contracts, including social security, good working conditions and insurance policies. It is primarily up to us to put proper arrangements in place. Unfortunately, we have now discovered that we have failed in this respect, and that there is now an extra need for a sound statute for our assistants. The EDD Group is lending its unqualified support to the assistants’ legitimate wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final remark in this connection. Vast discrepancies between the EP permanent staff, the temporary staff of the groups and the assistants are not justified, particularly as they, to a large extent, do the same type of work. The Council should perhaps reconsider precisely what now constitute unjustified discrepancies. Indeed, we must repudiate discrimination at all times. The freedom of assistants to choose the social system under which they want to work is of great importance, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to concur with Mr Posselt who has warned against too much red tape. It is already very complex and time-consuming to act in the correct manner. Members should also have the freedom to employ assistants in their own Member States or in Brussels, and we should not be restricted in this choice in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have some speaking time left, but Commissioner Liikanen has managed to reassure me to a great extent. I wish him a lot of success and hope that the activities will indeed be completed before the summer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was right to raise the matter again, authoritatively, clearly and incontrovertibly, since Parliament has repeatedly made commitments on the issue. I would also stress, in addition to the indisputable nature of these commitments, the role of the socialists who, particularly within the Committee on Budgets, have fought on the front line every year to ensure that these commitments are included in the budget lines, and they will do so on this occasion with regard to this operation too.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening, the Bureau and the Vice-President and Commissioner Liikanen have made somewhat significant commitments. These commitments are a step in the right direction although they are still not a full response. We need to provide a definitive, comprehensive response dealing with national insurance contributions, tax and salaries, and the rights and responsibilities associated with an – albeit temporary – position.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for swift action, for it is our duty to ensure the greatest possible transparency and total legality of a relationship, certain aspects of which still make a mockery of respect for workers’ rights and the principles which we desire to uphold for all and which we must protect, especially for those who work with us. It is our duty to guarantee respect for the dignity of these professionals who, moreover, make a valuable, high-quality contribution to our work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore wish to begin by welcoming in particular the initiative presented here by our colleague, Mr Rocard, to bring into the open a debate which must be conducted with the utmost transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, from a personal point of view, I would even argue for a common statute for parliamentary assistants based on the categories currently laid down in the Staff Regulations. The revision proposed as a joke by Commissioner Kinnock might even be a good opportunity to lay down a decision of this type. In any event, I suspect that we are a long way from that point. We must therefore do the best with what we have and with solutions which may be enshrined in European instruments, such as the Staff Regulations, but which represent only one possible approach towards a future European statute.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the new rules adopted by Parliament on the situation of parliamentary assistants are nothing more than internal regulations. We must ensure the transparency of the contracts, public recruitment procedures, the requirement for an effective system of social protection and the payment of tax in each of the Member States. These rules are an expression of our political will but they also reveal the weakness of Parliament’s powers to regulate an entire statute for parliamentary assistants, which involves, of course, much more than just these issues. In any event, now that these rules have been agreed on, I am sure that there is a broad majority in this House, and this can be seen in the Bureau, in the Contact Group and in the speeches that have been made here, that wishes the Council to frame in law what is already being practised, affecting only our institutions, through an amendment to Regulation No 1408/71, which is a general rule covering migrant workers. Ultimately, by means of the amended base Regulation which applies to all the Member States, we want parliamentary assistants to be given the right, as migrant workers, to be able to choose to be governed by the legislation of the country that is most relevant to their work, which is divided between Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg and the country of origin of the Member of the European Parliament for whom they work. We have been informed today, by Commissioner Liikanen, that the Commission is, at last, going to get the ball rolling on this dossier. We will then begin to emerge from the tunnel in which we are stuck if the Belgian Presidency manages to close this dossier. Later, if the Belgian Presidency is successful, we will have to conclude the work. That, however, Mr President, is simply a matter of tidying up loose ends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first was to assure our assistants publicly that this matter was being taken on board by the European Parliament. We have done that.</p>
<p class="contents">The second was to make sure that the Commission, which itself had commissioned the expert, Mr Vandersanden, was prepared to capitalise on its work and to follow it up by taking precise administrative action. You have pledged to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third objective was to have a timetable, which was particularly related to the fact that the Belgian Presidency was just around the corner and that the problem essentially concerned Belgian social security.

<p class="contents">Just now, our fellow Member, Mr Pittella, justifiably called on us to arrive at a full and final solution to the problem of the assistants, and he was right to do so. We all know, however, that this will take time and it will involve a number of different stages and much effort. We need the involvement of the three institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament. We can, though, only do our work once you have done yours. The essential stage is always the next one.

In this afternoon’s urgent debate our group, the largest in the House, had only 12 minutes to share out, apart from the minutes allowed to the proposers. It was uncommonly difficult to accommodate everyone. We had to disappoint a large number of colleagues. In light of this experience, I would therefore ask that the groups in future be given a little more speaking time in urgent debates than is currently the case. The present method of calculation is clearly not altogether realistic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it does seem somewhat ironic to me that we have been voting in this place all week to save the planet but we still ride around Strasbourg in our chauffeur-driven Mercedes.</p>
<p class="contents">Could Parliament perhaps consider giving Members detailed instructions on how to use the tram system and the routes that are available, and maybe even give us a couple of complimentary tickets to get us started.

<p class="contents">The first would come at the end of Recital E and would be to add: ‘as well as the Bamako Declaration made by 52 Member States of the Organisation of African Unity on light weapons and small arms’. The general opinion is that the declaration is important enough to be added. It was purely and simply omitted.</p>
<p class="contents">The second oral amendment would come under point 2, in the fourth sub-point, and consists of a reference to the marking of weapons. I owe it to the subtlety of our fellow Members in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for having taken this amendment on board and for having found a more appropriate place to insert it into the text, and I thank the group for that. In other words, this amendment should be inserted after ‘the manufacture’ in the third line of the fourth sub-point of point 2. It should therefore read: ‘concerning, for example, the manufacture, marking, transfer and supply of small arms and light weapons’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>One cannot expect countries - even candidates for EU accession - to associate themselves automatically with EU declarations on foreign policy issues on which they have not been consulted and in the drafting of which they have played no part. On the other hand, as part of the process by which they approach accession the EU welcomes it when they feel able to associate themselves with EU positions in CFSP and indeed encourages them to do so. But it must be for these countries to decide freely whether they wish to do so.</p>
<p>In 2000, the associates were invited to associate themselves with 131 CFSP declarations. In 95 cases, all countries concerned aligned themselves; in 36 cases, one or more countries wished not to do so, in 18 cases of which Turkey was one of them. In 2001, the Associated countries have been invited to align themselves with 16 declarations.

<p>The Council is not aware of the commercial modalities of the gas supply agreements between Georgia and Russia.</p>
<p>However, the Council is concerned about the interruption of gas supplies from Russia to Georgia and its effect on the economic, social and humanitarian situation in Georgia. Interruptions of this kind, however short, do not only affect the people directly involved but, of course, in a wider perspective, also have an effect on Russia’s reputation as a gas supplier.</p>
<p>The interest of the Council in increasing the security of energy supplies is demonstrated by several items on the agenda of a forthcoming Council meeting.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Council is currently undertaking an in-depth examination of the Commission's Green Paper: "Towards a European strategy for the security of supply", which underlines our growing dependence on external energy sources and notably on Russia for gas. Within the context of enlargement, this dependence will increase further due to the historic links between Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. One of the responses to dependence will be increased diversification of energy sources.</p>
<p>Moreover, on the occasion of the 6th EU-Russia summit since the entry into force (1.12.1997) of the EU-Russian Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA), held in Paris on 30 October 2000, it was agreed to institute an energy dialogue on a regular basis to enable progress to be made in the definition and arrangements for an EU-Russian Energy Partnership. Since then, exploratory contacts at high level have been taking place, taking into account the interest of the EU in safeguarding the continuation of reliable energy supplies from Russia. On the same occasion, Russia also confirmed its commitment to proceed to the ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty in the near future. The Community is currently participating in negotiations on a Transit Protocol to the Energy Charter Treaty, which should also contribute to increasing the security of supply, especially as regards the legal framework.</p>
<p>Finally, the Action Plan on the Northern Dimension, adopted at the European Council of Feira, 19­20 June 2000, comprises, within a series of priority actions, measures to ensure (legal) security of investment and of supply from i.a. Northwest Russia. Implementation of this Action Plan will be reviewed at the June European Council in Göteborg.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0164"></a>

<p>The Council remains concerned at the difficult situation of the civilian population in Chechnya. In all political dialogue meetings with Russia, as well as in the OSCE and Council of Europe, the EU expresses its serious concerns at reports on violations of human rights and humanitarian law, in particular forced disappearances, summary executions, torture and arbitrary detentions. The EU is keeping the pressure on the Russian authorities to bring human rights violations before the court. The Council regularly expresses its disappointment that only very few complaints received by Mr Kalamanov have been followed by criminal proceedings so far.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council keeps stressing to Russia that the return of the OSCE Assistance Group to Chechnya is important and that it should be able to fulfil its full mandate. Foreign Minister Ivanov recently expressed Russia's agreement to the return of the Assistance Group. Only a few technical questions remain to be resolved. The Council will watch closely to see if Ivanov's statement is followed by concrete steps.</p>
<p>In view of the Commission for human rights in Geneva (19-27 March), the EU is to bring the human rights situation in Chechnya before the Commission, considering that the recommendations from last year's Commission have not been fully implemented and that the human rights situation remains unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>As long as the situation in Chechnya does not substantially improve, the Council will insist on discussing this point at all political dialogue meetings and it will explain that the lack of progress on Chechnya remains an obstacle to developing the full scope of the envisaged EU-Russia partnership. Upcoming opportunities to express the Council's concern are the Cooperation Council with Russia on 10 April and the EU-Russia Summit on 17 May.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0168"></a>

<p>Central to its programme for effective development cooperation, the Swedish Presidency is committed to the campaign against poverty.

<p>The Council as a whole is deeply committed to the fight against poverty. We believe that we possess the knowledge and resources to make substantial progress towards the international development goal of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by the year 2015. You will remember that this goal was confirmed by 149 Heads of State and Government at the UN Millennium Summit last autumn.</p>
<p>In its joint declaration with the Commission on 10 November 2000, the Council stressed that the main objective of Community development policy must be to reduce and, eventually, to eradicate poverty. Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon. Experience shows that poverty is not just a matter of lack of material resources – it is also a lack of access to power. To be poor means not being able to make one's voice heard. It is to feel insecure. To be poor is to have very little chance of influencing one's own life. This implies that poverty includes much more than the conventional dimensions of income or consumption. Poverty also includes risk, vulnerability, voicelessness and powerlessness. The fight against poverty must take all these dimensions into consideration. The perception of the poor themselves must be the starting point.</p>
<p>Bringing the different dimensions into our understanding of poverty inevitably leads us to see its context specificity.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in their declaration, the Council and the Commission went on to discuss ways of combating poverty, highlighting the importance of measures to improve:</p>
<p>Access to adequate food supplies, health and education, natural resources and drinking water, land, employment and credit facilities, information and communication technologies, political involvement, services and infrastructure. The Council also emphasised the need for consolidating the democratic process, respect for human rights, peace and the prevention of conflict, the development of social policies and the integration of social and environmental concerns in macro-economic reform programmes.</p>
<p>Another important dimension of development is the gravity of the communicable diseases, especially HIV/AIDS. In view of the global dimension of the problem and its impact on poverty, targeting this problem must be considered an absolute necessity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the declaration stressed the integration of developing countries, in particular the least developed among them, into the world economy. In this respect, the Council recognised that economic growth was essential, although not sufficient in itself to ensure poverty reduction.</p>
<p>The Council also supported the Commission’s view that Community activities should be concentrated in a limited number of areas selected on the basis of their contribution towards reducing poverty and for which Community action provides added value. These are trade, regional integration and cooperation, support to macroeconomic framework, transport, food security and institutional capacity building.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to the new development policy, the Commission has, on several occasions, stated that it will, early 2001, deliver a communication on how to strengthen its capacity to address the objective of poverty reduction in the EC development cooperation. The Swedish Presidency is of firm belief that the Commission will live up to its commitment in this area. Poverty cannot be handled as a sector or separate part of development cooperation. To implement the development policy, the interdisciplinary and poverty focused approach to development partnerships must be strengthened. There is also a need for improved coherence among different policy areas focusing on poverty alleviation. Increasing competence and capacity of the Commission to fully embrace the poverty reduction objective is a means to achieve this.</p>
<p>As regards the elimination of third world debt, which is obviously relevant to the fight against poverty, the Council would refer to its answer to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0108_EN.html">H-0108/01</a> from Mr Brian Crowley.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0170"></a>

<p>Sanctions against the Taliban - and not against Afghanistan - have been adopted by the UN Security Council following the Taliban's refusal to extradite Usama bin Laden, who is abusing his host country as a basis to launch acts of international terrorism and as a convenient cover to set up a network of training camps for radical terrorist groups. The relevant UNSC Resolution 1267 (1999) further accuses the Taliban of, inter alia, massive violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law. The sanctions adopted concern a flight ban for aircraft under Taliban control and a freezing of Taliban assets.</p>
<p>As a result of the Taliban's persistent refusal to comply with the pertinent UNSC Resolutions, the UNSC adopted, in December 2000, its Resolution 1333 (2000), which oblige all UN Member States to adopt a new set of sanctions against the Taliban regime. These sanctions demand in particular: the prohibition of direct or indirect supply, sale and transfer of arms and related military material; the prohibition of the direct or indirect supply, sale and transfer of technical advise, assistance or training related to military activities of Taliban forces; the withdrawal of military experts and advisors from the Taliban regime; the closure of Taliban and of Ariana airlines offices; the freezing of assets of Usama bin Laden an individuals or entities associated with him; the prohibition of the sale, supply or transfer of the chemical acetic anhydride (necessary for the production of Heroin).</p>
<p>The Council, while fully sharing the honourable MEP's preoccupations concerning the disastrous humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, does not believe that these sanctions have or will disrupt the distribution of relief supplies. On the contrary, these targeted sanctions are aimed against a regime which, due to its ruthless pursuit of the civil war and of its massive violations of human rights and the international humanitarian law, is primarily responsible for the disastrous situation in Afghanistan. The severe drought has contributed to a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation. The Council expects that the sanctions will contribute to reduce outside interference and to promote a negotiated settlement of the Afghan conflict. The Council further expects that they will lead to a reduction in the production of Afghan drugs, thus reducing the revenue necessary for the Taliban to pursue and to finance the war.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the EU will continue to provide humanitarian aid to internally displaced Afghans and to Afghan refugees in neighbouring countries, whenever the difficult conditions on the ground allow.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0172"></a>

As the Council had already the opportunity to do in its answer given to the question raised by Mary Honeyball during Question Time last February, it recalls the ongoing work in the following areas:</p>
<p>Following last December's Council (Industry/Energy) agreement on a political orientation on the proposed Directive for the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the internal market, the Council will, within the coming weeks, formally adopt its common position on this text, which should confirm the commitment of Member States to a indicative Community target of electricity from renewable energy sources of 22.1% by the year 2010. This Directive will represent a significant progress in favour of electricity from renewable energy sources, all the more needed given the difficulties faced by the Climate change negotiations.</p>
<p>The Council (Industry/Energy) has welcomed with much interest the presentation of the Commission's Green Paper: "Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply" at its December meeting. This paper, launched to raise an overall debate, proposes a strategy for dealing with the increasing dependence of the Union with regard to energy supply over a 20-year period. Within this strategy, as proposed by the Commission the enhancement of diversification of energy supplies and sources is an important part, and includes the increased efforts in the research of (alternative) new and clean energy sources (ies).</p>
<p>A comprehensive European sustainable development strategy will be prepared with a view to its examination by the European Council (Göteborg) in June 2001. To that effect, the Council, on the basis of a report from the Commission, will be examining the ongoing work on the strengthening of the strategy for the integration of environmental aspects and sustainable development into the energy sector (policy), as adopted at the European Council in Helsinki (1999). This examination will also include consideration of the Commission's Action Plan to improve energy efficiency as well as the proposal for a 6th Community Action Plan on sustainable development. It is our intention to draw some conclusions at the May Energy/Industry Council, in order to bring this work forward. Moreover, we expect that a number of actions will be launched under the Action Plan on energy efficiency on the basis of the priorities identified by the Council at its meeting on 5 December last.</p>
<p>Furthermore the Council recalls that among existing instruments for the promotion of cleaner energy, (the ALTENER and CARNOT subprogrammes of the Energy), the framework programme on Energy, i.e. ALTENER, SAVE, ETAP and CARNOT, is of specific (are particularly) importance (t).</p>
<p>Last but not least, as regards the relation between clean energy and physical disruptions, the Council considers that the progress towards the achievement of a fully operational internal energy market, as stated in the Lisbon European Council conclusions, will contribute to diminishing the influence of external factors on security of supply.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0176"></a>

<p>The ongoing BSE- and Foot-and-Mouth disease crisis affecting the farming sector and the knock-on effect which this has on related services sectors in the Community will inevitably lead to new approaches for the fulfilment of the objectives of the CAP being considered in particular in identifying and promoting new growth areas in farming, including the encouragement of consumer and environmentally friendly production as well as the development of a more diversified rural economy.</p>

In this way, it may better guarantee a real future for farming, for young farmers and family farms while defining a better framework for rural development. Furthermore, the Council hopes that the national authorities - which can already use for this purpose the facilities of the Regulation 1257/99 - will implement those measures while elaborating programmes and projects ensuring the cofinancing of such opportunities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0181"></a>

<p>Regarding the Council's general attitude towards subsidies within the energy sector, the decision in ECOFIN on 12 February 2001 should be noted. The directive on mineral oils, which includes harmonised rules for the taxation of mineral oils, allows for Council decisions regarding certain exemptions from those rules, whereby a unanimous decision in the Council is required. Some of the older exemptions expired by the end of 2000, while others were automatically extended. ECOFIN took the decision that, from now on, all exemptions should be time-limited and should not be subject to automatic extension. Most exemptions have now been extended for six years while some, which concern tax refunds for diesel in the transport sector, will only be extended for two years.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0183"></a>

<p>–	Human rights, including the situation of women and girls, are an important item in the political dialogue with Iran.</p>
<p>–	The European Union is considering, as in previous years, tabling a resolution on the human rights situation in Iran at the UN Commission for Human Rights in Geneva. Such a resolution will include references to the situation of Iranian women and girls.</p>
<p>–	The EU supports the call by the UN Special Representative on Iran on all branches of the Government of Iran to take further measures to ensure full and equal enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights.</p>
<p>The Council welcomes the efforts made, in particular by the Iranian Parliament, to improve the status of women and girls in Iran. It regrets that these efforts in many cases have not yet been translated into law. As a matter of fact, in law, women are discriminated against in many different ways, mainly based on Islamic law: inheritance (only half of that of a man), right of divorce, legal testimony, freedom of movement (permission to leave the country), etc. In practice, women are also discriminated against on the labour market (lower wages).</p>
<p>At the same time, the EU recognises that the situation of women is in many respects better in Iran than in many of the neighbouring countries. Women enjoy full legal rights to participate in political life in Iran; there are several women in the Iranian Parliament and some in important positions in the Government, such as one Vice-President. Women practice almost all professions - lawyers, journalists, doctors, business people, teachers; 60 per cent of university students are women.</p>

<p>The Polish law of 7 January 1993 protects the life of unborn children and/or foetuses. The number of abortions in that applicant country has declined sharply: from more than 100 000 per year until 1988 to a few hundred in recent years. Representatives of the Presidency and of the EP have criticised the Polish law prohibiting abortion. As penal law is not subject to the ‘acquis’, does such a law have any relevance in negotiations with applicant countries, and would it play a role in the accession process?</p>
<p>Is the Council planning to include the issue of abortion law in the EU information campaign being carried out in Poland to prepare that country for membership or in any activity with that in mind?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Council would like to inform the honourable Members that it is not in the habit of expressing its views on the content of statements made by national ministers.</p>
<p>The Council believes that Poland continues to fulfil the political Copenhagen accession criteria, with which the applicant countries must have complied and which relate, namely, to stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for, and the protection of, minorities.</p>
<p>With regard to the special issue of abortion, the Council would remind the honourable Members that national abortion legislation does not fall within the Community’s competence. The issue of conformity with the Community’s regulations does not therefore arise.</p>
<p>With regard to Ireland, the Council also wishes to remind the honourable Members of Protocol No 17, annexed to the Treaty of European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, and of the Declaration of 1 May 1992 of the High Contracting Parties to the Treaty on European Union, which constitutes a legal interpretation of that Protocol.</p>
<p>The Council would remind the honourable Member that, in the Nice conclusions on 7–11 December 2000, the European Council insisted upon the historic significance of the European Union’s enlargement process, together with the political priority to be given to making this process succeed. The Council has welcomed the fact that the accession negotiations with the applicant countries have been intensified. These have led to very important progress, especially in recent months. This is naturally inconsistent with any suspicion of prejudice against any of the applicant countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Troika notably pressed the authorities to provide information about the disappearances. Belarus stressed that investigations were under way, but had not led to any concrete result yet.</p>
<p>The EU will continue to press Belarus in this regard on every occasion, notably through its Heads of Mission in Minsk. It will also pursue its TACIS projects for the promotion of democracy in Belarus, supporting civil society in particular.

<p>On 5-7 February 2000, extremely serious incidents occurred in El Ejido in Andalusia. Both large numbers of eye witnesses and the media stated that the riots were racist and xenophobic in nature, and the European Parliament adopted a resolution severely censuring what had taken place. What does the Council intend to do in view of the fact that there have been no prosecutions or sentences in connection with the events at El Ejido a year ago, although almost 700 complaints have been lodged?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>1.	The honourable Members should note that extensive and intensive debates are currently being conducted within the Council’s different bodies on a number of issues affecting immigration policy within the framework of an overarching strategy.</p>
<p>2.	It may be remembered that Article 63 of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides for the Council to decide upon measures relating to policy on both legal and illegal immigration.</p>
<p>The European Council in Tampere called for a common EU policy on immigration to be developed and emphasised the need for an overarching strategy on all problems and issues affecting immigration. The Tampere conclusions gave priority not only to the fight against illegal immigration but also to an integration policy granting third country citizens legal status with appropriate rights and guarantees. The need to enter into partnership with immigrants’ countries of origin was also emphasised.</p>
<p>3.	So as to be able to implement the regulations in Article 63 of the Treaty, the Commission has, as a result of the Tampere conclusions, designed a ‘scoreboard’ for monitoring progress in creating an ‘area of freedom, security and justice’ in the European Union. The scoreboard provides a detailed framework and a timetable for measures which will deal with all the relevant problems outlined in the Tampere conclusions in terms of a coordinated strategy. The Commission is also considering developing a new immigration strategy and establishing a framework for the Community’s immigration policy. A communication was therefore submitted recently to the Council, with a long-term strategy for dealing with immigration that requires a large number of effective measures to be taken both by the Community and the Member States.</p>
<p>4.	On the basis of the scoreboard, the Commission has already presented the Council with various proposals for legislative measures, and these are at present being discussed both at technical and political levels. The Commission will shortly be tabling further proposals which will be announced on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>5.	With regard to partnership with immigrants’ countries of origin, the work done by the high-level group for asylum and immigration is of the greatest importance. The high-level group developed an integrated strategy, not confined to any one pillar, for tackling the basic reasons why people migrate or become refugees and drew up action plans for certain countries from which asylum seekers and/or illegal immigrants come, including Morocco. Within the framework for implementing this plan in the course of the year 2000, two measures are of special relevance to the situation of migrant workers in Spain. These measures, comprising the following, are described in a document that was presented to the European Council in Nice.</p>
<p>–	Programmes to assist the integration of Moroccan immigrants in Spain, for which the Spanish authorities have earmarked a total of EUR 4 373 589.</p>
<p>–	An agreement between ministers of health and social affairs from Spain and Morocco concerning Moroccan seasonal workers in Spain.</p>
<p>6.	The Council also emphasises that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is applicable to the Community institutions and the Member States only when they apply Community law, which is not the case in the current situation. However, the Council has resources available to it, such as the programme for combating social exclusion, and, through these, it can intervene to improve situations.</p>
<p>7.	Finally, the Council would ask the honourable Members to note that the events in El Ejido, the prosecution of those responsible for the criminal acts committed under these circumstances, and decisions concerning preventive measures are issues which fall within the competence of the Member State concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Does the Council acknowledge that denying the Kurds their rights is the root cause of the problem of Kurdish refugees?

<p>Illegal immigration towards the European Union is one of the main issues the Council is dealing with, as shown by the conclusions of the European Councils in Tampere, Santa Maria da Feira and Nice. As the honourable Member will be aware, the European Council committed the European Union to intensified cooperation to combat trafficking in human beings, following the tragic events in Dover last year. However, regarding the first question, it is not for the Council to conduct such an inquiry. This matter falls within the exclusive competence of the authorities of each Member State. The Council is not authorised to take a position on a matter which does not fall within the scope of the powers conferred upon it by the Treaties.</p>
<p>The Council is concerned about the difficult situation for Kurds in many of their countries of origin. But there are many reasons why people, including Kurds, are fleeing to Europe from their countries of origin, including poverty, economic hardship or simply a natural desire for a better life, as well as political persecution. The EU is doing what it can to promote conditions which will reduce these pressures both politically and economically. The Accession Partnership with Turkey has a number of priorities and intermediate objectives with specific relevance for Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin. The EU strongly supports the Peace Process in the Middle East. It welcomes the fact that under UNSCRs a significant proportion of the oil-for-food programme is used in the Kurdish parts of Iraq. The Council also underlines the importance of the Action Plan for Iraq on asylum and migration adopted by the Tampere European Council. The Council is currently working on the implementation of the Action Plan, which includes, among other measures, a dialogue with Turkey on questions concerning migration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0212"></a>

<p>The Council is fully aware of the environmental problems caused by the plans for expanding the port of Primorsk, by the construction of a pipeline to that port and by the fact that tankers will be navigating the Gulf of Finland. The matter was therefore discussed under "other business" by the Council at its meetings of 10 October 2000 and 8 March 2001 (Environment).</p>
<p>The Community has raised the matter on different occasions in the relevant bodies under the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, including at the EU-Russia summit on 30 October 2000. Each time, the Community expressed its concern and suggested establishing, in the framework of the Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context, an international panel that would evaluate the trans-border impact of the extensions of the port. The Council was informed that the Russian authorities have undertaken an environmental impact assessment and will take measures to preserve the environment around Primorsk and to protect the approaches to that port against oil spills. In particular, they informed the Finnish authorities that they intend to protect the maritime approaches to Primorsk by a strict implementation of the Marpol convention, i.a. by imposing the anticipated use of double hull tankers, and that they would in addition consider carefully the plans for constructing the oil terminal and the pipeline to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>All the statistics show that it is becoming increasingly difficult for refugees to enter the EU. The extension of transporters' responsibility introduced during the French Presidency is simply another expression of this tendency.

This means that it will become more difficult for refugees to enter the EU legally to seek asylum and plays into the hands of the people smugglers.</p>
<p>Is it reasonable to expect refugees fleeing from countries which are guilty of massive violations of human rights to have 'their papers in order'? Does the Council not see a risk that the extension of transporters' responsibility may be playing even more into the hands of people smugglers by making the conditions for entering the EU legally even stricter?

<p>The proposal to which the honourable Member refers is an initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive on the harmonisation of financial penalties imposed on carriers transporting into the territory of the Member States third-country nationals lacking the documents necessary for admission. <a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>This text, which was forwarded to the European Parliament for consultation on 6 September 2000, is at present being examined by the competent Council bodies.</p>
<p>The initiative draws on the will to cooperate in implementing a coherent policy for combating illegal immigration at European level. Such a policy cannot be restricted to taking measures that apply solely to illegal immigrants. Action must also and especially be directed effectively against the vectors and means that accompany, or even encourage, the phenomenon. Making carriers answerable is an essential part of this approach.</p>
<p>The implementation of this policy must, however, involve a shared attitude on the part of Member States, since it is essential that the European Union present a united front in its struggle against illegal immigration. A common approach is also required for the system to be effective. Divergent situations in the various Member States could lead to distortions of competition in particular in the field of air transport.</p>
<p>In that light, the essential aim of the initiative is to harmonise the penalties applicable to carriers as provided for in Article 26 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement.</p>
<p>I would draw the attention of the honourable Member to the fact that according to Article 26(2) of that Convention and recital No 3 of the French initiative, ‘the draft Directive is without prejudice to the obligations resulting from the Geneva Convention of 28 June 1951 on the status of refugees, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967.’</p>
<p>As recognised by Heads of State and Governments at the Tampere European Council a future Community asylum and immigration policy must be based on the full and integral application of the Geneva Convention, on rules governing the orderly admission and integration of legally arriving third country nationals, on measures aimed at combating illegal immigration, as well as on partnership with countries of origin of asylum seekers and illegal migrants. The French initiative falls under the third of these four guiding principles.</p>
<p>Finally, I would point out that the competent administrations of the Member States regularly train employees of transport companies in the detection of false papers and that it must be remembered that any person who wishes to enter another State must first pass through the passport control organised by the border police of that State.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As is well known, American and British aircraft attacked military targets outside Baghdad on 16 February. The reason given for the attack was an increase in Iraqi anti-aircraft fire directed at the British and US warplanes patrolling the "no­fly" zones in northern and southern Iraq. The United States and United Kingdom have made statements stressing that the action was taken by way of self-defence, was of a routine nature and should not be regarded as an escalation or change of policy. Several countries have criticised the action taken. The Security Council held a brief discussion of the matter during informal consultations on 20 February.</p>
<p>As was also noted earlier by the Presidency during a debate at the European Parliament on 1 March of this year, there are differing opinions within the Union concerning the basis in international law for such military actions, including those in the no-fly zones. One Member State participated in the strikes. Other Member States have deplored what happened, but the Common Foreign and Security Policy depends on the existence of a common position and, as you all know, that is not the case here.</p>
<p>As for the sanctions, Security Council Resolution 1284 of December 1999 allows for the possibility of suspending them provided the Iraqi Government cooperates fully with the UN inspectors responsible for disarmament in Iraq. It is encouraging in this connection to note that a dialogue has been initiated in New York between the Secretary-General and the Iraqi Government. Naturally, we hope that these discussions can help break the deadlock and that Iraq will decide to cooperate with the UN and the UN’s weapons inspectors on the basis of the current Security Council Resolutions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0233"></a>

<p>All observers agree that the human rights situation in the People's Republic of China has considerably deteriorated over the last few years. With only a few days to go until the opening of this year's session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, does the Council not consider that it ought, as a matter of urgency, to state the EU's position publicly on the tabling of a resolution condemning the grave and persistent human rights violations in China?

<p>–	The Council hopes that the financial crisis will not seriously disrupt economic development in Turkey or create hardship for the Turkish population. The crisis will not itself affect close relations between the EU and Turkey or Turkey's candidature for the EU. The EU will continue to support the Turkish reform efforts in the framework of the pre-accession strategy, including a structural adjustment facility of EUR 150 million decided upon last year which will also help to carry forward the necessary structural reforms.</p>
<p>–	In the recently adopted Accession Partnership for Turkey, implementation of the anti-inflation and structural reform programme agreed with the IMF and the World Bank is listed among the short-term priorities. A new economic programme is being prepared by Turkey in close cooperation with the IMF, in order to replace the previous programme. The economic reforms in Turkey which the EU sees as priorities are set out in the Accession Partnership and include the "swift implementation of the financial sector reform, aiming at guaranteeing transparency and surveillance".</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0240"></a>

<p>The EU has on several occasions raised the recommendations contained in the report of the Electoral Observation Mission to Sri Lanka, both publicly and bilaterally with the Sri Lankan authorities.</p>
<p>On 18 December, the EU issued a declaration in the run up of the World Bank Development Forum on Sri Lanka, where good governance was one of the key issues. The declaration recalled that the observer mission was a demonstration of the EU's support for the democratic process in Sri Lanka, regretted and condemned the anomalies observed throughout the campaign and the violence during the voting, and reminded the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) of the need to implement the mission's recommendations in order to guarantee greater transparency in future elections.</p>
<p>More recently, the issue was discussed at the EC-Sri Lanka Joint Commission, which took place in Colombo on 27/28 February 2000, within the wider discussion on improving governance in Sri Lanka. The EU was anxious to engage GoSL in constructive talks on this issue, following up on the report's recommendations and with the aim of developing an agreed programme of action which would improve the quality of governance in the country.</p>
<p>The GoSL assured the EU that the principal recommendations of the report had been noted and that necessary measures were either under consideration, notably in the framework of the revision of the Sri Lankan constitution which the GoSL proposed before the elections, or were already being implemented.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Council is not yet in a position to confirm whether the High Representative Solana will be able to meet the Sri Lankan President during her forthcoming visit in Brussels. The Council is, however, confident that the President of the Commission will raise, once again, the crucial question of improving good governance in Sri Lanka in his talks with the President Kumaratunga.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0146"></a>

<p>In its declaration on the future of the Union annexed to the Treaty of Nice, the Intergovernmental Conference expressed its desire for a broad and in-depth debate on the future of the European Union. This debate, encouraged by the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, in cooperation with the Commission and with the participation of the European Parliament, will involve all the interested parties: the representatives of the national parliaments and public opinion as a whole, including representatives of political, economic and academic fields, representatives of civil society and candidate countries, according to procedures to be defined. This process will culminate in an Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. The Commission believes that, at that conference, and also during the preparatory stages for it, the fundamental issues on the aims of the Union should be raised.</p>
<p>The questions we will be raising on the future of the Union will lead us to a consideration of the distribution of Community competences. It is within that framework that sport, amongst other issues, will no doubt be dealt with. However, it does not seem appropriate to approach this ‘constitutional’ debate by dealing with specific policies. We must first of all produce a coherent and sustainable plan for the enlarged Union. Once this coherent plan has been drawn up, we will be able more specifically to raise the question of the role of a particular policy and we will therefore have the opportunity to create a specific legal basis for sport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0224"></a>

<p>There have been delays and shortcomings in the implementation of this programme. Six years after the approval of the operational programme and despite the allocation of significant Community funds, not a single part of the project is operational. Therefore, on 19 January, the Commission sent a letter to the Greek authorities requesting clarifications and raising the possibility of applying Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) 4253 of 19 December 1988, which lays down that, in the event of proven irregularities, Community aid can be reduced or even cancelled.</p>
<p>The Commission will not take a decision until it has made an in-depth analysis of the Greek authorities’ response.</p>
<p>In the current circumstances, the Commission has agreed with the Greek authorities that this project will not form part of the new ‘Environment 2000-2006’ Operational Programme and that the corresponding sum would be added to the national reserve, with a view to a return to the programme at the appropriate time for the co-financing of environmental projects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0231"></a>

<p>The Commission acknowledges that certain weaknesses have been identified in relation to the programming periods previous to 2000-2006 with regard to the implementation of the Community INTERREG initiative on the Franco-Spanish border. The difficulties arose essentially as a result of the absence of common programming and management methods for these Structural Fund actions.</p>
<p>For the 2000-2006 programming period, within its Guidelines on Interreg III, the Commission has laid down that the use of new methods for the development of cross-border cooperation is mandatory. Hence, item 7 of the said Guidelines lays down that the development of a common strategy is a necessary requirement for the acceptance of projects proposed for Community funding. All specific operations selected must be of a clearly cross-border nature. The only eligible operations are therefore those which are selected and implemented jointly. Furthermore, the implementation of the cooperation must make use of common management structures.</p>
<p>In relation to the existence of legal structures for cross-border cooperation, the Commission’s Guidelines for Interreg 2000-2006 allow Member States the opportunity of choosing the most suitable means for promoting that cooperation. In the specific case of the Franco-Spanish border, the two Member States and all the regions involved have proposed that the region of Aquitaine should take on the role of common management authority for the new programme. The role of payment authority will be taken by the Spanish Minister for Finance. A joint technical secretariat will operate from the region of Aquitaine. Three subcommittees for the selection of projects will also operate in a joint manner.</p>
<p>This programme was presented to the Commission on 22 November 2000. It has been deemed admissible and negotiations are commencing between the Commission and the competent regional and national authorities. The Commission expects it to be formally approved by the summer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0135"></a>

<p>The European Employment Strategy (EES) which is the cornerstone for European Social Fund (ESF) activity deals with this issue. In guideline 7, the employment guidelines encourage Member States to “implement appropriate measures to meet the needs of the disabled, ethnic minorities and migrant workers as regards there integration in to the labour market and set national targets where appropriate for this purpose”. Recently agreed ESF programmes reflect these commitments.</p>
<p>In reforming ESF, there was a desire to move away from the target group approach to programme development to one based on defining clearer policy themes. This aimed to move to a position of management by objectives rather than management by inputs (e.g. numbers in a target group). Consequently, one of the 5 policy fields specifically promoted through ESF focuses on “promoting equal opportunities for all in accessing the labour market, with particular emphasis on those exposed to social exclusion”.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission considers equal opportunities not only with regard to women and men but in its broadest sense in the application of Structural Funds allocations. There are a number of references to the objective of including all groups of people and combating any discrimination or social exclusion.1</p>
<p>The aim of the Community Initiative EQUAL, funded by the European Social Fund, is to promote new means of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.</p>
<p>In this framework, ESF programmes have made a clear commitment to supporting the needs of people with disabilities and others at risk of social exclusion. Latest estimates suggest that the ESF will contribute in the region of 9 billion Euro towards the fight against social exclusion over the period 2000-2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0136"></a>

<p>The Commission is currently finalising its opinion on the Council’s common position on the Directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources. This opinion will also set out the Commission’s position on the provisions in the common position relating to the incineration of certain forms of waste including biodegradable urban and industrial waste.</p>
<p>With regard to waste management, the Community Support Framework for Italy’s Objective 1 regions stipulates that actions will focus on: the establishment of ‘ambiti territoriali ottimali’ and their management plans (a prerequisite for undertaking further actions); the promotion and staging of information campaigns for prevention and innovation; the development of a system for integrated waste management in line with Community priorities and the organisation of training actions and actions aimed at creating new businesses. </p>
<p>The definition of the management plans (drafted in accordance with Community Directives 91/156/EEC, 91/689/EEC and 94/62/EEC) and priorities for action must be consistent with the Community priorities in the field of waste management and must stipulate the prior analysis of the region’s needs and specific characteristics. </p>
<p>The Commission – in line with the Community Strategy for Waste Management as well as the Parliament Resolution and the Council Resolution on waste management in the Community – considers that ‘prevention of the generation of waste shall remain the first priority, where the generation can not be avoided, it should be reused or recovered for its material or its energy. Preference should be given, where environmentally sound, to the recovery of materials over energy recovery operations’. In other words, recycling shall take precedence over incineration. As stipulated in the above-mentioned directives, waste management plans must be reported to the Commission, which will establish whether they comply with the directives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Commission grants authorisations for mergers involving European companies. Its main concern is clearly to ensure that the rules on competition are applied.</p>
<p>Major companies which decide to merge always use mergers to get rid of thousands of jobs and to close down industrial sites.</p>
<p>The adverse employment and social consequences of mergers usually come to the attention of public opinion when the merger is announced and therefore cannot escape the Commission’s notice when it gives its opinion.</p>
<p>The job losses are particularly shocking because they occur in companies whose success and good performance are plain for all to see. Despite this, the Commission does not seem to take any account of this aspect of mergers when it grants authorisations.</p>
<p>Since the European Union, in all of the texts it adopts on economic policy, is in the habit of adding one or two paragraphs saying that it wishes to preserve Europe’s social dimension, and in order to ensure that these declarations do not remain just meaningless words, we should like to know how many mergers the current Commission has authorised and how many jobs have been lost as a result?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The worldwide trend of increasing merger activities is clearly reflected in the growing number of cases notified to and decided by the Commission. In 2000 the Commission made 345 decisions, which means an increase of 28% compared to 1999. The respective figure for 1999 was 270, which represented an 18% increase over the previous year. In 2000, 321 cases were cleared in Phase I, of which 28 were cleared conditionally; in phase II three cases were cleared unconditionally, 12 with conditions attached, and two were prohibited (six cases were withdrawn during an in-depth investigation before a final decision was taken).</p>
<p>It is not possible to ascertain exactly how many jobs are lost due to mergers. The figures mentioned (if any) when mergers are announced very often do not adequately reflect the actual development afterwards. Figures provided may both under- and overestimate eventual job losses. In addition, it is not always clear, whether job losses can really be attributed to mergers as such, or whether they are not rather the result of exogenous changes in market conditions and induced structural changes, which are at the same time the driving forces behind these mergers. A balanced evaluation of the effect of mergers and other restructuring on jobs would also have to take account of possible job preservation effects.</p>
<p>However, there can be no doubt that mergers do very often involve substantial cuts in employment, and that this presents a very severe problem, especially for those workers who are directly affected. The basic objective of the Community’s competition policy is to ensure the maintenance of competitive markets. At the same time, competition policy has important implications for employment and social policy and it seems necessary to examine the links which exist between these policies.</p>
<p>Within the current context it appears for example important that the views and interests of workers and their representatives are adequately reflected and heard in the process leading to the establishment of a merger. This concerns first of all effective involvement of workers' representatives within the concerned companies, through adequate and timely procedures of information and consultation as provided for in existing Community and national legislation and practice, as well as in legislation under adoption (notably the Commission's proposal on information and consultation in the EC). It also concerns the possibility for them to present their views to competent public authorities, notably on the implications of planned mergers, as provided for, e.g., in the Merger Regulation.</p>
<p>As announced in the Commission’s Social Policy Agenda of June last year and endorsed by the Nice European Council the Commission will continue to examine the relationship between social policy and competition policy with a view to better articulate both policies, as well as to address the employment and social consequences of economic and market integration (mergers, acquisitions).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0140"></a>

<p>In December 1998, the European Parliament organised a public hearing to collect information on action undertaken by the Member States to improve the safety of existing lifts in line with Commission Recommendation 95/216/EC<a href="#defann_48_1" name="refann_48_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>Indeed, a standard would offer Member States the possibility of defining an action plan to bring the safety level of existing installations progressively and selectively close to that of lifts installed under the New Lifts Directive. Such an action plan should aim at eliminating major risks in an initial phase with a view to avoiding any further serious injuries and fatalities.</p>

<p>The Commission believes it is important that the safety of lifts already in service continues to improve, which is the aim of Commission Recommendation 95/216/EC of 8 June 1995, concerning the improvement of safety for existing lifts. It recommends that Member States take all necessary action to improve the safety of existing lifts, based on the principles given in Annex I to the Recommendation.</p>
<p>The public hearing organised by Parliament in December 1998 certainly helped raise awareness on this issue within the Community.</p>
<p>A standard on the safety of existing lifts would be very useful. In fact the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) is currently drafting a standard on the “Rules for the improvement of safety of existing lifts”. This draft standard will soon be subject to public inquiry. It is likely to become an important tool for Member States in their efforts to take action according to the Commission Recommendation.</p>
<p>Parliament and Council Directive 95/16/EC of 29 June 1995, on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts assures the circulation of “new” lifts in the European economic area (EEA). It would therefore not be possible to use it as a legal base for mandating a harmonised CEN standard on existing lifts.</p>
<p>The elaboration of standards is a responsibility of CEN and is based on priorities laid down by all involved parties, as national standardisation bodies, industries, etc. CEN being a private body, it has the possibility to elaborate all documents it deems necessary or useful to help industry and to ensure a high level of safety. In the case where there is no mandate from the Commission, such an elaborated standard can not give any presumption of conformity according to New Approach Directives but remains a very useful guidance tool for industry and user.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport have been effective since 5th July 1997, the date of their publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. It is expected that the guidelines will be revised in 2002.</p>
<p>With respect to the issue of tendering in relation to the ferry services off the west coast of Scotland which are currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne, the state aid guidelines must be seen in the light of Council Regulation 3577/92 of 7 December 19922 on the freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States. Article 4 of this Regulation permits public service obligations for the provision of maritime transport services, within a Member State, on shipping companies participating in regular services to, from and between islands. Whenever a Member State imposes public service obligations, it shall define it precisely and entrust it on a non-discriminatory basis in respect of all Community shipowners; it shall also limit the financial support to the extra costs incurred by the operator in providing the service. A public tender is an effective way of meeting these requirements and ensuring the market price of the services concerned. It is for this reason that the state aid guidelines specify the expectation of a public tender as one of the criteria for permitting the reimbursement of operating losses incurred as a direct result of fulfilling certain public service obligations not to have to be formally notified as State aid under Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>There are currently no plans to alter Article 4 of Council Regulation 3577/92. Whatever form the revision of the state aid guidelines may finally take, the principle of non-discrimination will remain and will need to be fulfilled by Member States wishing to establish public service obligations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0154"></a>

<p>The main principles of the protection of the health and safety of workers are laid down by the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work. These principles are fully applicable to workers on board of all kind of vessels. Article 16 of this directive establishes that individual directives should be developed to cover activities of specific risk, in particular, in the field of fisheries and agriculture.</p>
<p>For this reason, in 1993, the Council adopted Directive 93/103/EC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for work on board fishing vessels.</p>
<p>This directive sets down the minimum safety and health requirements for new fishing vessels (in Annex I), and for existing vessels (in Annex II) including, inter alia, the minimum requirements on seaworthiness and stability, as well as on the conditions of decks, bulkheads and deckheads in order to prevent falls. In particular, Article 7(1) foresees that Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that, without prejudice to the skipper's responsibility, owners shall keep on board the vessel an adequate quantity of suitable equipment and survival equipment in good working order and, without prejudice to the provisions established by the Council Directive 89/656/EEC on the minimum requirements for the use by workers of personal protective equipment at the workplace, shall take account of the personal protective equipment specifications given in Annex IV to Directive 93/103/EC.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission, being extremely sensitive to the protection of falls and drowning, adopted a Communication in 1989 for the implementation of the Council Directive 89/656/EEC concerning the assessment of the safety aspects of personal protective equipment with a view to the choice and use thereof. Paragraph 8 of the Annex of this Communication describes the non-exhaustive information for evaluating life jackets for professional use as personal protective equipment. This description includes the risk, the origin and type of risk and the safety and performance criteria for selection of equipment.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission considers that the above mentioned directives cover in a reasonable way the prevention of the risk of drowning. However, it should be noted that it belongs to the national authorities of the Member States the control and enforcement of the national legislation transposing the Health and Safety Directives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0155"></a>

<p>Considerable concern is being expressed in the United Kingdom at the possible damage to human health from the new Terrestrial Trunk Radio ('TETRA') system, due to come into use very shortly. It is argued that the lower frequency used will interfere with brain-wave activity and increase the long-term risk of cancer. Can the Commission state what consideration was given to these health concerns when the TETRA standard was devised in the 1990s and whether it agrees that the current public concerns now need to be readdressed?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The honourable Member raises the important issue of how public health and new technologies interact as regards in particular the expanding use of telecommunication systems.</p>
<p>A European protection framework is already in place in form of the Council Recommendation of 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields. The Terrestrial Trunk Radio (TETRA) system, which the honourable Member mentions, was already known and taken into account during the preparation of the Recommendation, and the system is covered by the scope of the Recommendation. The exposure limits of the Recommendation are not based on the effects of any particular system, but on the guidelines regarding protection against health effects from exposure to electromagnetic fields developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection. These guidelines, which include specific exposure limits regarding the TETRA system, were endorsed by the Commission’s Scientific Steering Committee, which stated that these international guidelines provide the appropriate basis to develop exposure limits against public health risks.</p>
<p>In order to cover any new scientific findings and to ensure that the scientific basis, on which the Council Recommendation is based, is still valid, the Scientific Steering Committee has been asked to give an up-dated opinion in June 2001.</p>
<p>To ensure a uniform level of protection throughout the Community the Commission has mandated the standardisation bodies (CENELEC and ETSI) to work on establishing European standards, including harmonised methods of calculation and measurement. This will enable verification that the safe exposure limits set in the Recommendation are met. A first standard for mobile telephones is expected to be available in June 2001, and other standards will follow.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0157"></a>

<p>Given the high level of EU exports to the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (14,573 million euro in 2000, the fifth highest export market for the EU in the world) and given the importance of the Arabian Gulf in political and strategic terms, can the Commission explain the absence of a permanent accredited Delegation anywhere in the Gulf? Has it any plans to remedy this glaring deficiency?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the importance of opening a Delegation in Riyadh.</p>
<p>In 1998, the Commission included Saudi Arabia in its list of priorities for the opening of new Delegations and Offices. But, the Commission does not at present have sufficient resources - financial and human - to enable it to open all the Offices it would like.</p>
<p>The overall structure of the External Service is currently under review, not least to take account of the new needs arising from the reform and deconcentration of external assistance. The emphasis must be on consolidating the existing network of delegations.</p>
<p>The Commission cannot therefore give any undertaking as to when it might open a Delegation in Saudi Arabia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission shares the honourable Member's interest to ensure that new information and communication technologies benefit both rural and urban areas within the Community. The Commission recognises that such technologies can present an important opportunity for the economic and social development of rural areas, by overcoming features such as distance and isolation, which have previously constrained their development. However, to realise this potential, it is also clear that rural areas and communities need the same level of access to these technologies, and under similar conditions, to users of these technologies in urban centres.</p>
<p>The new Structural Funds regulations for the period 2000-2006 provide the scope for financing actions in this field. Indeed, the information society has been identified in Commission Guidelines for the period 2000-2006 as one of the priorities to be implemented. That priority has been converted into practice as a feature of most Objective 1 and 2 programmes. The choice of measures within these programmes is then the responsibility of the Member States and regions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the second instalment of intervention under the heading of innovative actions in regional policy includes financing for programmes to promote the information society at the service of regional development. This applies to all regions, rural or urban, that are eligible in whole or in part for Objectives 1 and 2.</p>
<p>In recognition of their interest for rural areas, the Commission identified the use of new technologies to make the products and services of rural areas more competitive as one of the four priority themes for the Community Initiative for rural development for the period 2000-2006, LEADER+.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0171"></a>

<p>The Commission is, of course, very aware of the desperate humanitarian situation which exists today in many parts of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Winters are particularly harsh in Afghanistan, made worse this year by the continuation during the winter of the ongoing conflict and by the prolonged effects of the worst drought in the country for 30 years.</p>
<p>International donors have reacted to this crisis with increased shipments of food aid and medical supplies, as well as continuing with support for activities in the field by United Nations agencies, international aid agencies and NGOs.</p>
<p>Except for a brief period following the introduction of the latest UN sanctions the activities of these aid agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have continued as previously.</p>
<p>The Commission’s own activities through the UN and others on behalf of vulnerable groups of internationally displaced persons (IDPs) and Afghan refugees are also continuing.</p>
<p>The Union’s position on the situation in Afghanistan is clear and is set out in the latest Common Position on Afghanistan dated 22 January 2001.</p>
<p>In this Common Position, which of course the Commission fully supports, the Union sets out its principle objectives as being the bringing about of a lasting peace, the ending of foreign intervention and the encouragement of an inter-Afghan dialogue through the UN.</p>
<p>The Union applies a set of sanctions, which were decided by the UN Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and are therefore mandatory for UN members. In addition, it continues to apply its own embargo on the export of arms, munitions and military equipment to those parts of Afghanistan that are not controlled by the Taliban and urges other countries to adopt a similar policy.</p>
<p>Some days ago, the restrictive measures against the Taliban set out in UNSCR 1333 of 19 December 2000 have been adopted by the Council following discussions between the Member States and the Commission. Any decision on the lifting of these sanctions will have to be compatible with the obligations of Member States under the UN Charter.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0173"></a>

<p>On 7 October 2000, the European Anti-Poverty Network adopted a resolution on healthcare for the disadvantaged, demanding that reducing health gaps should be a condition of membership of the Union and that the requirements set out in its resolution, which ranged from guaranteed access to all forms of healthcare to an enlarged role for NGOs should be applied to the applicant countries.

<p>The European Anti-Poverty Network (EAPN) resolution that is mentioned by the honourable Member firstly calls for European guidelines to improve access to healthcare for all and strongly argues for the need to develop an integrated approach to health issues within social inclusion. The Commission considers that the open method of coordination that has just started in the field of social inclusion provides the appropriate framework for addressing these EAPN concerns, keeping in mind the limits of Community competencies in the area of health.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 152 of the EC Treaty, Community action in the field of health complements and supports that of Member States, by promoting cooperation among them. It shall fully respect their responsibilities in the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care. Recent initiatives in this respect includes a Communication on the health strategy of the Community, and a proposal for a new programme of action in the field of public health (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0285">COM (2000) 285</a> final of 16.5.2000). The communication identifies wide variations and inequalities in health status among the serious public health problems that cannot be ignored. The proposal for a new programme, which is currently being discussed by Parliament and the Council, contains a key action on developing strategies and measures on socio-economic health determinants. The purpose is inter alia to develop a methodology for benchmarking and linking strategies to identify health inequalities, and to review and identify obstacles to access to health services across internal borders in the Community.</p>
<p>Concerning the need to promote equal access to health as a part of efforts for promoting social inclusion, the Nice European Council adopted a set of common objectives for policies against social exclusion and poverty, among which it is mentioned the need for "policies which aim to provide access for all to healthcare appropriate to their situation, including situations of dependency". The Commission is committed to ensuring that this priority is properly reflected in the national action plans to combat social exclusion that Member States will submit by 1st June 2001</p>
<p>The EAPN resolution also calls for universal and equal access to good quality social protection, including health care, to be a condition of membership of the Community for candidate countries.</p>
<p>Membership of the Community requires adoption and full implementation by a candidate country of the acquis communautaire. In the area of public health this covers essentially Community programmes and tobacco directives. In this context, the Council Recommendation 92/442/EEC on the Convergence of Social Protection Objectives and Policies sets out a range of principles to guide the development of social protection systems, including health care. From the starting of the negotiation process the Community has recalled the importance it attaches to assuring a high level of human health protection in the definition and implementation of all Community policies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the candidates countries are invited to develop a health monitoring system in order to obtain health data and indicators comparable with the Community health monitoring system. At the moment all the candidate countries, with the exception of Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, have accepted the acquis. This is already implemented in their legal system, or will be implemented before the accession. The Commission continues to monitor this closely.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0175"></a>

<p>Recent research carried out by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions has highlighted the fact that economic efficiency, environmental protection and workplace safety are three key policy areas of sustainable development. It has also shown that the cost of learning about the environment and health and safety is proportionately greater for SMUs than for larger companies and has suggested that informal local networks can reduce the costs of disseminating good practice. How does the Commission intend to follow up this research, with particular regard to helping SMUs to deal with these issues on the same basis as large companies?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The objective of the sustainable development policy is to ensure that enterprise policies, environmental policies and social policies are conducted consistently. In particular, in their implementation, they must take into account any impact they may have on each other, in order, for example, to ensure that the implementation of environmental measures will have the lowest possible impact on the international competitiveness of European enterprises.</p>
<p>The implementation of these policies can lead to the introduction of new legislation or legal obligations and thus place constraints on undertakings, in particular in the areas of the environment, health or safety, as demonstrated by the research conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.</p>
<p>In general, such constraints will be proportionally greater for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Taking size into account, the cost of learning about the regulatory framework (access to information, acting on that information, making adjustments for the particular circumstances of the enterprise, etc) is, of course, relatively higher for SMEs.</p>
<p>As a means of reducing the cost to SMEs, the proximity networks solution has been considered to be one of the most effective, and the operation of enterprise support networks such as Euro Info Centres (EICs) is a response to exactly that concern.</p>
<p>Those networks were set up for the purpose of providing, at local level and close to enterprises, information and assistance services covering all areas of interest to SMEs, particularly access to financing, participation in European programmes and the Community standards framework, including in the areas of the environment and employment.</p>
<p>Their mission is not confined to making information available, but extends to a proactive approach that can be adapted to enterprises' needs.</p>
<p>In that context, the EIC network has been especially active on environmental, health and safety matters. A campaign has been launched as part of the SAFE programme to promote best practice on matters of health and safety at the workplace, and considerable expertise on questions of the environment is present across the whole network.</p>
<p>Yet, although the diversity of the existing networks, born of different programmes and answering to specific objectives, makes it possible to respond to a wide variety of needs, it is also liable to project a heterogeneous image which can be a source of confusion to enterprises.</p>
<p>For that reason, and in the context of the multiannual programme for enterprises and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (2001-2005), the Commission has undertaken to review the operation of the existing support networks with a view to improving their integration and streamlining.</p>
<p>That approach is consistent with the line of reducing duplication and increasing efficiency in order to guarantee better visibility and ease of access to beneficiaries by boosting the operation of these services at local and regional level.</p>
<p>The Commission approved a first stage in that approach on 21 February 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0177"></a>

<p>To date, International Labour Organisation Convention No 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour has been ratified by a total of 62 countries around the world, including a very large number of developing countries. The pace of ratification of the new Convention by ILO Member States overall has thus been very rapid, and according to the ILO itself has set a record compared with other ILO Conventions. The Commission is hopeful that this will contribute to the new Convention becoming increasingly recognised as a standard of universal validity.</p>
<p>The Commission is following with particular interest the ratification of the Convention by the Member States, notably in view of the Recommendation adopted by the Commission on 15 September 2000, which encouraged those Member States which have not yet done so to ratify the new Convention. So far, the Convention has been ratified by six Member States: Ireland, Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal and Denmark.</p>
<p>While it is difficult to assess the implementation of the new Convention in practice, given that it only entered into force in November 2000, the Commission will follow closely the ILO's own assessments in this regard.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to take this opportunity to stress that the elimination of child labour is a goal which it is actively pursuing in its own development policy, notably via the funding of projects specifically devoted to this issue in a number of developing countries. The Commission would further underline that the phenomenon of child labour is closely linked to poverty, and that poverty elimination is at the heart of its development policy in general. It is against this background that the Community in the trade context continues to pursue a policy of incentives to promote core labour standards, rather than sanctions, which would be counterproductive in that they risk exacerbating the social problems that they seek to redress.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0179"></a>

<p>The Commission fully shares the honourable Member’s concern for the difficult circumstances currently being faced by many sectors within the farming community. The Commission confirms the importance it attaches to the sustainable development of the Community’s rural areas, and to promoting thriving communities within these areas. These priorities were highlighted in the Agenda 2000 reforms, which saw rural development policy become established as the second pillar of the common agricultural policy (CAP) and ensured that Community rural development support would be extended to all rural areas within the Community.</p>
<p>In recent months the Commission has approved almost all of the 68 rural development programmes drawn up by Member States and regions in the context of this new, strengthened rural development policy for the period 2000-2006. These programmes contain a broad range of measures designed to improve the economic situation of both farmers and the wider community in rural areas. Given the diversity of the Community’s rural areas, much flexibility has been left to relevant Member State authorities to identify those measures best suited to meeting the specific needs of their rural communities.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware that the dramatic rise in fuel prices during 2000 has had a significant impact on the operating costs of fishing businesses and that a large number of those businesses, because of the rise in these operating costs, have not been able to cover all or part of their fixed costs. In view of this situation, and bearing in mind that fuel already enjoys heavy tax reductions in all Member States, several Member States have informed the Commission of their intention to compensate for the rises in the price of fuel by means of specific reductions or exemptions from certain operating costs, in particular from certain social security contributions. These Member States considered that this was an exceptional situation, which threatened the survival of fishing activity.</p>
<p>The Commission, while acknowledging the abrupt and sudden nature of the price rises in fuel and their harmful effect on the financial situation of fishing businesses, considers that this is not an exceptional situation. In fact, this is a fuel price level which, in real terms, has already been reached and even exceeded and which may be repeated in the future. Furthermore, the Commission believes that the impact has been all the more harshly felt since fishing is suffering from a significant excess of capacity and serious overcapitalisation. The combined effects of these factors are an increase in operating costs linked to the absence of real economies of scale, a decrease in income and, for the more modern vessels, excessive costs for finance and depreciation.</p>
<p>With regard to the national aid that has already been discussed and since this is operating aid, the Commission, having concluded in its preliminary enquiry that this does not seem compatible with the Treaty, has decided to open an enquiry in this respect. Furthermore, the Commission notes that this aid does not come within an overall restructuring plan aimed at re-establishing reasonable conditions for the viability of the sector in question.</p>
<p>It is therefore not the Commission’s intention, as the honourable Member suggests, to advocate a Community approach allowing the adoption, without any countermeasures, of specific supplementary measures to reduce fuel costs, because that would contravene the rules of the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0185"></a>

<p>It has not, as yet, been necessary to save funds from the budget in certain sectors covered by the common agricultural policy in order to free up resources to finance the measures taken to alleviate the effects of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis.</p>
<p>The overall budget for 2001 has, of course, been increased, and the effect of the proposals adopted by the Commission on 13 February 2001 will be to free up in the medium term funds saved from the budget in the beef and veal sector itself.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the light of market developments, and in the context of the preliminary draft budget for 2002, the Commission reserves the right to review the situation and to assess whether it would be appropriate to adopt any legislative initiatives in order to cover the potential budgetary risk incurred from the financial year 2002 onwards. Such initiatives could prove necessary in order to bring solidarity into play, something that must not always be seen as a theoretical concept.</p>
<p>On a more general note, the existence of a common policy and a single market requires solidarity between the Member States as well as between the different market sectors.

<p>National Missile Defence is about territorial defence, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) is in the business of territorial defence, so of course that is the appropriate forum for a broader debate between allies. And no, the Commission is not worried that the European point of view would be lost in such a debate. After all, all but two of NATO’s members are European, and more than half of them are EU Member States.</p>
<p>On the substance, the Commissioner responsible for External Relations has already some time ago stated: "The US, because of its boundless confidence in technology, its pre-eminence as a world power and its geographical position, can contemplate technical solutions - such as National Missile Defence - to the threats that it faces. Whatever scepticism or enthusiasm one may have about this approach - and for what it’s worth I remain to be wholly convinced - it is symptomatic of a belief that the world can be kept at bay. Interestingly, this belief has increased US reliance on tools (military threats and action) which, in Europe, are a Member State responsibility. In Europe, by contrast, our geography rules out such an approach, even if we were to believe in it. We can only achieve security by engaging constructively with our nearest neighbours."</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0195"></a>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>On 5-7 February 2000, extremely serious incidents occurred in El Ejido in Andalusia. Both large numbers of eye witnesses and the media stated that the riots were racist and xenophobic in nature, and the European Parliament adopted a resolution severely censuring what had taken place. What does the Commission intend to do in view of the fact that there have been no prosecutions or sentences in connection with the events at El Ejido a year ago, although almost 700 complaints have been lodged?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>1.	The Commission shares the honourable Members' concerns about the serious incidents that occurred in El Ejido last year, and firmly condemns any form of expression of racist or xenophobic views which may constitute a violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms which are common to all the Member States.</p>
<p>2.	The Commission welcomes the agreement reached in El Ejido by the Spanish authorities, the employers, unions and immigrant associations concerning the improvements of the living and working conditions of immigrants in the area.</p>
<p>3.	This serious incident illustrates very well the problems which arise from uncontrolled migration into the Community. This is one of the reasons why the Commission adopted, on 22 November 2000, a Communication on a Community Immigration Policy<a href="#defann_75_1" name="refann_75_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which is designed to stimulate a wide-ranging debate in the Member States on a new approach to immigration, This Communication was presented at the same time as a separate Communication setting out the different policy options for the establishment of a common asylum policy<a href="#defann_75_2" name="refann_75_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>4.	The Communication on immigration sets out progress already made with the implementation of the different elements of an asylum and immigration policy for the Union already agreed at Tampere and puts forward a new approach to labour migration, taking into account the changed demographic and economic context of the Union and of the countries of origin. It proposes that the current 'zero immigration' policies of the last 20-30 years be abandoned and that a controlled migration policy, which both reflects labour market needs and new patterns and pressures of immigration flows on the Union, should be developed.</p>
<p>5.	The Communication emphasises that such a policy must include equal treatment of migrants admitted, especially with respect to living and working conditions, and consequently also further efforts to combat illegal work.</p>
<p>6.	As regards the integration of immigrant communities, the Council has adopted, on a Commission proposal, a directive<a href="#defann_75_3" name="refann_75_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> aimed at prohibiting, in all Member States, discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin in a number of areas such as employment, education, social security, health care, and access to goods and services, including accommodation. Member States have until 19 July 2003 to adopt the national measures necessary to bring themselves into line with that directive.</p>
<p>7.	As regards criminal legislation in this area, the Commission intends to refer to the Council, in the course of the year 2001, a legislative proposal on common definitions, charges and penalties for offences related to racism and xenophobia. Once that proposal has been adopted by the Council, it will be the responsibility of the Member States to adopt the necessary measures to bring themselves into line with the provisions of that instrument. In this connection, the Commission is concerned to point out that it has no authority over the administration of justice in the Member States and that any decision to bring criminal proceedings is a matter for the judicial authorities in those states.</p>
<p>8.	The Commission wishes to reiterate its commitment to combating racist and xenophobic phenomena by all the means laid down in the Treaties. These activities were reinforced by the activities of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, set up in June 1997 in Vienna. The Observatory is an independent body that can draw up conclusions and opinions for forwarding to the Community and its Member States, and publishes an annual report on the situation of racism and xenophobia in the 15 Member States. Implementation of those actions can be expected to help to secure respect for and protection of human dignity, which is, of course, one of the basic principles of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights<a href="#defann_75_4" name="refann_75_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, to which one of the honourable Members refers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In line with the principle of subsidiarity, it is for local, regional and national authorities to decide on the pattern of public transport services they believe their area needs; to decide in what ways these services need to be integrated with each other; to decide on the division of roles and responsibilities between authorities and public transport operators; and to select the operator or operators that will fulfil their public service requirements.</p>
<p>The Community has neither the capacity nor the competence to take over these tasks.</p>
<p>However these tasks, like other actions in the field of services of general interest, need to be carried out in a way that takes into account the requirements of the rules of the Treaty, notably those relating to state aids and to the award of exclusive rights.</p>
<p>In general, these rules come into force only where a particular measure has a potential impact on trade between Member States.</p>
<p>In the past, public transport in the different Member States was organised on purely national or even local lines. Operators were active only within a single Member State; there were no international operators of local and regional public transport.</p>
<p>During the last decade, this situation has completely changed. The majority of Member States, including Denmark, have chosen to open at least part of their public transport sector to competition. International as well as national operators have taken advantage of this opportunity to enter new markets – again, Denmark is an example.</p>
<p>As a result, the organisation of public transport is no longer a matter that has purely local effects. In this emerging single market, abuses of Treaty rules on state aids or the award of exclusive rights can now have a direct effect on trade between Member States.</p>
<p>This is already the case as Community law stands today. However, the full implications of these Treaty rules in the public transport sector are not clear, and authorities and operators are experiencing legal uncertainty. The Commission has therefore made a proposal for a regulation on public service requirements in public transport. The aim of this proposal is to remove this legal uncertainty. Moreover, the proposal aims to ensure, through a system of controlled competition, that public authorities in the Member States have explicit powers to deliver quality and integration in public transport and to protect existing employees in the sector.</p>
<p>The evidence shows that competition, properly regulated, is an effective way to promote these objectives. It is certainly true that public companies often offer services of a high quality, and the Commission’s objective is not to promote privatisation. However it is appropriate for these companies, like any others, to show from time to time that they are still the best for the job of delivering services in their area. Such a demonstration is in the interest of passengers and of the Community at large.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0204"></a>

<p>Food safety plays an important role in the preparation for enlargement. Emphasis is put on the existing acquis and on early implementation. It is essential that the candidate countries adapt their legislation as early as possible to Community rules in order to ensure the highest possible consumer protection within an enlarged future Community. Consequently implementation of food safety legislation is a key pre-requisite for a successful completion of the enlargement negotiations.</p>
<p>The Commission has continuously stressed that administrative structures as well as the operators should implement Community rules as early as possible and take advantage of the technical aid offered during the pre-accession period. To this end all candidate countries receive yearly, a summary of all new legislation added to the existing acquis. Furthermore the Commission organises regular screening exercises to highlight or explain further the new rules in detail.</p>
<p>The proposals of the White Paper have been presented on various occasions. However, it would be premature for the candidate countries to take full account of such proposals, prior to their adoption. As and when, the measures set out in the White Paper become law, they will be presented in the screening process mentioned above. However and in addition to the early implementation it is crucial that the candidate countries adopt already today to the “farm to table approach”, which is the central theme of the White Paper on Food Safety. This point is particularly important as the relevant food safety legislation falls under two very different chapters for which the negotiations are conducted separately: chapter 1 (free movement of goods) which covers the general food safety rules and chapter 7 (agriculture) which covers more particularly the rules on food of animal origin.</p>
<p>The Commission has invited all candidate countries to present a "food safety strategy " setting out their existing or future measures intended to enable them to adapt to the Community food safety system. It has emphasised that it is imperative for the candidate countries’ to provide a coherent timetable for transposition, implementation and enforcement of the acquis communautaire, and that it is essential to demonstrate how they intend to ensure a coherent approach throughout the food chain, whatever chapter is concerned.</p>
<p>Of course the “food safety strategy”, which they should transmit in April, is aiming at a “moving target” as the Community acquis is under constant development. The discussions that will follow the transmission of their “food safety strategy” will address new elements as the Community acquis is adapted over time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0206"></a>

<p>For some months, the market prices for olive oil have been falling quite sharply. This drop is caused by two factors: a cyclical production surplus due to a substantial harvest, and the arrival on the market, in addition to the good harvest, of oil from recently established olive groves which are gradually reaching maturity.</p>
<p>This production surplus, which is likely almost to become structural, cannot be resolved through simple storage measures. Sooner or later, the stock would have to be placed on the market, and this would exacerbate the problem.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to provide temporary relief for the market, the Commission has authorised producers in the regions worst affected by falling prices to make use of private storage, with the result that 100 000 tonnes can currently be stored privately in Spain and Greece.</p>
<p>The Commission does not feel that the right solution to the difficulties lies in supporting supply but in encouraging demand, by means, in particular, of a quality strategy. This is what it outlined in its December 2000 report on the matter.</p>
<p>As far as the growers of the island regions of Greece are concerned, the Commission points out that they benefit from special measures and aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission provided the third largest contribution to UNHCR in 2000. It is true that there has been a decrease in Community funding to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in recent years from the peaks of mid-1990s., This has not been the result of any policy decision by the Commission.</p>
<p>It rather corresponds to a gradual decrease in UNHCR’s caseload, the changing nature of crises in the late 1990s (generating more internationally displaced persons (IDPs) and less refugees), as well as the number and quality of projects submitted for Community funding.</p>
<p>The overall contribution of the Community to UNHCR has remained around 40% of major donors throughout the 1990s. In 2000, the Community contribution to UNHCR was EUR 66 million. It ended up ranking third highest after the United States and Japan. At any rate, the Commission acknowledges the inadequacy of the current, financially ‘unpredictable’ working relationship with UNHCR and is actively addressing that unsatisfactory situation, aiming at providing appropriate support through a better-structured dialogue in exchange for up-to-standard performance. A change of the Financial Regulation – as proposed by the Commission – that will allow a programme based funding will contribute to this.</p>

It comes to the conclusion that a part of such differentials is due to fiscal measures and exchange rate fluctuations, while the remaining portion cannot be explained. The question of car price differentials will be an element to be taken into account in the Commission's considerations on the future regime for motor vehicle distribution.

Does Recital 6 of Commission Regulation (EC) 68/2001<a href="#defann_88_1" name="refann_88_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> mean that, henceforth, the Commission will regard such contributions as State aid? If that were to be the case, does the Commission realise that the sectoral social partners involved will be inclined to use such resources solely for their own company training schemes or for purposes other than training and not for training schemes which involve more than one company or are not directly applicable?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As sectoral training funds in Belgium (as well as in some other Member States) are made compulsory by way of national legislation they must legally be regarded as State resources within the meaning of Article 87 (1) EC Treaty and constitute State aid if the other conditions of this Article are met. As a consequence they are in principle notifiable to the Commission for advance approval pursuant to Article 88 (3) EC Treaty.</p>
<p>In respect to training aid, two important exceptions to the notification obligation should be pointed out:</p>
<p>Aid which complies with the 'de minimis' rule (when the amount of aid involved does not exceed the ceiling of EUR 100,000 over a three-year period) is not notifiable.</p>
<p>Aid which falls within the applicable levels specified in the Exemption Regulation on Training Aid (Regulation 68/2001) is no longer notifiable provided all relevant conditions are complied with. This should significantly reduce the incidence of notifications required relating to Belgian sectoral training funds: only all individual projects which involve expenditure in excess of EUR 1 million has to be notified to the Commission.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, training usually has positive external effects for society as a whole since it increases the pool of skilled workers from which other firms may draw, improves the competitiveness of Community industry and plays an important role in the employment strategy. In view of the fact that enterprises in the Community generally under-invest in the training of their workers, State aid might help to correct this market imperfection and therefore can be considered (under certain conditions) to be compatible with the common market and therefore exempted from prior notification.</p>
<p>The Commission is therefore of the opinion that Regulation 68/2001 is an important step forward since it considerably simplifies the procedural obligations of Member States who want to grant training aid. Regarding the use of sectoral training funds, the Regulation has clarified the existing situation and thereby provided a transparent framework for sectoral training funds.</p>
<p>In recently approved Objective 3 Single Programming Documents in Belgium, it is clearly stated that sectoral training funds (which fall within the applicable levels specified in the Exemption Regulation on Training Aid - Regulation 68/2001) continue to be used as cofinancing for ESF projects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
