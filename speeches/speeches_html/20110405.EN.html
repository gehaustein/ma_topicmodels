<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Herman Van Rompuy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the European Council. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, President of the European Commission, honourable Members, within the space of 49 days, I have chaired 3 meetings of the European Council and a Summit of Heads of State and Government of the eurozone. These facts illustrate the great and urgent challenges our Union is facing, both on the economic and on the diplomatic front. It also neatly illustrates that meetings of the European Council are not just an event: they are part of a process. Indeed, in the meeting on which I am reporting today – that of 24 and 25 March – we duly approved a significant set of economic measures that have been prepared and discussed over the last year, we stepped up our action with regard to ongoing events in Libya and we initiated our response to the catastrophic events in Japan. Allow me to take each of those issues in turn.</p>
<p class="contents">On economic issues, we took forward a comprehensive package of measures. Under the impulse of earlier meetings, including the informal eurozone summit of 11 March, we were able to bring together almost all the strengths of this endeavour. Of course, approving measures and procedures to deal with the crisis does not in itself take you immediately out of the crisis. This will require perseverance and sustained effort. I will not repeat all the decisions we took in detail. You will find them in the conclusions. However, let me summarise six key points.</p>
<p class="contents">Number one: we agreed on the Treaty amendment needed to give full legal certainty to the permanent Stability Mechanism. In its resolution of 15 December, Parliament called for a light Treaty change that provides a legal basis for such a mechanism, rather than resorting to a profound amendment of the Treaty. We followed that advice, and I was delighted when Parliament endorsed the proposed Treaty amendment by such an overwhelming majority on 23 March. I am especially glad that we were able to reassure Parliament about some of the concerns that had been raised in this context. I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri, for working so closely with me to achieve this result.</p>
<p class="contents">Number two: we reached a detailed agreement on the size, scope and mode of operation for the future Stability Mechanism and on improving the temporary facility.</p>
<p class="contents">Number three: we endorsed the position of the Council on the six legislative proposals on budgetary and macroeconomic surveillance ahead of negotiations with Parliament. I know you are working hard on this; indeed, I met your rapporteurs and will be meeting your coordinators this afternoon. All those concerned understand the need to conclude by June.</p>
<p class="contents">Number four: we started the European Semester. It is an exercise in which we follow up the implementation of the EU 2020 Strategy, the Stability and Growth Pact and macroeconomic surveillance. The European Council in June will draw the necessary conclusions. I will personally see to it that this does not sink into the sands of a bureaucratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">Number five: we agreed that credible stress tests for the banks will take place soon. The task is double: the banks must do the test and governments must be ready to deal with the outcome of the tests.</p>
<p class="contents">Number six: we provided for a new quality of economic coordination. We call it the Euro Plus Pact for two reasons: firstly because it is about what eurozone countries want to do more – they share one currency and wish to undertake supplementary efforts on top of existing EU commitments and arrangements; and secondly because it is also open to the others. That is why I am glad that six non-euro countries have already announced that they will join the Pact. They are Denmark, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania. It remains open for any of the four remaining Member States to join later on.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say once again that the political commitment of the Euro Plus Pact comes on top of all the other measures in the package to improve Member States’ economic performance: the stronger Stability and Growth Pact on fiscal surveillance, the new macroeconomic surveillance and implementation of the crucial EU 2020 Strategy on structural reforms to achieve economic growth. The commitments in terms of competitiveness, public finances and pensions, employment and so on must be translated into the national reform and stability programmes. They will also be evaluated annually at the highest level.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a final remark on the economy. Some people fear this work is about dismantling the welfare states and social protection. Not at all. As I said to the social partners at the Tripartite Social Summit, it is to save these fundamental aspects of the European model. We want to make sure that our economies are competitive enough to create jobs and to sustain the welfare of all our citizens and that is what our work is about. These, then, were the main elements of our global economic package to help us come out of the crisis. As I said, they are the result of a long process, not a single meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">It was on 25 March 2010 that the European Council decided to improve European economic governance, launching the Task Force that I had the honour to chair. One year later, we are getting new rules, new instruments and more ambitious policies. It was, and remains, an effort of all institutions, including this Parliament and all the Member States. It was not always easy, not always without drama, but the political will has been unflinching, our sense of direction is clear and significant results are there.</p>
<p class="contents">Not all our problems are over. They are the result of past mistakes and a lack of appropriate instruments both at the European and at the national level. But we now have every chance of dealing with them and not repeating them.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the situation in Libya, which was, of course, something we discussed on 24 and 25 March. We showed common determination. I know that some among you had doubts, but we worked hard to secure concrete results. Two weeks previously, at an extraordinary meeting of the European Council on 11 March, we had adopted a clear line on Libya. Without that clear European position, the subsequent actions would not have been possible. We decided that, to safeguard the safety of the civilian population, Member States could examine all necessary options, provided that there is a demonstrable need, a clear legal basis and support from the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Those three conditions were quickly met. The clear need was obvious when the regime stepped up the violence against its own people. The legal base was provided when the UN Security Council agreed the landmark resolution on Libya a few days after the European Council meeting. Regional support was immediately forthcoming from the Arab League.</p>
<p class="contents">The actions undertaken by a coalition of European, Arab and North American countries implementing the UN resolution have helped protect the civilian population of Libya. A massive bloodbath has been avoided. Thousands of lives have been saved. This is the most important result and deserves the highest attention, more so than the decision-making process. The wood is more important than the trees.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the decision to take military action was not easy. There are, quite naturally, questions and hesitations. That is perfectly normal in issues of war and peace. But any difficulties that we have experienced over that aspect of the Libyan crisis should not mask for one moment the full track record of the European Union. From the beginning of the crisis, the European Union was at the forefront. It was the first to impose sanctions, the first to impose a travel ban on leading figures in the regime, the first to freeze Libyan assets and the first to recognise the Interim Transitional National Council as a valid interlocutor, at the request of this Parliament. The Union also coordinated rescue efforts for EU citizens and has provided, and continues to provide, substantial humanitarian aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The political objectives we set on 11 March remain unchanged. Gaddafi must go. We want a political transition led by the Libyans themselves and based on broad-based political dialogue. We stand ready to help a new Libya, both economically and in building its new institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also following the events in the rest of the region closely. Knowing that the situation is different in each country, we express our utmost concern at the situation in Syria, Yemen and Bahrain. We strongly condemn the escalation of violence and we support political and social reforms in our southern neighbourhood. We also have to change our policy, and I will be discussing this later today with several MEPs responsible for this region within Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs. On the positive side, we noted the smooth conduct of the constitutional referendum in Egypt two weeks ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a few words on Côte d’Ivoire as well. It was not on the agenda of the most recent European Council, but we adopted conclusions in December and have been closely following developments there ever since. First of all, we condemn the violence, particularly violence against civilians, in the strongest possible terms. This must stop on all sides. Secondly, the current situation is a clear result of the lack of respect for democracy. Democracy is not only about elections, but also respect for the outcome of the elections. The international community was clear about the results of the presidential elections in Côte d’Ivoire last year. We must be consistent in our position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on Japan, turning to the accumulation of tragedies that had hit Japan, we as the European Council expressed our sympathy and solidarity for the Japanese people and our condolences for the thousands of victims. We must not forget them, even while other aspects of the drama in Japan are retaining our attention. We are ready as a Union to assist in any way we can. In these tragic days, as true friends of Japan, we reiterate the strategic importance of the EU-Japan relationship. As we know, the effects of the events go beyond Japan, and that is why the European Union is drawing all the lessons fully. We are paying close attention to the consequences for the global economy and to the nuclear aspects. That is a top priority.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore decided that the safety of all of our nuclear plants should be urgently reviewed in the ‘stress tests’ on safety. The Commission will report to the European Council on the stress tests before the end of the year. It will review existing EU rules on the safety of nuclear installations and propose improvements wherever necessary. In Europe, we want the highest standard for nuclear safety, because ensuring the safety of nuclear plants cannot stop at our borders. We encourage and support neighbouring countries to do similar stress tests. A worldwide review of nuclear plants would be best.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, that concludes my summary of what we agreed at this, the third meeting of the European Council this year. Much of it paves the way for further work in this Parliament, be it through legislative procedures or through Parliament’s general right of scrutiny over the common foreign and security policy. I look forward to hearing your views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">José Manuel Barroso, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, President of the European Council, honourable Members, the President of the European Council has given us a presentation on all the decisions made at last week’s meeting. I would like to share my reading of these with you, and to talk to you especially about the next stages.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is fair to say that some very important structural decisions were made for the sake of greater financial stability in the euro area and greater economic coordination. This is a real turning point for European economic governance, especially if we look back at the road we have come down to get to this point.</p>
<p class="contents">At last we have laid proper, solid foundations for the economic component of our economic and monetary union. I think it will now have a more stable basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a framework which will enable us to respond together to any crises that may occur. And last but not least, in assessing the results of this Council, we should not overlook the fact that the framework is in keeping with the provisions of the Treaty and adheres to a Community approach.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, that was not a foregone conclusion. The Commission was at the forefront of the joint response to the economic crisis and the vision for Europe in 2020. It received vital support from this Parliament, and once again I would like to thank you for this. The stance that Parliament and the Commission have taken together to defend the Community approach have been acknowledged and have played an important part in obtaining these results.</p>
<p class="contents">Our new economic architecture is now largely in place, therefore. However in itself, it is not a guarantee: political leaders will now need to make some important decisions in order to live up to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Under this new framework, we will need to be determined in implementing without further delay the necessary public finance consolidation and structural reform priorities for growth that this European Council confirmed, based on the Commission’s annual growth survey.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that our determination over the coming weeks and months will be as strong as, if not stronger than, the determination we have shown until now in establishing the various components of our joint response to the crisis in a cohesive and coordinated way: the European semester, the Euro Plus Pact, the new strengthened economic governance framework and the steps we have taken in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility to maintain the euro area’s financial stability.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not mind telling you that the Commission would have liked to have gone further in several areas of economic governance, especially in relation to the euro area’s new financial stability mechanism. For example, we would have liked greater flexibility. Nonetheless, I think we can say that we have succeeded in securing a mechanism that is anchored in the Treaty, with a strong role for the Commission and monitoring by this Parliament. The result we have obtained is significant and the approval for the amendment to the Treaty, which was so widely supported by this House, contributed to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, the new governance structures must now be put into action to address the economic situation. The truth is that we are still in a difficult climate. The ball is now more in the courts of the Member States, which must finalise their national reform programmes and their stability, or convergence, programmes</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be waiting to receive concrete, ambitious proposals from each Member State for moving forward together towards the major Europe 2020 Strategy objectives: more jobs, more investment in education, training, research and innovation and a bolder approach to combating poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also waiting for them to present the measures they will be taking to correct the continuing macroeconomic imbalances and to improve competitiveness and growth for jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as we receive these documents, we will be able to prepare our draft opinions and recommendations for each country, so that they can be adopted before the June European Council, which will mark the end of the very first European semester.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that we all share a joint responsibility and it is important that everyone takes full ownership of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The Europe 2020 Strategy remains the fundamental framework for Europe’s reforms for growth and employment. Paragraph 6 of the European Council Conclusions could be mentioned in this respect. It makes the following very clear point: ‘In implementing these policies, and in order to ensure wide ownership, close cooperation will be maintained with the European Parliament and other EU institutions and advisory bodies (ESC, CoR), with the full involvement of national parliaments, social partners, regions and other stakeholders’. I want to stress this point because as you know, one of the most frequent criticisms of the Lisbon Strategy was precisely a lack of ownership of the European economy reform programme. I hope that this time we will have benefited from the lessons we can learn from this process and will genuinely work hard on growth for employment at both European and national levels.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards economic governance reform, it is now Parliament’s task to progress towards final approval of the six proposals in the legislative package, and I hope that we will reach a bold result as quickly as possible. This is vital if the whole governance system is to be in place.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, therefore, that we have many reasons to be pleased with the outcomes of the last European Council, but also many reasons to keep on working hard from now on, since the economic climate is still difficult and unpredictable, especially in terms of the social aspects, about which we are all very concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the next few weeks, the Commission will also be presenting its proposals on the Single Market Act. I am delighted that the Council devoted so much time to discussing the future of the single market and that it emphasised the vital role played by the single market in stimulating growth and employment and promoting competitiveness, by highlighting among other things the importance of easing the regulatory burden on SMEs in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to free up the single market’s potential for growth. I would also like to draw attention at this point to the fact that the consolidation of public finances is not an end in itself, but a means to the end of stimulating fair, sustainable growth and generating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are on the subject of fair growth, it is important to emphasise that the European Council also gave its verdict on the possibility of levying a tax on international financial transactions. I confirmed the Commission’s intention to put forward some proposals concerning taxation of the financial sector. Indeed, we believe that everyone should contribute towards dealing with the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, as you know, the Council also discussed the situation in the southern Mediterranean and in Libya in particular. The President of the Council has given us a very detailed report. I would simply like to mention that I had a meeting with the Tunisian Prime Minister yesterday. I reiterated our support for the democratic revolution and our readiness to help the Tunisian people in their quest for freedom, justice and social progress. I also mentioned in this context the matter of migration, which Tunisia and the EU must tackle jointly in a constructive spirit and one of genuine partnership, since it is a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity that we have proposed and that has been very well received by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another subject that the European Council dealt with, namely the crisis in Japan, in particular the nuclear situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also had a fairly substantial telephone conversation yesterday with the Japanese Prime Minister, who thanked the European Union for its actions. I reiterated our solidarity and told him that we would continue to stand alongside Japan. We also discussed the nuclear question. Prime Minister Kan informed me about the situation in Japan and the latest safety developments and signalled his readiness to cooperate with us in relation to the work to be done on nuclear safety in Europe and the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">There is obviously mounting public anxiety over the nuclear issue. We must address these anxieties and guarantee maximum nuclear safety. We must also act with complete transparency. ‘Stress tests’ will therefore be carried out in nuclear power plants in Europe and the results will be made public. The Council has asked the Commission and the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group to decide on the scope and practical details of these tests, which will be carried out by independent national authorities. The Commission will also examine the regulatory framework on safety in nuclear power plants and by the end of the year will suggest any improvements that may prove to be necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, we must not disappoint the hopes that have been pinned on our capacity to act together for Europe’s common good. This is what the Commission seeks to do on a daily basis, knowing that we can count on Parliament’s support, and we will continue to do it and to perform our new duties to the full. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By increasing the capacity of the Solidarity Fund and deciding to make it permanent, the 27 have once again demonstrated their commitment to the euro and the importance they place on solidarity between the more financially stable countries and those facing temporary difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the decision to seal a euro pact between eurozone countries, and further afield, is indicative of the political will of European leaders to draw lessons from the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we share a currency forces us to be more coherent in our economic and social choices. The time when countries could set an atypical rate of taxation or specific social rules without first consulting their partners is long gone. The reason for this is simple: all countries should benefit from the solidarity of their eurozone partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet our people will only accept this solidarity if they think that everyone is putting the same effort into managing public funds. In this respect, the euro pact is a major step forwards towards the convergence of our economies. My group strongly supports it, but demands – and I shall continue to demand – that it is implemented in the context of the Community method, under the auspices of the Commission, Mr President. You are taking the right steps, you have done some good work, but more needs to be done within this Community method under the auspices of the Commission. That is how we will build Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, you know how stubborn I can be and I will repeat it as many times as necessary here so that no one forgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe sets itself apart from the rest of the world with its model of the social market economy, a model which our fellow citizens are quite rightly proud of and which is based on the principle of solidarity, but one which is difficult to preserve in the face of globalisation. The question is knowing how to ensure its future is sustainable by striking a happy medium between the nanny state favoured by socialists, which we have seen almost bankrupt us, and that of excessive liberalism, the dangers of which we have seen with the financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Three things are needed to achieve this. Firstly, all our countries need to reduce their deficit; secondly, they need to adopt comparable budgetary, fiscal and social rules; and, thirdly, they need to invest together in innovation to boost growth, which to date is clearly inadequate. Indeed, we can only preserve and strengthen our model if we invest in growth sectors: green energy, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, and so on. Given our limited financial room for manoeuvre, the best way to meet the growth challenge and achieve economies of scale is to pool our skills as well as our capital. Without massive investment in innovation, without a genuine European plan, we are denying ourselves the ability to keep up with our competitors.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, while our Heads of State or Government were meeting, 10 days ago, the Fukushima power station continued to be an issue of global concern and the insurgents in Libya were looking to Europe for strong action. On these two matters, our countries and the European Union have shown a great sense of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We have in fact offered Japan our nuclear expertise in what is an extremely difficult and worrying situation for that country, and also for the international community at large. There will no doubt be a pre-Fukushima and a post-Fukushima. Although unfortunately not there yet, my group wants the post-Fukushima to be a period of reflection and action, firstly to ensure that the rules governing nuclear safety are significantly tightened and, secondly, to further our efforts in the field of green energy. I agree with your approach to Côte d'Ivoire, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning lastly to the Mediterranean, I welcome the European Council’s repeated call for Colonel Gaddafi to relinquish power, allowing for a new page in this country’s history. What I want is for all our countries to come together and discuss a neighbourhood policy as ambitious and successful for the South as the one they were able to make in the 1990s for the East.</p>

There is no problem – everything is fine. We have solved every difficulty to everyone’s complete satisfaction.</p>
<p class="contents">I for one am unable to fathom your reports in relation to the European Council. I can fully understand that you did not wish to come here with a negative report. If I were President of the European Council I would probably also be anxious to portray this permanent Congress of Vienna in the most dazzling terms.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned Libya. What you failed to mention was the deep differences between Europe’s two largest governments on this issue. There is no consensus between France and Germany on the Libyan question. The differences within the European Union with regard to one of the key international issues is an indication that not everything is under control. Mr Van Rompuy, we would have been better served if the results of this Council meeting had been available to us in 2010. If we had wanted to prevent the downward spiral of the last year, particularly in the euro area, then we should have taken the steps now implemented as long ago as spring 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ask ourselves why these steps were not taken in spring 2010? The answer is that in the European Council, the institution headed up by you, it is not the Community method, community spirit and shared objectives that determine what is discussed and agreed, but rather that national tactical interests ultimately play a greater role than common European interests. This is a particular problem for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have liked to have heard something from you, Mr Barroso, explaining for example how it is that the party that you belong to and once led and that made you Prime Minister of Portugal has now caused a Portuguese government to fall which was implementing precisely the measures demanded by you and the Commissioner sitting next to you.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accuse you of being responsible for this, after all you are no longer the party leader. However, I would have expected a clear statement from the Head of the Commission about jockeying at national political level and its negative impact on the European Union – after all the collapse of the Portuguese Government coincided precisely with the moment that the government resolved to do exactly what the stability framework required of it. This is no way to take Europe forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that worries me greatly and that neither of you has mentioned is that we are always faced with exactly the same scenario prior to a European Council meeting. The Heads of State or Government have hardly agreed a measure to stabilise the euro or a particular member of the euro area in its draft conclusions, when some ratings agency in the City of London or in New York downgrades this country, always with the same result, namely triggering a wave of speculation against the euro. When will we finally have the courage to say: ‘Europe is no longer going to be dictated to by these speculators’?</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What do we tell the banks? Mr Barroso, I am very pleased to hear you say that you have a proposal for the financial transaction tax. At present the European Central Bank is lending money at 1% to the same banks that then lend this money to Member States of the euro area at 10%. Nothing changes: those who caused the crisis continue to profit most from the crisis. That is why we need a financial transaction tax, so that we can make sure that these banks carry some of the cost of this financial crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, you mentioned Europe 2020 – more employment, more investment, more research and training, more environmental protection – it all sounds just great: except that this is all to be achieved with less and less public investment. One result is that Europe 2020 and the Lisbon process are extremely positive developments, however they are bound to fail if we only cut budgets unilaterally in the context of Europe’s economic development. What we need is the courage to make public investments. Take a look at the level of investment in the emerging states. Look at the level of public investment in India. Look at Brazil. Look at the other continents and the public funds invested there.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is cutting back to death, which is why we should declare a method of attaining our goals, namely the Europe 2020 objectives, as the legally binding basis in the ‘six-pack’ for economic governance. Governments will then undertake finally to do what they have been loudly promising, only to prevent development with their budgetary cuts – also achieved by cutting the EU budget itself. For this reason, Mr Barroso, I expect you and, more particularly, your Budget Commissioner Mr Lewandowski to produce a committed and ambitious draft budget for the EU that actually facilitates the developments that it demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Guy Verhofstadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group. </span><span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Van Rompuy for this report on the Council, but let us be honest, I do not think that the crisis is over, and I do not believe that, with the measures we are taking now, it can be over. There is a heavy thunderstorm on our doorstep.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have done in the European Union so far is to use stop-gaps: measures which may be necessary but are not in fact solving the crisis. We have given EUR 110 billion to Greece and EUR 67 billion to Ireland, and I am not including the EUR 24 billion for the Irish banks that we have just decided to provide. For the moment we have EUR 76 billion in government bonds which the ECB has purchased. I can tell you that it will continue to do that, because the emergency fund is not allowed to go on the secondary markets. This means that it will continue to do so. On top of that, the ECB has accepted EUR 100 billion of collateral to give liquidity to the banks in Europe. In total, that is EUR 400 billion that we have invested in this crisis in recent months. That is three times the budget of the European Union! And the worst is still to come. On Thursday there will probably be an increase in interest rates in Europe –from 1% to 1.25% – which may worsen the situation. It is necessary to combat inflation, but on the other hand this is making the situation worse.</p>
<p class="contents">So that is the situation: EUR 400 billion that we have invested. And have we solved the crisis? No, we have not solved the crisis. What is necessary is a really bold and in-depth approach and we do not have that for the moment. In this regard I would like to quote Nout Wellink, the President of the Dutch national bank, who published his annual report a few days ago. He says three things about the outcome of our decisions and those of the Council in recent weeks. He says that the budget rules are not tight enough, the economic governance package is too little and the pact for the euro is in fact too weak because there is no mechanism to enforce it. I am not the one saying this, I am quoting Nout Wellink, President of the Dutch national bank, who is repeating exactly what Mr Trichet said last week. The third thing he mentioned is that financial supervision is being conducted on too national a basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I think Nout Wellink is right. We can even add a number of other elements. The first is the EFSF and the ESM. The permanent and temporary rescue funds cannot work because they have a unanimity rule. If we keep this rule, it means that the entire eurozone will from now on be hijacked by eurosceptic governments and by eurosceptic political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally – and this is my message for today – we still have to clean up the European banks. The problem has not been solved and the economic recovery in Europe will not start if we do not first of all deal with that problem. Not only do they have the old products from the financial crisis still in their portfolios, but they now also have a number of bonds in their portfolios from problematic countries whose ratings are going down every day and at least every week.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am asking is that Mr Barroso and Mr Trichet come forward as quickly as possible with a global response on that issue, namely a bolder Stability Pact – and Parliament is working on that – and economic governance. Is there real economic governance? What we have now is an intergovernmental approach without a sanction mechanism and that will not work. It has not worked in the past and it will not work in the future. We must come forward with a proposal to abolish the unanimity rule in the rescue funds, because it cannot work. We are in fact giving all the power to the countries and the parties who are against the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have to come forward with a plan for the European banking sector. We will not have economic recovery before you have put on the table a European mechanism to clean up the banks. We all know that will take money. Recapitalise the European banks, finance investment in Europe – as has been requested by Mr Schulz – and at the same time cover the bad public finances of a number of our Member States. How will we do that? Where is the money? The only way to find the money is to create a real European bond market, and we know it. Creating a European bond market is the only way out of the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say to Mr Barroso that now is the time for him to deliver. Time is running out and it is not only with a pact for the euro that we will solve the problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The direct equivalent in French is known as ‘Tout va très bien, Madame la Marquise, il n'y a pas de problème’.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say I am astonished at how things are presented here. We should not be taken for fools. Even if we like listening to you, we do read the papers now and again, so we do know what happened at this Council. Do not be telling us little stories. We know what the problems are. We are not here to waste our time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say one thing to you and to Mr Barroso. You harp on about ‘stability, growth, employment, competitiveness’. That much is true. But do you know how that comes across to our citizens? What they see are ‘inequalities, a feeling of injustice, insecurity’. That is how it translates for them. And if the European Union does not change its ways, does not try to respond to this feeling of injustice, this feeling of inequality or the reality of inequality, the reality of insecurity, well the people will hear ‘competitiveness’ and understand it as ‘they are going to hit us again’.</p>
<p class="contents">That is where the real problem lies for us, because citizens will see the mechanisms to bail out the banks, which might I add are necessary, and think ‘well it is alright for the banks’. Look at the banks’ profits. Look at the massive pay packets. People will say: ‘This is totally insane! All that money is spent and yet it is the citizens and national budgets that will suffer as inequalities are heightened only further.’ In recent years, all the statistics point to the fact that inequalities are growing. If we fail to address this problem, citizens will turn their backs on us, fuelling the extreme right anti-European wave across Europe. And they would have good reason to: because we are not capable of responding to this feeling of inequality, injustice and insecurity. So, if we do not respond, we will not succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Eurobonds are concerned, as mentioned by Mr Verhofstadt, what we need to tell citizens and what we need to mobilise is indeed a defence fund, but if we have no investment fund, if we can show no real evidence of wanting to get the machinery going again – and that is why we need Eurobonds not only for defence but also for investment – well, if we do not go down that road, citizens will fail to understand anything and in particular this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Some things therefore need to be said: regarding inequalities, why is not possible for certain social measures that citizens actually understand to be adopted in Europe today? For example, deciding on a minimum wage across Europe, not necessarily the same level, but merely introducing the concept of a minimum wage. It is unbelievable that in a country such as Germany, with all its talk of economic rebalancing, there is no mention, no talk of this problem. It is unbelievable that Germany, one of the few more profitable countries in Europe today, is incapable of introducing a minimum wage for its citizens. It is something that should be raised in the context of the economic and social governance of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Libya now. What Mr Schulz said was right, albeit dramatic. You have a country such as Germany hiding while the other countries try and find solutions. On this point only do I agree, and only just. What I would like when we now discuss a neighbourhood policy is for us to take stock of the many past blunders we have made in respect of this neighbourhood policy. What were our relations like with Mr Gaddafi before the bombing began? What relations did European countries have with Mr Gaddafi, Mr Ben Ali, Mr Mubarak? Let us finally make an assessment of what those articles on human rights, in the association agreements, meant to us. Zilch! Nothing! If we are not going to make this assessment, well then we should stop lying to ourselves. Did the European Council devote even five minutes’ thought to what we failed to do previously in our policy on the Mediterranean? Did you think about that? I have not read anything in the papers. I have heard nothing about what you said on this matter. If only the European Council were capable of a bit of self-criticism over its past failings.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, I turn to Japan. The problem is that the best form of nuclear safety is to phase it out. There is no zero risk when it comes to nuclear power. This cannot be achieved overnight, but if we do not phase out nuclear power, we will never be safe. The problem is nothing to do with stress testing one incident. The problem, as stated by Mr Lacoste, the head of France’s Nuclear Safety Authority, is the cumulative effect of several possible incidents – something which, unbelievably until now, has never been looked at. That  is what has happened in Japan. It is not just one incident, it is the accumulation of four or five incidents, plus human error, that have led to this situation</p>
<p class="contents">Mathematically speaking, it is not possible to guarantee this safety. If we Europeans do not speak out ... it will not be phased out overnight, but if we do not phase out nuclear power, we must stop talking about nuclear safety. There is no such thing as nuclear safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are well aware that most of the MEPs in the group of the European Conservatives and Reformists are from countries outside the eurozone, and most are from countries that have not even joined the pact for the euro. However, this does not mean that we want the eurozone to fail. On the contrary, we want a stable and prosperous European Union, including the eurozone. We want responsible national governments which will end debt, reform the structure of public spending and embark on fiscal reforms, thereby bringing about a restoration of the financial discipline we consider to be correct.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do not consider to be correct and what bothers us is the hidden agenda promoted here by some Member States and partly by the Commission and some groups of MEPs as well. It is an attempt to take advantage of the crisis for a further transfer of sovereignty. It is an attempt to go further towards fiscal and tax harmonisation. It is an attempt to take a further step towards the creation of fiscal union, and therefore towards full political union. We say ‘no’ to such a union. We do not support such a union.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been sitting here since 2004, and whenever there is a problem I hear the same old phrase: ‘We need more Europe, we need a more Community-based approach’. I say that is not what we need. It is the attempt to solve everything at the European level that has got us into this mess – and how will we tackle it? At the European level again. I am asking you to understand, at last, that the current model of European integration has run out of steam. You need to stop living in the 50-year old dream of post-war European integration from the last century. The European paradigm has changed, and the sooner some of you come to terms with that, the better it will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, let us consider economic policy. We have articulated our thoughts on the agreed guidelines in the area of economic policy in a hearing held last week. What we need is to overcome the neo-liberal practice of profit and competition fixing, evident in terms such as ‘flexicurity’, adjustment of retirement age, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that there is a need for democratically legitimised, controlled economic policy management that will prevent tax, wage and environmental dumping practices through appropriate common minimum standards that will provide effective regulation for the financial markets and prohibit the privatisation of profits, while at the same time passing on the risks to the public at large.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to our southern neighbourhood and Libya in particular. The EU Member States have become involved in a macabre situation in North Africa, particularly in Libya. We have already heard some criticism here. I would just like to emphasise one point: the dictator Gaddafi is using weapons purchased from us against the demonstrators and rebels. He is under fire from NATO troops apparently in order to protect those fighting for freedom and democracy, who are also using European and US weaponry.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to know the point of the existing code of honour in relation to arms dealing if such a situation can exist? Where is the support for freedom, human rights and the fight against social injustice in specific cases such as Lampedusa, where hundreds of refugees are arriving from North Africa every day? I fear that the newly cobbled together neighbourhood concept is more about European interests than an appropriate response to the needs of the partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to Japan. We still have time to discuss Japan this afternoon and tomorrow. Here too we fail to recognise a coherent European approach, at least as far as safety controls, the so-called stress tests, are concerned. I am not surprised that our citizens are asking with justified scepticism what exactly the European Union’s position is on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There will be a permanent support fund for the euro, a fund that will support Member States that have plundered their national exchequers and that will transfer the risks to those Member States that keep their own houses in order.</p>
<p class="contents">Most economists agree with us that this fund will not rescue the euro any more than the arrangements under the Stability and Growth Pact were able to. It is a soft agreement that rewards weak and fraudulent Member States with easy credit. Where will that money come from? How is the fund to be made up? On paper, every Member State will contribute to the fund, including Ireland, Greece and Portugal. Yet these countries do not have any money.</p>
<p class="contents">What it comes down to is that those Member States that have kept their own houses in order will end up paying. Dutch citizens will end up picking up the tab for weak Member States such as Greece and Portugal – your country, Mr Barroso – and that, Mr President, is unacceptable. That is not solidarity, it is rewarding the bad behaviour of a number of weak Member States at the expense of hard-working Dutch, German and Belgian citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro cannot be rescued in this way. Instead, these countries should be removed from it. Greece must get the drachma back and Portugal must re-introduce the escudo. Some countries must accept that they will have to leave the euro area and they have themselves entirely to blame for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If these results are handled like everything else, including the Stability and Growth Pact, and if the Member States do not adhere to them, then they are not worth the paper they are printed on. That is why I cannot share the optimism of the two Presidents that the crisis is over. I believe we are only now facing into the real test.</p>
<p class="contents">It is more than two and a half years since the collapse of Lehmann Brothers and where are we now? It has taken us two and a half years to reach this point. The responsible Commissioner rejected the proposals for a financial market transaction tax the last time they were brought forward. I want to see results. When I think back to the last parliamentary term, I recall that this House passed 12 resolutions on measures in relation to the financial markets and that the responsible Commissioner for the Internal Market – who thankfully is no longer in office – rejected them all. That is the reality. The Commission did not provide leadership in resolving the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we found that national self-interest needs to be overcome at Council level too and that Parliament needed to fortify the Commission in its role in amending the Constitution. There is absolutely no reason to rest on one’s laurels. I must concur with Mr Verhofstadt. Budgetary consolidation is too lax, governance too non-committal, the euro pact too weak and national interest still too strong. If we do not have the courage to demand greater commitment to Europe from national governments, then we will never achieve a meaningful, lasting solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barroso, I was critical when the Greek Members of my group voted against the programme for Greece. I certainly do not agree with Mr Schulz. If a socialist head of government is voted out of office, this is prima facie a good thing. However, in the Portuguese case your party also voted against the programme. Things like this should not be allowed to happen in Europe. I would ask everyone to play their part in ensuring that this partisan national attitude has no future as we work to solve this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many Europeans may think that the choices are along the right lines, but are slow and not very ambitious. Those who have seen the documentary <span class="italic">Inside Job</span> will be angered by such greed and lack of scruples, and will be asking: if credit rating agencies (CRAs) operate in this way, what is Europe doing towards establishing independent and reliable CRAs?</p>
<p class="contents">President Barroso said not long ago that, if a Member State can avoid having recourse to outside aid, then it should do so, as outside aid is costly. That is also the opinion of the Portuguese Government. Portugal does not need outside aid: it only needs financing for its economy and its families at reasonable interest rates. However, as CRAs serve the interests of speculators, the result of the enormous sacrifices that the Portuguese are making is going directly into the pockets of these speculators. Is this European justice? Do political decision-makers not realise that we are going through a crisis of the euro area; I repeat, of the euro area: that attacks on the sovereign debt of some countries could undermine the euro, and jeopardise the single currency and the European project itself? This is a European problem, which requires a European solution.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to come through the crisis, we need more Europe rather than less Europe; we need to measure up to our past and to the challenges of the future; we need to give confidence and hope to the European public, without whom there is no European project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are some positive aspects, but I have no need to go over them again. I do, however, have one concern that goes beyond technical detail and what you have told us. I am talking about the North-South divide that is currently taking root in the European Union. As was the case just moments ago, we have heard people claim that some are right and others are wrong, that some are good while others are bad, and they seem to have forgotten about interdependence. This is serious.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, by refusing to deal with the issue of the banks, which Mr Verhofstadt mentioned, I think that a number of countries in the North, who preach a great deal to countries in the South, are viewed by many as refusing to see what their own responsibilities are. I therefore believe that if there is one task that falls to you, President of the European Council, and to you too, Mr Barroso, it is to prevent this divide from growing and becoming entrenched at all costs. We need solutions that are acceptable to everyone. We need to ensure that everyone shoulders their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point: I find the European Council extremely inward-looking. The whole of this discussion has taken place as if the euro were of no global importance. There is nothing about external representation of the euro area in the IMF. France, which is currently chairing the G20, wants to promote the idea of global monetary reform and there is no proposal, like that of the Eurobonds which we are trying to push, that would attempt to make the euro a truly global currency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You say that workers should not worry, that we are working for them. When I read the section on competitiveness in the ‘Euro Plus Pact’, as you call it, my understanding is that it talks about wage cuts, about greater flexibility and less security. Nothing is said about productivity or our resources. Nothing is said about energy productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am saying is that we will never win the race against China when it comes to cheap labour. By contrast, China is well on course to beat us when it comes to energy efficiency and resource efficiency. What, then, will be left for Europe in terms of competitiveness if we cannot compete in those areas?</p>
<p class="contents">You are telling us that those on benefits should not worry. Yet when balancing public finances, a reasonable objective, you say that cuts need to be made. Forty per cent of public spending goes on welfare and you are telling us not to worry. You also tell us that revenue is being taken care of. Let us talk about revenue. The CCCTB, the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, is a real joke. You talk about it in the conditional tense; you say that it should in any case be neutral in terms of revenue. Therefore no extra euros will be gained from it, and what is more, companies will be able to choose, anyway. I have never seen anyone choose the most expensive fiscal option.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, if anyone should be free from worry it is the banks’ shareholders and creditors. You talk to us about stress tests. Those last year were a joke. I do not know whether we will see the same tasteless joke this year. What we can be sure of, however, even if these stress tests are serious, after all, is where the funds for the banks will come from. Will they come from their shareholders or from us, the taxpayers? Be serious! Anyway, they obviously have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, nothing has been said of the elephant in the room, namely the absolute unsustainability of the Greek debt and the Irish debt. You know, no matter how much you want to skirt the issue, there is no way they can pay it back. And the later we restructure, the more painful the exercise. It is never going to be a pleasant exercise, but if you wait it will cost us dearly.</p>

This is the mistake that we are now making with regard to the current financial crisis: it is serious, it does require action, but many of the proposed solutions will have far-reaching and, in my view, highly damaging effects for the long-term future of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunity is being seized on by many to launch plans for permanent economic governance, with intervention and control as its guiding principles. The solution, we are told, is firstly to abuse the existing rules such as Article 122 of the Treaty, which was never intended for the bailouts that it has been used to pay for – my hope is that some country will have the courage to challenge this in the European Courts – and to impose more limitations on our Member States, which in reality means constraining the democratic choice of many of the electorates.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the case of Ireland, that country has tried its very best to stabilise its banking system – stabilisation, incidentally, which is desperately needed by banks and institutions in other Member States, which would otherwise be terribly exposed – and Ireland’s reward for that is to face demands from other Member States to increase its own rates of corporation tax in order to compete with the bloated situations in other countries.

<p class="contents">In any case it is still strange that those – including some in this Chamber – who so fiercely and righteously rage against the absolute evil that is Colonel Gaddafi were all too happy, up until very recently, to get photographed, all smiles, at the side of the Libyan dictator, who they received with military honour. All I want to say is that it is easier to fire on Gaddafi today than to provide an answer to the enormous questions that will arise.</p>
<p class="contents">To mention just one of these, are we going to further arm the rebels – the collective term for a diverse bunch of people, some of whom by European standards have not yet mentally outgrown the Middle Ages – and if so, what guarantee do we have that such weapons would not be used to plunge the country into greater chaos, as happened in Iran after the Shah was expelled?</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I would like these European efforts and muscle to be somewhat more visible in the military guarding of our own external borders. A silent war is also being fought at the moment, a frightening harbinger of an immigration invasion that no one talks about. We need European muscle to deal with this, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is an important step, but it is also a step on a very difficult road that we have to go down in order to restore confidence in the euro and in our economy so as to get out of this crisis by promoting economic growth and jobs. This House – you said it – has a co-legislative role in respect of the legislative package to strengthen economic governance. We want to see more ambition in the package and you should enter into discussions with Parliament in the forthcoming period in that regard. We believe that we need stronger and more ambitious financial support that builds on the Commission’s proposals. You have already heard various Members say that we want to see a more robust Stability and Growth Pact with a reverse voting mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, much stronger socio-economic coordination is needed. That involves more than the ‘commitments’ of the Euro Plus Pact, as the principles of our social market economy are anchored in the Europe 2020 Strategy. It involves a greater commitment to elaborating on those principles in order to promote growth and jobs for our citizens. We want to anchor these objectives in the national reform programmes – and I have heard Mr Barroso talk about this – and we should bring forward proposals to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">You have said this, and indeed emphasised it, with a view to having these points already concluded on obtaining an agreement in June. As far as we are concerned you can already get to work on getting the Council moving, at least in relation to these points, which would then make an agreement in June possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Are you serious about saving the eurozone and the European project?</p>
<p class="contents">The bank stress tests have just concluded, based on the most pessimistic scenarios in Ireland. The new Irish Government has drawn a line under the Irish banking debacle. It has, to everyone’s surprise in Ireland, decided that there will be no haircuts for senior bond holders in the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">But what is the European quid pro quo? Why is the European Central Bank silent on essential medium-term funding for Irish banks? Why are President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel insisting on the destruction of the Irish industrial base in return for a cut in the bail-out interest rate? Why are some Member States blocking progress on the European financial transaction tax and the eurobonds? Why is the European budget being cut?</p>
<p class="contents">The short answer is short-term electoral calculations and doctrinaire economics. The Irish economic crisis is an integral part of the European crisis. The failure of the Irish economy would not only be a failure for Europe, but would be a failure of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Debt sustainability for Ireland is critical for Ireland and Europe and the Quartet must get real on this issue. What we need from the Quartet now is imagination and vision in its ongoing negotiations with Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">I want you to mark my words. Ireland is a democracy, just like France, just like Germany, just like Finland: we govern at the will of the people. Ireland’s electorate has accepted severe austerity through gritted teeth and seething anger. They need to see fair play in Europe, otherwise quite soon the window of tolerance currently opened to the Irish Government will shut with a bang. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I could focus on the problems that those decisions you have taken in the Council will entail and they certainly will entail problems, but the positive aspect is nevertheless that you have made progress when it comes to economic governance and the macroeconomic aspect. My fellow Member from Ireland just mentioned how concerned people are in this country. Their problems are related to the fact that so far we have not had any appreciation whatsoever of the macroeconomic aspect. This is something that we will be able to have in future thanks to this economic governance package. In this regard, I think the Council has gone in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what I feel to be a little worrying is the fact that the Council seems to lack the will to change its own decision-making culture. It still wants the opportunity to utilise different types of political arrangements, something we could perhaps call horse trading. However, if you do not change your decision-making culture, I fear that in future you will not be able to take the necessary decisions when you are facing difficult considerations on the basis of the recommendations that I nevertheless believe that the Commission will be able to produce. This is a challenge that the Council must take seriously and get to grips with. This is also illustrated rather well by the tendency that we saw during the Council meeting when my own Member State, Finland, was also being rather awkward with regard to a different issue – in that case the stability mechanisms. As a Finn, I regret that. Not all Finns think like this, but it is a good illustration of the fact that the decision-making culture in the Council needs to change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I doubt very much that the Euro Plus countries would be in a position jointly to impose strict rules on themselves in the field of public expenditure, since they could not do so individually.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I am in no doubt that standardising the tax base is an effective step towards a tax union, which has only one objective – the elimination of tax competition within the European Union. The French politicians Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Lagarde have revealed their true intentions by insisting for weeks on raising tax rates in Ireland, under the pretext of the fight against the crisis. Raising tax rates in the European Union to standard levels regardless of the Member State is however a recipe for prolonging the crisis, not for mitigating it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are two topics that are particular cause for concern. The first is that we continue to take an inconsistent line in dealing with the economic crisis and the difficulties of the euro. It is also a fact that the Council and the Commission are lagging behind events.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be realistic: we need a debt haircut, at least in Greece and probably also in Portugal. There is no escaping this. The longer we take to address this issue, the more it will cost, not just in financial terms, but also in terms of the general credibility of the European project. Events in Greece will serve to arouse emotions. We were part of a special delegation to the country: the underlying attitude is that the EU is responsible for the problems in Greece because of a lack of clear communication and because the necessary steps, which are already obvious, are not being taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The second topic is nuclear power. The so-called stress tests being prepared will only make sense and credibility in a cohesive Europe will only be restored if these stress tests are performed according to stringent criteria and not according to the weak criteria of the IAO, if genuinely independent experts are consulted and if the events and the entire process is presented to the public in an appropriate and understandable way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In what is perhaps a slightly orderly and naive view of the European Institutions, I think the European Institutions represent our ideals while, for many reasons, our governments represent our interests.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a game to be played. What is striking is that it seems to me that in some situations the team representing ideals refuses to play the game. Some weeks ago, when Parliament proposed to recognise, or rather proposed that the Commission should recommend to the Council that it recognise the Provisional Libyan Council, Baroness Ashton said that it was not within her mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, after a wonderful presentation, when it came down to proposing a strategy to the Council that would make the crisis related to migration flows a European issue, Mrs Malmström said that she rejected the idea because she thinks it will not win majority backing in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">How is the ‘ideals team’ going to win the game if our players refuse to shoot at goal because they think the goalkeeper is too good? I think this is a fundamental point for an historical understanding of the task to which we are called.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to make this observation: who are our attacking players? They are the European Institutions: Parliament, the Commission and even you, Mr Van Rompuy, because I think that you do not represent the Council in the sense that you defend its interests but you are the man that can make the Council understand which ideals to focus on.</p>

Therefore, despite not inconsiderable reservations about the methods and intergovernmental nature of the fund, Parliament supported this watershed moment and has focused on ensuring a solid link between the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the EU Institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this vein, the reference in the European Council’s conclusions to a regulation establishing the procedures to define the conditional requirements is important and we now expect the Commission to come up with a suitable proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though this is a positive result, it is difficult to consider it adequate. The problem is the basic direction of European economic governance. We persist in treating the symptoms of the illness instead of its causes. Deficits are the effect and not the cause of the crisis. Thinking that we can cure the illness by limiting ourselves to cutting deficits with one hand and refinancing banks with the other is sheer make-believe: it risks deepening the crisis and making the very task of the permanent stability mechanism unsustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to treat the illness and not merely the symptoms, then we need to tackle a number of basic problems. We talk about strengthening European competitiveness. Rightly so, but which model of competitiveness are we pursuing? We cannot bring in a model for recovery driven solely by exports to third countries, because this will accentuate imbalances. In order to be more competitive in external trade, we also need to stimulate high-quality internal demand.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore deal with the issue of the banks and the system for providing credit to the economy in order to direct European savings toward long-term investments. We need to equip ourselves with instruments such as Eurobonds, the tax on financial transactions and a budget worthy of the name, in order to make large-scale public investment at a European level that can provide a kick-start for private investment. Finally, we need to think of the European social model as a resource instead of a burden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A strong commitment to the single market is key to competitiveness in the EU and therefore the euro area. That is welcome, but single market initiatives remain in the framework of the Treaty and the 27.</p>
<p class="contents">The ESM facility, I fear, lacks flexibility and is unsustainable for recovery with a two-and-a-half to three per cent risk premium. I understand the need for discipline and risk provision, but these rescue mechanisms are not for money-making, especially when there is self interest beyond eurozone stability, such as several Member State banks being supported by Irish taxpayers, as has been mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not solved the banking crisis, nor will we by being faint-hearted. Germany, even, has not recapitalised its own banks nor recognised impaired assets and also relies on the indulgence of everyone else in the EU and worldwide to allow silent participations as core capital, otherwise stress tests will be failed.</p>
<p class="contents">So, President of the Commission, President of the Council, let us have some vision, some humility, some honest self appraisal; the very least you can do is to treat risk premiums as collateral and give them back when the risk is gone. Small-mindedness will not save the euro and the markets know that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The real function of politics is to establish the legal framework to ensure that such a situation never arises. You now need to do the wrong thing because you have failed for decades to do the right thing. You now intend getting to the root of the problem, which is something that we welcome. However, as far as can be foreseen, it would seem that you are once again working at the wrong level with the wrong resources and within the wrong framework because you are trying to deal with the issue outside of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Happily we have succeeded in bringing part of the dealings within the scope of the Community method, however there is still a lack of classic top-down policy. In this area above all others there is a need for every policy to be democratically debated, legitimised and checked. You are using the wrong instruments because you are taking the money from the taxpayer to support the banks and those who speculate with the banks and other financial products. You have still failed to take adequate steps to deal with those who have been profiting from this situation for a long time. This means that you are continuing to foster an imbalance in European society that weakens approval for this policy, rather than strengthening it. You are placing a burden on the public coffers and budgets on the one hand and protecting private assets on the other. This does nothing to resolve the actual problems, but simply remedies some of the symptoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Running up debts was not seen as a problem as it was felt that economic growth would melt them away like the sun melts the ice.</p>
<p class="contents">Many private individuals felt the same way. They bought expensive houses far beyond what they could afford. The rising value of those properties was supposed to save them, but this house of cards collapsed. The debt crisis is being tackled with new debts. The European Central Bank has bought up billions worth of government bonds issued by Portugal, Ireland and Greece. The economies of these countries will now have to be under the whip and grow like crazy on a consistent basis for many years in order to pull through. Madam President, that will not succeed. These economies are shrinking alarmingly. This is setting a course straight for bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore time for Crisis Strategy 2.0. We must allow the bankrupt countries to return to their former currencies in conjunction with a vigorous devaluation and a partial write-off of their debts.

Well done! We must, however, understand that this will present a new and formidable problem, namely political acceptance of the decisions thus taken, on two levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The first level being between the Member States themselves. Ever since this Euro Plus Pact process began it has been based on purely intergovernmental consensus, at the initiative of the largest Member State. This is fine if it is a one-off. However, if, over a number of consecutive years, we continue down the same political path, we run the risk of heightening national tensions. The German Chancellor has already been booed on the streets of Athens and Dublin. This intergovernmental procedure therefore needs to be transformed gradually into a genuinely European procedure, one not just for the EU, but for Europe as a whole. This is the thrust of the amendments adopted by Parliament, and we should thank and congratulate Mr Juncker and you, Mr Van Rompuy, for having adopted them.</p>
<p class="contents">The second level is acceptance in the eyes of the public in each Member State. How would opposition parties in our countries feel if they were bound by policy directions about which they had never been consulted? Let us look at what happened yesterday in the Irish elections. Let us look at the electoral debate today in Portugal. The only way in which these recommendations can acquire political legitimacy is to ensure that national parliaments are involved from the very outset, throughout the process of the European semester, and yet the Council conclusions only mention these parliaments in passing, in the same category as regions, social partners and NGOs. Infinitely much more is at stake. The decisions taken mean we now have to explore a new dimension of European democracy.</p>

However, if we look at how this works and how it will continue to work in the future, then it is evident that the wrong people are being affected. Schools are being closed, teachers are losing their jobs, researchers are finding themselves out on the street and public investments are being cut or left to stagnate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso: Is this your intention? Of course you will say that this is not what you want and that other areas are to be cut back. My question then is: Where are the cuts to be made? My key question is as follows: If you believe that the cuts should be made elsewhere, then why is it that the draft that you propose for decision making in the ‘six-pack’ for economic governance makes no distinction as to whether a country purchases tanks or weapons of war or invests in an ailing national economy, or whether it makes an investment in the future? Or perhaps whether it invests in a modern energy supply system and in the education and training of its children? Romano Prodi once famously said that these drafts are stupid. His words are still true because this distinction between good and bad investments cannot be made. Our only choice is to improve these drafts, because Europe cannot be governed sensibly if such distinctions are beyond us.</p>
<p class="contents">My last question is: Where is the income to be found that will enable us to move forward out of the crisis? After all, we cannot just save our way out of the problem. Mr Barroso, we await your proposal on the financial transaction tax in Europe, something that this House has backed with a large majority.

<p class="contents">I would say this quite clearly: ‘While I have heard the message, I am not sure I believe it.’ We should not lose sight of the starting point for all these deliberations and measures, namely the run-away debt of some euro Member States, the loss of competitiveness, economic distortions and, as a consequence, an increasing current account deficit that has to be financed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is already obvious that many Member States will not be able to meet the conditions of the new Stability and Growth Pact with the best will in the world. The ESM will not help to overcome economic distortions because no one has seriously faced up to the idea that a euro Member State could become insolvent and because the prospect of financial aid from the ESM will lead to further laxity.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called stringent regulations will prove to be relatively lightweight in practice. The need for unanimous resolutions is resulting in the horse-trading that was a familiar fixture in the past. Finally, the pact for the euro is much too non-committal to cause destitute countries to implement far-reaching real economic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, therefore, I fear that we will not succeed in eliminating the root cause of the problem. We shall have a permanent overdraft facility whose credit parameters will have to be increased at regular intervals. This will turn into a bottomless pit and the citizens in the states that will have to foot the bill will find themselves duped once again. Public confidence in Europe will decline even further as a result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The war in Libya goes on. We have seen that there used to be warm relations between the Libyan leader and European leaders, who were like best mates in a playground.</p>
<p class="contents">Last time, I showed everyone some photographs, including of you, Mr Van Rompuy. I believe you to be a man of integrity, an honest man, even in politics. You are consistent. For that reason I have foregone the photographs. Hundreds of people were killed in Lockerbie, many of them Europeans and then we see European leaders meeting with this murderer. When I saw you, therefore, I felt let down. Perhaps it was precisely because you are in this job, between prime ministers and presidents and other chosen individuals. I want to advise you, however, to keep your feet on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must stand on the side of freedom. The essence of this project is freedom, something that you and Mr Barroso, who was also very friendly with Mr Gaddafi, neglected and that leaves me feeling let down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is why the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is of utmost importance, not only to reach the aims and targets but also to have credibility in the economies of Europe. We also need to tackle the problems of the lack of competitiveness and economic growth. That is the main task we need to deal with in order to fight poverty and create jobs, but also to secure prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Member States have a fundamental responsibility here to restructure budgets, giving priority to social security and investments in growth at the same time as deficits are reduced. They must reform markets, including labour markets and other opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what Member States must do – and much more – but let us also underline what the European Union as such must do. We must have the same level of preparedness to restructure the budget of the European Union as we are demanding from Member States, ensuring that we give priority to growth and investment, research and science and open markets.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to ensure that we are reforming the European market. Seventy percent of the European economy is in the service sector, but the Services Directive is rather limited in that perspective. The future of the European economy lies in the service sector and the knowledge economy. There is strong demand for the Commission to put forward proposals making the internal market applicable to the whole knowledge economy. That is the key issue in making Europe the leading knowledge economy in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have defined it yourselves: the EU 2020 Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet when I look at what you are doing in terms of economic governance, I get the impression that there is total contradiction. Indeed, if one looks at the stability pact and economic governance, you are shifting from a coordination strategy to a supervision strategy, resulting in a Washington consensus becoming a Brussels consensus. When you talk about structural reforms, you talk about wage cuts and an increase in the retirement age.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to talk to you about the real structural reforms that we need. We need public investment, first and foremost in education. Did you know that during the whole period of the Lisbon Strategy, half of the Member States reduced the budget they spent on education? Did you penalise them for doing that? Are you aware that the European Union will never implement this 2020 Strategy if we do not pool investments for the future, if, when you assess the public expenditure of Member States, the only expenditure that you treat differently, where you take quality into account, is when Member States introduce capital-funded pension reforms, whereas you ignore those who are inclined to make efforts with regard to education?</p>
<p class="contents">When I look at the situation in Ireland today, one thing strikes me. Day in day out you decide to save banks; meanwhile, the Irish are sinking. This is not the European Union we want. I would prefer us to ‘save’ the people of Ireland rather than their banks. What is more, in order to save the banks, you invented ‘stress tests’. I am now under the impression that every time we come up against a problem, we introduce stress tests. These are the new talking shops. There is a stress test for nuclear energy, a stress test for banks; there might even be a stress test for the Commission one day. Perhaps we will suggest it. I personally, however, would prefer to see the Commission take the initiative and be where it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">When I look at the opinions of the European Central Bank today, I get the feeling that it is more concerned about what is not included in its mandate, namely wage levels, than about the viability of our banking system and its effectiveness in bringing about the public investment we need. This Parliament has submitted proposals on the taxation of financial transactions and on Eurobonds, but you refuse to consider them.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, it is time that you listened to the proposals coming from this House, to ensure that the strategy that you yourselves have adopted is a success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that most European citizens probably believed that stress tests had been a matter of course as part of the safety measures with regard to nuclear power for decades. That is not the case. The proposal that has been adopted by the Council in its conclusions is far too weak. We need to test not only the technology and the geography but also the safety culture and multiple risks. We must ensure that there is openness and transparency. It is totally unacceptable for governments and national authorities to audit themselves in this area. There clearly needs to be independent checks, facts must be made public and full transparency must prevail under the scrutiny of the Commission. That is the only way we can make this technology credible for the future. We also need to renegotiate the institutional structure, which is as old as the European Union. It must be updated. We must have European safety standards within the system and, finally, we must ensure that the Council, too, puts forward proposals when it comes to energy efficiency, alternative energy sources and a timetable for these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the problem is that not only are we going through a financial crisis, we are also experiencing a crisis of confidence and a political crisis in Europe and in the European nations. The problem is not simply one of assessing the actual economic and technical contents of the European Council. At the same time as there are meetings of the European Council, European, national and regional elections are being held and all of these confirm our apprehensions. Extreme positions are being adopted. Some of these positions are currently taking refuge in forms of nationalism. Therefore, you must be very well aware that our problem is not simply to face up to the crisis, but to face up to the political and social consequences of that crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not simply a time when there is, as a fellow Member quite rightly said, a north-south crisis in the European Union. These are new times and a particular feature of new times is that crises mount up and proliferate and are not resolved. They turn up unexpectedly, both inside and outside the EU. Moreover, these new times basically demand new ways of thinking at both individual and institutional levels, and that is the major political challenge that faces us.</p>
<p class="contents">Any change in one’s personal way of thinking starts with that person him or herself. First of all, if that person is a Member of this House, he or she must say in what ways Parliament must change if it is to deal with new times. The same goes for members of the Commission and the Council; each and every one of us must be able to face up to this issue.</p>

<p class="contents">There were design faults, such as the lack of planning regarding financial assistance to countries within the euro area, inefficiency in fulfilling commitments in the areas of public finance and competitiveness and increased macroeconomic imbalances and divergence within the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw how steps that had been taken so as to have a European voice in the areas of foreign policy and security, were not supported in the area of the economy, despite the imperatives of globalisation. Our economic potential could not be turned into economic leadership at world level and the imbalance between the single currency pillar and the intergovernmental economic pillars became all the more evident.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to provide an adequate response, we must make progress on integration. There is no national way out of the crisis, unless some people have got the wrong century. That is why, on 24 and 25 March, the European Council took important, even spectacular, steps in the right direction. The implementation of the European semester, the adoption of the permanent stability mechanism, along with the commitments made before Parliament, including the legislative package, which will have to be balanced by Parliament, are all steps in the right direction. The Euro Plus Pact does, without a doubt, represent a step forward but much remains to be done. The crisis is still there, there are 23 million unemployed and there are still important clouds on our horizon and major challenges to face.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need a three-dimensional pact with the citizens of Europe because there are limits to austerity policies and we need to promote a policy of growth and employment through investment in order to redefine our economic model and fulfil the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">A policy of fiscal and financial sustainability requires a European framework as much in the area of sovereign debt as in the recapitalisation of financial bodies and we need a genuine European social pact to introduce improved productivity, with social standards, progress in taxation and the bringing of the welfare state up to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The creation of the single currency of the euro and the period of existence of this currency comprise a history of ignorance of economic laws, broken rules, lies about the size of public finance deficits and deception in national statistics. The Stability and Growth Pact was adopted as the last chance to deal with the notorious rule-breakers, and it has been violated by everyone for years. How could it be otherwise in the Euro Plus Pact, I wonder, given the different nature of the national economies, the different inflation levels and the different levels of unemployment?

<p class="contents">I believe that these are very positive results for Europe, and it is just a shame that this process was not fully concluded on 24 and 25 March. I believe that, if we had given this signal, if the Member States had given this signal in the Council, completing this fund reform package in full, we would be in a stronger position today for facing the next 3-4 months, and we would have partly alleviated the effects of the crisis currently being experienced in my country, Portugal, about which I also need to say something. This is that the Portuguese Social Democratic Party (PSD), which is fully integrated into the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), is absolutely and completely willing to fulfil all requirements and obligations for being part of Europe. That is what we have been doing, even at this time, when there are difficulties with regard to short-term financing. In contrast to what the government of the Portuguese Socialist Party (PS) has done, the PSD has been demonstrating its total willingness to provide Europe with the guarantees necessary in the context of this crisis. Therefore, without bringing domestic politics into the European Parliament, I would like to signal the PSD’s commitment to and complete guarantee of the strict timetable that the country will need to adhere to following its elections on 5 June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is primarily a conservative success. Its implementation depends on unity. For this reason it is regrettable and requires explanation that four countries with conservative governments did not accept the Euro Plus Pact. It is regrettable and turncoat behaviour to recommend something to others that we, as the Presidency, do not consider acceptable for ourselves. Whoever stays out misses out. A country which does not aim for a breakthrough based on knowledge and competitiveness but for cheap wages and winning the tax competition will be the poorhouse of the European Union even in the medium term. As I have mentioned tax competition, Commission President, President of the Council, how do you explain that the Council did not discuss the issue of tax havens? Do you think that this is not a problem for European citizens? You are mistaken! We expect much more progress from the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me to also address the Japanese natural disaster and the consequent industrial disaster. There are 12 000 dead, 17 000 missing, hundreds of thousands are homeless and millions are without work. The European Union, which considers solidarity an asset, must help. The disaster shook the world’s energy and raw materials markets. It will determine the political and economic environment for a long time. It is imperative that we improve the world’s nuclear safety. It is imperative that we devise rules that make this possible. It is imperative that we boost research and development investments and strengthen diversification in European energy policy. These objectives, Commission President and President of the Council, have already been formulated in the 2020 objectives. It is the Council’s and the Commission’s job to build the road leading here and generate the resources for this. We wish you every success in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not because important steps forward have not been taken; it is because we cannot use the past and what we did in previous times to stabilise and strengthen the euro area as our benchmark today; our benchmark must be how efficient we are in dealing with the crisis. Unfortunately, however, we are not efficient when it comes to the markets – just look at how the cost of borrowing has risen over the past few days for countries in the region, especially Portugal – and we are not efficient or persuasive, unfortunately, when it comes to the European public, who increasingly feels that Europe is part of the problem, not part of the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, in two recent resolutions, and prominent figures across the entire political spectrum have pointed out that, if we want an effective and global response to the debt crisis, we need to seriously consider the possibility of a system for issuing Eurobonds. At the same time, the majority in the European Council tells us that this cannot happen, because it would create a moral hazard for fiscally healthy countries in times of crisis. While they cite the moral hazard in order to campaign against Eurobonds, they are creating a moral hazard at the expense of the countries with financial difficulties, by officially and unhesitatingly tabling the prospect of controlled bankruptcy and the involvement of private individuals in cost-sharing, thereby perpetuating the crisis by keeping the cost of borrowing unnecessarily high.</p>
<p class="contents">If we truly want private individuals to be involved and fairer cost-sharing, then we should seriously examine the question of a financial transaction tax as a matter of priority, so that some of the revenue can be used to finance the permanent mechanism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is sad, but true. We wasted a lot of time and missed out on numerous opportunities during the years of growth. Creating the single currency has undoubtedly been a success. However, it looks like a beautiful house with a damaged roof. We moved in when it was dry, but now the rain has come and is falling on the euro area in the form of a high deficit and debt level, with low creditworthiness.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euro Plus Pact and the decisions made by the Council mark a step in the right direction. The economic semester is a measure which will provide our economies and budgets with greater coordination and resilience in financial crises.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased about and it is the right decision for 60 countries outside the euro area, including my country, Bulgaria, to join the Pact so that they can actively participate in the decision-making process on economic policies, enabling Europe to move away from different standards and principles.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that European economic policies will have to be based, sooner or later, on a Community rather than an intergovernmental method, as is the case now. Indeed, the day is perhaps not far off when there will be a new intergovernmental conference or even a convention on economic and political governance issues in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Council’s conclusion on the matters relating to Libya. The European Union must be actively committed when it comes to establishing democracy after the end of the conflict and help the Libyan people create a constitutional state and civil society. This will obviously send out a signal as well to the other countries in the region that Europe supports the legitimate demands of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must also learn the lessons from the crisis in Libya and the whole Arab world. What else can we do for our close southern neighbours? Can we use our experience from the Eastern Partnership in the Mediterranean region?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso, Europe needs operational rapid-reaction forces which can carry out missions under the European Union flag. Increased capabilities and integration in terms of security and defence are required to achieve this objective, without, of course, duplicating or replacing NATO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one can be against that. However, rigour should not mean zero deficit or austerity, but rather intelligent spending.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s necessary competitiveness should be improved, that goes without saying, but wage cuts and social expenditure cuts should not be the only adjustable variable. Competitiveness is gained by investing in qualifications, research, excellence and major infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone here agrees on the fact that the Union and the euro are at a turning point. We are faced with having to choose between, on the one hand, a model of turning in on ourselves, where each country compares its competitiveness with the neighbouring Member State, where it looks at its rating on the financial markets and at the lowest possible contribution it can make to the European budget, and, on the other hand, a model based on solidarity – the only acceptable model – in which social standards are raised, in particular by upholding the position of social dialogue and of unions, with minimum social requirements across Europe and wage-indexing mechanisms that are protected, and in which solidarity between generations is guaranteed by a pension system which provides enough to live in dignity, as Parliament has recently stated.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States should be free from the pressures of financial markets thanks to a European Central Bank with a strengthened role, and we should have better regulated rating agencies, a solidarity-based model which guarantees genuine social and territorial cohesion in Europe, notably through an increased European budget, with a fundamental reform of its own resources and with the introduction, at last, of the tax on financial transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">Your conclusions are based on a distinct ideology that says that debt and deficit are responsible for the recession, when the real cause is the irresponsibility of financial players. Without a change in the ideological prism within the Council, we will not come out of the recession, and nor will we restore citizens’ trust. There is a clear democratic deficit today, and if the Council and the Commission continue to make proposals that fail to take Parliament’s opinion into account, our fellow citizens will reject our project even more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am therefore happy to endorse what my fellow Members have said in praising the Presidency of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from everything that other Members have already said, there are three points that I want to bring up. The first of these relates to labour costs as one of the factors involved in competition policy. During the financial crisis I often heard both the Commission President and the President of the European Council talk in praising terms of automatic stabilisers. Instead of sharp peaks and troughs these would ensure that we have a more stable economy with fewer job losses, which fits in perfectly with the social market economy that we want to be. However, some people now fear that an all-too-heavy focus on the labour costs factor in the Euro Plus Pact could too greatly limit the leeway for these automatic stabilisers to operate. My question, Mr Van Rompuy, is what is your view on this?</p>
<p class="contents">I have a second reservation to raise in relation to the factor of labour costs. I hear again and again from the trade unions that, in the area of wage settlement, the autonomy of the Member States and their social partners is being harmed and that we are possibly heading for a flagrant violation of the regulation of competencies under the Treaty. My question about this is, are we really treading risky ground here, or is this fear unfounded? I would also like to hear your analysis, Mr Van Rompuy, as, if this double fear is unfounded, we really must banish it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have a question about the common framework for calculating company tax base. In the conclusions of the spring summit, I read just one sentence – just the one – on this, and even that was without any commitment at all from the European Council in this connection. Is the conclusion that I am to draw from this that there is still no prospect of consensus for the introduction of this common framework for calculating company tax base and that, when it comes to increased cooperation in this regard, the best we have is dreams? Thank you in advance for your answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall comment on another very important issue: the issue of nuclear energy. What has Japan taught us? Two things: firstly, that no one can be ever be sufficiently well-prepared for natural disasters or combinations of natural disasters and, secondly, that nuclear energy is never completely safe.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we doing? We are accusing Japan of negligence. We are saying that it was not nuclear energy, it was Japan that was not safe. We are saying that we shall carry out our own inspections of nuclear power plants, so that we can see which are not safe and which are and then we will develop them. This means that we did not learn our lessons from Japan. We are not as prepared as Japan for disasters; we hardly even have a civil protection policy for cross-border problems, such as a nuclear accident.</p>
<p class="contents">We must stop calling today for new nuclear power plants to be built. We must invest not in the development of nuclear energy, but in developing the efficiency of photovoltaic and other renewable energy sources. The impact of nuclear energy is cross-border and the European Union is responsible for it, which is why, Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy, it will be your very serious responsibility if we fail to take the necessary precautions against another accident. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First, I think that the Council summit meeting brought very important and positive results, given the difficulty of the situation and the context. I welcome the formula of having an inclusive Euro Plus Pact open to those who are not yet eurozone members, as President Van Rompuy said.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are creating a European stability mechanism safety net. Could we not consider that in both mechanisms in Euro Plus, which is an obligational commitment to observe certain rules of behaviour in macroeconomic and macro-financial policy, and also in ESM. The safety net should be open so that both convergence and solidarity, which is ESM, may be inclusive and not exclusive.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark concerns neighbourhood policy. We seem to be redesigning our neighbourhood policy. The stimulus is coming from the South, but it is important for our overall neighbourhood policy. I hope that it will be – if we read the documents by Baroness Ashton and Mr Füle – far more society-oriented, more generous towards those societies and demanding of authorities and governments. We should move away from short-sighted economic interests and base this policy on a human rights and democracy approach, moving from status quo policy to transition policy. But when we create this new paradigm it should also be applicable to the East. We should be more human rights and democracy-based and more society-oriented and less authority-oriented than we are now.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns EU-NATO. In Libya we have a new experience of EU and NATO cooperation, which is a relationship which we do not yet fully understand. We also have an old experience in Afghanistan, which is not always good. At the same time, this relationship is important. Let us aim to be successful this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not correct to continue punishing the taxpayers in these countries for mistakes in fact made by the private sector, specifically by the banks. As far as the future is concerned, we must look to what after all is our goal for Europe. That goal is to secure stable growth. However, in order to secure stable growth, the necessary means, and this is also what is being discussed at the Council, is to secure low levels of government debt.</p>
<p class="contents">What will low or little government debt ensure? It will ensure the confidence of the financial markets in these countries, which will in turn ensure low interest rates, so that businesses in those countries may again recover and develop. When businesses develop, investment will follow. With investment will come jobs, which are essential for us in Europe. This process, namely reducing government expenditure, so that the level of debt is low, does not, moreover, exclude investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Several members have mentioned that investment is essential, that we cannot, as they say, ‘save ourselves out’ of this crisis, that we must invest. I can specifically cite the example of my country, Latvia, which has not only taken significant savings measures in the last two years, but this year, in 2011, has allocated one third of the national budget to public-sector investment. It is therefore possible. We have to go down this road in the future, to avoid arriving where we have arrived today. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The future mechanism will ensure a stable, consistent response to any situations where the euro area is destabilised. It is excellent having such a mechanism. However, it is preferable not to end up in such situations, which means that the disciplinary measures set out by the economic governance provisions should also be applied consistently. All Member States must help maintain stability, whether they are part of the euro area or not. This is why the creation of the Euro Plus Pact, which has also been joined by countries outside the euro area, including Romania, is an extremely positive development.</p>
<p class="contents">Implementing the European Semester will help coordinate European economic policy by improving competitiveness, cutting red tape, promoting education and boosting the labour force. However, these priorities must be very quickly converted into specific domestic measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of the new European structural reforms is closely linked to strengthening the single market. The Union needs a strategy which will help create jobs and relieve the shortages in the EU’s labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commission’s intention to present the Single Market Act, which should be adopted by the end of 2012. However, I regret to say that the priority measures which will give new impetus to the single market and competitiveness do not include any mention of the need to ensure the free movement of all European workers, focusing only on the free movement of services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my country, people have two concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, they do not know how many people will come. This is a fear which cannot be countered because we do not know how many people will cross over. Secondly, people are very concerned because of the uncertainty about Europe’s willingness to help this time round. This is a fear we can and should address because a solidarity mechanism already exists in our legislation, in Directive No 55 of 2001. What we should do is use it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission appears to be giving two reasons for not having made use of it. Firstly, that there is no majority in the Council of Ministers. I appeal to President Barroso not to cite this as reason. The Commission should show political leadership and take the political initiative to table a proposal for this mechanism to be activated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also stating that the numbers are not yet large enough. However, we should be careful. The number could be small in relation to Europe as a whole but very large for a single country expected to host them all on its own.</p>

Without thorough analysis and conclusions, that should become a commitment for all involved, we cannot avoid repeating the same mistakes. The central issue remains enhancing competitiveness.

<p class="contents">I was interested in the comments made by Catherine Day, a senior Commission official, in Ireland last week when she said that the shine had gone off Ireland. I hope that does not mean each of us individually, and I hope that, given the results of the stress tests and the very strong action of the new government, the shine will come back to Ireland. I hope, too, that it comes back to our people, who are very depressed and disillusioned by a feeling that they carry a very heavy burden for the rest of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask those who wag their fingers in anger about incorrect behaviour by individual countries and citizens to please remember that there were others who also joined in at the party – I speak of European banks, who tried to profit from the boom that existed not just in Ireland, but elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a ray of hope in the Irish media this morning. I see that global finance giants are backing our economy in the wake of the stress tests, and I hope that they realise that the Irish have fixed a problem for the rest of Europe, and will show us much-needed solidarity on interest rates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, this is hinted at in the section on page 16, on fostering competitiveness. It says ‘there will be assessments of wage and productivity developments and competitive adjustment needs’. Whatever does this mean?</p>
<p class="contents">It could only mean one thing. Wages must be adjusted downwards to make goods competitive with those of the emergent economies. While principles such as free trade are sacrosanct, the economic interests of European workers, it seems, are dispensable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it is unfortunate that Hungary’s name was not among those listed by President Van Rompuy, because regrettably Hungary is not taking part in the Euro Plus Pact. Very many Hungarian citizens and economists do not understand either why the Hungarian Government decided in this way, because Hungary is a small country with an open economy, and the argument that this would have obstructed tax competition is unsound since it is only about the harmonisation of the corporate tax base.

It is very important for consolidation efforts to supplement structural reforms, particularly in implementing priorities in the European Union set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy. A particularly important role should also be played by the Commission, which should monitor Member States’ actions very responsibly and follow the implementation of specific measures in accordance with national stability and convergence programmes.

<p class="contents">I think it is right to recognise that we have made important progress on the structure. If we compare what we have now with what we did not have beforehand, it is undoubtedly an important step forward. There has been, for instance, the creation of a permanent stability mechanism, which was not even provided for by the Treaty. Furthermore, this Parliament, by an overwhelming majority, supported a limited reform of the Treaty in order to create a new instrument, an instrument which did not even exist before.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, let us be intellectually honest in our assessment. I believe there has been substantial progress in terms of the reaction to the crisis, in terms of lessons learnt with regard to the shortcomings we have seen in the past, whether at instrument level or policy level. However at the same time, I said, very clearly in fact, that this might not be enough. It is one thing to have the structure, the architecture, but it is another to have the policies to be applied. Indeed, the real test will be to see, after this, what governments, and also our institutions, will be able to deliver in terms of substance. Substance is more important than instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time however, I have told you, with great transparency I think, that when we talk about ambition, the Commission would have preferred to have gone further in some areas. We highlighted for instance the fact that for the permanent stability mechanism, we were in favour of more flexibility. Unfortunately it was not possible to reach a consensus for this higher level of ambition. Having said that, I think it would be a mistake to reject the gains we have achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Staying on the subject of ambition, I would like to emphasise this important aspect, because some have suggested that the Commission should submit other proposals. Practically everything you have said, the Commission has already proposed. On 9 May 2010, the Commission – myself and Commissionner Rehn – tabled a legislative proposal relating to a wholly Community-based approach to the stability mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">We proposed the pooling, for instance, of debt management, what are referred to as joint and several guarantees. This was rejected by our Member States. Not by you, but obtaining the Member States’ approval is essential, Mr Verhofstadt. We presented the text at the euro area summit. It was rejected by a large majority of Member States. That is the reality.</p>
<p class="contents">On the specific matter of unanimity or majority rule for the permanent stability mechanism, I myself suggested the latter; I insisted, in the presence of the President of the European Council and certain Heads of State or Government, that they should accept a qualified majority rule. However, it was rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, one can always insist, but the clauses need to be clear and you need to know exactly who to address your requests to. The Commission has made ambitious proposals, for instance in relation to stress tests; it is the European Commission and the European Central Bank who have proposed credible and transparent tests for the European Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Eurobonds, the Commission has been talking about Eurobonds for at least 30 years I think. This was rejected by some of our Member States. I myself suggested here – and I can tell you that I will do the same for the financial perspective – that we could now at least have project bonds for financing investments at draft European budget level. We will see at that point who will be there to support this approach in favour of European investment. And maybe then, some of you could convince us with your own European parties to support this more ambitious approach to the financial perspective. This may be an opportunity for us to work even more closely. That is all on the issue of ambition at European level.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Even regarding the social issue, which I now wish to talk to you about, the Commission went to great lengths to ensure that the 2020 Strategy places more emphasis on social aspects, as well as on education. It was not easy, however. Some governments were saying that, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, it was not up to Europe or the European Union to take direct action on social aspects and education.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now try, within the framework of the 2020 Strategy – where it was nonetheless possible to reach a certain consensus on the inclusion, for instance, of the fight against poverty and social exclusion – to develop this policy, and also to encourage investment, particularly in education and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in that respect, let me tell you something that you may not be aware of. The Commission suggested, some time ago – two years ago I think – that emergency food aid be provided for some Europeans, because there are now people in Europe, too, who do not have enough to eat. Recently, I, together with Joseph Daul, Chair of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), visited the food bank here in the Bas-Rhin. There are poverty-related problems in Europe. Well, did you know that two governments took the Commission to the Court of Justice because the Commission had put in place a mechanism for helping the poorest in Europe? That is the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be absolutely clear. The Commission is in favour of a Europe that is more ambitious with regard to governance; it is in favour of fair growth and of more social justice at European level. However, at the same time, we need to have Parliament and the Member States on board. And we have to fight for that. Therefore, in my opinion, to criticise the Commission really would be to choose the wrong target, since it spearheaded the fight for a more social, fairer Europe and for much more credible governance.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, let us be absolutely clear on this as well. I do not think it helps Europe to say that the current problem is Europe’s problem, as if the responsibility did not lie at all with certain governments, which let their debt reach unsustainable levels or their banks have growth several times that of their gross domestic product. Governments are also partly responsible. That responsibility is essential. That is why we must now find solutions based on solidarity, but also act responsibly. That is why, for instance, I am proud that the Commission and I have supported the proposal aimed at lowering the interest rates paid by Greece, and we are doing the same thing now for Ireland. We think that this is the right thing to do, not only to avoid imposing extremely heavy costs on our Greek and Irish fellow citizens, but also to ensure that the debt is sustainable. Consequently, it is in that spirit of solidarity and responsibility that we can find common answers that will also enable us, I hope, to avoid a problem that some of you have alluded to and which concerns me, namely the problem of a certain division in Europe, in particular a division between North and South, between centre and periphery. I think that the Europe that we want to build is a Europe of solidarity, not a first-class and second-class Europe, but a Europe with which all Europeans can identify. </p>
<p class="contents">I have already defended, in word and in deed, the financial transaction tax in the G20 on behalf of the European Union. This was rejected by a huge number of our G20 partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that we are now discussing is whether, at European level, we can – or we should – have a financial transaction tax or not. Let us be honest, once again. Several Member States fundamentally oppose it. They will not agree. What I said at the last European Council was that the Commission is now making impact assessments of different options for the financial sector and will soon come forward with proposals. It was very important that the Commission made that announcement to the European Council because at least in the conclusions of the European Council there is a commitment to look at the proposals that the Commission will put forward for financial taxation. I believe that, in terms of justice, it is important that the financial sector – and to a large extent at least some of the behaviour in the financial sector was at the origin of this crisis – also contributes to the response to the crisis. I think this is basic in terms of fairness. That is my own position and, I have no doubt, the position of the Commission. I will come forward with proposals on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for the CCCTB. There is some opposition in some quarters in the Council, but the Commission has put forward the proposal and we will fight for it because we believe the CCCTB is important for the completion of the single market. This is exactly the approach we are defending.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been discussing process and instruments for a very long time. Now is the time to put process and instruments at the service of the substance. Process and instruments are important, but they are at the service of the substance and cannot substitute for it. The challenge we need to resolve is our economic renewal. The truth is that, in order to be able to invest, we need confidence. Confidence depends on our capacity to modernise, to innovate and to become more sustainable and more competitive. Let us not confuse cause and effect. Investment will be attracted if we implement Europe 2020 quickly and decisively, and if we pursue our goals of a Europe that is sustainable and competitive in the spirit of solidarity and also in solidarity with all the Member States, including Portugal. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr Schulz, you know very well that in my capacity as President of the Commission, I cannot interfere in Portuguese domestic policy. If one day you cease being Chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and you have other duties, I am sure that you will carry out those new duties completely independently and that you will not interfere in your group’s internal matters.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at the same time, I have to tell you that a political crisis in Portugal has not made things any easier, since Portugal was already in a rather difficult situation. Despite this, we the European institutions also need to respect national democracy and the decisions of national parliaments, and we now hope that Portugal will find the best way out of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the Commission stands by Portugal in helping it find the best solutions in accordance, of course, with the commitments it has made and with certain responsibilities it has towards its European partners. I believe that it is in this spirit of active solidarity and responsibility that we can tackle the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that there have been rather pessimistic views expressed here today. Moreover, as Europeans’ elected representatives, you reflect the dominant feeling in Europe. While it is only natural that we are concerned, I think that we should have the political courage and perceptiveness to show confidence in our European project, because I do not believe that we will be able to restore confidence in Europe by being pessimistic. The Commission is ready to carry on working enthusiastically with you, with the European Council, with the Council, with all the institutions, towards a stronger, more sustainable, fairer and more competitive Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">but I have the impression that you have not just come here to listen to me.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to thank you for all your comments, both positive and negative. I was struck all the more because, within the European Council, we have to have unanimity, and we try to have unanimity between all your colleagues, from all your parties, Prime Ministers and Heads of State. There are Socialists, Christian Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals, all belonging to your political families, and every time, we try and secure agreements between them.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone said earlier that I must be the idealist around here, the dream maker. I do not think that is my role, but what I try to do, at least, wherever possible – and the President of the Commission can testify to this – is to act in such a way that in most cases, we end up with a convergence between the Commission proposals and the outcome of the European Council. Let me mention the example of the task force, where the Commission proposals were the basis of the task force on economic governance, and where the outcome is very close to the Commission proposals. And I will try, we will try with Parliament, to improve these proposals still further. My role, then, is to seek a consensus, but one that is also based as far as possible on the Community, and I think that in some crucial areas, I have succeeded in doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the ‘Euro Plus Pact’ – you know, the short paper that served as a starting point for our discussions, and the final Euro Plus Pact document – many of you, even those who belong to sceptical political groups, have said that their country should join the Euro Plus Pact. This is probably because it is not so bad after all. We have succeeded in reaching a compromise between ambitious objectives, so that economies remain competitive and public finances remain sustainable, and implementation at national level, because in most cases, the decisions we must take are national ones.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation concerns methodology, if you will. Many criticisms in relation to Europe are justified in terms of substance, but are not in line with the Treaty. For example, the whole nuclear policy, the Energy Mix, comes under national jurisdiction and there is nothing I can do to change that. Even safety and security of nuclear installations come for the most part under national jurisdiction. There are Community competences, European competences, and in the conclusions of the European Council, we tried to promote them as much as possible. I do not think that the Commission has ever had such an important role in nuclear security as it has since the European Council of a few days ago. However, we still need to work within the framework of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">People have talked about minimum wages in some countries, but that is a national competence. People have talked about inequalities, job insecurity, injustice, yet in most cases, these are measures that are part of a national framework. However, I would like to add that many measures which need to be taken now regarding competitiveness and public finances are measures that national governments ought in fact to have taken, even without European pressure. Europe is exerting additional pressure because there is, for 17 countries at least, a Community currency that needs defending. In most countries, however, the required measures need to be taken for the country’s own interest, for its own nationals, to safeguard its own future. And Europe is bringing additional pressure to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore let us not level any unfounded accusations against the European Union. Are our governance measures too weak? Well, the Council will work with the European Parliament to improve economic governance and, as in other cases, I am certain that compromises will be found. It may be that there is a governor of a central bank of one of the 17 countries who has a number of criticisms in relation to economic governance, but I can quote other governors or bank directors of countries close to the Netherlands who have an altogether different opinion. If necessary, I can give you the names and the quotations: that is the easiest way to work.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the current crisis, honourable Members, there is the future, and there are instruments on which important decisions have been taken, but there is of course the past. As I have already said, the past needs to be managed. Even with the best instruments that we can come up with – the facility, the stability mechanism, changing the Treaty, economic governance, the pact – we will not solve the problems of the countries that are struggling, we will not solve the problems of the banks that are still under pressure. So there is the future and there is the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the past, there was a lack of policy in some Member States and at European level. We need to be self-critical there. However, what we need to ensure and will ensure, and we have already taken the necessary measures, is that this crisis does not happen again in the future. In the meantime, as I have already said, we have to manage the legacy of the past, both regarding certain countries that you know about and which are in the programme – such as Greece and Ireland – and regarding other countries where we are taking measures to prevent them from going into the programme. Could we have taken those measures a year ago? No! Have there been major errors in the past? We undermined the Stability and Growth Pact seven or eight years ago. If we had not done that, we would have had much more effective instruments and we could have prevented many crises.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to economic growth, honourable Members, since 2010 it has averaged 2%, which is the average for the decade between 1999 and 2008. We had economic growth in 2010, and it is averaging 2% in 2011. Should we do more? Of course we should. Are public investments the only instrument? Not at all! The internal market, the single market is extremely important. It must be developed further. There are Commission proposals on the table, and they will be discussed again in a few weeks, at the June European Council, and we will return to this matter again in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of Libya, many criticisms can be levelled at us. However, without Europe, without European leadership, there would have been a bloodbath in Libya. Without Europe, there would have been massacres. Some of you have been very critical of the European Union. Yet we acted in time! And without Europe, nothing would have been done at global level, at United Nations level. After all the criticisms that have been voiced, I believe that we also have the right to hear that truth. Did we get things wrong in the past? Did we adopt the right policies? No! Did we correct our mistakes? Yes! And the European Union deserves credit for correcting them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say one last thing in my own language. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL) </span>I just listened to Mr Eppink, who declared that he felt let down. I, too, feel let down by so much intellectual dishonesty. I will not go into it further, but for Mr Eppink to stand there waving a photograph knowing full well that I was there in my official capacity and that that was not my personal conviction, well, I have to say that I feel very let down by him. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am speaking not just for myself, but on behalf of many of my colleagues who were here the whole time and who followed this debate. In all my time here at the European Parliament I have rarely felt as badly treated as today in the interplay between you and Mr Barroso. I want to be very clear on this. Mr Barroso, you have told us: ‘The initiatives open to me, which have the support of the vast majority in this house, fail because the Member States reject them.’ Let me offer you a word of advice: place your initiatives on the table in the form of draft legislation. That way you will get a majority in this House and the Council will no longer have any hiding space.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you to please stop hiding behind the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">To you, Mr Van Rompuy, I would say this: you tell us that you have succeeded in reaching compromises between socialists, liberals, conservatives and Christian democrats at Council level. The Council is made up of sovereign ministers of state and prime ministers. Here we witness a President of the Council trying to turn the Treaty of Lisbon in the opposite direction. The result of the Treaty of Lisbon is that the Council of Heads of State or Government is drawing more and more power to itself, while at the same time saying: ‘our decisions are made on a unanimous basis.’ This was not what the Treaty of Lisbon was about. Lisbon wanted majority decision-making to be the norm within the EU. You are misinterpreting the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">For this reason it is high time for the European Parliament to take the matter in hand itself and to defend the Community method.</p>

Despite there being signs of economic recovery, the situation remains difficult, and the end of the economic crisis still seems a long way off. This may be seen in the case of Portugal, which has unfortunately ended up having to join Ireland and Greece in requesting economic and financial aid. It is therefore important to adopt the necessary economic and financial measures for dealing with the crisis, for preventing cases of indebtedness like in Greece, Ireland and Portugal being repeated, and for strengthening economic governance within the EU and ensuring job creation. A package of six measures has been adopted, which from the start appear to me to be positive and to have quite ambitious expectations, such as the establishment of a European Stability Mechanism, the Euro Plus Pact, and so on. I hope that these can be implemented as quickly as possible, so that they can begin to produce the results that are so necessary and hoped for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both proposals offer therefore a constructive pair of measures, especially in view of the proposal for coordinating taxation policies, which is an essential reform in a union of states seeking to share the same currency. Furthermore, the European Stability Mechanism, thanks to its intervention facility of EUR 500 billion, operates like a European Monetary Fund, authorised to borrow money and purchase bonds directly from states, while countering financial speculation at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">However, certain proposals in the Pact are unworkable. Fiscal austerity and making the labour market extremely flexible will delay economic growth, keep unemployment at high levels and create labour instability. I think that gradual fiscal consolidation and safeguarding the European social model are needed to lay the foundations for sound economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it must be recognised that this crisis also has a huge knock-on effect on my own constituency of Northern Ireland, which shares a land border with the Republic. There is a large quantity of cross border movement in terms of finance, services and people for employment purposes. Banking institutions from the Republic of Ireland also have a considerable stake in Northern Ireland. Therefore the liquidity problem these banks are now facing are directly impacting on businesses in Northern Ireland, particularly SMEs, in terms of access to financing. At a time when SMEs are struggling to survive an already dire economic climate, this is only helping to depress a difficult situation. At present, 30 per cent of everything manufactured or produced in Northern Ireland goes directly to market in the Republic of Ireland. Therefore a weak market in the Republic has direct and serious ramifications for business and employment in my constituency. In light of this serious situation I call on President Barroso to acknowledge this and use the taskforce to look at ways to improve the situation we now find ourselves in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has surely been renamed in order to conceal its true authors – Germany and France – given that the previous name, the ‘competitiveness pact’, would immediately give them away. Alongside so-called ‘economic governance’, this is an attack on Member States that are in a more vulnerable position from an economic and social point of view, with this being a veritable sentence of economic dependence and backwardness.</p>
<p class="contents">Both instruments are linked to the announced amendment – using the simplified procedure and without holding any referenda – to the Treaty of Lisbon, with the aim of introducing the so-called ‘conditionality’ associated with the European Stability Mechanism. According to the Council’s conclusions, this is ‘strict policy conditionality under a macro-economic adjustment programme’, a process that will be developed and implemented jointly by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, we are going through a process of concentration of political and economic power, now not only in the hands of a directorate of powers in the service of big business and finance, but also in the hands of the very institutions of international capital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current Hungarian Presidency has scored a striking success for the second time in the areas of economic governance, the stability mechanism and the European Semester. In the series of talks that took place in the context of its last meeting at the end of March, the European Council managed to agree on the limited amendment of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as well, the purpose of which was to enhance the stability of the euro area and the euro. At the Council meeting the Hungarian Presidency voted in favour of a rational, responsible economic policy that can be abided by, and apart from the institutionalisation of the European Semester, also strengthened the stability mechanism. However, we need to point out that the elements of economic governance are not to be confused in any way with the Euro Plus Pact, which is an intergovernmental agreement at its current stage. Although it is possible that the Pact is good, the single internal market cannot be regulated by non-contractual intergovernmental agreements. Due to an unclarified point in the Pact concerning tax harmonisation, Hungary does not wish to apply the agreement in its entirety for the time being because we have an interest in enhancing our competitive advantage, and through this in real job creation in the long term and economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Also of importance is the agreement that has been reached on structural reform and fiscal consolidation and the final resolution on the amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon for the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism. All countries must implement fiscal consolidation measures and measures aimed at preventing macroeconomic disequilibrium. Structural reforms to promote employment and social inclusion must also be implemented. They must be defined according to each country’s particular situation. The participation of 23 European countries in this pact leads us to hope that these measures will encourage economic growth. This is a step in the right direction and a sensible response to those economic challenges. This pact fits splendidly with the work of Parliament and the Commission on improvements to the single market and the three reports that we are approving in Parliament this week. We must take even bolder decisions. Member State governments must not seize the pretext of the electoral cycle in order to put off taking important but unpopular decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the most important decision in connection with European economic policy is the Euro Plus Pact, which provides a common agenda and common objectives. The four main objectives are: promoting competitiveness, promoting employment, increasing the sustainability of public sector funding and restoring financial stability. As a result of this pact, several other Member States have joined the euro area; for example, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Denmark, Romania and Bulgaria. I think that it is extremely important at the present time to reach common agreements involving the application of equal rules as well as common mechanisms for achieving the desired objectives. I especially want to recognise those Member States who are not members of the euro area but who have still joined this pact. It is to be hoped that the application of common rules will be accompanied by the harmonisation of national perceptions, and this particularly relates to the sustainability of public sector funding with a view to preventing the situations that engulfed Greece and Ireland from arising in the future. At the same time, we cannot just stop at these decisions, as they will only provide short-term results. It is necessary to develop solutions for making future investments, whether through eurobonds or through other solutions. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Euro Plus Pact adopted by the Heads of State or Government, with the involvement of the countries in the euro area and Bulgaria, Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Romania, provides us with a real chance of achieving the objectives set out in it, or in other words supporting competitiveness, employment, the stability of public finances and financial stability in general. It is worth highlighting the fact that the Pact does not specify the political or economic measures to be used in order to achieve these objectives, which means that it will still be up to the individual Member States to choose suitable means of doing so. There can be no doubt that the success or failure of the Pact will be determined by the genuine involvement of the Member States and how effectively their progress is monitored. When it comes to economic coordination, the EU can no longer afford a failure such as that suffered by the Stability and Growth Pact. Consent was also given at the summit to the inclusion in the Treaty of a provision establishing a permanent European Stability Mechanism, mobilised with the joint agreement of the Member States in the event that it is necessary to ensure the stability of the euro area as a whole. This is a very important decision, particularly in light of the recent problems faced by countries in the euro area. A permanent mechanism enshrined in the Treaty will act as a solid guarantee in the event of similar problems in the future, thus also reducing the risk of speculative attacks on the European currency. I also welcome the fact that the mechanism has been opened up for Member States outside the euro area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is hard to imagine a more competitive EU being built without the participation of countries such as the United Kingdom, Sweden or Poland, so I welcome the news that the Euro Plus Pact has been adopted. To begin with, our impression was that the euro area planned not only to reform itself, but what is more to introduce reforms outside EU structures, which was a cause of some concern to MEPs. These fears were however successfully dispelled, and an uncompromising stance was taken on Parliament’s behalf. The only regrettable thing is that the Member States did not adopt it in its entirety, particularly with regard to the European Stability Mechanism, which in our opinion should be open to countries outside the euro area from the outset. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title4"></a><a name="creitem4"></a>

Obviously, we must be ready to deal with these situations and these flows of people. We need to find a way of doing this together by ensuring, in solidarity with one another, that we meet the challenges that arise when our common system is put under pressure from the outside world.</p>

I am particularly pleased that Parliament’s resolution places the focus on strengthening the role of the border agency, FRONTEX. That is something that we in the Danish Liberal Party have been fighting for for a very long time. During the current crisis in North Africa, FRONTEX has proven to be a particularly important instrument for dealing with migration flows in the region.

This is about the individual fate of human beings, in which every person’s story is different. They are on the move through desperation, but what unites them all is hope for something better.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs to show sympathy and a willingness to help. European integration is a successful, common project through which we have created prosperity, stability and security – a sort of cradle of well­being. It will be difficult and expensive to respond to this wave of immigration after it starts rapping on the doors of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The example provided by the island of Lampedusa shows how foreign policy security matters can become internal policy in an instant, and that is why development cooperation alone is no longer enough. Europe needs a comprehensive, preventive plan that covers aspects of security, regional cooperation, trade policy, climate change, the protection of human rights and the development of democracy. This is what we need to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This question disregards two pieces of information, often for ulterior motives. Firstly, many of these immigrants want to end up in other EU countries. Secondly, in the last two years, less than 4 000 people have arrived on Italy’s shores, thanks to bilateral agreements with Libya and Tunisia. In the past two months following the political crisis, 22 000 people have already arrived.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy is a pressure cooker right now. On the one hand, the flow of migrants from North Africa, particularly economic migrants from Tunisia, is not coming to a halt. On the other hand, France is rejecting immigrants at Ventimiglia because they do not hold residence permits.</p>
<p class="contents">If European solidarity does exist, now is the time to show it by working together at EU level to decide how to deal with these flows, both in the current emergency and in the long term, as well as which instruments to use in dealing with those arriving in Europe and what measures to adopt in countries of origin. This text is an initial step in this direction and I therefore voted in its favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolution that we have voted on calls for a Union policy for the East and its most appropriate instruments to address various factors that cause this instability.</p>

The governments of the Member States each acted on their own behalf, offering a pitiful spectacle to the world and the people that we should be helping. The only refugee reception policy the Union could offer fell well short of requirements. The island of Lampedusa and Italy were left without any answers.

All kinds of things are stated and proposed in this report – some of them even sensible ideas, which is unusual in this Parliament. Yet, sadly enough, it remains primarily a report offering total political correctness that nowhere – not in a single place, not in a single paragraph or a single clause – ventures to question the new mass immigration into an already overpopulated continent of Europe, as this relates predominantly to the countries that used to make up what was known as Western Europe but is also a fundamental issue.</p>
<p class="contents">My own country of Flanders is the most densely populated country in the whole of the European Union.

The idea that emigration is a product of poverty and desperation, although superficially plausible, turns out to be specious. Emigration, we know historically, more often is the product of rising wealth and rising aspiration. We saw very recently that the great migratory flows from Tunisia came after the restoration of democracy and the end of dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">The real cause which uproots people and makes them shift themselves hundreds of miles in pursuit of a better life is opportunity. The reality is that in the European Union we have created a situation where we have long-scale structural unemployment and yet are still are having to import labour. In our country, the United Kingdom, there are more than 4 million people who are either unemployed or on incapacity benefit and yet every month we are bringing people in from all over the world to do jobs that are not being taken by people born in the United Kingdom. We have trapped millions in the squalor of dependency. We have placed them in a situation where work is no longer part of their mental horizon. If we want to rescue people from that wretched condition, the answer is not in foreign policy but in reform of welfare, so as to restore dignity and independence to our own citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Think what it must be like to leave behind your family, your village, your town, all your social ties, your friends, maybe never knowing whether you will see them again or when you will see them again. What makes them leave those countries and seek opportunity, as the previous speaker said, in the West? Well, quite often it is because they are escaping from conditions and governments that are no longer able to command their confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">We can help in some ways. Let us look at some of the policies that we have: our fisheries policy, which encourages large fishing boats to plunder the seas off poor African nations, leaving their local fishermen in desperation with no jobs. What do they do then? They seek to migrate. We have our aid policy, which keeps corrupt governments in power, making it less pleasant for people to stay in their countries. That makes people look to go abroad and they come here.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to get this right. We have to understand that it is difficult for people to leave their own countries. We should make sure that our policies help people to stay in their own countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we want to maintain a stronger European agricultural sector that is able to supply good quality food to the whole of Europe we need to ensure that this sector is attractive to both workers and families. For this to be possible, it is necessary for us to give rural areas the opportunity for growth, innovation, jobs and development. It is not necessary for us to impose quotas and unnatural gender distributions on the sector. Therefore, it is also a good thing that Parliament has today adopted the report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas, thereby sending a very clear signal that, here too, women play an important role. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a problem not only for Asia, but for every country on every continent. If nuclear power stations exist which should be closed for safety reasons, let us do everything in our power to ensure that this takes place and efficiently. Let us provide support for all measures resulting in the creation of new and safe energy sources, and when taking decisions let our overriding priority always be public safety.

In 2004, the Lithuanian, Slovak and Bulgarian Governments made commitments in their accession treaties to gradually shut down some of their nuclear reactors. The closure incurred extraordinary economic burdens, thus the EU undertook to provide financial aid for decommissioning by the end of 2013. EU experience of nuclear decommissioning is limited. The shutdown may have a direct effect on the energy supply of the country concerned and neighbouring Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of alternative, low carbon emission and competitive energy sources must be promoted in order to manage the negative consequences. At the same time, we need to provide adequate financial resources to ensure that decommissioning operations occur in accordance with safety regulations. The European Union will be able to use the experience gained during the shutdown processes with nuclear power plants that are approaching the end of their economic lives. Based on the results, with a view to 2013, it may be presumed that several investment projects will be almost complete, and new decommissioning and management structures will be already available to us.

However, over all these years, billions of euros of European taxpayers’ money has been spent modernising them and prolonging their life. We are basically subsidising the nuclear lobby which fought for reconditioning. Fukushima has shown us yet again that these reactors should be shut down; however, no such financial provisions were included into the operating costs of reactors and this is a huge and scandalous subsidy for a dangerous, expensive and contaminating method of producing energy. Now, however, we can change the political will. Convert subsidies for reconditioning unsafe reactors into funding to close them. Freeze all new reactors being designed. Convert resources from Euratom financing and abundant ITER subsidies. Divert the resources earmarked to design and build new reactors to an economy based 100% on renewable energy sources by 2050.

Most of the projects concerning the closure of Ignalina have been implemented or are being implemented. Obviously, there are some difficulties. When a new Lithuanian Government and Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant Board take office, it is hoped that it will be possible to bring proceedings against those individuals, who failed to organise work properly, and also to review the agreement on the construction of repositories for spent nuclear fuel, managing to obtain favourable conditions. I entirely agree that it is necessary to manage funds and use resources with complete transparency, thereby ensuring nuclear safety.

It is a crime to be persecuted. We need to break the silence. Respecting culture and religion is important but it should never be an excuse for honour killing, genital mutilation, trafficking, domestic violence and forced marriages. The Stockholm Programme provides a new policy framework to enhance the fight against violence on women and calls for concrete action. I encourage the Commission to come forward with a strategy which includes practical proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted in favour of this report because I believe we must join forces across political parties to denounce and combat all forms of violence against women. I support the principle and most of the proposals, but judicial and criminal law measures should be taken at national level. That is what we are doing in Sweden. In fact combating violence is at the centre of the women’s organisation of my party, providing practical action and raising awareness not only to protect women, but also to empower women and to develop a culture of respect for women’s dignity. I have started a social media campaign on this which everybody is welcome to join. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In drafting a strategy for the fight against all forms of violence, the Commission should harmonise the rights of women and the rights of unborn children.

I voted against it because, as a colleague of mine said a bit earlier, it is a bit of a time warp. It brings us back to the 1970s and political correctness and is very naive in that element.

<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs assessed the respective eligibility conditions favourably. The EGF was created in 2006 with the objective of providing additional support for workers who have been made redundant and are suffering from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns, and to assist their reintegration into the labour market. As a result of a revision of the EGF Regulation in 2009, the fund’s scope was expanded to include support for workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the world economic and financial crisis. The annual budget available for the EGF is EUR 500 million. I believe that it would be advantageous to make the necessary efforts to speed up the mobilisation of this instrument, thus enabling aid to reach the workers who need it more quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be remembered that Poland requested assistance for 594 workers made redundant in three companies in the manufacture of machinery and equipment division in the NUTS II region of Podkarpackie.</p>
<p class="contents">The redundancies are linked to the impact of the economic and financial crisis, which has resulted in a drop in exports for the companies Huta Stalowa Wola SA, HSW – ZZN and DEZAMET SA of 47%, 34% and 58% respectively, meaning that the companies meet the eligibility criteria laid down in the EGF Regulation. The European Commission is therefore proposing the mobilisation of the sum of EUR 453 570. The result, they say, has been a considerable reduction in the production of machinery and equipment, thus demonstrating the effects of the crisis on the companies in question in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The 594 redundancies have severe repercussions for living conditions, jobs and the local economy, which is why mobilisation of the EGF is of the highest importance for supporting the affected workers.

The share of this fund remaining at year end is repatriated to Member States as part of their ‘rebate’. Yet failure by some countries, like the UK, to use this fund, which is its established right, in cases like the Twining Tea plant closure in Andover, raises certain questions. Those pretending to understand the benefits/disbenefits of the rebate query whether or not it is more correct and efficient for countries to make direct use of EGAF monies at local level.</p>
<p class="contents">The second irony concerns political and economic participation – engaging at all EU levels of added value. For the UK to maintain the right not to participate in funds managed at EU level because later benefits may flow is, in this case, uncertain and perhaps even plain wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK is renouncing access to funding on a principle of not applying for this fund in order to receive a rebate. For those seeking help to return to work – in Sandwich, Kent and Andover, Hampshire – there is little justification in saying ‘no’, and this is another UK Government let-down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Political, social and economic instability, lack of security, political repression and authoritarian regimes are the major driving forces behind migration, depriving affected communities of viable local prospects and income and, hence, of the right to choose whether to migrate or not, putting their lives at constant risk and leaving them with migration as their only option. The recent dramatic events in Egypt and other countries in North Africa and the Middle East have clearly increased the flow of both legal and illegal migrants to Europe. The European Union must therefore be ready to withstand the flow of migration. It can only do this by having an efficient and wise migration policy similar to those implemented in Canada, Australia or New Zealand. I agree with the rapporteur’s position that we must urge the Commission to ensure that any readmission agreement signed by the EU and its Member States fully respects human rights and the principle of 'non-refoulement' and does not put at risk any persons in need of international protection. The EU will thus demonstrate once again that values and respect for human rights are the most important thing and inalienable, and persons seeking asylum will feel safe and respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Migration is a particularly relevant issue which has been highlighted recently, because due to events in North Africa, the European Union, as a neighbouring region, has been forced to receive huge flows of migrants. The report draws attention to the many factors behind migratory flows, such as political and social factors, economic instability and climate change, which still fails to be taken into account when examining the reason for mass migration. Due to all these reasons, it is stressed that the EU requires a more effective approach to migration, which would complement foreign policy instruments. These instruments would help address sources of instability in countries of origin, which force people to emigrate en masse to more stable neighbouring countries. The report also calls on the Commission to draw up proposals on legal migration, which would be easier to manage and could promote economic and social progress in receiving, transit and origin countries. It is stated that the very worst human rights violations, as well as criminal activities, which often become a business for those organising those activities, are precisely linked to illegal immigration. Finally, it emphasises the need to assess the demographic situation in the EU itself, in order to calculate exactly how many people Europe can receive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resettling of refugees from this region should be the responsibility of the states which the refugees head to, and if the influx becomes unsustainable, the response should be to tighten up EU asylum and immigration policy. In this context, I consider the calls to create a common EU asylum system and a common EU resettlement programme to be alarming.

The report in question looks at the importance of continuing with cooperation treaties relating to the European neighbourhood policy (ENP). The phenomenon of emigration fuelled by situations of crisis and instability has negative implications for the origin country, the destination country and the displaced populations themselves. This phenomenon needs to be reversed, so that emigration under these circumstances ceases to be the last resort: an escape from a situation of insecurity, of weak economic development, of instability or of fear. In this explanation of vote, I reiterate the need to take measures ensuring and promoting stability and security in origin countries. The perspective for reducing these migration flows fuelled by instability and crisis should be prevention. I believe that European foreign policy, and very specifically the ENP, should provide for aid to these regions of the world, promoting security, stability and the protection of human rights as part of an expanded development process, as I stated in my report on the revision of the ENP-South, which will also be voted on this week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We support the call for the human rights dimension to be clearly reflected in the work of FRONTEX, especially the right of a person to leave his or her country, the ban on refoulement and the right to seek asylum.

The Union’s foreign policy cannot simply be not removed from this phenomenon: it must seek to understand it, and monitor it to the greatest extent possible. In truth, the EU needs to take measures to optimise the use of its financial resources and institutional structures, and effectively manage migration flows resulting from the instability that currently exists in several areas of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">A policy of prevention that uses the most appropriate foreign policy instruments, with a view to tackling and confronting the causes of instability, could help to transform the current ‘desperate necessity’ for emigration into an ‘opportunity’ for emigration. The rule of law needs to be promoted, human rights protected, and the development of democracy and economies fostered. Without these common development efforts in the countries involved, working alongside their people and social structures, it will not be possible to contribute effectively to instability reduction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We absolutely need a European response and European solidarity in the face of this unfolding human drama. Our report calls for a system of solidarity regarding the resettlement of refugees from North Africa. Our report calls for the ‘solidarity clause’ to be applied between Member States with regard to policies on border controls, asylum and immigration. Our report also asks for the post-2013 budget to include a provision on emergency funds for a rapid response to immigration and asylum in Europe.

The challenge that the European Union must face up to is caused by the obvious instabilities in which North Africa and the Middle East are enmeshed. In order to avoid negative consequences, Europe must be able to meet this challenge by setting out and implementing a policy of prevention that acts on the causes of economic and political instability in these countries, proposing shared solutions that can prevent or at least reduce the magnitude of the phenomenon. However, the resources required for this purpose are extensive, which is why it will be necessary to involve other world powers and coordinate with them. All of which cannot, however, be done without fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity. From this point of view, Europe is duty-bound to respond concisely and cohesively, thereby demonstrating its decision to focus on this policy above others. For these reasons, because I am convinced of the important political signal that Europe is morally obliged to send on this issue and not leave the States to their own devices, I used my vote to support the aforementioned resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU is concerned about the fall of dictators it used to support in exchange for management of ‘migration flows’ at its borders.

Moreover, this text recommends applying sanctions to countries that fail to respect the principles enshrined in the free trade agreements and those advocated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Arab revolutions have barely shaken off the yoke of their own despots and now foreign tyrants are sending them their regards. This report is arrogant and brutal.

This report advocates European migration policy that is not based on the understanding that emigration is a right and not a crime, and does not guarantee the sacred principle of requesting asylum. The EU’s hypocrisy is abominable: it is criminalising undocumented immigrants. Illegal immigrants are used for labour in the process of rapidly accumulating capital, in a direct assault on the universal nature of human rights. The EU, which can only exist through economic immigration, is demonstrating great cynicism. What is happening in North Africa is proof of ‘Fortress Europe’. The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) has nothing to do with solidarity or cooperation to help peoples fight against dictatorships like those of Ben Ali, Mubarak or Gaddafi: when thousands of Africans are fleeing repression and war, the EU imprisons them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Wars and military conflicts, ethnic tensions, systematic violation of human rights – such as a prohibition to exercise one’s religion, natural disasters, lack of economic and democratic structure are among the causes of such migration flows. This phenomenon is of great concern since it may not only increase and strengthen tensions between the country of origin and country of destination but also between the country of origin and a country of transition. In order to address the challenge efficiently, the EU should conduct preventive policy by any appropriate means of foreign policy intended to deal with causes of instability so that emigration becomes an opportunity not a necessity. In the long term, the EU may undertake effective actions for optimisation of the use of its own financial instruments and existing institutional structures. The measures proposed in the report are not sufficient and are too declarative. A precise and specific financial economic plan is necessary. Otherwise, Europe will choke as a result of the wave of illegal migration. As a first step on the way to resolving this problem, the report is very useful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the fact that migration cannot be stopped, foreign policy must play a special role in this area. Countries on the EU’s external borders are worst affected by increased migration flows. Every effort must therefore be made to ensure that a common EU migration policy is established at EU level so that migration flows are managed and controlled optimally. Only joint efforts will protect economic growth, labour market sustainability and scope for development from negative consequences in those countries facing the greatest flows of immigrants. This will be an effective instrument for stopping illegal immigration, organised crime and trafficking in human beings. The EU must make every effort to ensure that legal migration is promoted and that we combat irregular migration effectively. It is very important to establish a system for legal migration, taking account of the needs of Europe’s labour market and the capacity of each Member State to receive and integrate immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Legal immigrants in European Union Member States must enjoy the same rights and obligations as other workers. Furthermore, in every country it is very important to reduce the brain drain and the departure of qualified specialists. To that end we must introduce assisted return programmes, promote circular migration, regulate recruitment practices and support capacity-building. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Immigration is a difficult issue to resolve; however, we can manage it, if we take the right action. The problem cannot be shouldered basically by Greece, Italy and Spain. Since January, 23 000 immigrants have entered Italy. We must try, especially in light of developments in North Africa and the Arab world, to find a European strategy to address the problem of immigration, so as not to leave the Member States to their fate and, at the same time, to ensure that the unfortunate people forced to migrate and the citizens of Europe bearing the burden are not taken advantage of. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Right now, just as the situation in North Africa is giving rise to large flows of migrants, the EU is failing to hit the mark by failing to take any clear responsibility. Frontex cannot be the only instrument involved in tackling the refugee crisis. Europe also urgently needs to develop an action plan for burden-sharing in order to assist the resettlement of refugees from the region and to offer support to the homeless. I find it regrettable that, in the current circumstances, the postponement of an agreement governing cooperation between the EU and Libya was apparently the only possible option. In such agreements, it is not the tightening-up of border controls into the Union that should be the primary concern but monitoring the ratification of and compliance with the Geneva Convention. I hope that this resolution is a first step towards a more global approach to the issue of refugees so that people are dealt with in a more humane way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coordination between foreign policy and immigration policy is essential. We need to focus on the deep-rooted causes of instability in certain regions of the world and to manage migration flows effectively. Migration management policy should indeed be effectively combined with European development cooperation policy, and should take into account aspects concerning security, regional cooperation in the Southern countries and cooperation agreements with countries of origin and of transit. With regard to the central role of some third countries in this policy, I am convinced that it is absolutely essential for the EU to sign cooperation agreements to be signed between with these countries in order to combat illegal immigration.

I believe it is essential for the EU’s migration policy and its development aid policy to feed into each other. There are unseen human dramas behind the migration phenomena, and part of the solution lies in aid policy for third countries that will contribute to their development and stability. It is an issue that the European neighbourhood policy (ENP) also needs to take into consideration. I believe there is an urgent need for a Union-wide response and I call on Member States and the Commission to mobilise the necessary tools and resources. This will be done by strengthening the resources and role of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (FRONTEX). It will also be done by providing adequate assistance to the regions and towns of the Mediterranean coast that will have to deal with the humanitarian emergency that this influx of immigrants is going to create, and that will have to ensure that order is maintained and to encourage the integration of legal migrants. To my mind, European solidarity must fully come into play between Member States and third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, in order to ensure a stable situation for populations working in agriculture, rural development policy should focus more strongly on creating innovative and sustainable living and working conditions in rural areas.

It is also important for support to be given to political efforts to further the role of women in agriculture by making it easier for them to be active as agricultural entrepreneurs.

I entirely agree that one of the important measures that may change this emerging tendency towards urbanisation is the creation of suitable living and working conditions in rural areas. Experience shows that quality of life and economic power in rural areas are closely linked to women and the role they play in farming. Consequently, it is particularly important for the measures proposed in the report, which would enable women to realise their own plans for their lives, to be economically independent and meet family challenges just as successfully as they do today in urban areas. Measures listed in the report include the continuation and development of training and counselling provision for women that has a specific rural focus, continuity of EU support for agriculture and business in rural areas, the development of the most essential infrastructure and IT infrastructure, and the opportunity to take advantage of early retirement and many other measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It remains a crucial task for European rural policy to achieve equivalent living conditions in all regions, preventing the one-sided development of heavily populated urban areas, so that, even in rural areas, women and men can look forward to staying and having a successful life. If we want to keep women of all generations living in the countryside or encourage them to move there, then support policies must reflect their needs and circumstances more strongly than has been the case in the past. In a modern society, the only way to do this is through recourse to support services, facilities and structures that must be affordable and accessible at regional level. One of the core European support strategies must be to maintain this supportive structure and develop it in a woman-friendly way. It is necessary right at the planning stage – for example, when constructing a kindergarten, creating a day-care facility or developing public transport – to identify new approaches and to involve women of all generations in the decision making. Schooling, vocational and academic education and further training remain fundamental to quality of life and quality of work in rural areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the rapporteur, I am convinced that a campaign of active support for rural areas is the only way to prevent women from moving to the cities. This also requires needs-based childcare facilities and an infrastructure tailored to families in the agricultural sector, as well as access to the Internet and other communication technology. In order to be able to implement important measures in rural areas in the future, we will require sufficient financial means for agriculture and for the development of rural areas.

Out of a total of around 27 million people regularly employed in agriculture in the EU, around 42% are women whilst, according to official statistics, one agricultural business in five (around 29%) is directly managed by a woman. I invite you to take these figures into consideration when assessing the huge contribution women in many local communities make to development, which often follows a disproportionately low participation in decision-making processes. This is a barrier that we must overcome with a policy of services that, via the new common agricultural policy (CAP), will facilitate the processes of development and activity in the rural fabric of many areas. I am thinking in particular of training, consulting and business creation initiatives, which in the framework of the second pillar of the CAP, could still be developed and which would represent the turning point for a significant improvement in living conditions for women, as well as men, in rural areas. I consider this to be a fairly strategic requirement, not least when it comes to achieving the EU 2020 Strategy objectives, with particular reference to initiatives aimed at stimulating innovation, research and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need a heavily financed European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to be able to narrow the disparities between rural and urban areas. Investment in modernising the basic physical infrastructure must remain an essential aspect of this fund. Furthermore, additional references would have been helpful to the ageing of the rural population and the importance of the programmes aimed at the early retirement of farmers and setting up young farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our experience in recent decades has proven that the growing involvement of women and their knowledge, experience and professionalism is a key factor in the development of all branches of the economy. For this and other reasons, I believe that one of the fundamental objectives of the common agricultural policy should be to make rural areas more attractive, paying particular attention to the needs and role of women. We should make every effort to help women to achieve their goals, and also to combine a career with family life. In order to achieve this, we need guaranteed access in rural areas to services in the broad sense of the word and to infrastructure, and also training and personal development opportunities. It is essential to take measures to support entrepreneurialism among women and to combat all manifestations of gender-based discrimination. We should also focus on ensuring greater political and financial support, for example by means of easier access to investment and loans. I am sure that all these measures will ensure that women’s potential for the development of agriculture, and of local communities and entire regions, is put to ever better use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, we must make every effort to ensure the establishment of an effectively functioning social protection system, which would make it possible to take early retirement and receive maternity pay. In order to create a favourable environment to promote entrepreneurship, all rural areas must have the most up-to-date IT infrastructure. Adequate broadband access is one of the main factors behind the growth in the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas. Furthermore, we must make every effort to ensure that rural communities are preserved and opportunities are created to reconcile family and working life. Consequently, there is a need to ensure that people living in rural areas receive a high standard of health care, education, child care and other services intended to meet daily needs and which would create more favourable living conditions and would reduce social exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States using money from the Structural Funds must establish and implement initiatives which would promote the participation of women in the labour market, reduce social inequality and address issues related to transport infrastructure.

It is important to recognise that rural areas are particularly affected by population ageing, low population density and, in some areas, depopulation, for which reason the common agricultural policy (CAP) should be oriented toward responding to these challenges. It is a fact that, historically, women’s work in agriculture has been systematically undervalued, and frequently unpaid or paid at a lower rate than equivalent work carried out by men. It is therefore important that this be taken into consideration as part of this topic, and that, above all, equal working conditions be established for equal work.

That was the choice made today by the European Parliament which, in adopting Mrs Jeggle’s report, has highlighted the important role that women will play in the future enhancement of rural areas. As the rapporteur very appropriately wrote in her explanatory statement: ‘Experience shows that, in rural areas most particularly, quality of life and economic strength are linked to the presence of women and their involvement in a wide range of activities.’ Here we have a simple and modern way of re-thinking the agricultural profession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware that many of us would like women of every age to remain in the countryside, or we believe that we need to encourage them to move there to ensure the future of rural areas and agriculture in Europe. However, in order to facilitate this, we have to improve women’s access to education and training in the agricultural sector and allow them to gain better access to direct payments. On the other hand, we must ensure they have access to decent pensions and social insurance.</p>
<p class="contents">In Romania, for example, some women living in the countryside are not eligible for farmer pensions and find it very difficult to start a business in the agricultural sector. This is why it is paramount that we focus more attention on women working on family or subsistence farms and guarantee them both a decent living and adequate pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I am in favour of solutions aimed at increasing levels of employment among women in rural areas. In Poland there are more women who are unemployed than men, particularly in rural areas. A large percentage of those without work in rural areas are women under the age of 34. In the majority of cases these are educated women, who cannot find work appropriate to their qualifications. This is a particularly dangerous trend, since it is young people who should be given greater opportunities to gain a foothold in the labour market. In the long term, this results in the feminisation of unemployment in rural areas, and thus in higher levels of poverty among young women. Many of them decide to move to towns to look for work, which in turn leads to an ageing of the rural population, a drop in the natural growth rate and a general deterioration of living conditions for residents of rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this, I support the proposal whereby provision should be made in the new EAFRD regulation for special funding aimed at supporting women in the future 2014-2020 programming period. This may have a positive effect on levels of employment among women in rural areas. I am also in favour of ensuring appropriate benefits for women living in rural areas, within the framework of social security systems. These benefits must take into account the fact that women have less earning power and that this affects their pension entitlements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The role of women in rural areas is also changing. What is now needed, in order to ensure that women remain in rural areas, or to encourage them to choose a rural lifestyle, is to take greater account of their needs and make sure that these needs are reflected in our support policy. We should ensure that women are more visible in rural areas, particular in the economic and financial spheres, and we should make instruments available to achieve these tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that it is still women who take care of young children and sick and elderly people, giving up work to do so, we should make it possible for them to achieve a balance between family life and professional life. This is possible by means of infrastructure development, for example, by building nurseries and developing various educational and cultural options. The key to achieving these aims will be to include women of all generations in decision-making processes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also of the utmost importance to improve access to medical services and cancer screening programmes for women. Furthermore, it is still worth supporting and developing agritourism as a low-risk form of economic activity which fosters job creation and work-life balance, and promoting electronic forms of entrepreneurship, such as <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce, which make it possible to be economically active regardless of how far you are from urban centres. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very important document for Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia as they decommission nuclear power plants. There is concern that key waste infrastructure management projects have experienced delays in Lithuania and this is preventing it from absorbing EU funds in a timely and efficient manner. It is noted that considerable financing is still required for decommissioning and that national funds are not sufficient to cover this: the State Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant Decommissioning Fund has so far accumulated just over EUR 100 million (while the technical costs of decommissioning alone range from EUR 987 million to EUR 1 300 million). The European Parliament therefore calls on the EU Member States to take appropriate measures in this respect. The decommissioning of nuclear power plants is a very complicated process. Countries do not have sufficient experience to be able to anticipate all the work involved and carry it out efficiently. The European Parliament is adopting this resolution at the right time, thus encouraging Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and all EU Member States to implement decommissioning work as efficiently as possible. This is very important work which will continue to receive much attention from the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When they joined the European Union, Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria made commitments that were politically and economically complex to decommission nuclear power plants, and the European Union made a commitment to allocate the financial assistance required for the decommissioning work, the construction of nuclear waste repositories, the storage of such waste and the development of energy projects. I believe that the concept of European Union solidarity can contribute effectively to mitigating the negative economic consequences of early closure in the energy sector, but many important issues remain unresolved. The issue of awards is not entirely clear, because it is now known that current funding will be insufficient to carry out the decommissioning work in a timely and proper manner. There is a danger that decommissioning the nuclear power plants will be delayed through lack of financial resources and this may pose a threat to the environment and human health. Detailed decommissioning plans have yet to be finalised, and, as a consequence, that there is insufficient information on the timetables, the costs of particular projects, and their sources of funding. I agree that the European Commission must play a greater coordinating role with these three Member States, in order to reach an agreement on the submission of detailed plans, the completion of work on schedule and the volume of funding. The Commission must also study ways of altering the EU’s methods of financing decommissioning operations in view of the strategies employed in the Member States and their national administrative structures, and simplifying the rules on management of the funds in such a way that they do not affect the safety and security of the decommissioning operations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard, the experience which has been accumulated must be used effectively and the model based on projects prepared and funded previously must be used in order to achieve a reduction in costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I fully support the point of view expressed in this resolution as I think that we need to monitor the way in which these funds are spent so as to ensure that they make an effective contribution to guaranteeing the safety of the decommissioning process. Unfortunately, the strategies have been lacking in clarity, which has also resulted in a lack of any ceilings for the European Union’s funding of the decommissioning activities. In future, such a way of working should be avoided, with the need for a comprehensive plan to be devised to cover all the actions which will be eligible for funding.

The Commission should report on the results of the reassessment of the project timeline. A large portion of the funds was allocated to energy projects, but considerable financing is still required for decommissioning and national funds are not sufficient to cover this: the State Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant Decommissioning Fund has failed to accumulate sufficient funds. The technical costs of decommissioning alone range from EUR 987 million to EUR 1 300 million. The EU Member States must take appropriate measures in this respect. Furthermore, as far as nuclear safety is concerned, we must discuss the new nuclear power plants with nuclear reactors that are planned on the EU’s borders, in Russia and Belarus.

Thanks to the release of very substantial appropriations, which will total EUR 2 848 million by the end of 2013, it has been possible to shut down all of those plants and to ensure a partial conversion to other energy sources in those Member States. However, a number of the commitments made do not seem to have been honoured, and one is entitled to wonder about the use of the allocated funds. That is why I voted in favour of this European Parliament resolution. Highlighting the almost non-existent progress in decommissioning, despite this being the main reason for the programme, the resolution calls on the Commission to implement this assistance more effectively, by producing an annual progress report, for example. To this end, the Commission could build on the audit currently being carried out by the European Court of Auditors. It should also put together a team of coordinators and experts to cover all three projects, which, curiously enough, it has still not done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Above all, we must strive to ensure that all decommissioning work is carried out in time while properly implementing all the necessary safety measures and eliminating even minimal risks to human health and the environment. If we are committed to decommissioning Ignalina and other nuclear power plants, all financial resources allocated to this process must be used as intended following the principle of transparency and efficiency. National authorities must finalise detailed decommissioning plans as a matter of urgency. I believe that the results of the audit carried out by the European Court of Auditors will reveal the objectives of the use of the funds and their effectiveness. We must make every effort to ensure that dismantling activities and management of decommissioning waste will have started by 2013. I believe that it is advisable to require the Commission to present the European Parliament with a detailed financing plan and identify responsibility for the use of European Union assistance. Given the fact that state funds for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants have not accumulated a sufficient amount, it would be advisable for the strategies and plans drawn up to include new actions and provide for additional EU funds accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The safety of energy supply is one of the fundamental priorities in the EU’s energy strategy. According to current forecasts, the delays experienced by the programmes to date will not prevent the start of the processes of dismantlement and management of nuclear waste nor will it affect works to be carried out by power station personnel by 2013.

It is very important for these discussions to take place – many Lithuanians remember the Chernobyl tragedy only too well. The closure of Lithuania’s Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant was one of the conditions for EU membership, but this has been very painful. The EU provided Lithuania with EUR 837 million of assistance to eliminate the consequences of the closure of the nuclear power plant over the period 2007-2013. However, it is not enough to simply receive the financing from the EU allocated for the closure of the reactor. Safe decommissioning is a long road and the EU must support Lithuania at every step of the way. This should include comprehensive support – the management of radioactive waste and dangerous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur states, comprehensive EU support is important for reducing the economic and social consequences of the closure of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. The closure of the nuclear power plant made many Lithuanians redundant and damaged our economy. The EU must provide more assistance for projects in the energy sector in order to mitigate the economic consequences of the closure of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. This might include promoting the renewal of measures to increase energy output and energy efficiency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EGF was created as a separate specific instrument with its own targets and deadlines, and it therefore deserves its own dedicated resources, thus avoiding transfers from other budget items, which happened in the past and which might frustrate the achievement of various political objectives. In my opinion, the EGF has proved its worth, and my only concern is that the new Member States have not made greater use of it. The impression may ultimately arise that the aim of the EGF is for the old Member States to get the EU budgetary resources they were formerly used to within the framework of, for example, the cohesion policy. In my opinion, the first Czech request in history for a grant from the EGF is the first swallow, after which others will follow, because Czech industry too has been hit by globalisation and the worldwide financial crisis, and Czech workers who have been laid off deserve European assistance in their efforts to succeed in a challenging labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The scope of the EGF was broadened for applications submitted from 1 May 2009 to include support for workers made redundant as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis. The Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 allows the mobilisation of the EGF within the annual ceiling of EUR 500 million. On 24 March 2010, the Czech Republic submitted an application to mobilise the EGF in respect of cases concerning 634 redundancies (all targeted for assistance) in the enterprise Unilever ČR, spol.sr.o, operating in the retail sector (food products), and supplemented it by additional information up to 20 September 2010. This application complies with the requirements for determining the financial contributions. The Commission, therefore, proposes to mobilise an amount of EUR 323 820.

<p class="contents">Today, the European Parliament has taken this hypocrisy even further by allocating a proportion of this fund to Unilever, which has just closed its Czech Republic factories and made over 600 people redundant, while its net profits have risen by 26% to EUR°4.6°billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore voted against this report, which raises a more general issue than that of the Unilever case. How can national and European public bodies, given the employment crisis we are facing, continue to use public money to subsidise multinational companies which lay off employees despite being in profit, and which are therefore putting their shareholders’ interests before their employees’? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For 15 years the EU has been tightening control of the export of dual-use goods, relying on preventive measures such as the imposition of export licensing requirements and customs registration procedures. However, given constant technological changes and new threats, it is necessary to regularly update lists of controlled dual-use items that reflect those of the main international export control regimes. The main task of these international export control regimes is to update the lists of goods to be controlled. To date, these lists have been quasi-automatically transposed into EU legislation without any participation by the European Parliament, but with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament’s approval is now required.

<p class="contents">Export controls have a high impact on the EU’s trade policy as they can affect more than 10% of all EU exports. The main EU export control tool is the Dual-use Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009, which entered into force on 27 August 2009. This new Regulation introduced a number of significant changes to the scope of dual-use export controls in the European Union. These include the introduction of controls on brokering activities and transit with regard to dual-use items. The Dual-use Regulation includes regularly updated lists of controlled dual-use items that reflect those of the main international export control regimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, I would also like to emphasise the role of the relevant monitoring bodies, for example customs authorities, which shoulder considerable responsibility for the direct monitoring of exports or transit of dual-use goods. In my opinion, we should also assist these bodies, for example in the area of access to modern monitoring equipment, the acquisition of new expertise in the performance of monitoring procedures and, last but not least, through support for professional training and work exchange visits.

The European Parliament’s position carries the achievements of the Treaty of Lisbon into EU legislation, and rightly so. Parliament also reinforces democratic control and transparency and raises the profile of the EU in relation to international export control regimes. It is also positive that the Commission is obliged to produce reports on the functioning of the Regulation, together with a comprehensive impact assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the trickiest bone of contention between the Council, Parliament and the Commission in all this remains the question of when the control of notification and registration of the export takes place, whether before or after the actual export. As far as I am concerned, it is crucial that this control should take place before the export is effected. This is because, in practice, ex-post control will always result in us having to hunt around for the facts after the event. Parliament has just decided to opt for ex-post controls. In the end, I therefore voted against the final version of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Export credits are an important instrument for supporting EU enterprises.

Export credits can help to create jobs by securing financing for projects which otherwise would have more restricted access to capital due to their non-market character. Nevertheless, it should be observed that currently there is insufficient transparency to find out what export credit agencies (ECAs) finance or have financed in the past. The lack of transparency leads to huge cost and time overruns, and it also facilitates bribery and corruption.

The collective magnitude of the export credit guarantees provided in the period 2004-2009 by the ECAs of the EU Member States alone was in the range of EUR 468 billion. ECAs facilitate legitimate trade where the private capital market fails. They have a much higher risk-absorbing capacity than private actors, since they do not have to pay taxes and make profit, and hence have more lee-way to break even on an extended credit than private banks. However, for the same reason ECAs are also potentially a massive distortion of trade, if their financing operations are not disciplined by common rules. Although ECAs are an important instrument to support trade and investments of European companies, it is necessary to ensure that their operations are financially sound, and they do not need to turn to the tax payer for re-financing their operations. I agreed with the report and the requirement to submit annual reports to the European Commission and the European Parliament, because currently there is very little data showing what ECAs finance or have financed in the past, and some national ECAs do not even report the overall balance of their annual operations regularly, which violates the principles of transparency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Direct foreign investment in our businesses, furthermore, represents a source of development for third countries in which work is created and it is certainly worthwhile encouraging these links through export credit agencies.

Some national ECAs do not even report the overall balance of their annual operations regularly. Many others do not report disaggregated data of their sectoral lending or the geographical distribution. This is in spite of transparency requirements in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Arrangement of 2005, which all EU Member States adhere to, and which shall now be transferred into EU law. The OECD Arrangement does not contain the requirements needed to guarantee the fair pricing of premiums since it entails no disciplines with regard to transparency and minimum standards in the application of social and environmental risk calculations. There are proposals to tidy up transparency requirements on risk calculations, disclose off-balance sheet vehicles, make the notification of social and environmental risk calculations mandatory and to establish a requirement for the EU Member States to annually report to the Commission on the activities of their ECAs in these regards. I therefore voted in favour of this document, because it will introduce more transparency and standards in the application of social and environmental risk calculations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Because the risk assessment criteria for public export credit agencies are quite different from those when the loan comes from a private bank, competition can be distorted in international trade, as the Chinese example illustrates. That is why a whole host of regulations exist, such as OECD and WTO agreements, which fix the deadlines for repayment and a minimum premium rate. For the purposes of evaluation and in order to prevent abuse and to avoid refinancing from taxpayers’ money, specifications are required for greater transparency through an EU-wide obligation to publish annual reports, etc. It is open to question whether the proposed measures will bring about greater transparency.

Violence against women is an international as well as a European problem. Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for several decades, the international community has not managed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of criminality. It is therefore very important to make every effort at EU level to reduce violence against women as much as possible and create the conditions to prevent it, to prosecute criminals and protect victims. To achieve these objectives it is necessary to harmonise criminal law at EU level, and put in place a legal framework, under which offenders would be effectively punished and victims protected. This is also very important for combating trafficking in human beings. Forced marriage is another form of gender-based violence, which constitutes a serious violation of the individual’s right to freedom and self-determination. It is important for young women to be protected against such forced relationships. Honour-related violence is a key concept in this context. In order to stop all forms of violence against women, it is necessary to disseminate information on gender equality, and to actively inform society, particularly those layers where relations between women and men are based on traditions and rituals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I support the commitment taken by the Commission to present in 2011-2012, the ‘Communication on a strategy to combat violence against women, domestic violence and female genital mutilation’, to be followed up by an EU action plan, but I also hope we will see the adoption of a comprehensive policy approach, comprised of legal, judicial, executive and health actions, which can effectively reduce this kind of violence and the consequences which it unfortunately has on the 26% of children and young people who report having experienced physical violence in childhood. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The truth is that they are linked to the massive presence of immigrants who bring to Europe a fundamentalist conception of religion, Islam, and while today it is women in these communities who are paying the price, tomorrow it could affect our women and the very core of western society.

I would like to draw attention to the fact that one in ten women in Europe has experienced violence and it is one of the most frequent causes of violent death among women. Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate for several decades, it pains me to see that we are still unable to protect women from violence. It is therefore very important for the European Commission to draw up a single directive on all forms of violence against women – physical, sexual or psychological – and on combating it. Gender-based violence covers sexual abuse, human trafficking, forced marriage, genital mutilation and other forms of violations. Such violent crimes have a major impact on and do irreparable damage to a woman’s physical and mental health, and therefore the Member States should ensure better healthcare for the victims of violence. Furthermore, I would like to urge the Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilią Malmström not to reduce the financial assistance allocated to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) combating violence against women. Even more acts of violence are taking place during the economic and financial crisis, therefore under no circumstances can we reduce financing in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The National Crime Council in 2005 found that one in seven women in Ireland experienced severe abusive behaviour of a physical, sexual or emotional nature from a partner at some times in their lives. The impact of domestic and physical and/or sexual violence should not be underestimated, as it results in severe damage to individuals’ physical and mental health giving rise to severe depression and even suicide. However Parliament’s report also shows the cost to the exchequer as it is estimated that the cost to society of gender-based violence – in the form of spending on healthcare, the legal system and social services – is EUR 2 million per hour in total in all EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009, I had the privilege in becoming the first ambassador of Rape Crisis North East based in Dundalk. This support and counselling service is one of many across Ireland East. These NGOs offer vital support for victims of sexual and domestic violence, yet have to cope with a very difficult funding environment. I hope this report helps fight domestic violence in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union stipulates that the EU shall make efforts to combat all kinds of domestic violence, and the Member States should take all necessary measures to punish these criminal acts and to protect the victims.

<p class="contents">We know that violence against women represents a serious violation of human rights and freedoms, both individually and collectively, with enormous social consequences, given that violence against women involves a wide range of human rights violations, including domestic violence, sexual violence, prostitution, the trafficking of women, sexual and psychological harassment, and violence against women in their places of work.</p>
<p class="contents">The prevention and eradication of violence against women are essential strategic objectives important to the progress for which our civilisation is striving.</p>
<p class="contents">Some studies on gender-based violence estimate that between a fifth and a quarter of Europe’s female population have been victims of acts of physical violence at least once during their adult lives, and around one tenth of them have suffered sexual violence. It is also believed that around 26% of children and young people report cases of physical violence during childhood and adolescence, which is particularly worrying if we take into account premises based on social learning…</p>

Moreover, and importantly, I voted for the introduction of a mechanism to facilitate access to free legal aid, and for urgent psychological aid services to be provided free of charge for victims.

It is a problem for the whole of society, and one which contributes to its widespread disintegration. The total costs are underestimated in this respect.</p>

Violence against women, whether physical, psychological or sexual is an expression of incivility which Europe must repudiate. It is a plague which leads to traumas which have repercussions of inestimable influence on the lives of women in society. Statistics currently available portray a sad and distressing reality.

Gender-based violence is always primarily a criminal matter. Society must therefore respond with punishment which is proportional to the seriousness of the crime. In setting priorities for the allocation of society’s resources, it is important to have a clear victim’s perspective, since it is this group which currently needs special protective measures. This does not exclude devoting resources to individual offenders by, for example, offering conversation therapy and other methods to counteract violent behaviour. This form of alternative treatment for men who have committed serious assaults on women, however, should never replace the penalty imposed by criminal law. Conversation therapy and other such forms of treatment can only supplement other forms of punishment, such as prison.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence is in large measure a consequence of unequal power relations between men and women, and is an expression of a domination/subordination relationship between the perpetrator and victim for these crimes, therefore, conversation therapy in which both victim and perpetrator take part must be regarded as out of the question since the crime is of such a nature that the two can never be equivalent and equal negotiating parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The apathy and pseudo-morality found in society should give us pause for thought. The early stages of actual violence, such as intrusiveness, obscene remarks and harassment meted out by many migrants to western women on a daily basis are increasingly regarded as normal. The disregard for women has reached peak levels when a German judge refers to the husband’s right to use corporal punishment anchored in the Koran as a decisive factor in her judgment on a Muslim divorce case.</p>
<p class="contents">By permitting migration, the EU has imported problems from every conceivable quarter, including honour killings, forced marriages and domestic violence in patriarchal family structures. Culture, religion and tradition should not be used to justify acts of violence.

The oppression of women, after all, is an intrinsic part of Islam.</p>
<p class="contents">The PVV wants to see violence against women tackled, but is voting against this report because it fails to mention the motives and the background of the perpetrators. By failing to explicitly mention Islam as a cause of violence, we are missing a great opportunity to tackle this specific form of violence against women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As there is no international definition of gender-based violence, the data is quite disparate, and does not give an indication of the real scale of the problem. Some studies estimate that between a fifth and a quarter of the female population of Europe have been the victim of acts of physical violence at least once during their adult lives. The forms and methods of violence used against women are many. Its historical and structural dimension means that measures taken need to be at European and international level. There is therefore a need to intervene in all areas of public life, in order to raise awareness and consciousness, using the six ‘Ps’: policy, prevention, protection, prosecution, provision and partnership. I voted in favour of this own-initiative report, as I believe that any type of violence should be subject to social and legal penalties.</p>
<p class="contents">European legislation, in the form of a directive, based on education, the effective protection of victims, cooperation with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and the implementation of a European Year of Combating Violence Against Women, is an example of measures for combating this social scourge, which has harmful consequences for European society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with my friend and colleague Mrs Svensson when she states that women are victims of gender-based violence; however we must not view women, including those who are victims of this kind of violence, simply as victims. The role of institutions is to help them rebuild their self-esteem and build a new and better life for themselves and their children. We should also focus on the causes of this type of violence, starting with an examination of the gender stereotypes of which both women and men are victims, even from a very young age.</p>

Violence against women is found at all levels of society and is not specific to any particular culture, level of education, age or income. Women are at greatest risk in their own homes – domestic violence is the most common cause of injury to women, more common than traffic accidents and cancer put together. The victims suffer an extreme negative impact on their health, self-esteem and safety and can no longer participate in public life or in the labour market as they would wish. The perpetrators of such violence cause life-long suffering to these women and their children, as well as representing a social problem because the follow-up costs in the areas of health and justice amount to several billion euros. Accordingly, the perpetrators need to be held responsible for their actions and should be subjected to public prosecutions.

Mr Oettinger, it is nice to see you. Mr Oettinger, a well-schooled disciple of Mrs Merkel, is now also opposed to nuclear power. He was a supporter of atomic energy, but Fukushima has been a road to Damascus for him and, like a latter-day Saul, he, along with several others, has seen a bright light in the sky. At least he has revealed that, in his opinion, there were a couple of nuclear power plants that would not pass the stress tests. I found this very interesting.</p>
<p class="contents">If you suspect, Mr Oettinger, that there are stress tests that will not produce the desired result because the systems to be tested may not survive the test, then why does the Commission not intervene straight away to close these plants? If the stress tests are anything like what happened with the banks, namely that we realise after the event firstly that the stress tests were not clear enough and secondly that the results did not reflect the actual situation, then the issue of nuclear power would be far more dangerous than the banks.</p>

<p class="contents">Mr Schulz, I believe it was important that the European Council, after intense discussions, agreed on the role of the Commission. I can tell you that the beginning of the discussions was just about the coordination of national regulators and, after I insisted, the Commission was asked to come up with scopes and modalities and also given the task of presenting, before the end of the year, a full report on the findings.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to do this for all the nuclear sites in Europe. We are going to do this in full transparency. It is important to acknowledge that fact. I believe this is progress in terms of nuclear safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Harms, you have raised a very important issue. First of all, the emergency measures adopted on 25 March, as regards the import of feed and food from Japan, ensure the safety of the EU consumer and a harmonised enforcement approach across the whole European Union. We believe these measures are proportionate to the risk and they have a wider scope than the measures applied in other major parts of the world like the United States and Canada. To the best of my knowledge, based on the scientific expertise I receive, we believe that these matters and this approach are safe.</p>
<p class="contents">Customs ensures that food and feed items can only enter the European Union market if there is assurance that they are safe for consumption. Under the present arrangement, the Japanese authorities themselves – and it is true what Mrs Harms said – enforce even stricter requirements on food products for domestic consumption and exports.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the stricter levels that are being imposed in Japan we, the Commission, have decided that it would be correct to amend the present levels in force since 25 March as an additional safeguard measure pending further scientific analysis of the levels established under Euratom Regulation 3954/87. This analysis will be carried out by the Commission, together with appropriate scientific experts, before 30 June so as to arrive at standards that can be applied to imports on a uniform basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to underline here that all the checks carried out up to now, by Member States, of Japanese food imports demonstrate negligible levels of radioactivity, which are significantly below current European or Japanese standards. Let me inform you that the Commission will propose to the standing committee on the food chain next Friday a revision of our norms to align these with the Japanese norms. These will then enter into force as of next week. I should emphasise again that this is a purely precautionary measure, which allows initiating the necessary scientific assessments of current permitted levels throughout the world, so that the European Union can demonstrate it is once again applying the highest standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot take decisions solely on the basis of personal opinions. We have a regulation that was established after Chernobyl. It was based on the best scientific evidence. Japan is in an extremely sensitive position with regard to food security, and there are many reasons for this. It has a different threshold to the one we have in Europe. So precisely because of these differing standards between Europe and Japan, we have decided that on a transitional basis we are going to implement the standards of Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">The levels permitted are lower, which means that their standards are higher. We are going to implement this for Japan. In the meantime we are going to consult the committee of experts at national level and at European level so that we can, if appropriate, establish common uniform rules for all imports. I believe this is the best, most proportionate, scientific-based approach. I do not think any other approach would be advisable at this time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Help me. What is the EU’s policy on Libya? I got a letter on 1 April from the noble Baroness Ashton telling me that the EU had provided more than EUR 75 million in humanitarian assistance and that, although the situation remains uncertain, the EU has offered to assist in fostering dialogue. Yet she wrote this many days after the bombing had begun. That is what she has been saying.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we have got hard man Herman Van Rompuy, who has made it clear that regime change is the aim of this Libyan adventure. He also said that the action in Libya could not have happened without the European Union, and that France and Germany could not have taken military action without first getting the support of the European Council. So we have two big chiefs within the European Union directly contradicting each other. Could you please shed some light on the matter, and tell us what is the European Union’s policy on Gaddafi and Libya? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Japan is faced with an intensive task of restoring its devastated territories, which will require significant resources, including inward investment. That is why the European Union must open negotiations on a free trade agreement with Japan.

With regard to the question of finding funds for finance, just this morning, during the debate, I said that we, the European Commission, are going to table proposals for this in the next financial perspectives that we are calling ‘EU project bonds’: that is, bonds for investing in certain projects, structural projects, such as projects for European networks, which will definitely include energy. I would hope, Mrs Ferreira, that you will support these proposals, and would also like the support of the various governments. This issue is one we all need to get behind. The very lack of resources in many of our Member States because of cuts in investment budgets means the European Union must not give up investing in growth in Europe on this scale.

I welcome the fact that you are going to adjust the European maximum levels in line with Japan’s levels, because at the time of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 297/2011, we realised that the levels proposed by the Commission were far too high. I welcome this therefore, and would like to see it incorporated into this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns imports of food products from Japan. There is a fundamental issue here. Are we going to be obliged to have contaminated food, although the contamination is below the maximum levels, in order to support the Japanese economy? I am sure you have children. I think to myself, am I going to give my children milk containing 500 Bq of iodine when there is an alternative milk with 0 Bq of iodine? I wonder if the Commission should perhaps consider blocking food and feed imported from Japan because it may be contaminated and instead help and support the Japanese people themselves, either financially or with uncontaminated foodstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have an appeal to make to you Mr Barroso. I have been approached by Areva, who have travelled to Japan where their equipment had been blocked and is in storage at the airport.

But first, as regards the amount of food and feed imported, it is really marginal. The European Union imports feed and food with a total value of EUR 216 million from Japan, which represents around 0.4% in value and less than 0.1% in volume of total feed and food imports into the European Union. For the Japanese economy it also represents very little. I could give you a list of the products imported, but I have only one minute so I cannot do so on this occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second issue, concerning why there are different values, those values were established after Chernobyl. They were based on that scientific evidence, and that is why we believe they are sound. Nevertheless, we have now had another tragedy, far away in Japan. As I mentioned, Japan has very high food safety standards. To avoid a contradiction between their standards and our standards, we have decided – as I announced today – on some kind of harmonisation, at least with Japan, while we are reviewing scientifically the global standards we can implement for any kind of imports to the European Union. This explains why there are differences; but they are, I believe, transitional differences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU framework comes at a moment when the situation of Roma has become a real focus of attention in Europe. The EU has made available to the Member States a range of legal, policy and financial instruments to address the situation of the Roma. We also have a whole legal framework based on non-discrimination, free movement of people and the enlargement strategy. However it is very clear that the economic and social marginalisation of the Roma persists, and this is neither acceptable nor sustainable in the European Union of the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, with support from across the whole political spectrum – and I would like to underline this – has drawn attention to the urgency of promoting the integration of Roma, through its recently adopted resolution on the EU Roma strategy. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Járóka, for her excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">Determined action is needed, both at national and at European level. We need to join forces and step up our efforts to end discrimination against Roma and make sure they enjoy the same rights as any other European citizens, because that is what they are. When I say that, I of course have in mind a two-way process which requires a change in the mindset of the majority of our European citizens and of members of the Roma communities.</p>
<p class="contents">We all agree that there is a need for effective policy planning and implementation as well as for a strategic common approach. We all know that the primary responsibility for the integration of Roma lies with the Member States. We also acknowledge that the situation of the Roma varies greatly from one Member State to another. That is why the Commission decided to present an EU framework to enable the Member States to take action commensurate with the challenge they have to overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">The Roma task force which was set up in September last year, and reported in December, showed clearly that, very often, not enough is being done. The EUR 26.5 billion which are available under the Structural Funds are not being utilised as they should be. Only EUR 100 million of this money was earmarked for specific Roma activities, while 70% of the means for technical assistance, which would have been necessary in most Member States, was simply not used. So the measures in place so far are not adequate. It is now time to ensure that national, regional and local policies focus on Roma needs in a clear and specific way.</p>
<p class="contents">In our framework we concentrate on four main issues: education, employment, health and housing. We want the EU and the 27 Member States to commit themselves to closing the gaps and to concentrate on the common goals in those four areas with targeted actions and sufficient funds to deliver them. We want all Member States to build these goals into their existing Roma strategy, if they have one, or to develop a Roma strategy if they do not have one, for the period up to 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to check whether these efforts achieve their objectives, we need regular monitoring. Therefore the EU framework lays the foundations for a robust monitoring mechanism to ensure concrete results for the Roma. This monitoring mechanism will ensure that the national Roma strategies are implemented, that money intended for Roma integration reaches its final beneficiaries, and that there is progress towards achieving the Roma integration goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will report annually on progress made towards integrating the Roma population in the Member States. The EU framework provides an opportunity for all stakeholders, at all levels, to join forces with the EU population in general and the Roma population in particular in order to put an end to the exclusion of more than 10 million European citizens, which we can no longer afford for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Andor, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, Honourable Members, the socio-economic situation of Roma is at the top of the EU agenda. Last month this House adopted the Járóka Report on an EU strategy on Roma inclusion. And today, the Commission adopted a Communication on an EU Framework for national Roma integration strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Both documents make significant contributions to the wider debate on Roma, and will feed into the conclusions to be adopted at the next Council meeting of Employment and Social Affairs Ministers on 19 May, which will be exclusively devoted to the integration of Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">Those documents articulate the EU’s political determination to address the situation of millions of Roma who are suffering from economic and social exclusion. I would like to make three key points here.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission has set out an EU framework for national Roma integration strategies. It acknowledges the Member States’ prime responsibility for designing and implementing Roma integration strategies. It also reaffirms the Commission’s deep conviction that the European Union cannot tolerate any form of racism, xenophobia, discrimination or social exclusion of Roma. The Union has a moral and political obligation to support the Member States in their efforts with all the policies and instruments at its disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as you know, the Union has agreed on a comprehensive strategy for developing the European economic and social model in a balanced way. The Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth is the right policy context for addressing the multifaceted problems facing Roma. We must harness Europe 2020’s objectives, targets, flagship initiatives and reporting structures for the cause of the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">The key message is that excluding millions of EU citizens from economic and social life is not smart, is not sustainable and is certainly not inclusive. In short, there is no excuse for Roma exclusion to continue in the Europe we want to live in.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Europe 2020 headline targets for employment, poverty reduction and education are key benchmarks for measuring progress in Roma integration policies. The Commission’s Communication on Roma identifies four areas that are of strategic importance to overcome Roma exclusion. These are as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to employment: the big gap between Roma and non-Roma employment rates has to be addressed. We will not achieve our Europe 2020 targets if we do not do it.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to education: all Roma children should have access to quality education and not face discrimination or segregation. As a minimum, all Roma children should complete primary school.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to healthcare: reducing the gap in health between Roma and non-Roma. Member States should provide access to quality healthcare under the same conditions as for the rest of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Access to housing and essential services: where the situation of the Roma people is indeed much worse than that of the rest of the population, for example where access to water, electricity and other services are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of an integrated approach has a negative impact on the overall integration of Roma people in society and leaves them in poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Union must put its money where its mouth is. The Commission is currently drawing up a proposal for the multi-annual financial framework, which will be followed by specific proposals on the Structural Funds. To my mind, the Structural Funds need to be brought into line with the Europe 2020 Strategy. This applies to the policy areas for which I am responsible in general – employment and social inclusion – and it certainly applies to the socio-economic integration of Roma. Making our financial instruments more effective is a key objective for me.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stop at this point, so I can listen to your views and answer any questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation not only for the work done, but also for the personal dedication of Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Andor and all those who have cooperated on this truly significant achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">With the presentation of this strategic document, we have moved a giant step closer to the realisation of one of the chief priorities of the Hungarian Presidency. I am convinced that it will prove to be an important contribution to the improvement of the economic and social situation of the Roma in Europe, together with the recently adopted resolution of the European Parliament on an EU strategy for Roma inclusion based on the report by Lívia Járóka.</p>
<p class="contents">Extreme poverty, discrimination and marginalisation continue to affect large numbers of Roma throughout Europe, so it is high time for improvement. We cannot afford to say that it is their problem, and not ours. Moreover, people must never be considered as a problem, but rather as a chance, an opportunity. Given the current economic and demographic situation in Europe, the improvement of the economic and social status of the Roma can open up new human resources, thus contributing to economic growth in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hungarian Presidency has always believed that, besides the necessary fight against discrimination, a new policy mix is necessary, with three key elements: employment, education and housing. If followed up properly by the Member States, integrated policy action in these three fields, complemented by adequate monitoring as proposed by the Commission, will make a difference. The Member States will also have to make an effort to reach the goals of the EU 2020 Strategy. Measures for the social inclusion of the Roma can be mainstreamed in various policy fields. It is now widely recognised that measures inspired and coordinated at EU level can create synergy and added value.</p>
<p class="contents">What is next? The Hungarian Presidency intends to present and discuss the communication with the two Commissioners during the next Roma platform on 7 April in Budapest, to which I invite all who are interested. The Council will deal with it in a horizontal manner. Firstly, the April Justice and Home Affairs Council will discuss it on 12 April. Then it will be the turn of the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 9 May, with the adoption of Council conclusions. The Education Council will also receive the document, on 20 May, before the Hungarian Presidency presents its report on the results of the discussions to the General Affairs Council on 23 May.</p>
<p class="contents">The final moment of this itinerary will, hopefully, be an endorsement in the June European Council. It will, of course, just be a new beginning for coordinated action at EU and national level for helping this truly European minority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for this is that 8 April is International Roma Day. Incidentally, the fifth meeting of the European Roma Platform happens to take place on this very same day in Hungary. Through these we can take a significant new step towards a joint action plan that is EU-coordinated yet can take into account local characteristics. The European People’s Party has urged EU action on the issue of the Roma’s social integration for years. Moreover, we hope that the European Roma strategy can really get under way at the Summit of Heads of State or Government on 24 June.</p>
<p class="contents">By doing this, an answer can be given at European level to address the European Union’s most serious human rights problem. It is first and foremost the Member States’ responsibility to guarantee that basic human rights are enforced for their citizens. The European Union can provide only frameworks for this, but it is up to each Member State to give substance to these frameworks. The European Roma strategy can be a type of professional minimum. However, I firmly believe that a long-term action plan that spans parties and cycles will be prepared through this which can effectively remedy the poverty and social exclusion affecting the Roma. A few important points regarding the content of the strategy are that its target group is defined on an economic and not an ethnic basis; it fosters the enforcement of the full spectrum of human rights and strengthens the principle of equal opportunity; it takes into account the regional nature of exclusion, and alleviates the disadvantages concentrated in underdeveloped microregions.</p>
<p class="contents">For the strategy to succeed, the stakeholders, namely the EU institutions, the Member States, non-governmental organisations and Roma communities, need to make long-term, determined joint efforts. For precisely this reason, this issue must not be used to foment opposition or for party political attacks. Neither is collective labelling permissible. It is impermissible to juxtapose the collective guilt of the Roma and the collective responsibility of the majority, the oppressors. A solution to the Roma issue is a priority of the Hungarian EU Presidency. I hope that the European Council adopts the planned strategy in June. I ask for the support of the European Parliament in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Monika Flašíková Beňová, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – (SK)</span> Madam President, Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Andor, I would like to begin by congratulating you on the presentation. I am pleased that, after many repeated calls by Parliament, the Commission is today finally presenting this European framework strategy. In my opinion, it is also high time this happened, as the situation is starting to grow more serious. Many Roma in the Union are faced not only with undignified living conditions, but also increasing terror. Saturday's torch march against the Roma in Hungary is the latest evidence of this, and I would hereby like to call on the Hungarian Government to draw the conclusions from this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make some criticisms of the presented framework. The situation is urgent, but even so we cannot accept the Commission’s decision to draft the framework without public consultations with the parties involved. It is strange that, on the one hand, you emphasise in the framework itself the importance of cooperating with civil society, but in the actual drafting of this key document you have ignored both the Roma as well as voluntary organisations, international organisations and the like. Such a closed approach to the framework does not add to its legitimacy; rather the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I consider the actual content of the presented framework to be successful on the whole. The Commission has correctly defined the competences for solving this Europe-wide problem. However, the key competences continue to be at the Member State level. I consider it extremely important, however, for the EU to take on the task of coordinating national strategies and supervising them, with the aim of ensuring the quickest possible genuine integration of the Roma.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is also vital to mention the importance of monitoring the compliance of national strategies with the submitted framework, and monitoring the effectiveness of their implementation. However, the Commission’s position seems to me rather unambitious in this direction. The Commission should get tough, especially concerning its expectations of the Member States. The framework correctly defines four key areas for Roma integration: access to education, availability of employment, access to health care and the availability of decent housing and basic services. Together with members of our group, I have had the opportunity, during numerous visits to Roma communities all over Europe, to confirm that these really are the key areas where the Roma often face poor conditions. It should be emphasised, however, that similarly formulated objectives also appeared in the <span class="italic">Decade of Roma Inclusion</span> programme. It is now essential to ensure that they are fulfilled.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these four areas, I would like to add one more which is missing from the framework, and this is specifically the fight not only against discrimination, but also against verbal or physical expressions of racism.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to draw attention to the question of financing the inclusion measures. The Commission working group revealed at the end of last year that Member States have significant gaps in their use of EU funds. The Commission should therefore focus on three things: that the drawdown of funds is not excessively demanding administratively, that the Commission takes effective measures to ensure that the funds released really do fulfil their purpose, and that the use of funds for practices involving segregation is restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by thanking and congratulating you, Commissioner Reding and Commissioner Andor, once again, and now it is up to the Member States to proceed effectively with Roma inclusion on the basis of this at the national level.</p>

How do you stand on the fact that a Member State would also be liable to pay a penalty if the obligatory primary school attendance requirement is not met? Primary school attendance is mandatory in all countries. Thus, if Roma children fail to attend primary school, is the relevant country liable to penalties? Do you not think that the parents have some responsibility in ensuring that their children go to school? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When talking about Roma integration, we should not forget that we are talking about the most specific and, perhaps, the most complicated issue in Europe and the European Union. This is an issue which cannot be resolved through funding alone, anti-discrimination legislation alone or by launching education programmes alone. The solution to this problem can only lie in a combination of all these approaches and, actually, as part of a common political will.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the Union is dealing on its own, more than ever, with its 12 million Roma. Some still do not realise that these people are not simply just Bulgarian, Romanian or Slovak Roma, but are citizens of the European Union with identical rights and obligations, while also having limited prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation, as we can see, is fairly complicated. The greater the level of integration among the actions, initiatives and policies implemented by Member States and all the European institutions, the greater the success the European Union’s Roma integration strategy will enjoy.</p>
<p class="contents">Improvised and unilateral actions may even cause harm rather than good. This is where I should mention that in some Member States knowledge about the Roma is inadequate and, in some cases, even wrong. As a result, the Roma issue in Europe must be actively explored and its progress professionally monitored. Otherwise, there is a danger that, instead of defusing the ticking bomb, we will only move it from one location to another on the map of the Old Continent.</p>
<p class="contents">A huge effort to provide education to the Roma must be at the heart of our ambitious strategy. This means complete integration of their children into the education system, basic qualifications for young people and adult literacy provision.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim must be to increase steadily in the coming years the proportion of Roma who are trained for the labour market and have an enlightened attitude towards the institutions and the rule of law. This is the sole guarantee that in future the Roma’s life will cease to evolve, like it does now, as a wretched existence on quicksand which has needlessly swallowed up European taxpayers’ money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Between now and the end of the year, the Commission will assess these strategies and then in roughly one year’s time we will need to debate the issue again. Today, we are therefore in effect setting out a road map which should allow parliamentarians, public bodies and civil society to exercise ongoing, extreme vigilance in the very important areas you have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that the Commission communication takes on board some of the points we set out in the parliamentary report. I am talking for instance about the involvement of the Fundamental Rights Agency in the assessment of the strategies. I believe the Agency has proven its competence in this area. I am also talking about developing cooperation with the Council of Europe on training mediators from the Roma community. This is an important strategic factor for the success of the projects at all levels, as is the attention devoted to Roma who are nationals of third countries and the enlargement aspect, which is taken into consideration in this report. Lastly, I think that establishing common indicators to support the monitoring system is very much to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I must emphasise certain failings in this communication. I believe it is not sufficiently strong and insistent in its reference to the necessary participation of Roma at all levels, that is to say at the levels of preparing the projects, implementing the projects and evaluating them. The communication talks about information and consultation, but the involvement of the Roma community itself is vital. There is ample experience to prove this, because there have actually been good experiences in Europe as well. I find this a weakness in the communication.</p>
<p class="contents">A second weakness in the communication is that it deals with the issue of non-discrimination as a cross-cutting theme in each of the four areas. However, I think it is very important, or would have been very important, to have a special paragraph devoted to combating discrimination and violence and to access to justice for the Roma. This anti-discrimination, fundamental rights, access to justice component is not included as a specific component in its own right. I find this another weakness in the Commission document.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we also talked about the subject of mediators, a programme that was launched by the Council of Europe. It is good that it is mentioned in this communication. We could have mentioned, and you also could have mentioned the guidelines that have already been drawn up by the Council of Europe, so that we do not somehow end up with two strategies, or two types of framework for assessing the national strategies. I feel this would have been a plus in this communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that the Commission’s work is not yet finished, and that the task force should continue its work, in order to ensure that Member States are constantly aware of the pressure on them from the Commission, civil society and local bodies to actually implement these guidelines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main aim of the programme should be to achieve basic universal rights for all those people.</p>
<p class="contents">I fear, however, that once again this heavily burdened and complicated agenda, like previous programmes, may have to be cut back.

However, I hope that this new strategy marks a new era in the way the EU addresses the issue by firstly listening to the Roma people.</p>
<p class="contents">For too long programmes have been too complicated and have simply not reached the people who need help most. In nearly ten years little of substance has been achieved on the ground. I hope the Commission will now focus on how best to simplify the procedures for accessing EU funds and how to better monitor, assess and implement its programmes.

That is because the overall proposals that the Commission has placed on the table are far behind the many years of discussions with representatives of the Roma, some of which were held in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">For years, representatives of the Roma community, both with and without a framework strategy, have been pointing out the need for targeted measures and clear, specific requirements. We do not even have clear sanctions should this strategy not be adhered to. Although there have been some proposals in this direction, no actual sanctions exist, so that the system is more full of holes than a Swiss cheese.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy on the Roma must take account of all the significant areas. This is what was agreed. However, what does the Commission have to offer other than the four key points? There is no provision in the structures for the participation and inclusion of the Roma communities in all the decisions that relate to them. There are no structures for the specific implementation of targets. There is no gender perspective. Something that also really irritates me and that I believe to be a scandal is the fact that you are unwilling to undertake any explicit action to combat discrimination against the Roma community.</p>
<p class="contents">You complain that the EU structural funds for the Roma are not used. I would like to ask you quite openly: Is it not the case that discrimination against the Roma is also one of the reasons why the community has not made use of such EU funds to date? I think so.</p>

The creation of national contact points for Roma integration, simplification of funding procedures, the assessment of national plans by EU institutions and verification of progress on Roma integration in Member States are measures which will help improve the economic and social situation of the Roma population in Europe. Member States must scrutinise this strategy closely and set up as soon as possible an administrative body tasked with the strategy’s implementation and coordination with the other Member States. I hope that, from this summer, the Commission will take on the lead role in coordinating the strategy in terms of developments in key areas such as the promotion of civic education, vocational guidance and employment. I find it regrettable that the new strategy fails to make clear recommendations as to the types of programmes which will be developed and implemented for Roma in a similar manner in all Member States, with certain variations. I call on the Council and Member States to come up with such recommendations for types of programme which the Commission will handle centrally. Without such types of programmes, adapted to the nomadic nature of the Roma lifestyle, the European Union will never be able to make a full contribution to increasing the value added at EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The goals set up at EU level, covering four important areas for Roma integration – access to education, employment, healthcare and housing – will only be reached if there is a clear commitment from Member States. It is now crucial to step up a gear and ensure that national, regional and local integration policies target Roma in a clear and specific way and that explicit measures address the needs of the Roma to prevent and compensate for the disadvantages they face. The Member States should ensure that all Roma children have access to quality education and establish a concrete target for raising Roma employment rates within the context of Europe 2020, increasing the proportion of Roma households with access to water, sanitation and electricity, and promoting non-discriminatory access to housing, including social housing. The Member States should establish concrete targets with concrete timelines for raising the life expectancy of Roma, raising child vaccination rates to the level of the non-Roma population, and lowering infant and maternal mortality rates to the level of the non-Roma population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, these ambitions still need to be put into practice. One year on from the European Parliament’s adoption of an amendment to the ERDF Regulation aimed at investing in housing for marginalised communities, projects are having trouble getting off the ground. It is important that Member States should invest and should report back on their actions in areas such as employment, education, health and housing for Roma people, but also that the Commission should ensure that it is rigorously monitoring use of existing European programmes. Lastly, Roma people must seize this opportunity to take control of their own destiny, knowing that they can count on Europe’s support. A wait-and-see attitude and hollow words will only feed the extreme right and mistrust among communities. International Roma Day will be celebrated next Friday, 8 April. I hope that on 8 April 2012 we will be able to celebrate the progress that has been made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title19"></a><a name="creitem19"></a>

<p class="contents">This is a report that will enable Parliament’s 2012 budget to be an austerity budget, a containment budget, and a rigorous budget. In truth, we have effectively cut around EUR 49 million from the initial proposal. Regarding the position we have taken, which was voted on and supported by a broad majority here in the Chamber, we have gone further than we had committed ourselves to do. We had said that the update would be around the rate of inflation. We are a long way from the rate of inflation, which means that the 2012 budget will represent a reduction in real terms: a budget that will be below 20% under heading 5, which is where funds for the European institutions are posted. We have not achieved this objective and passed the 20% point for several years.</p>
<p class="contents">I also recall that the Conference of Presidents has set the objective for Parliament’s budget at 20-22%, with this year below that figure. However, as part of the implementation of the 2012 budget too, we will want savings using the principles of good management, economy, efficiency and effectiveness. We want all expenditure to be supported by documentary evidence, and we want all variable costs to be the subject of a cost-benefit analysis. In this way, we will also make additional savings during implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">The effort with regard to savings needs to be made by all institutions and provision made for the margin of heading 5, which includes the administrative costs of all institutions, to have a surplus of around EUR 380 million in 2012. We then propose that EUR 100 million intended for administrative costs be transferred to the area of youth. Why youth? Youth because it is the generation that has greatest difficulties in terms of access to jobs, with an unemployment rate that is double that of other generations. However, there are also additional reasons for and objectives of our choosing ‘youth’ as the priority for 2012. It already was in 2011, and ‘youth’ is also present in all five objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, which gives the next financial perspectives direction but which also gives direction to Mrs Balzani’s 2012 budget. Furthermore, with regard to school drop-out rates and education for the generation aged 30-34, 40% of that generation have university degrees, which makes two of the objectives exclusive. I hope that any amendments that go against this proposal will be rethought, as I believe that the priority ‘youth’ should be kept as a priority by this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I see it as a positive development that we have agreed in the basic guidelines that Parliament’s budget is to be drawn up carefully within the framework of only modest increases and that adjustments should not exceed the inflation rate. I believe the target mentioned by Mr Fernandes, in relation to youth employment is very important because in our last budget we were very concerned that more money should be provided for youth than was previously the case because it is young people in particular who are affected by unemployment or who need special support, including from Europe. That is why I believe the additional EUR 100 million is a very positive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur on buildings, I would particularly like to point out that I believe it is extremely important for us to maintain a high level of efficiency in relation to the financing of our buildings and to monitor the financial situation with care. In this context I believe it is right that financial resources that cannot be spent on Parliament’s budget over the course of the year should be used as prudently as possible to avoid interest payments. In this regard it is also necessary to ensure that the monies are not spent in a mad rush at the end of the year, but rather that they are used to pay off buildings more quickly and more economically. In relation to the House of European History, we shall ensure that the operating plan is carefully examined once again and that the construction costs are closely monitored so that, crucially, an orderly budget can also be presented after the building is complete following notification in accordance with Article 179(3). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly appropriate as we know that the Council intends to cut its budget by 4%, the Commission intends to increase its budget by only 1%, the Committee of the Regions by around 2.9% and the Economic and Social Committee by an even smaller amount.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the initial suggestion of 5.2% made by the Bureau was far too high. Reducing the increase to 2.3% is therefore progress. It is in fact a cut of about 0.5% in real terms. Personally, I would have liked to have seen an even smaller increase. In the future, I believe we should produce a plan to identify savings in Parliament’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should recognise that savings have been made. I welcome the savings made on the Added-Value Assessment Unit – which will save us around EUR 1.3 million – the savings on information campaigns, buildings policy and stationery and on the proposal to reduce the contingency reserve by around EUR 3 million. These all equate to real savings of around EUR 13.7 billion, in addition to the deferred spending on Lisbon and enlargement. As I said, I believe that further savings could have been made, but we have at least found some savings.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, could I also raise two important outstanding issues? Firstly, on the suggestion that the EUR 100 million from unallocated margins in Heading 5 should go to youth policy, as outlined by the rapporteur: along with other groups, we have said in Amendment 7 that this transfer could be considered but only in line with the priorities in the general 2012 budget. This will therefore need discussion before a decision can be made on whether it should be done and where the money should go – in other words, where the money would be spent if that transfer takes place. It is far too soon for us to commit ourselves to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the issue of the House of European History. It would be a good idea if we had plenty of money, but I believe that now is not the time. We need a proper business plan and we need it to go through the proper parliamentary procedure, perhaps through the normal budget process later this year, so that Members can have their say and give their views on this project. On this issue, I believe it is important that Parliament, as on other issues, should be seen to be taking the right decisions on our own budget. Our own budget is important and we have to be seen to be making sure that we take the right decisions for the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is evident that money is not everything, but that nothing seems to work without money. The same applies when it comes to making savings; everyone wants to hold onto what they have and is unwilling to give anything away that might have the potential to lead to more savings. In this context, the discussion of whether the inflation rate is 2.3%, 2.5% or 2.7% is, in the final analysis, mere shadow-boxing. Our task is to look and see where we can genuinely save money.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisive issue here – and it is important for the European Parliament’s Secretariat to take this to heart – is that the Committee on Budgets should be provided with all the key documents to enable it to see where savings can be made to the European Parliament’s budget, rather than simply receiving the Secretary-General’s savings proposals for it to rubber stamp. The European Parliament’s budget consists of more than just these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Fernandes has pointed out, we have identified savings of EUR 49 million. What he did not reveal, however, is that two thirds of these savings have simply been transferred to the 2013 or 2012 financial year, so that we will have to decide what to do about this money next year. In relation to the original savings, I am pleased to see that the so-called smaller groups, including the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, have managed to come together to convince the two larger groups of the need for these savings in the area of information technology, in simple matters like cleaning or payments to political parties and foundations, in other words that we have an understanding in theory at least of where money can be saved.</p>
<p class="contents">The newly opened debate on the EUR 100 million to be spent on our youth is naturally something that no one could oppose. On the other hand, we must be careful not to get side-tracked because this issue has nothing to do with this report. It needs to be dealt with in other reports. We cannot let ourselves be diverted from other important topics. Nonetheless, we have made a good start and it is evident that we do not necessarily need more money, but rather greater discipline in how we spend it. I believe that we can expect a fruitful cooperation with all groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the previous speaker that we did well to negotiate a reduction in the budgetary proposals from the Bureau, which originally involved an excessive growth rate of 5.2%, down to an increase of 2.3%. However, an increase is still an increase, even if it is probably below the inflation rate. So, we are not really making savings, but rather reducing growth. We really should be honest enough to call a spade a spade.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of the House of European History, let me say this: in principle the majority of my group is in favour of the idea of a service for the citizens of Europe informing them of our history since 1945. However, this also requires that a business plan should be put in place and that all the conditions currently being formulated for tomorrow’s vote by majority decision should be met. This is the only way to pursue budgetary policies that are responsible, truthful and transparent. This also means that if there is a genuine desire for this change in priorities, which will involve an investment of EUR 60 million in the coming years, then, in the opinion of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we will also have to make savings in other areas, rather than just limiting increases. For example, in the case of flights within the European Union of less than four hours’ duration, we believe there is no need to fly Business Class. This would save quite a considerable amount. More bicycles could be provided for the employees and Members of Parliament here in Strasbourg instead.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close with a comment on the political sleight of hand in reassigning funding for youth employment. Of course the Greens also want to increase spending on youth employment. However, this is part of the Commission budget. If this money is taken out of the European Parliament budget, then we will be cutting the resources available to the new financial supervisory body or the Food Safety Agency, for example. Is that what we really want? Is this the signal this House wants to give to our citizens? No, this is the wrong decision. We need to strengthen these regulatory agencies, making them fit for purpose, and the funding for youth employment schemes must come from the Commission’s budget. That would be the right thing to do from a political perspective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The best example of that happened this morning. Leaders of EU institutions were saying that the financial crisis is largely behind us. Nothing could be further from the truth. As Wolfgang Münchau wrote yesterday in the Financial Times, Europe is facing a stark choice between default and bailout. Both imply the absorption of a huge loss. The only difference between the two is how the loss gets distributed. In the case of a default, German, French, British, Italian and Spanish banks will suffer and the taxpayers of those countries will share the cost with Greek, Irish and Portuguese taxpayers. In the case of a bailout, the total burden will be put on the back of Greek, Irish and – soon – Portuguese citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that I say that the proposal to increase the budget of Parliament by 2.3% is still too high and unacceptable. Let us go back to the drawing board and reduce it to 1%, as suggested by Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski. To show an increase well below inflation would earn some badly needed legitimacy for Parliament in the eyes of European citizens. Not only the increase, but also the structure can be modified.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many ways to save money for the European taxpayer. As Helga Trüpel has already said, we do not need to travel business class within the European Union. An amendment jointly tabled by the Greens, the United Left and the ECR proposes to reduce travel costs significantly by using flexible economy class tickets for flights under four hours in length. We do not need a shiny, glitzy fleet of black Mercedes-Benz cars here in Strasbourg. Use the tram. We do not need the House of European History, as Europe is losing competitiveness and geopolitical weight. It will be a museum anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">There is huge scope for savings on energy costs. Our offices have no temperature control or individually adjustable heating and air conditioning. We waste a tremendous amount of energy every year. There is large scope for savings on security and IT services. In both cases, we need far better service for much less money. We should review and revise our health insurance costs as well. There is no need to have access to such an extraordinarily generous range of health care services. Budgeting is about setting priorities, both positive and negative. There is no shortage of positive ones, but responsible and prudent budgeting requires both, especially in times of crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also decide about money for employing people. Between 2010 and 2011 we awarded ourselves an additional EUR 3 000 each per month. It is also us who vote on the spending cap for our offices, assistance for expenses, allowances, and even how we travel. We have absolute power in these areas, and so I ask myself and I ask you: have we been using or have we been abusing this power of ours, have we been wise and thoughtful, or have we instead not been able to resist the hold that this power has over us? Unfortunately, we have not, and that is why this debate is not about figures, this debate is about ethics and politics, it is a debate that qualifies or disqualifies us in the eyes of those who call us to account.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not to any extent an anti-party populist, nor do I believe that Members should have to work by candle light. However, it is precisely because this sort of demagoguery exists in our countries that we need to be extremely strict when talking about making decisions relating to money and the perks that we receive. I am sorry, but it is not normal for Members who always travelled in economy class to have changed to business class now that flights have started to be reimbursed by the ticket rather than by the kilometre. The same criterion applies to our salaries and expenses. In my opinion, they are excessive, and in some cases they are even extravagant, but that is not what is at issue here: what is at issue is knowing whether we have the courage to vote for these expenses to be frozen at least.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not understand how there can be Members of Parliament here who do not hesitate to advocate austerity policies and the reduction of wages and pensions in their countries, but when it comes to making decisions about their own money, austerity goes out of the window. This is not just serious, my friends, this is indecent and very sad. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report provides no vision. It is instead a collection of empty words that once again highlight the fact that the European Union provides no added value at all. There is waste to be seen in the 2012 budget, specifically in connection with a project as ridiculous as the House of European History. The cost estimates are lurching out of control while the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, who has to take the decision on funding, is also a proposed member of the supervisory board. No other Parliament would accept a conflict of interests of this kind, but of course this House, this European Parliament, does. This is too crazy for words!</p>

What is more important is the fact that those of us who are in favour of the European Union also think it is time to have a rethink when it comes to administrative expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, we make the decision in this report not to accept a development that entails an increase in Parliament’s budget at a time when the Member States’ budgets are experiencing difficulties and when many ordinary citizens are suffering under the effects of austerity measures. We must now start to take this matter seriously. For the first time since I have been a Member of Parliament we are now cutting Parliament’s budget. I think that we should do more. I agree with the rapporteur and several previous speakers that we should take a more strategic approach to this. The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has therefore tabled an amendment regarding a long-term, strategic review of Parliament’s administrative expenditure. We now need to show that we can take this task seriously and that it is not just talk. We must start work on this review.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I would like to mention is the House of European History. Many people have questioned whether it is the task of a parliament to run a European history museum. It is questionable, but I believe that there is a point to the project, namely that no one else has started such a museum. It is perhaps time that someone did. However, it must be done according to transparent principles, with complete responsibility for the costs and taking genuine responsibility for the activity. I am therefore very pleased that we have now been able to reach an agreement between the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the S&amp;D Group and the rapporteur to vote for the most important parts of our amendment, which will mean that we will now have a genuinely transparent decision-making process with regard to this House of European History. I am pleased about that.</p>

Basically I agree with him. I also wanted to go further. I am not happy that we ended up with an increase of 2.3%. I think we could have gone further, but it was a compromise between the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau. This is also the reason why we have tabled an amendment seeking a long-term strategic overview of Parliament’s costs. With more modern management and a real effort to make long-term savings, I think we can end up in a much better situation when it comes to administrative expenditure, and there we will certainly listen to some of the proposals made by Mr Portas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At that time, the will to review certain things was lacking. I am pleased to hear my fellow Member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament say just now, for example, that there is a will to consider what we can do in the long term. That is probably the most sensible way to approach this.</p>
<p class="contents">This discussion also shows that it is easy to turn an administrative debate into a competition to determine who comes top of the populist list. Unfortunately, there seem to be rather a lot of people here in the Chamber competing for first prize. However, there is no doubt that we need to review our costs and the only sensible way to do that is to take a long-term approach. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe proposed a number of savings both last year and this year. We were among those who were pleased that we were able to reduce the increases originally proposed by the Bureau. In this regard, I would like to thank Mr Alvaro for his excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the proposal for a House of European History I have to say that the idea does not particularly appeal to me, but at the same time I believe that it is good to remember that this is a long process and it was started during the previous parliamentary term. Now we need to consider how we can take a decision on this matter. I think it would be good for the issue to be put to the vote, providing those who definitely do not want a museum with a real opportunity to say ‘no’. It may well be that I will then be among them.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not believe that we will gain anything by competing over who comes top of the populist list in this regard. It is better to reflect carefully on where we can make cuts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur is absolutely right to opt for restraint, but unfortunately he does not go far enough in so doing.</p>
<p class="contents">The current proposals are for us to have a budget that is 2.3% higher than at present. That is not in line with the view of the Commission, which is proposing a 1% increase, and certainly not in line with the wishes of the Council, which is even considering a decrease of a couple of percent. Indeed, it is the last of these proposals that we need to fall in line with. We need to make more savings, and it is possible to do so. We can make more savings. Maybe it was decided earlier to build the House of European History, but it is still possible to undo that decision. Let us do so, then, as a matter of priority. Let us put a stop to this project – the House of European History – that will waste millions.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to us, the Members of this House. We are still receiving many thousands of euros in general expenditure allowance every month without there being any requirement for accountability in respect of the sum in question. If we were to now monitor and investigate that there would be a good deal of money to be saved in this area, too. Let us, then, focus our efforts on this idea – let us make greater savings! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to reiterate that, in contrast to the majority of Members, we were opposed to and voted against the current financial statute for Members of the European Parliament, because, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, it involved virtually doubling Members’ incomes in the case of some countries. Mainly, however, because it broke with a principle that is essential in our view: the existence of a link between the average salary level of the citizens of a country and the salary level of their representatives. The breaking of this link is another symptom of the degradation of democracy, of the gap between representatives and those they represent, of ethical decline, and of a system that, imposes antisocial policies on the population through generalised cuts whilst protecting those who implement them from their effects. Is it not time to review this financial statute?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end, Madam President, by saying that it is also important for it to be clear that the draft amendments to this report, while promoting savings in Parliament, should not seek to create exceptions that are more favourable to funding European parties and European political foundations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The compromise of increasing expenditure by 2.30% seems acceptable, since this figure is actually lower than estimated inflation and would represent a theoretical saving.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, however, still far from meeting the requests made by the Commissioner for Financial Programming and Budget, who had hoped that the institutions would contain their needs to a single percentage point rise, which some institutions, such as the Council, have managed to achieve. I shall leave the issues surrounding this increase, which is probably justified by the greater number of responsibilities after Lisbon, aside for the moment, and say a few words instead on the House of European History.</p>
<p class="contents">Insane figures were circulating at the Committee on Budgets with regard to the House of European History, both for its creation and its management. It seems truly absurd that we are even considering investing tens and tens of millions of euros in a project of extremely dubious utility at a time like this, totally out of place and at completely the wrong moment in time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tasks facing all the institutions are continually on the increase due to the expansion of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon and new activities, and expenditure is rising accordingly. Nonetheless, cost-efficiency is the golden rule.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore only logical for Parliament to follow a strategy of consolidation in the area of personnel, reducing expenditure on the day-to-day running of the House, missions and business trips. I particularly support the proposal of the Secretary-General that the House’s environmental policy should continue. I would emphasise that in this draft budget the European Parliament recognises the importance of a constant, consistent supply of information to Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of the House of European History is supported in many quarters. For this reason it is to be welcomed that the budgetary authority has now been informed about the project.

I think that we in this House can certainly achieve a great deal when it comes to efficiency. It would be a very positive step if we were to establish our own points where Members of the House and staff could submit their suggestions for improvements, thereby promoting efficiency in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, since the Treaty of Lisbon, we have had ministers with specific remits who have sufficient resources in their Member States, their own specialist personnel, cabinets and financial resources, which they could have used to help explain European policy more clearly to our citizens. For our part, we in the European Parliament are responsible for making the public aware of the daily decisions taken in the interest of the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must also be given adequate resources for its new competences in the areas of energy, world trade and foreign policy, as well as the areas of competition, the environment and social affairs, which affect us all.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very much in favour of fiscal consolidation, as this would naturally allow us to make the requisite savings. Anyone who believes that Economy Class is adequate to his needs on short-haul flights should naturally fly Economy. There is no doubt about that. Or, for example, if someone does not use every last penny of their secretarial allowance, that is all right too. It is up to each of us to decide how much work we have and to what extent we wish to communicate with the citizens of Europe. This should remain something that the Members of this House should decide for themselves, because it is naturally also extremely important that we should explain the benefits effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The worst thing here is that when it comes to the issue of the House of European History there are so many cooks that people have actually lost sight of the point of the whole exercise. Thus, the Daily Telegraph today reported that documents have come into its possession indicating that the cost of this project has risen to the astronomical figure of GBP 137 million. I can only invite the Daily Telegraph to forward these documents to the Committee on Budgets and to let us see from it some of the transparency that the press demands from the Members of this House. I would welcome an opportunity to examine the evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Does this project make sense? Naturally it makes sense to foster an awareness of what the European Union and European integration have meant for people’s lives. Should a parliament operate a museum? No, definitely not. That is why the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament have followed two guiding principles on this project. The first is: we demand that the project should have a business plan. The second is: we want clarity on the follow-up costs, that is, how this project is to be funded going forward.

However, the bottom line here is that there is a 2.3% increase when inflation is expected to be 2.8%.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point that must be made is that the European Union has to deal with something in line with the overall context of the 27 countries, whereas some countries, particularly my own country, are suffering very badly at present. We have just come from a meeting, thankfully, with Commissioner Rehn, who was very obliging with us. Obviously in that situation people cannot understand any increase whatsoever, even if it is less than inflation. Be that as it may, I think we have to make overall decisions, we have to give commitments to various things we have to do, we are going to see growth in terms of extra MEPs as a result of the Lisbon Treaty and, hopefully, also when Croatia joins.</p>
<p class="contents">One point I would make before I conclude is that all this brings to mind the point which President Barroso has been making quite frequently: we do need to have a full and frank discussion on own resources and, perhaps, particularly project bonds, because the more finance the European Union can get independently, the less controversial budgets are going to be and the less we will be asking from the Member States. Ultimately, I think we should be following the line of President Barroso. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would have liked to have had him here, as I would like to remind him of paragraph 6 of the resolution, in which we ask the services to go through the budget with a fine toothcomb with the aim of identifying potential savings.

<p class="contents">This is a more austere budget, in line with what the Commission and Council requested. It is being kept within the 20% limit, thereby observing the ‘gentlemen’s agreement’, even though that does not exist. We all talk about savings, some of us with partisan intentions, but we all have some shared priorities: for example, we Members want legislative output to be improved; we are called on to respond to the new priorities of the Treaty of Lisbon; we are asked to work more professionally in co-decisions; we are asked for more meeting rooms, more internal security, greater efforts in communication policy, better IT networks, and so on. Does this or does this not all have to be paid for?</p>
<p class="contents">We have to comply with all the agreements concluded regarding property. It is being said that we could stop financing them, but we know that it does not work like that. If we are being responsible, we will have to accept that, will we not?</p>
<p class="contents">Youth is never a controversial area: youth is a necessity. For example, my country has 50% youth unemployment. These problems are not solved by EUR 100 million for youth policy, but that does respond to Parliament’s priorities. I know that moving this money from heading 5 to heading 1 is controversial, and it could even be – and has been – argued that it contradicts budgetary procedure, but we are a living institution and we must adapt to the needs of the moment.</p>

This 2.3% increase is certainly a lot easier to accept and justify than the 5.2% proposed by the Bureau. Parliament needs to be very self­critical in this budgetary procedure.

<p class="contents">I think that it is important that savings have also been sought in the small things, and in different areas. Certainly, making savings on cleaning and upkeep, for example, is one solution, but perhaps we also need more ambitious agendas than merely saving on soap. This year Parliament voted to change a double part­session in the autumn to make it a week­long sitting in Strasbourg.

That is the ambition to keep a closer eye on the efficiency and thriftiness of European institutions. In a time of economic crisis, when many EU citizens have lost their jobs, the running of institutions funded from their taxes is a highly sensitive matter, and it has to be said that this is perfectly justified. It is therefore important for the budget to enshrine the obligation for strict management.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need to concentrate on several items in order to avoid the unnecessary squandering of public funds. It is important to create and apply a strategy for electronic administration. The use of videoconferencing should be encouraged for meetings, as well as the use of new environmental technologies. In order to save natural resources, and particularly paper, we must bring the wireless network into operation in all of our workplaces. However, the saving of resources must not, on the other hand, lead to loss of quality in the work we carry out in the European institutions.

This really is positive, but in future Parliament must make greater savings and tighten management and monitoring procedures.

The services of Parliament must increase their efforts to modernise and rationalise administration, reducing their dependence on external services, and applying strict management of human resources.

However, the truth is that there has been a real decrease in this budget to well below inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">One more word on the issue of youth. We are well aware that the initiative has come from the Commission and that the Council needs to adopt it unanimously, but we also know that it was important to send a signal, and the allocation to which we are referring is heading 5 out of all of the administrative expenditure, where there is due to be around EUR 380 million and we propose EUR 100 million.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of Members’ salaries, it is not Parliament’s responsibility to update salaries. It is the Council, following proposals from the Commission, that sets salaries. The Commission’s current proposal for updating salaries is 0.9%. Salaries are also in something called the ‘Statute for Members’, and are indexed to the salary of a judge of the Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament alone cannot amend the Statute for Members. The approval of the Commission and the Council are required. Some Members need to read the regulations, and they also need to read the Treaty of Lisbon, specifically Article 223. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cătălin Sorin Ivan, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(RO)</span> Madam President, this report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests is based on the report drafted by the Commission according to Article 325 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union. This article refers in no uncertain terms to the fight against fraud, while the Commission’s report fails to give a very clear indication as to what percentage of the irregularities are due to fraud and what percentage are simple errors.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of paramount importance that we define very clearly what is meant by fraud because the use of this term means an act of deliberate infringement. We are talking about corruption in the proper sense of the word, whereas mistakes are unintentional. While we may agree to tolerate errors, we can, in no way, tolerate any act of fraud. There must be zero tolerance of fraud when it comes to European funds and the European Union’s budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Another major problem relates to the collection of data and information. We must have a very serious discussion about the way in which Member States pass on to the European Union, to the European Commission to be more exact, information about the way in which EU funds are used. In my view, the content of the national management declarations will be of a higher quality when they entail much greater political responsibility at national level. I ask the Commission once again to ensure that these national management declarations are signed by the relevant minister or a minister from the national government.</p>
<p class="contents">In another respect, the EUR 16.7 billion contained in the European Union budget are own resources and mainly revenue from customs duties. Seventy per cent of imports come through the simplified procedure. I would like to quote at this point from Special Report No 1/2010 from the Court of Auditors of the European Union, which points out the following: ‘the control carried out on these simplified procedures is very limited, while the number of errors identified by the Court is alarming’. It is of paramount importance that, in this case, the Commission evaluates the financial impact of these irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to congratulate OLAF for the Diablo II operation, aimed not only at protecting the European Union’s financial interests but also, at the same time, at combating counterfeit products. Apart from the detrimental impact these counterfeit products have on the European Union’s fiscal framework and budget, there is also the risk to European citizens’ safety and the adverse effects in the European Union’s economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I will continue to refer to the costs involved and to mention, on the one hand, the use of European funds and, on the other hand, the recovery of funds which have been allocated without justification. On the subject of the use of European funds, we must mention the Integrated Administration and Control System, which is an excellent system but causes huge problems when it has been implemented because it is based on incorrect databases and is also hampered due to the identification of the parcels to be used.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, on the subject of recovering European funds, the only thing I can say is that I find it worrying that 42% of agricultural funds are recovered and only 50% of the cohesion funds. These are extremely alarming figures and we must keep a very close eye on fund recovery. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Algirdas Šemeta, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ivan, for his constructive report. I will concentrate my remarks on six very important elements of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the question of the information provided in the report on the protection of financial interests. The 2009 report already includes new detailed information on levels of fraud and irregularities, and indicates the suspected fraud rate per Member State for the 2000-2006 Cohesion programmes. Further improvements are always possible, and I will take due account of your suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the issue of the Convention on the protection of financial interests, I am preparing a communication for next May, together with Vice-President Reding. It will present a strategy for the protection of EU public money against all forms of illegal conduct, including fraud, and will look at procedures, substantive criminal law and the institutional framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, turning to own resources, in 2010 the Commission started to visit all Member States to examine simplified customs import procedures. It will report to Parliament as soon as enough information has been gathered for a meaningful analysis of their implementation and performance.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, on cigarette smuggling, agreements have now been concluded with four tobacco manufacturers. We will continue to push for a Protocol on the elimination of the illicit trade in tobacco products under the WHO Convention on Tobacco Control.</p>
<p class="contents">On the fifth point, I fully agree that failures in applying public procurement rules are an important source of errors and fraud. The Commission vigorously implements financial corrections with rates of up to 100% of the allocated funding, depending on the gravity of the irregularities. We propose simplification and clarification of EU procurements directives by 2012, in line with the Green Paper published earlier this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I share the view that the recovery of unduly paid funds is a key element in protecting the EU’s financial interests. For multiannual Cohesion programmes, the Commission is making extensive use of the interruption and suspension of payments, avoiding payments to Member States where management and control systems are found not be effective. In 2010, more than EUR 2.4 billion of payments under the Regional and Social Funds were preventively interrupted. The Commission will continue to push Member States towards more efficient management of recovery from final beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is improving. In the agricultural sector, for example, the recovery rate at the end of 2010 went up to 53% for new 2007 cases, compared to 10% for cases dating from before 2006. Let me stress, however, that for multiannual programmes the full picture is only seen when the programmes are closed, after any irregularities have been satisfactorily dealt with by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Commission will endeavour to actively follow up the actions which Parliament has proposed. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first of them is the fact that the Commission’s report did not provide information on the estimated level of irregularities and fraud in individual Member States. Therefore, we lack a clear picture of the problem at Member State level. In addition, the Commission dealt broadly with irregularities but failed to look at fraud in detail. We expect that to change in the report for the following year.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns public procurement, which, as we all know, is the area with the highest risk of fraud and corruption. What we call for in this report is for the Commission to focus on regulating public procurement: to apply uniform systems of procurement; to define and implement clear conditions for participation in public procurement; to implement criteria for decision-making on public procurement and bring transparency to these decisions; and also to review public procurement decisions and ensure transparency and accountability in public finances. We expect the Commission and the Council to finalise the adoption of the public procurement reform and to consult with us on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue concerns the transparency of beneficiaries’ funding. There is a page on the Commission’s website where we can see some of the beneficiaries of European funds in the Member States. However, we need to improve this greatly. We need one-stop transparency. We need a single website that publishes all the beneficiaries of EU funds on the basis of standard categories of information to be supplied by all the Member States in at least one working language of the Union. Otherwise we will be lost in a lot of diverse information that fails to provide any overall picture and cannot offer transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner said, there is always room for improvement, and I hope to see improvement in the areas I have mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The annual report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests is a bit like the Member States’ list of sins, which is why I would like to thank Mr Cătălin Sorin and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their hard work. I found the Commission’s report on the protection of the European Union’s financial interests contains one remarkable sentence – on page 11 in the German version. It reads: ‘For the Objective 2 programmes, the very high irregularity rates of the UK and the Netherlands, which mainly benefit from this type of programmes, may have influenced the overall rate.’</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom and the Netherlands are two of the countries that have proposed cutting the European budget. From my position I can only call on them to make sure that European taxpayers’ money is spent correctly and to combat the level of irregularities in their countries. I would be very interested to hear whether you have anything else to add in this context, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It provides us with an insight into what may be going wrong. It provides us with an insight into what can be improved. In that context, this report is very important indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, following the debate in Parliament’s anti-fraud committee, we can stand by the following conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the reports need to be more precise. They need to provide a real insight into the actual scope of irregularities and fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Member States need to improve their reporting. This is sub-optimal at the moment, and I use the term advisedly. We therefore need to put pressure on the Member States to improve this, with sanctions if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, those resources that are wrongly spent must actually be recovered, and the Commission must take the necessary steps to ensure that this is the case. We should also discuss this when discussing the granting of discharge in Strasbourg next month. Italy is a problem child in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need to better monitor the mandatory notification of irregularities by the Member States. The lack of reports from Spain and France is particularly odd in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I am the permanent rapporteur for own resources and, as such, I would also like to direct a word of thanks and congratulations to the Commission and, above all, to the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) and its anti-cigarettes and tobacco fraud unit, whose results have been quite staggering and very impressive. Operation Diabolo II – it is said – was a peach of a collaborative operation, and the agreements reached with British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco were equally outstanding. This will yield us EUR 500 million.</p>
<p class="contents">There is just one thing though – it is important that this money does not simply disappear into the national exchequers of the Member States. This money must actually be used – by the Commission, yes, but predominantly by the Member States – to strengthen anti-fraud measures in the Member States. This is really a very important point. The money that results from this agreement must be put to use in the fight against fraud. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the autumn of last year, at the presentation from the European Court of Auditors, we were already discussing the responsibility of Member States for monitoring the overall issuing of EU funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it is right and proper that every Member State should protect the financial interests of the EU by ensuring reliable controls at the national level for the detection of irregularities and fraud. In connection with this, there is also a need for Member States and the Commission to cooperate in the provision of comprehensive and reliable information. The mandatory declaration of a report at the national level must be duly checked by the national monitoring body. The Convention on the Protection of the Financial Interests of the European Communities is surely an appropriate supporting instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Czech Republic, which is mentioned in the report, has not yet ratified the Convention, because it requires the introduction of criminal liability for legal entities. The law of the Czech Republic is traditionally based on the criminal liability only of natural persons. The matter is now under discussion, however, on the floor of the Parliament of the Czech Republic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Only two of the four whose names were revealed have effectively resigned. Will this Parliament review the legislation these four MEPs have worked on? One MEP has even gone so far as to question OLAF’s power to investigate these cases, declaring – incredibly – that in some countries such action would not be considered illegal and would not even be investigated.</p>

I very much regret that we are only dealing with this report at a time when three Members of the European Parliament have been entrapped and are suspected of corruption on solid grounds. It does not bear thinking about that the ensnared MEPs are only the tip of the iceberg here in the European Parliament. That is to say, according to some calculations, about 50% of European Union tenders and public procurements, which have been mentioned a lot here, are embezzled, defrauded and lost in corruption, and get into the pockets of certain politicians. Well, this is intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the mere financial aspect of this is secondary, because society is turning away from politics. If people turn away from politics, a mood of resignation will govern which will be unable to prevent school closures, rising food prices and loss of jobs. This is why the European Parliament must set an example and we must waive our privilege of immunity from judicial process. Moreover, Jobbik recommends that sentences be doubled for politicians. Thank you very much for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the Commission is trying to determine the extent of irregularities and fraud. Unfortunately the report also makes obvious attempts to use statistics to play down the problem of irregularities and fraud at every turn. Commissioner, I was not at all pleased to read this.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also offers more important news, namely the implementation of the reporting system for dealing with irregularities, known as IMS. Data can now be entered at 800 offices throughout Europe, rather than 50 offices as before. Accordingly, the proportion of irregularities in the agricultural sector rose by 43% and in the area of structural funds by 23%, while the total figure in the structural funds area actually rose by 109%.</p>
<p class="contents">This system needs further improvement. It is painful to see that the Commission is still showing a great deal of patience in relation to implementation in the Member States, which continues to proceed at snail’s pace. This is also evident in the report. Hence our call for the full implementation of the IMS. We will only have credible data when the system is up and running correctly, enabling us to deal with quota irregularities and fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very unhappy with the situation in Italy. This country is way ahead of the rest when it comes to fraud. The EU accounts up to 2004 were audited and 60% of suspected cases of fraud were attributed to Italy. For this reason it would make sense to help this country with an action plan and a series of special measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my sincere thanks to OLAF and its staff for the important work completed. You have our backing, which is why we are calling for greater support from the Commission for the European Anti-Fraud Office. Why are problems encountered with access to databases if the Commission claims that it supports the work of OLAF and considers it just as important as we do? Commissioner, we would be grateful to hear some answers and to receive appropriate remedies in the legislation introduced by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has focused only formally on what it was notified of by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you should look more deeply, with the help of the specialised bodies. You simply have to make a greater effort, and you must try to apply the latest methodologies for measuring the extent of irregularities and fraud. If we continued with the methodology represented in the Commission’s annual report for 2009, we would have only estimates for many of the suspicious items. For example, some large States receiving a high level of funding report a very low level of irregularities and fraud. Is the situation in these States really so positive, or is the national methodology for identifying these aberrations simply lenient in some way?</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the rapporteur that the Commission is putting a disproportionately large effort into convincing us in Parliament of the need to introduce a tolerable risk of error, rather than trying to persuade Member States of the need for mandatory national management declarations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for this is quite sad, however, as it consists of the observation that large amounts of fraud are committed within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I quote: the Commission fails to consider fraud in detail and deals with irregularities very broadly. Large amounts of EU funds are wrongly spent. There is a disproportionate rise in irregularities in Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. Spain and Italy are responsible for the highest number of cases of irregularities. Over recent years, only 10% of legitimate recoveries were actually recovered. Finally, Bulgaria perpetrates the most fraud in connection with the Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD).</p>
<p class="contents">These were just a few facts from the report. It is a good thing that these facts have been noted, but what is the European Union actually going to do about it? How much longer will fraud continue to be tolerated and for how much longer will the citizens have to pick up the tab?</p>

I must say that unfortunately this report reveals a certain lack of attention on the part of the Commission in its dealings with Parliament, which even in last year’s work had signalled to the Commission several specific measures to be taken in response to this aim that we have set ourselves to protect the financial interests of the European Union and the interests of taxpayers in combating fraud and fighting illegality.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, as Mr Ivan has made clear, concerns over the improper use of European funds have not diminished, and the percentages of irregularity and incidence of suspected fraud are still very high. Therefore, if the objective of our controls is to ensure the recovery of resources, we are bound to admit defeat in the light of the figures reported to us.</p>
<p class="contents">As we already stated in the report presented last year, the Commission should take responsibility for intervening in cases of serious concern, which I would group into three categories, as fellow Members before me have also said. In the first instance, Member States must take on responsibility in particular by working on detection and reporting mechanisms. Secondly, the clarity of regulations. It is vital that we arrive at a single and clear definition of fraud, irregularity and error. Finally transparency, which means not only maintaining reliable detection records from which to draw conclusions, but also going ahead with the publication of these data on a website, which is instead experiencing something of a slowdown.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first point, in particular that of giving Member States more responsibility, I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the lack of harmonisation between national systems creates significant differences in terms of the amount of time needed to verify cases of fraud and irregularity.</p>
<p class="contents">Italy has often been discussed in relation to this subject. Italy is also mentioned in Mr Ivan’s document. We certainly have insupportably long verification periods and we are trying to work on the timings involved in legal and criminal justice. However, I must say that if there is no uniform criterion for the definition of fraud and irregularity, it is clear that the time taken to recover losses in states like Italy will seem excessively long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the activity performed by Parliament, the Court of Auditors and the national audit offices of countries, Member States alike is highly important. It is extremely important that we do our job transparently and, if possible, impeccably. Naturally, the most important concomitant of Parliament’s credibility is that we ourselves are all beyond reproach. With regard to itself, Parliament certainly needs to introduce rules for itself that are better and more effective than at present. At the same time, I would like to emphasise that it is very important to distinguish between irregularities and fraud because irregularity is not the same as fraud. Defrauders must be punished. For irregularities a different method must be applied. The goal must be that all spending organisations of all Member States know the rules precisely to ensure that as few mistakes as possible are made. It is no coincidence that we see that in the new Member States, where the debate has now begun and the use of funds has started, inexperience is one of the contributing factors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important one, because taxpayers want to know that their money is well spent.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important to emphasise, as did the last speaker, the difference between irregularities and fraud. For the public, fraud is carried out with criminal intent, but many people make mistakes which could be classified as errors, or commit major or minor breaches of European Union rules, and they should not all be lumped together. There is a very distinct difference.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to agriculture, which was mentioned by some colleagues, it is important that we have full transparency on payments in the agricultural sector. Huge improvements have been made in this area. But it is important, as we move towards reforming the common agricultural policy, that we continue to make those improvements. I refer in particular to paragraph 24, which talks about the control systems. I know that, in the Member State that I represent, farmers are getting new maps out and have got to resubmit. A huge amount of patience and attention is being paid to this issue, and rightly so.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish by saying that individuals are sometimes caught by the system, whereas major players and others who might be more guilty of an element of fraud are perhaps less likely to be caught. That is something that we need to be aware of. Let us not terrorise the individual. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

European Union taxpayers’ money must be used appropriately and efficiently. To that end, it is necessary to ensure that the Member States have effective control mechanisms and adequate fraud detection capability. It is important for the Commission and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to be provided with high quality, accurate, reliable and comparable data on irregularities and fraud. The current recovery rate is very low and intolerable. It is therefore necessary to take action to recover all European Union money that has been misused. In this fight it is crucial for proper attention to be paid by the Council and the Member States to the facts presented in Parliament’s report and the Commission’s annual reports on the protection of interests, and for OLAF to be able to take all necessary steps to strengthen anti-fraud measures in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, the European Commission’s data is not completely adequate either for determining measures to be used to discipline the Member States with the highest rate of irregularities and fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Most fellow Members have already mentioned the difference between fraud and irregularities, which is not emphasised clearly, because the report fails to consider fraud in detail, which is deliberate wrongdoing, while adopting a very general approach to irregularities, which does not give us an opportunity to make any effective recommendations on the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased with the Commission’s conclusion that compliance with reporting requirements in the agricultural sector has already reached 95%. However, at the same time, I find low and zero rates for fraud and irregularities in some Member States suspicious, which could mean that fraud control and detection systems are not operating properly.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that control over the spending of European funds would improve considerably if there were specific data and methods available for assessing the management and control systems deployed in the Member States where the national agencies’ efficiency is evident. This is why it is totally plausible that countries with a zero irregularity rate simply have a poor control system which fails to detect the problems, whereas countries with efficient national agencies may discover more fraud and irregularities, thereby making the levels for these considerably higher.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the data from the Court of Auditors of the European Union, at least 30% of the errors could have been detected and rectified by the national agencies prior to certifying them to the European Commission. I hope that all Member States will make more effort to improve their mechanisms for detecting and rectifying errors.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to call on the European Commission to take the necessary measures to guarantee sufficient information about the control and management systems deployed in Member States, as well as adequate measures for promptly removing any deficiencies detected where the control systems are used. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report repeatedly highlights the unusually low levels of fraud and irregularity reported by various countries in relation to agricultural expenditure, structural funds and pre-accession funds.

However, fraud is not something that just simply happens, but requires a high level of criminal activity. Those who seek financial gain from the Brussels juggernaut by making false claims are sometimes seen as latter-day Robin Hoods rather than as criminals. However, this does not just inflict damage on the EU, but also misuses the taxes paid by our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We must give new strength to the weak mechanisms for combating fraud. I am thinking of significant financial penalties, as well as exclusion from subsidy schemes as a consequence. In the final analysis, what we need is greater transparency and clear areas of responsibility when there is reason to suspect fraud and negligence. We cannot allow the institutions, in particular the European Parliament and OLAF, to impede one another’s investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word about our major headaches: cohesion policy, pre-accession aid and agencies. We need to rethink our strategy here and to take decisive action to establish order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all the progress made in terms of transparency and controls, public perception remains critical. This critical attitude is justified when we consider the way that some Member States have dealt with improperly apportioned grant payments. The fact that only a fraction of this money has been returned to the European budget represents a blow against all taxpayers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must recover this money immediately. An even better solution would be to pay out a correspondingly smaller level of subsidies to the relevant Member States in the next financial year and to continue to do so until the improperly distributed funds have been returned to Brussels. However, we are equally uneasy when very few irregularities are reported, according to the principle: if I report nothing then I do not need to worry about recovery and the money will remain in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">As demanded in the report, I also call on Spain, France and other countries to place their cards on the table, while also calling on the Commission to further strengthen its controls. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission will further improve the format and content of the Article 325 annual report on the protection of financial interests and will take into account the suggestions that were made during the debate. As I mentioned, we have already improved the statistics, but of course there is still room for more improvement.</p>
<p class="contents">We are asking Member States to present more information and also to distinguish better between fraud and irregularities in order to be able to present clear information on both fraud and irregularities.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with Mrs Grässle that we can make improvements in the irregularities management system, and we are working on it very seriously. The issue was raised of transparency of beneficiaries as well. We are improving this and the ideas that were presented here will also be analysed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also shares the view that, although measures have been taken by the Member States to make control systems in the fight against fraud and corruption more efficient, there is still room for further improvement. Regarding the points made by Mr Geier: fraud has no specific national borders. It is not just a problem for several Member States or new Member States but also for the Member States that you mentioned in your intervention.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we have to address this issue seriously throughout the European Union and my intention is to really improve the content of the report for 2010. I and my services have been working seriously on it and I believe that the report for 2010 will be of the highest possible quality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs with whom I enjoyed excellent relations. This report is the result of the collaboration and excellent cooperation I had.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate that the difference between irregularities and fraud must be clearly defined. While we may agree to tolerate errors and irregularities, there must be zero tolerance of fraud. Secondly, the national management declarations must be signed by the national politician responsible for this, such as the relevant minister.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are awaiting with great interest the check being carried out by the Commission on the simplified procedure because it is of paramount importance for the European Union’s own resources to be collected in the most efficient way possible and for the budget to be consolidated as effectively as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, with regard to the public procurement law and bureaucracy relating to the use of European funds at national level, we have to tackle excessive red tape in many Member States, which is intended, on the one hand, to combat fraud but, on the other hand, creates opportunities for corruption and making fraudulent use of European funds. Otherwise, as they are highly politicised, the funds go to political beneficiaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, and as the final point in my speech, I want to welcome the proposal tabled by my colleague Jens Geier on introducing a system for automatically suspending European funds when any suspicion of fraud arises. I think that this will ensure that Member States too respond much more quickly when we sound the alarm bell. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would first like to highlight the appeal made in the report to countries that have not yet ratified the Convention on the Protection of the Financial Interests of the European Communities, in other words Malta, Estonia and the Czech Republic. Unfortunately, the current Czech government has done nothing to intensify the fight against fraud and corruption. On the other hand, I would like to applaud the report for stating that the Czech Republic, along with Estonia, Latvia and Slovenia, had a zero level of fraud in drawdowns from the pre-accession SAPARD fund. I am alarmed by the finding of the Court of Auditors that more than 30% of errors identified by the Court in a sample from 2009 could have been discovered and corrected by the Member States before confirming the payments to the Commission, on the basis of information that the Member States had in their possession. I would like to join the call for OLAF, in accordance with the request raised in last year’s report on protecting the financial interests of the Community, to provide a detailed analysis in its next annual report of the strategies and measures introduced by each Member State in the fight against fraud and the prevention and detection of irregularities in the use of European funding, including cases where these resulted from corruption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those funds were mobilised immediately, and were actually the first significant contribution to arrive. This initial amount was increased to EUR 30 million on 3 March in view of the rapidly increasing humanitarian needs. An additional amount of EUR 6 million has been mobilised under the civil protection budget line for the co-financing of assistance in kind provided by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">EU humanitarian assistance is implemented through our partners, funded by ECHO or through assistance in kind from the Member States, and mobilised and coordinated via the EU civil protection mechanism. It covers the provision of assistance to people fleeing Libya on the borders with Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria, support for the repatriation of third-country nationals to their countries of origin, the provision of assistance and humanitarian protection to people with refugee status who cannot go back to their countries – they have no countries to go to – and to Libyans fleeing Libya, the financing and prepositioning of emergency stocks to provide relief aid inside Libya, and the financing of medical supplies, emergency surgery and food assistance inside Libya, to be implemented as and when specific areas become accessible. Currently, not the whole territory is accessible. For the time being, we can operate in the east but not in the west, which is controlled by Gaddafi.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy jointly adopted, on 8 March 2011, a communication on the partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the southern Mediterranean. It presents a strategy for Europe to support the momentous changes in the southern neighbourhood. The Commission has also mobilised its instruments to support, if needed, Italy and other Member States if a massive influx of migrants from North Africa were to materialise. This response includes operational measures and financial assistance. The Frontex joint operation – Hermes 2011 – was launched on 20 February with assets and experts from a number of Member States. We are closely monitoring developments and preparing for different scenarios. If required, Frontex operations could be strengthened to help deal with possible new inflows. The Commission is ready to mobilise additional financial assistance from funds such as the External Borders Fund and the European Refugee Fund, which amount to EUR 25 million in total. A large number of Member States are prepared to provide very welcome specialised personnel and technical assets.</p>
<p class="contents">Compared to the status quo, current military operations have not affected the level of humanitarian access, because it was restricted from the beginning of the crisis by forces loyal to Gaddafi. Ongoing negotiations between the authorities in Tripoli and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) have not yet resulted in an agreement on humanitarian access to western Libya. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is of course one question – a long-standing question – as to whether humanitarian aid reaches the real recipients and transparency plays a very important role here. I note, Commissioner, the reticence of northern European countries to go beyond the contractual framework and open up the European market, open up its borders to exports of agricultural produce from these countries, from North Africa, to the European Union. However, it cannot be southern Europe, because that is where the competition is, that pays yet again.

First, the outflow of migrant workers into Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria and Niger – there the Commission and the Member States have been very effective. We have mobilised both air and sea deployment of Member States assets so we can take people home, and a humanitarian injection into the International organisation for migration and the UN organisation for refugees so that they can help with a huge amount of people – 420 000 people – fleeing Libya.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, in the Eastern part of Libya to which we have access, we have provided support for medical treatment as well as for the prepositioning of food supplies. This is not yet a food crisis, but this is a country that imports 90% of its food, so we must be ready. There we also are helping sub-Saharan Africans, in particular Chadians, who found themselves in a very difficult position because of the risk to their safety, being perceived to be mercenaries, being perceived to be fighters, when of course many of them are not. Helping them to get to safety, mostly in Egypt, has also been a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, we know that in Gaddafi-controlled areas there are humanitarian needs but we are restricted in getting there. We have set aside EUR 9 million even when conditions allow for us to be mobilised. We actually gave instructions to the World Food Programme as well as to other humanitarian organisations, to be ready to help.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second part of your question, access to markets, this is at the heart of the southern Mediterranean initiative which I outlined. It is about making sure that we can offer a prospect of a better future for jobs and prosperity to these countries. There we are putting a very strong emphasis indeed on trade, trade with Europe, but also trade among the countries of the Mediterranean. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We managed to achieve coordination between our Member States and deployed the monitoring and information centre to provide a platform for this coordination. As a result, we got the vast majority of our citizens out of Libya in the fastest and safest manner. By the time this massive evacuation was completed, there were only around 200 people left who wanted to be evacuated. Right now — as we speak — some of them have been safely evacuated by a Russian aircraft.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of medical services, as we evacuated European citizens the law of unintended consequences kicked in, because some of these European citizens had been providing medical services as part of the Libyan health service. Many nurses were evacuated, though not so many doctors. We are now making every possible effort to enable humanitarian organisations that specialise in medical care to provide access to such care for Libyans and third-country nationals in Libya.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the critical importance of Gaddafi allowing humanitarian organisations to operate in the western part of Libya cannot be over-emphasised. Unfortunately this has not yet happened. We have a team of our own experts in the eastern part of the country. They have returned from an assessment mission and reported that, although there are increasing numbers of wounded people in need of medical care, the medical supplies and support — including personnel — that the intentional community is providing are broadly sufficient in the eastern part of Libya. That is not the case, however, in cities like Misrata and other areas controlled by Gaddafi. As you probably know, attempts are now being made to send in medical ships by sea as a means of increasing the availability of medical treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union carries out actions to support, to coordinate or supplement Member States actions, to protect and improve human health. Having said this, the Commission believes that all citizens across the Union should have universal access to high quality care.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore launched a number of initiatives in this regard and I am happy to answer the question by the honourable Member of Parliament. In 2009. the Commission adopted a communication on ‘Solidarity and health: reducing health inequalities in the European Union’ and this communication stresses the need to bridge inequalities in health.</p>
<p class="contents">Last December, the Commission services further launched a joint action with 14 Member States on reducing health inequalities in the framework of the health programme. Universal access to high quality care is also a focus of the open method of coordination on health and long term care. In this context Member States have agreed specific objectives concerning health care systems, access to health care, quality of health and sustainability of health care policies. In addition with the new directive on patients’ rights in cross-border health care, EU patients will have the opportunity to get information on treatments that are available abroad and will be able to seek possible reimbursement of costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the health sector is one of the funding areas under the current cohesion policy. Measures financed in this context, such as modernisation of hospital infrastructure, purchase of medical equipment or the training of medical staff can help improve citizens’ access to healthcare, particularly in the poorest regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In that Communication we emphasised that despite excellent research and development capacities in certain key enabling technologies, we are not managing to achieve proportionate success when it comes to transforming those results into manufacturing products and services.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe therefore that it is important that we define a strategy that aims to further the deployment of key enabling technologies in European industry. This approach has also been outlined in initiatives by the Commission, in particular in the initiatives for industrial policy, the Innovation Union and the European digital strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the adoption of the Communication, in July last year the Commission set up the High-Level Expert Group on Key Enabling Technologies. Their work was launched by three Commissioners: Vice-President for the Digital Agenda Nelly Kroes, the Commissioner for Research,Innovation and Science, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, and by the undersigned as responsible for Industry and Entrepreneurship. The group was given a one-year mandate to formulate recommendations on policy measures to adopt in order to promote the industrial deployment of key enabling technologies in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The group consists of 27 representatives from the administrations of Member States, from the research community, from the European enabling technology sector, from the European Investment Bank and from associations of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">In February this year, the group presented a mid-term working document to the European Commission, which illustrated the main challenges related to the commercialisation of key enabling technologies in Europe. The first internal working document can be consulted on the Directorate-General’s site ‘<span class="italic">Enterprise’</span>. The definitive report by the expert group will be presented to the Commission at some point this July. This report will represent a significant contribution to the Commission’s reflections aimed at creating a single strategic framework to bring together initiatives to support research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Key enabling technologies (KETs) are of fundamental importance for our economies, because they represent real instruments which would facilitate the emergence of future products and services and would therefore represent the basis of our industrial platform, for what we could call our third industrial revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who know how to avail themselves of these technologies in Europe will also be able to make our industries more competitive and will be at the forefront in the transition towards a low carbon-emission economy, which is efficient in the consumption of resources and based on knowledge. Not making use of KETs means losing European leadership in sectors in which we are strong and losing innovative capacity in applications that are of strategic importance for our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, these technologies offer an enormous market potential in terms of growth. I should like to quote certain symbolic figures. According to our estimates, their volume on the global market is between EUR 950 billion and EUR 1 100 billion per year, with an expected annual growth rate of between 5% and 46%. Emerging technologies represent therefore an extraordinary opportunity on which all industrialised economies will root their competitiveness, an indispensable instrument for future growth.</p>
<p class="contents">To pass over this opportunity would be an error and the Commission intends to play its role. We need the support of the European Parliament, particularly after the Treaty of Lisbon and the increase in competencies awarded to the European Parliament, and I believe – and I say this as a former Member of the European Parliament – that this collaboration between the European Parliament and the Commission will lead us to achieve good results also in this sector, which is so crucial for growth and competitiveness in our European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The high level group dealt with a number of issues, but one of them was this ‘valley of death’, in other words this chasm that separates the creative idea from the market place, and it pointed out the fact that Europe often loses its first-mover advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">It also spoke about a number of roadblocks that are there, for example the absence of a European IP patent and the need to reduce the fragmentation of the regulatory framework already in place.

We are currently at the stage of awaiting policy recommendations from the expert group before identifying the Commission’s final strategy</p>
<p class="contents">In the mid-term working document the expert group proposed a three-pillar bridge to overcome this gap in innovation. Each of the three pillars represents a condition that must necessarily be met to allow key enabling technologies (KETs) to be deployed in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The first pillar concerns technological research. Europe must develop more competitive technologies up to patented prototype stage. This goal requires the Union’s research programmes to be more focused on technological research.</p>
<p class="contents">The second pillar concerns product demonstration. We must succeed in transforming technological successes into competitive products and this goal requires a rebalancing of the Union’s research programmes to facilitate demonstration projects.</p>
<p class="contents">The third pillar is global-level industrial competitiveness. Europe must maintain current production capacities or create new capacities so that our innovative products can compete in a global market in terms of price and dimensions. We therefore need to improve the framework conditions for investors to encourage them to invest in the European Union. Thus we need to attract investment, but at the same time improve all EU programmes which could support this highly important sector, and try to overcome the gap between research and application which is characteristic of many productive sectors in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This transition from research to application is a problem that the entire industrial sector confronts. That is why I am in favour of and why we have supported the cluster policy - we have around 2 000 of them - which enables connections between research and industry, universities, research and industry and innovation, so as to make our industrial system more competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the state of the art, Mrs Harkin. We shall continue our work and I shall carefully examine all suggestion coming from the European Parliament and I shall take to heart all instructions that this House will send me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of these options was to continue the current policy beyond 2013. This status quo has been used as a benchmark for comparing the impact of other possible options. This status quo scenario takes into account new long-term management plans, the Control Regulation and the Regulation on illegal, unreported fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the status quo scenario option are clear: if we do not change our policy then, by 2020, sustainability of stocks will in general be out of the question.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding environmental sustainability, only 6% of the stocks analysed would reach maximum sustainable yield by 2020. This should be compared with our obligation to achieve maximum sustainable yield by 2015. So if we continue under the status quo situation there is no way we will fulfil our obligation to achieve maximum sustainable yield by 2015</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the economic performance of our fishing fleets, under the status quo scenario only some fleets will be economically viable. The catching sector as a whole will have profits close to zero or even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the picture for social sustainability is the same. Employment in the catching sector would continue to decline at the same pace as is the case now; wages would remain low, which would make the profession of fisherman increasingly unattractive to the younger generation.</p>
<p class="contents">So the status quo is really not an option for the Commission. We need the reform and we are working for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to be sure that our fisheries industry has a future, we need the reform. We intend to bring forward some sound proposals and we intend to secure the livelihoods of our fishermen.

However, the current regulation allows – and this is the problem we face – under certain conditions, on-board processing involving the removal of fins on board vessels, while making obligatory the retention of all shark carcasses on board. This is why we have faced the problem of shark finning in recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">We presented a plan of action in February 2009 and have since taken a number of measures. We are also actively working with regional organisations to put effective management regimes in place for the most vulnerable shark species and to ensure their sustainable exploitation. So the problem we are facing with a view to addressing this situation is the need for a public consultation, and we have now already had a public consultation for some months. The consultation document presented three of the main options that are currently being discussed by experts worldwide to improve controls and to ensure full compliance. Many stakeholders, such as the fishing industry, scientists, managers and NGOs, as well as the general public, have sent us their comments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to assure you that I take the issue of protecting sharks very seriously. I have therefore asked my services to thoroughly study all the contributions received. We will then prepare an impact assessment which, as you know, is required to modify the regulation. It is my intention to have a legislative proposal adopted as soon as practically possible. I would like to inform you that I have made this issue a priority in order not to lose any more time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that the Commission has taken a lot of measures to ensure the sustainable management and protection of sharks in general, beyond shark finning. We presented a plan of action and have since taken a number of measures. We have prohibited fishing for porbeagle, basking shark and white shark in EU waters. We have banned gill nets below 200 metres to protect deepwater sharks. Last year – and I would like to underline this – we proposed a sustainable and science-based quota for various sharks. We had a very rough time negotiating this in the Council. It was not an easy task, but in the end we were successful and we have a sustainable proposal for this year and, I hope, for next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I appreciate that it is very difficult. How do you police it? We need to put in place a regulation banning this practice completely. What we are talking about is the wiping out – the total extinction – of a particular species. The figures speak for themselves. For example, it is currently estimated that, in 2009, the fins of 26 million to 73 million sharks entered the global trade. It is a very lucrative business indeed. We need to ban it completely. It is barbaric, it should not be countenanced and we need to ban it once and for all. We should take the lead in that regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with you and we know the reality and how it works. We know that there is a very profitable industry behind all this discussion. But we have to take measures consistent with our legal framework, so let me explain.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem exists because the industry can now land the fins and the sharks at different ports. They can land the fins which, as we can imagine, are more precious because of the demand for them, especially in Asia, and they can land the bodies of the sharks somewhere else, making control very difficult. This is why all this happens. This is something we have in mind. That is why we came forward with this consultation procedure because we would like to deal with this very difficult situation.</p>
<p class="contents">So what I can tell you is that we are going to have an ambitious proposal and, by the end of the year, I hope we will have a new legal instrument on shark fins that will have some concrete results. We are going to regulate this situation once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the analogy on the mackerel situation, what I can say here is that the European Union has done its best. I would like to say that the Member States around this area were very cooperative and our fishermen and our industry had to suffer a lot of sacrifices in order to secure the sustainability of the stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we were very upset when Iceland and the Faroe Islands came with unilateral approaches and increased their own quotas by themselves. This is something we simply cannot accept. So we are now working on this – my services are working with the Cabinet and the services of the Trade Commissioner, Mr de Gucht – and we are going to launch a legislative proposal for a legal weapon to use in such cases. We have some weapons now, but the legal weapons at our disposal now refer only to fresh fish, including mackerel, and not to the products of mackerel and especially not to fish oil and fish meal which are the main export products from Iceland and the Faroe Islands. So we have to be productive on this. The Commission is going to do its best to ensure that during the next fishing season the sustainability of the stocks will be protected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to inform Parliament that the Commission recently adopted a communication on ‘A partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean’, which sets out a series of proposals to address the challenges that the region currently faces following recent developments. As you know, this is an extreme situation which is very fragile and very worrying.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is highly satisfied with the general approval for its initiative. This communication has been received in a very positive way by all the Member States and, I hope, by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me explain a few actions that we have taken to date towards the objective of a new maritime strategy for the Mediterranean. Firstly, in relation to an integrated maritime policy, we have already established a working group on such a policy, involving all the Mediterranean coastal states and regional conventions. We plan to take this forward as a cross-cutting forum on all maritime-related activities, cooperation and funding in the region. As part of this initiative, we also have the first technical assistance project, which was launched under the European Neighbourhood Policy, dealing with the integrated maritime policy for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to inform Parliament about an initiative I took recently in launching a joint cooperation project in the Mediterranean together with the International Maritime Organisation and the European Investment Bank. I am counting on this initiative and I hope it will be fruitful. We will define targeted actions for maritime growth, jobs and maritime training, which is very important for the Mediterranean region. We will also include measures for integrated maritime surveillance, and we will have private-sector involvement because, with regard to maritime issues, I believe this to be absolutely necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, the Commission intends to support the organisation of a forum for Mediterranean coastguards throughout the region. We will also step up our efforts in the area of fisheries control through training, workshops and joint control in cooperation with Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO).</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding protection of the environment and climate change, at EU level the Commission is now working with the Member States to achieve good environmental status in its marine waters by 2020. At regional level, the EU and its Member States cooperate, in the framework of the Barcelona Convention, with Mediterranean partner countries to promote the prevention of pollution, and improve the response to it, in all the regional seas bordering the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to migration-related problems and the recent developments in the region, the Commission is committed to assisting and supporting EU Member States that face sudden migratory pressures and is ready to mobilise financial assistance. We are now working on identifying financial emergency envelopes under the External Borders Fund, and possibly the Return Fund and the European Refugee Fund, in addition to funding already earmarked for 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the surveillance of external borders, the Commission is in constant contact with Frontex, which has launched the Hermes 2011 joint operation to control the EU external border in the region. Frontex, together with Europol, has also started preparing a targeted risk assessment of potential exploitation of the volatile political situation by criminal and terrorist networks, and monitoring irregular migration flows. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to inform her that Mediterranean countries could also better prevent and detect pollution from ships by participating in EMSA’s satellite-based monitoring system, such as safe sea nets or clean sea nets. We have these systems and we are going to encourage our Member States around the Mediterranean to participate in these systems, to detect possible pollution from ships.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that we are going to incentivise not only our Member States, but also our neighbours through discussions and cooperation in order to fulfil this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to regional cooperation, yes, we are going to take some initiatives on it and we have a lot of initiatives in the framework of the General Committee for Fisheries in the Mediterranean Region (GFCM), and we are also now working to have a new strategy, a maritime strategy, in the Adriatic and Ionian region.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now working with the governments of the Member States around the Adriatic and Ionian seas: Italy, Slovenia and Greece but also other neighbours around there, Croatia, Montenegro and Albania. We are trying to have a maritime cooperative strategy for this region. I would like to underline that this will really be an opportunity for cohesion funds, as the honourable Member has already said.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a brief remark about Western Sahara: yes, we had a lot of concerns about the right of the real beneficiaries to take advantage of the money we are giving to Morocco as part of this fisheries agreement. That is why we have asked the Moroccan Government to give us data with regard to not only the implementation of the agreement in general, but also to the regional approach of this agreement and to the distribution they have in different regions in Morocco. We are going to renew the protocol for a transitional period of one year just to find out if we can go with it or not. This is the way we are moving, very cautiously, towards this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Europe 2020 flagship initiative ‘Innovation Union’ (chapter 2) published recently by the Commission refers, among other things, to the obligation of the Member States to announce strategies for training enough researchers to meet their national strategic programme targets and the Commission's intention, in the same year, to support an international multi-dimensional system to benchmark the performance of European higher educational foundations.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Commission: How will it ensure the target of 3% for research by 2020 will be met across the board without variations in investments being seen between the Member States? Does the Commission think that the fiscal crisis in the eurozone Member States could put the intended targets at risk?</p>

The Innovation Union Scoreboard shows that the EU is losing ground to the United States and Japan, while Brazil and China are closing the gap with the EU. The 3% R&amp;D intensity target has a crucial contribution to make in meeting this challenge. The European Council invited Member States to set ambitious and realistic national targets, taking into account the initial level of R&amp;D investment and the key structural characteristics of their economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year Member States and the Commission engaged in bilateral dialogues. Nearly all of the Member States have now set national R&amp;D intensity targets, to be finalised in their national reform programmes by the end of April 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">On 12 January this year, the Commission adopted the communication on the annual growth survey. It comprises the list of national R&amp;D targets, which are generally both ambitious and realistic and marks the start of a new cycle of coordination in this field. An assessment of the national research and innovation policies and achievements will be performed, aiming at identifying the main bottlenecks impeding growth and recovery in a post-crisis scenario where the financial constraints are still effective.</p>
<p class="contents">An excellent research base is vital if the 3% R&amp;D intensity target is to be achieved and if Europe is to become more innovative. Europe will need at least one million more research jobs if the R&amp;D intensity target of 3% is to be reached by 2020. The number of new researchers required is significantly higher as many researchers will retire over the period. Research excellence by universities and also, of course, by industry will benefit the wider society. Progress is related to the high quality of higher education institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Innovation Union Scoreboard uses internationally recognised indicators to benchmark the performance of Europe against that of our competitors. Three of these indicators are: new doctoral graduates per 1 000 population aged 25 to 34, quantitative, international scientific co-publications per million population and scientific publications among the top 10% most cited publications worldwide as a percentage of total scientific publications of the country, both qualitative.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States has increased its lead in international co-publications and is now 37% above the EU level. Pending the results in June of a feasibility study, the Commission will support an independent multidimensional international ranking to benchmark the performance of higher education institutions. This study will cover performances, not only in the field of research, but also in other important fields such as innovation, education, regional engagement and internationalisation. The multidimensional character of this concept will allow students, policy makers and the universities themselves to select the dimensions and underlying indicators of interest to them and make their own personalised ranking tailored to their needs. Stakeholders are actively involved in all stages of this feasibility project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the first thing is that innovation and research is at the heart of European policy now. We have a commitment, not just from the Commission and from the Member States and the Parliament, but also from the European Council. We have very strong monitoring in place, which will be done diligently. We have 34 ‘Innovation Union’ commitments — for which different colleagues of mine have responsibility — where we monitor on a regular basis what the improvement is, what the changes are, what the development is and what has been delivered or, if it has not been delivered, why not. Every year we hope to have an ‘Innovation Convention’ at which we bring the stakeholders together to sit down and look at progress over the previous year.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have very strict monitoring, which I think is probably where we failed — or did not achieve what we set out to achieve — in Lisbon. We also have the annual growth survey and will now have the national reform programmes, where Member States will set down very clearly what their targets are going to be and how they hope they hope to attain those targets. I think that is a step forward that was needed.</p>
<p class="contents">On the modernisation of universities, this is a big issue that, I think, faces all the Member States of the EU. It is not good enough to have one or two universities in a number of Member States that are up there near the top of the tree. We need to modernise our university system at all levels in the EU and we need to avoid the kind of duplication that has been referred to, where each university up to now might have felt that they had the capacity to have a centre of excellence for every single faculty. That is not possible or cost-effective, and it involves a great deal of fragmentation and duplication, which is exactly what we are trying to avoid.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us remember that the Commission does not have competence in this area. So what we can do – and what Commissioner Vassiliou is doing assiduously – is explain to the Member States that we cannot continue the policies of the past. We have to change; we have to decide which are the areas in which we will have – or a particular university will have – a centre of excellence, and we have to put in place a real programme of university modernisation generally throughout the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Minimal checks and a high percentage of errors in projects in the 7th FP for research</span></p>
<p class="contents">From the Commissioner's answer to question <a href="/doceo/document/E-7-2010-8013_EN.html">E-8013/2010</a><a href="#def_22_1" name="ref_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>serious questions arise as to the effectiveness of the checks on the 7th FP.

<p class="contents">A precondition for carrying out the ex-post auditing activity is the availability of a sufficiently important number of cost claims submitted by the beneficiaries. For the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, or ‘FP 7 2007-2013’, the first reporting period takes place 18 months after the start of the project.</p>
<p class="contents">As a consequence, the number of FP 7 cost claims available to be audited reached critical mass only in 2010. Moreover, the Commission’s control strategy for research is designed to provide reasonable assurance on the legality and regularity of research expenditure on a multiannual basis over the whole period of the Framework Programme. As of 31 December last year the Commission has closed 345 FP 7 audits, covering 432 participations in FP 7 projects. In the same period, financial corrections amounting to EUR 4.482 million due to errors were proposed as a result of auditing EUR 88.633.047 million of FP 7 contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Research framework programmes are implemented mainly through cost- sharing grants based on the reimbursement of eligible actual costs. The main risk is that beneficiaries include ineligible costs in their costs statements. The risk is exacerbated by the conflict between the eligibility criteria and the usual cost-accounting practices of certain beneficiaries, in particular the requirement for beneficiaries to allocate personnel and indirect costs to projects while deducting various items considered ineligible for EU co-financing.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this the Commission issued, in April 2010, a Communication putting forward possibilities for the simplification of research funding rules and procedures. Simplification and clarification of rules and procedures can reduce the scope for error and increase assurance of the regularity of expenditure, but also facilitate the participation of researchers in the framework programmes and the achievement of EU research policy objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the overall consensus on a number of issues that could still be implemented under the current overall legal framework, on 24 January this year the Commission took short-term simplification actions comprising concrete measures with immediate and retroactive effect on FP7 projects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the end of the day, we accept – I think everyone has to accept – that researchers are not interested in being involved in the misuse of EU funding.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Involvement of SMEs in European research and innovation</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 9 February 2011 the Commission launched the Green Paper <span class="italic">From Challenges to Opportunities: Towards a Common Strategic Framework for EU Research and Innovation Funding</span>. Following public consultation, the Commission will develop a common strategic framework to facilitate both the guidance of research and innovation (R&amp;I) activity, to address the challenges of today’s society, and the simplification of the procedures for accessing European funds for R&amp;I, reduction of the amount of time taken to introduce the outcomes of research within the market, and greater involvement of European enterprises in R&amp;I activities. Within the context of the EU 2020 Strategy, the EU has set itself the target of the funds allocated to R&amp;I activities reaching 3% of GDP by 2020. Because the private sector has a low level of financing for R&amp;I, I would like to ask the Commission: what measures does it envisage to stimulate the involvement of this sector in the funding of European R&amp;I? What measures does the Commission envisage to help SMEs overcome the difficulties encountered in accessing European funds for R&amp;I? Does the Commission plan to allocate a European funding quota solely for SMEs? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a priority for the Commission, as stated in the Communication on Innovation Union adopted on 6 October last, in the Small Business Act for Europe adopted in June 2008 and in the review of the Small Business Act adopted on 23 February this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Green Paper ‘From Challenges to Opportunities: towards a common strategic framework for EU Research and Innovation funding’, identified the key questions for future EU research and innovation support, including a number of specific questions on how to better meet the needs of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">An overall aim of the common strategic framework is to make participation in EU programmes more simple and attractive, in particular for SMEs. For the future, important elements to consider in this context are a single entry point with common IT platforms, more standardised rules, a streamlined set of funding instruments that cover the full innovation chain, and simpler and more consistent procedures for receiving funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Green Paper consultation, the Commission will bring forward its legislative proposals for the common strategic framework by the end of this year. We have already introduced in the latest Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) work programmes – a number of measures specifically targeting SMEs, including earmarked budgets. The budgetary share of SMEs is forecast to grow from the current 14.3 % to over the 15 % target foreseen in the legislation. SMEs need support on their doorstep. Easier access to FP7 is provided by the Enterprise Europe network, a partnership between the Commission and nearly 600 business organisations such as chambers of commerce of industry, chambers of crafts, innovation agencies and regional development agencies. More precisely, based on agreed guidelines, this network, together and in cooperation with the national contact points of FP7, assists SMEs by providing support for awareness raising, capacity building for participation in the framework programme, engaging new SMEs in the proposals, partner search, joint actions addressed to SMEs and conducting consultations on inclusion of SME-related call topics in work programmes. Several hundred SMEs were able to submit FP7 proposals with the support of the network. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One is allowing more flexibility as to how personnel costs are calculated. Another is that SME owners whose salaries were not formally registered in their accounts can now be reimbursed through flat-rate payments. And a new steering group of senior officials, taken from right across the Commission services, is involved in removing inconsistencies. This is very important for the application of the rules that are there already.</p>
<p class="contents">We designed an e-learning platform specifically targeted at SMEs. It is going to go online this year, and it aims to facilitate the access of SMEs to R&amp;D projects. The exploration of its results will offer free online training and customised information and, very importantly, a communication forum. All of those taken together improve substantially the situation for SMEs and obviously, under the common strategic framework, I have no doubt that we will get other very good ideas about what else we might be able to do to help them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Apart from promoting good practices at the implementation committee meetings amongst other fora, the Commission focuses its efforts on checking if compliance with the limit values set in the directive has truly been met.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1996, the directive has required that Member States develop and implement an overall strategy, including long and short-term measures. The latter category is particularly relevant to address situations where there is risk of exceeding the particulate matter PM 10 limit values, for example. Plans must be prepared as soon as the limit values plus the margin of tolerance are exceeded, to show how compliance will be reached by the attainment date.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the air quality plans have to be communicated to the Commission within two years of the exceeded limit measured, the competence and responsibility for deciding on the measures to be included in the air quality plans rests entirely with the Member States. This is in line with the subsidiarity principle and acknowledges the fact that national and/or local authorities are best placed to identify the most efficient and tailor-made measures to address high concentration levels in their air quality zones.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s compliance checking focuses mainly on whether limit values are met, less so on how they are met. The latest data submitted by Germany for the year 2009 confirm that 70 out of about 80 air quality zones continue to show an excess for PM limit values. Most zones were granted an extension of the compliance date until 11 June this year because they had prepared an air quality plan with a clear timetable and measures showing how compliance will be met by the exceedance deadline. Munich is one of these zones. The time extension was granted, provided that the competent authorities adjust the air quality plan to include short-term measures that are effective for controlling and, where necessary, suspending activities that contribute to the risk of the limit values being exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as NO<span class="sub">2</span> is concerned, the Commission expects that many Member States will face similar problems as with PM. Exceedances prior to 2010, possibly extended to the end of 2014, do not constitute a breach of European legislation at the current time but trigger the requirement to prepare an air quality plan. Member States have until the end of September 2011 to submit the data for the year 2010. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that owing to geographical conditions, sometimes cities like Milan in Italy have a more difficult job to reach the same criteria than other cities. However, it is of the utmost importance that all citizens in the European Union be guaranteed the same level of health and protection. That is the issue in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, if there are issues that are locally or regionally specific, we award attention to that and we do try to address these issues in a collaborative way with the authorities so that we find the proper solutions. Our aim is always to target and find a solution – to be strictly helpful and helpfully strict, if you like.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the second question, we normally do not give specific recommendations to any of the cities or regions, simply because we believe that the authorities there are much better placed and know the situation better than we do. We do check if compliance is met, but normally the kind of standardised approach that gives good results is a mixture of various measures, some which are more short-term orientated and others are more structural. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are aiming for adoption in early May. Because the draft strategy is still under internal consultation within the Commission, I am not able to provide many details on its contents. I can however reassure you that it responds to both the EU’s ambitious mandate set by the Council last year and to the global commitments the EU signed up to in Nagoya last October in the framework of the Convention of Biological Diversity.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />The strategy will be developed around six sub-targets focusing on tackling some of the main drivers of biodiversity laws and the pressures exerted on biodiversity: nature conservation, restoration and green infrastructure, agriculture and forestry, fisheries, invasive species and the European Union’s contribution to global biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy will benefit substantially from implementation of the EU’s existing legislation, including effective and adequately financed management of the Natura 2000 network. It will also be essential to consider how reforms to the common agricultural policy and common fisheries policy and the future cohesion policy can help deliver the necessary support for this strategy. The 2020 EU headline target requires the halting of biodiversity laws and the degradation of ecosystems and the services they provide.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore assure you that the strategy will contain actions geared to reaching this objective. This will include actions aimed at stepping up implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives and ensuring significant steps are taken towards achieving a favourable conservation status for species and habitats of European importance. As regards the implementation and enforcement of the EU’s environmental legislation more generally, the Commission intends to come out with a new communication on this issue later this year. The aim is not to replace existing relevant communications but rather to improve upon them by focusing on the overall general structure and knowledge-base that underpins the implementation of this environmental acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of this initiative we will recall in detail all possible options for strengthening monitoring and control capabilities at EU level and the national inspection systems. It should be recognised that the EU’s legal framework on environmental inspection has already been improved during the last years, notably with the adoption of a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States as well as the inclusion of various provisions in sectoral environmental legislation.</p>

There are small problems with translation but we are well on track concerning the substance, and we are already planning to start preparation of the legislation after it has been signed so that we can then go on to the ratification process. It is taking some time, but I do not see any serious obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning marine protected areas, we are lagging behind still. We are trying to push things ahead, and owing to the commitments we made in Nagoya we will have to do more in Europe than at present – also owing to Natura 2000 itself and the commitments which we have made.</p>
<p class="contents">On the CAP and Natura 2000 financing, I am trying to do my best to ensure that this is represented very well in the first pillar and in the third pillar and that biodiversity gets proper attention in the future common agricultural policy. Commissioner Cioloş, Commissioner Hedegaard and myself prepared a joint letter which we sent to the last Environmental Council of Ministers. In that letter we agreed on the issues, and on the direction in which we want to go.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question by Mr Posselt, the whole Natura 2000 protection story as agreed is currently protecting 18% approximately of European land in the shape of the so-called Natura 2000 areas, and then we have two directives. One is the Birds Directive and another one is the Habitats Directive, under which it is clearly specified what is protected, how, on which level and so on. So basically it is pretty broad legislation and is not only covering some specific endangered and disappearing species or other. We want to act in such a way that we have broad protection, but the fact is that a lot of species in EU areas which have been identified as being endangered are in a pretty bad condition, so we would certainly have to do more.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of targets, the answer is pretty simple. At this moment we should not focus on the question of lowering targets, we should rather focus on the serious question of the implementation of Natura 2000, which means preparing the management plans and reserving enough financing. This will not be easy in this situation, but it is certainly a kind of financing for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject:	Waste management in Greece</span></p>
<p class="contents">In its answer of 9 August 2010 to Written Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-7-2010-3732_EN.html">E-3732/2010</a><a href="#def_22_2" name="ref_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the Commission said that it 'considers landfill disposal to be the least and last desirable manner for managing and treating waste'. In Greece there are plans to construct 61 landfill sites with cofinancing arrangements. These plans have naturally met with opposition from local residents in many areas (Lefkimi, Grammatiko and especially Keratea), who are forced to accept this ' least and last desirable' solution. According to the press, environmental organisations, political parties and local authorities, the government's persistence in seeking to impose this technology and methods for collecting and managing waste are connected with certain corporate interests, something that could result in a fresh political and economic scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission answer the following questions: Independently of the choices made by each country, does it consider it preferable from an ecological and environmental point of view to use the option proposed by environmental organisations (WWF, Greenpeace, SOS Mediterranean, and so on) that waste should be sorted by households at source rather than recycled at waste plants? Will it undertake to study these proposals without delay and send a representative to the areas concerned to hold discussions with all the bodies affected? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Janez Potočnik, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> The new Waste Framework Directive has set up a five-step hierarchy for waste management. Waste prevention is regarded as the most desirable option, followed by preparing waste for re-use, recycling and other ways of recovery, including energy recovery, with disposal such as landfill as the last resort. Deviations from the hierarchy for specific waste streams are possible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Member States departing from the hierarchy would need to provide a sound justification. Therefore, waste disposal in landfills that lie at the bottom of the waste hierarchy must be considered by the Member States as the least favourable waste management option.</p>
<p class="contents">High purity of waste materials, such as paper and glass, is a prerequisite for the use of waste as a secondary raw material by manufacturing industries. That is why separate collection of recyclable waste streams at source is usually the most favourable method of waste collection. Under the Waste Framework Directive, Member States are obliged to introduce by 2015 separate collections for paper, metal, plastic and glass. Again there is certain flexibility for Member States to adapt their waste collection systems to the specific national circumstances, notably in cases where highly efficient and advanced sorting technologies are available. In the absence of such technologies, however, separate collection at source is the cheapest and the easiest method to obtain high quality secondary raw materials from waste.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />Greece faces serious problems with illegal landfill disposal and was condemned, as you know, by the Court in 2005 due to the huge number of illegal landfills that had been operating in its territory. This issue has not been resolved yet. Nevertheless, in December 2010, the Greek authorities provided an action plan according to which all the legal landfills will be closed by the end of June this year. The Commission welcomes this plan, including the construction of new landfill sites, under the condition that this is unavoidable as a last resort option to maintain the waste disposal network that meets mandatory sanitary standards in line with European legal requirements.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />The construction of landfills complying with the standards of the EU Landfill Directive is already progress compared to the practice of illegal dumping of waste. The Commission urges the Greek authorities to complete their planning and the construction of the landfill sites – programmes that benefit already from EU funds. However, Greece must steadily go beyond these measures and move away from landfill as a predominant waste management option towards a modern waste management policy based on waste recovery and recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the latest Eurostat statistics, in Greece around 82% of municipal waste is land-filled whereas the average in the European Union is 38%. Additionally, the performance of the recycling sector in Greece is very low and only 17% of municipal waste is recycled.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the waste directive is a top priority both for the Commission and for me personally. We will monitor the national waste policies through the assessment of the Member States’ waste management plans. We are waiting for an updated waste management plan from Greece. In addition, we are carefully monitoring the implementation of the Greek action plan and the process of closing all the illegal landfills, including the plan for the EU-funded projects.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also monitor the use of EU funding to ensure that the projects to be financed are consistent with the objectives and requirements defined in our waste legislation. In the case of Greece, it is essential to reduce landfill and to increase recycling rates through separate collection and recyclable materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Proper waste management should be seen as an opportunity as it can create business and jobs across the country. It is also essential to achieve the new resource sufficiency objectives through the application of best practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, tomorrow I am flying to Greece, where I will be on a two-day full visit and we will, of course, discuss all these questions in detail there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will be having a debate on the first day with three committees from the Hellenic Parliament and we will certainly discuss this issue too. I am aware of that and of the seriousness of the issue. Maybe I could tell you why we are actually in favour and we are even co-financing some of the landfill, even if we do believe that this is on the lowest level of the preferred options in the waste hierarchy.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and absolutely most important thing that must be considered of course is human health, so we have to be sure that this is protected by all means. I think it is important that we definitely look for and try to find the best possible options but sometimes it is simply necessary to go step by step.</p>
<p class="contents">I have seen from the data I receive from all across Europe that once a country starts seriously on separate collections, the route to very high levels of recycling and very low levels of municipal land filling is very short. So separate collection is the fundamental thing and when this is done well then things can move fast. But sometimes, unfortunately, land filling is still the only possible option and, if we want to take care of human health in this context, we simply have to provide that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the fact that there is a similar regulation, European political parties have not enjoyed a statute in keeping with the Lisbon Treaty and the European Union in the past, by which I mean a statute as defined in Article 10(4) of the Treaty of Lisbon, which talks of political parties at European level helping to form European political awareness and express the will of the citizens of the Union. Obviously, this does not mean that European parties will operate as international non-governmental organisations at the level of the Belgian State. That is why, having accepted the Secretary-General’s report on party funding and his proposal to create a statute and the European Parliament’s proposal in the previous 2003 report on the need for such a statute – except that the Treaty of Lisbon had not yet been adopted then – and, finally, the Bureau’s decision of 10 January, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, following a serious hearing with all the political parties, chairmen and secretaries at European level and distinguished professors of economic and constitutional law and following a hearing of Transparency International and the EU Court of Auditors, approved this report, which calls on the European Commission to table a corresponding proposal, so that we can have a real European statute for political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, this statute will have certain criteria, as defined in the report: national parties in at least seven countries or regions, where the regional authorities of those countries have legislative powers, must be members. At the same time, a distinction will be made between recognition of European parties and their funding. In order to obtain funding, they must have elected at least one MEP. Of course, individuals, simple citizens, as well as parties, will be able to join.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals cover not only European political parties, but also their foundations. They call – and this is important – for a legal, political and fiscal status for European parties, within the framework and under the aegis, of course, of the European legal statute and European laws in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Constitutional Affairs debated the issue at length and arrived at this proposal, with slight differentiations, of course, which are shown in the amendments. Basically, it arrived at the conclusion that this is a question of strengthening democracy, of achieving a stronger presence for citizens within the European institutions by creating such a statute and, of course, as regards the question of funding, it stipulates that 10% should come from own resources and that donors should be able to give EUR 25 000, rather than the current EUR 12 000. Thank you, Mr President. Naturally, I hope that plenary will vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Mrs Giannakou for preparing this own-initiative report.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Commission consider that report to be a very important one. We know that European political parties play an important role in European integration. In particular they contribute to ensuring that political issues are presented and discussed from the European perspective in time, before the elections to the European Parliament, thus avoiding situations where these elections are dominated by purely national issues, which, as we well know, is very often liable to be the case. I therefore welcome the forward-looking tone of the report and look forward to discussing its content tonight and in the future as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 12 of Regulation (EC) 2004/2003 stipulates that the European Parliament shall publish by 15 February 2011 a report on the application of this regulation and the activities funded. The report shall indicate, where appropriate, possible amendments to be made to the funding system. We welcome, as I said, Mrs Giannakou’s own-initiative report and the accompanying resolution as a positive step, but it must be underlined that information on the actual implementation of the current regulation and the activities funded could be more precise and improved.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context and in the light of the vote by Parliament tomorrow, the Commission could be called upon to act through a further revision of Regulation (EC) 2004/2003 and the Financial Regulation, or through new legislation. Should Parliament come to the conclusion that the relevant existing legislation requires modifications, or that new legislation is required, the Commission will seriously examine these conclusions and, if it agrees, will take the necessary initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also reflect on how Regulation (EC) 2004/2003 could be further improved in the longer term in order to support the development of stronger and genuinely transnational political parties and foundations at European level, with a view to developing a truly political European public space.</p>
<p class="contents">On the specific issue of a legal statute for European political parties, I am aware that this is not the first time that Parliament has called for such a statute. This issue is addressed in some detail in a study that was commissioned by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) and I believe that the study itself clearly demonstrates that a range of complicated constitutional, political and practical issues are at stake with regard to establishing such a statute. The matter therefore requires a very careful and detailed analysis indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">The same can be said about some of the other issues brought up in the report. For the proposals that would require amendments to the Financial Regulation, the Commission also sees the need for a wider reflection on legislative solutions and the timing of the possible changes.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mrs Giannakou’s report and the accompanying draft resolution raise issues that are at the heart of European integration and its democratic nature, and which therefore need our full attention. I look forward to the debate on those issues tonight and in the future as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we talk about political parties, we must take two problems into consideration. Firstly, parties are not much esteemed in any country. Secondly, when European elections take place, political parties are generally considered to pursue the interests of their national state and not the interests of Europe as a whole. At the level of public opinion, there is therefore a lack of positive esteem either for the parties or for their function in relation to the forging of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore act urgently. Not only in the Treaty of Lisbon, as has already been noted, but in many constitutions, in almost all European constitutions, the function of the parties is considered to be of national interest, and thus crucial in the creation of democracy and the pursuit of common interests. It is important to stress that I am speaking about constitutions, and not ordinary laws, and that thus I am referring to the fundamental structures of the States and the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">It is thus pressing that we define a statute for parties that are truly European-facing, and not only an algebraic sum of individual national formations that have no permanent European structure on the ground. We need to see parties that think and act in a European context instead. The need I am describing is much more pressing if we really do want to see a uniform European electoral law which, hopefully, could even lead to a single European constituency to sit alongside the national constituencies. This will increase the individual European citizen’s sense of belonging to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to the core of my argument. As has already been emphasised – and I thank the Commissioner in advance – my committee has worked very hard, holding hearings and many meetings, but we need a proposal, an initiative from the European Commission, which brings together European parties within the law of the Union with a new legal form under public law, with a legal personality that is also valid in all Member States and with a uniform structure that allows them to act as representatives of the European public interest. I thank Mrs Giannakou and the Commissioner for their pledges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">European democracy is genuinely representative democracy. The edifice of representative democracy has remained steady ever since, in the mid-19th century, the expansion of suffrage made real the promise of the liberal revolutions to give the people representation, so that they could control their own destinies. The representative edifice has firm foundations, but from time to time it needs reforms and new ways to express itself with greater quality. An example of that would be the work that Parliament has done on adopting the Citizens’ Initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, democracy has never survived without free representation, and representation has never been free without plural competition. It is political parties that enable this plural representation. In democracy, the parties express pluralism and are fundamental instruments of political participation: they contribute to shaping public opinion; they offer alternatives, and general and sectoral government programmes; they coordinate and harmonise social interests; and they contribute to communication between the demands of the people and those who govern.</p>
<p class="contents">As a theorist of political parties has correctly pointed out,  parties did not develop to communicate the needs of the rulers to the people, but rather to communicate the aspirations of the citizens to the rulers.</p>
<p class="contents">We now need this, which has worked at national level, to work at European level. It is therefore a case of providing a framework and opportunities for European political parties to carry out at European level the functions that they have been carrying out in the national arena. The most essential thing to achieving that is for parties to have legal status, and that is what this report is proposing: parties that have a territorial presence and that, at the same time, conduct themselves according to democratic rules; and a differentiation between recognition of the parties and financing, which requires popular support.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we expect the Commission to set in motion the mechanism to perfect the currently imperfect situation of regulation of political parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Regulating European parties means nowadays creating a civic space without borders. In this respect, the Giannakou report is an invitation to reform-minded politicians. The plans outlined in this report are important. They will help turn European parties into a real instrument for enhancing participatory governance in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no coincidence that almost 100 amendments were tabled for this report. As a result of the joint efforts made, seven compromise versions were produced, supported by all the parliamentary groups. I think that the interest in the report in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was kindled by the notion of the European party system becoming even more flexible, attractive and logical, not to mention suitable for the processes in Europe, by establishing a general political, legal and fiscal status for European parties.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not about organising parties according to a single, standardised structure, but about following a more general model. The basic differences between parties and foundations also still apply, but there are new opportunities for greater synergy in their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report and the expected subsequent developments must change the familiar status quo whereby current parties are simply organisations of national parties and do not have any direct link with the electorate in Member States. Based on this aspiration, it is recommended to start examining the conditions for direct individual membership and the participation of natural persons in the party’s internal operation and even in the party’s management.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of sensitive issues are raised in this report. For example, a proper distinction is made between the criteria for founding a political party and those for funding it. The report should be supported so that the Commission can start creating a new section in the Financial Regulation devoted solely to the funding of European parties and foundations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason I would like to thank Mrs Giannakou most sincerely for her report. We worked together very closely on this. We did not agree on all the points to begin with. However, we are happy to sign up to the final result.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out a couple of areas that were particularly important to us during the debate. One of them is the fact that we believe that parties who wish to participate in the democratic process must also be democratic in their structures. This applies in particular to the election of party organs, the selection of candidates and the drawing up of lists and has now been included in paragraph 5. I believe this represents enormous progress. The same goes for a series of other points which I do not intend to mention here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to refer briefly to the most important point: the requirement that a party should already have one member in the European Parliament. This was originally required in order to receive recognition and funding. This condition now only applies to the funding issue. This was very important to us because recognition and funding must be very clearly separated. Recognition means that there must be free competition so that new parties with new issues and new faces can be formed in Europe. This should not be subject to excessive constraints. However, when it comes to the question of funding, this can, of course, be linked to a certain minimum level of electoral success. Accordingly, we can also agree to this, even if we would have liked to have worked this point out more clearly, which is why we intend to table an amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you take the ‘<span class="italic">demos</span>’ out of democracy you are left only with the ‘<span class="italic">kratos</span>’, with the power of a system that must compel by force of law what it may not ask in the name of civic patriotism.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot create the institutions of functioning representative government by bureaucratic fiat. We have tried it in the European Union. We have created all the attributes and trappings: the European Parliament, the political parties, the elections and so on, but you cannot make people feel European in the same sense that somebody might feel Norwegian, Japanese, French, Portuguese or whatever it is.</p>
<p class="contents">A party should grow organically because its members recognise a community of identity and common interests. It is not something that we can do with public funding or at the stroke of a bureaucrat’s pen. So, to be clear, the ECR opposes this legislation, we oppose the concept of having transnational parties. We form some of our constituent members into an alliance of parties but we oppose the single statute. We oppose the increases in the budget – which seems to me an extraordinary allocation of resources in the present economic climate – and I oppose my compatriot and my friend Andrew Duff’s idea that these transnational parties should be allowed to spend effectively EU money in national referendum campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">You will not create Europeans by spending public money. Not all the gold in all our national treasuries put together can serve to convince people of a false idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mrs Giannakou’s report shows, this approach also involves the further development of European parties, which, although they have been an everyday political reality in Europe for many years, until now have not been equal partners and players in terms of their democratic influence on EU policy. We need political parties at EU level too that are firmly rooted in the societies they represent and that can play a strong role in the elections to the European Parliament and in establishing European openness, based on internal democratic structures and regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to this particular report, I must say that I would have liked the rapporteur to have shown a great deal more courage by using the Parliament’s right of initiative to take a truly significant step in developing the political system and the party system in the European Union. This is a step that many citizens have been waiting for and that will encourage them to get involved. The interlocking European and national decision-making levels and the relations between the political parties could have been addressed more clearly as a common factor that is transparent and open to influence.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament should now decisively call on the Commission and Council to take the initiative in this regard. I would expect constructive cooperation from the Commission and Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Are we really in a process of creating a European <span class="italic">demos</span>, as my honourable colleague Mr Hannan just told us? I do not know, I am not venturing that far. I think what we want to do at this particular moment is to strengthen the nascent European public space and basically invigorate the debate on European issues. I mean, the idea in this House is to bring European citizens closer to what we are discussing here and what could be simpler then basically starting to discuss European issues with them.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, I can only speak for myself, but I am no bureaucrat – I am a directly elected member of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate is actually to increase the visibility of European political parties, to which we all belong regardless of whether we are sitting on the Left, in the Centre or on the Right of this House. To bring them out of the shade, because at the moment no one really knows what they do, what is their status, whether they produce any added value – and we in the EPP believe that they do. That is the possibility, to actually have some programme presentation and in the future hopefully to fight European elections on European issues and not get bogged down in national rhetoric all the time.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is positive on three counts. First of all, it brings a certain balance between operational authority within the parliamentary groups and a clear link with what we do in this House, linking funding to presence in this House – in the European Parliament. Secondly, it brings organisational convergence between European political parties and European foundations, which is quite laudable, and thirdly it tightens and clarifies the funding of European political parties, which I think should be the goal for us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU not only has a single market, its own legislature, an elected body of representatives and its own judicial system. Political parties at the European level have also been in existence for a long time now. They are not just federations of national parties. They have their own agenda, a European agenda, and they are an integral part of European political life. The strengthening of political parties at the European level reinforces participatory administration in the EU, and thereby ultimately democracy as well.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, I welcome the presented proposal to reform the statutes and funding of political parties at the Union level, and I would also like to thank you personally, Mr Vice-President, for your cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now very important for political parties to get a common and single legal statute. We must do away with the differences between the system for political parties and the rules applied to European institutions. This is possible on the basis of introducing a common political, legal and fiscal statute for political parties at the European level. It would also be appropriate to consider whether the right to establish such a party should be restricted to political parties operating at the national or regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of a funding system is also appropriate. The system for approving funding for political parties at the European level should be simplified. It should be possible to perform financial inspections, in order to maintain transparency. A transparent and secure environment for the operation and funding of European political parties is also a desirable and welcome step for the citizens of EU Member States. It may help them in their everyday lives. A statute of the European political parties is a significant step forwards towards greater interaction with citizens, more democracy and greater public interest in European issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mrs Giannakou’s report is on the right lines in terms of making the activities of European political parties and their foundations simpler and more straightforward. It will ease the burden of the conditions required in return for obtaining public funding and will broaden the options for making use of this funding. We are particularly in favour of the possibility for the foundations to act outside EU territory also.</p>
<p class="contents">However, alongside this general approach, which encourages and extends provisions supporting a stronger European democracy, one of the measures goes in the opposite direction and restricts the freedom of European political parties. Among the criteria for recognising a European political party’s basis in a Member State, the regulation will now require the party to have elected representatives sitting in a regional assembly that has legislative powers.</p>
<p class="contents">My party is specific to Corsica. It is a member of the European Free Alliance (ALE), which has been a European political party since it began. We obtained 26% of the vote in Corsica and have a large body of members on the Corsica Regional Assembly. However, since France refuses to grant the Corsican Assembly legislative powers, even if our party were to gain a majority on the island it would not count towards the criteria for the ALE. This provision is to be deplored. We wanted to draw your attention to this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Political parties and foundations have become participants in the political life of the EU, and as such they should be subject to appropriate regulations which prevent abuse. In certain cases, however, supranational structures aim to have too much influence over politics in the sovereign Member States. For example, I am concerned at the announced intervention of EU parties in domestic matters. As a Polish politician, I could not agree to a situation in which one or several of the European political parties were to organise a referendum campaign in my country, for example, using EU funds to achieve a specific result, for example in the referendum on my country’s accession to the euro area. Similar fears may be harboured by politicians in other countries, for example the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also opposed to demands to increase spending on European political parties, using money from taxpayers’ pockets. This is all the more true since the government in my country is halving subsidies for national political parties and preventing the opposition from reaching the public. Let us first support national parties, and then international ones. After all, the European Union is a Europe of nation states. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, a political party is not merely the party apparatus; it is much more than that. One of the truly major democratic challenges we face is the fact that political parties are reflecting the population as a whole to an ever decreasing extent. This is demonstrated, among other things, by the fact that political parties are losing members. Many countries have chosen to compensate for this by increasing government subsidies to the parties. However, higher government subsidies are no guarantee of a closer connection between the parties’ leadership and apparatus on the one hand and the parties’ membership on the other. On the contrary, the risk of an independent bureaucratic apparatus developing is greater the more financially independent from their members the parties’ apparatus becomes. I therefore have to say that I am sceptical about the idea of European parties approved by the EU and supported by payments from it. This is not because I have anything against European parties. European parties should grow politically, organisationally and financially from the bottom up. If this is not possible it is probably because there is not enough support. There is no shortcut to democracy, not even when it comes to establishing European parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliaments are the motors of democracy and political parties are the fuel.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in our Parliament, we complain all the time about citizens’ disinterest in the European Union. We lament the abstention rate in European elections and ‘No’ votes in referendums. If we want real European democracy, we must take a serious look at the place we want to give to European political parties in the European space we are trying to build.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already done a good deal with the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Citizens’ Initiative. We must now give European political parties the resources they need to achieve their ambitions. Please note that I do not think these resources should be a vehicle for allowing the big parties to turn into immovable hegemonies. Small organisations should also be able to take part in the debate. This is important if we are to combat the parties’ negative image among citizens and their image as the unpopular face of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is essential to clearly establish the conditions on funding and transparent management of funding if we are to strengthen the European public space we are trying to create. The initiative must be inclusive, so that the larger parties are not favoured to the detriment of the smaller parties and vice versa.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I would like to deal with relates to the continuity we will be creating between the European, national and regional levels. The European regulations we will be introducing must be capable of fitting in with the different national legal frameworks on the subject, to ensure that the different levels do indeed mesh with each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also need to look very closely at what paragraph 23 of the report says, because by extension we need to think about the links that European parties would be able to form with parties in the rest of the world. We must be able to share our democratic values with our partners in the rest of the world, because the globalised world in which we live today requires political decision-makers to come up with solutions to problems together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the job of our politicians’ to encourage citizens to take an interest in the European Union, to make it more understandable and accessible and to involve them in decision making. However, to that end it is necessary to regulate the activities of European political parties and foundations in a clear and uniform manner, and to ensure that the internal functioning of such parties is democratic. As enablers for democracy these political parties must have a uniform legal and fiscal status, which would ensure that European citizens have a better understanding of political parties and are better represented. It is particularly important for the formation of political parties’ internal management bodies to be based on transparent principles, in order to ensure the democratic election of all party bodies and democratic decision-making processes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In future, these parties will be based on a European legal statute and will have a European legal personality. As liberals, we have campaigned to ensure that a clear distinction is made between recognition as a European party and an entitlement to funding, as there was a certain greed in evidence. It is also important that European parties should follow democratic principles in their internal workings, something that cannot be taken for granted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To my mind, it is unacceptable that the costs of political foundations should be increasing at a rate of over 30% year on year. In 2009, EUR 6.3 million was spent; by 2012 this will have doubled to EUR 12.3 million. Some might say that if you object to this, why does your Foundation accept funding? Well, the answer to that is quite simply that any funds we do not accept are distributed among the foundations of the other political groups; we would be funding the activities of our political opponents. We need to find a way of returning money to our national exchequers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The policies being applied are angering and disappointing our citizens and the decision-making procedures discourage their participation, as the recent European elections demonstrated. That is why, subject to certain preconditions, European political parties, with their specific political attributes, may help the public to become more pro-active in seeking solutions for the benefit of the people, not the financially strong. Therefore the rules of political and legal recognition and the necessary funding must facilitate their action to freely develop their policies and their alternative proposals – because that is the essence of democracy – and they must not be influenced by outside political or economic restrictions. That is why I have reservations about certain points in the report, insofar as they might be used as restrictions on the free and independent organisation and action of political parties.</p>

We are here because we believe that the European Union, as it currently exists, does not serve the interests of the Netherlands. We are not opposed to the European Union, we just want it to restrict itself to economic cooperation. For us, Mr President, a European political union is therefore completely unthinkable.

<p class="contents">Mr President, the provision in the Treaty of Lisbon which states – and I quote – that political parties at European level contribute to forming European political awareness and to expressing the will of citizens of the Union is an absurd and out-of-touch statement. It does not interest the citizens, and quite rightly so. Between them, the European political parties received around EUR 67 million in European subsidies between 2004 and 2010. This is a completely senseless pouring of taxpayers’ money down the drain. A political party must, by definition, be able to function without subsidies, and that includes European political parties.

It is simply staggering for me to have listened and to see how greatly removed the debate is from the agenda of ordinary citizens. Mr Duff quite rightly acknowledges that there is a gap to fill between the European powers and the individual citizens. That is absolutely right, but that gap will not be filled by developing European parties and, as another contributor to the debate has said, giving those parties the resources to match their ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would challenge Mr Duff to go to his constituency at the weekend and try to sell those views to local community groups that have had their funding cut because of austerity measures imposed by his coalition government in the United Kingdom.

<p class="contents">The exchange of views clearly demonstrated as well how sensitive these issues are and, therefore, if this House approves this proposed legislative resolution tomorrow, the Commission will respect its commitment stemming from the framework agreement and will respond to this resolution within three months.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as you may have felt from this debate, it is quite clear that this would be a very sensitive, elaborate, political and legal task because there are a lot of issues that are both legally and politically very sensitive. Our preliminary analyses on the statute of the European political parties is in this direction but, of course, we now need to study very carefully the legal basis, potential legal form and, as we see now, we would most probably need a separate legal act on this issue. That is because the revising of the regulation from 2003-2004 would simply not be sufficient because it targeted the funding issue and not the issue of the statute of the political groups. So this would be one angle, which we would have to look at very carefully.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers raised the question of amending the Financial Regulation. Here, again, we would need to look very carefully at the requirements, scope and the timing and we certainly took very careful note of the calls in this report for more flexibility. As you know, we already took some steps in 2007 and we will examine these proposals very carefully. However, it is quite clear that it might be very difficult to agree on the changes and have them incorporated into the current revision of the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Parliament is a legislator and is free to raise this issue in the current ongoing interinstitutional process, if it so wishes. My thanks again, Mr President, and we are certainly looking forward to the ensuing debate on this issue once the resolution has been adopted and the Commission’s response has been prepared. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I think that it is important to repeat that, as far as the funding procedure is concerned, the parties will not seek more funding and that the amendment to the 2007 regulation has brought about greater transparency, as Transparency International itself has admitted. Secondly, it is only fair that the parties should seek a European statute and to bring their statute into line with the European institutions and with European legislation and this is, of course, intended to satisfy the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, creating a secure and transparent environment for the operation and funding of parties is a deeply democratic act.

To achieve genuine democracy, we need to have a European political space in the true sense of the term, and political parties at European level are a key instrument for attaining this goal. The proposals for reforming the regulation on the rules governing European political parties and their funding, which feature in this report, mark a step towards streamlining how they operate. I think that they can fulfil their role much better if they enjoy a uniform political and legal status based on European law. The current system where these parties have a legal personality based on national legislation does not offer the conditions which are most conducive to ensuring effective communication between these parties and the electorate in the 27 Member States. Introducing a European statute would help political parties at European level to adapt to any reform of the electoral system for the European elections, which is currently under discussion. Furthermore, I welcome the move to facilitate the involvement of European political parties in campaigns for referendums relating to European issues at Member State level. In most cases, these referendums are dominated by purely domestic issues. The involvement of European parties could help redirect the debates towards the real issues of these referendums. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although Parliament is acquiring increasing powers there has been no reduction in its democratic deficit due to citizens’ ever declining participation in European Parliament elections. Political parties at European level are essential instruments of parliamentary democracy, raising European political awareness, promoting interest in EU affairs and expressing the will of the citizens of the European Union. I therefore agree entirely with the rapporteur that it is necessary to enhance the situation of political parties at European level and prepare a clear and uniform legal status and financing model for them. Such parties should not remain foreign bodies. Currently the role of European political parties in the public sphere is rather limited. They are merely umbrella organisations for national parties and not directly in touch with the electorate. The new legal status of such parties in the European Union would ensure organisational uniformity and provide the opportunity to carry out its role more effectively. I would like to stress that we must continue to strive for the creation of a safe and transparent environment for party funding. Party funding should not be based purely on grants, we must also promote funding from our own resources, which are a sign of party vitality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These parties are supposed to become the representatives of the ‘European public interest’, but if you ask any two Members of this Parliament what that is, they will each answer differently. Who will determine this interest? Parliament? The Commission? Members are not nominated by EU institutions, however, but elected by the citizens of the Member States. It is my duty to represent actual citizens, not what the EU institutions consider to be the ‘European public interest’. Nor do I agree that European parties should also operate at regional and national levels. They simply do not have a mandate for that. If they start doing that, they will get into conflict with the parties on whose ballots we were all elected, and with the voters represented by these parties. My loyalty belongs to my voters, not to a European political party. That is called a free mandate. I therefore completely disagree with the philosophy of super parties presented in this report. It is another attempt by the social euro-engineers, who are so obsessed with the utopian super-state that they ignore common sense. If they listened to common sense, they would realise that the stubborn assertion of such proposals demolishes the foundations on which European integration stands. As a staunch European, I must therefore vote against this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title23"></a><a name="creitem23"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>− <span class="italic">(PT) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the external strand of the common fisheries policy (CFP) has taken on particular importance, as it is no longer possible to guarantee that our fisheries-product needs can be met on the basis of our fish resources alone. The European fishing industry can only provide for 40% of our self-sufficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009, we imported EUR 15.5 billion worth of fisheries products and only exported EUR 2.5 billion worth, which means that, without bilateral agreements with third countries, 3 000 boats would be brought to a standstill and 40 000 jobs would be lost. However, the external strand of the CFP also has positive aspects for our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast with many of our international competitors, the European Union does not limit itself to exchanging fish for money. The values that we support are behind the agreements we conclude, whether in terms of human rights, or respect for the sustainability of resources. According to the Treaty, the Union’s exclusive competence with regard to the preservation of biological resources applies to managing fishing activities by EU fleets in non-EU waters. The main objective of the activities that are part of the CFP’s external dimension is to expand the principles of sustainable and responsible fishing internationally. As I mentioned before, the other objectives currently guiding the external dimension of the CFP of maintaining an EU fleet presence at an international level and ensuring that this fleet supplies the EU market are becoming increasingly less relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this context that the report of which I am the rapporteur, which we are discussing here today, on the fishing agreement with the Union of the Comoros needs to be understood. It is an agreement concerning 70 European boats’ right of access to Comorian waters in exchange for a financial contribution of around EUR 600 000 per year. Around half of this amount should be channelled into developing the fisheries sector on which around 30 000 of the 800 000 inhabitants of the country depend; it should be recalled that the country has practically no other resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement provides for mechanisms for controlling catches, for employing of local crews, and for a clause relating to suspension or review if cases of human rights violations occur. It is to be remembered that this small country, independent from France since 1975, has already experienced several <span class="italic">coups d’état</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the above, I propose that the adoption of this agreement, and I would draw attention to the various recommendations that I make, specifically those relating to the need to improve significantly the evaluation of results.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take the opportunity to use the minute remaining to refer to another aspect of another report: that of Mrs Grelier, with which I do not agree, and which has given rise, jointly with other Members, to the tabling of a draft amendment. I am referring to the amendment seeking to permit fishing for hake and monkfish with trammel nets to continue in areas 8, 9 and 10, along the Portuguese coast, which was banned by Commission decision from 1 October 2010, as I believe that this has an adverse effect on certain populations of sharks caught with them, although no scientific study has been carried out to verify this.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, the aforementioned amendment would propose that this decision be abrogated until 2012, so that the Portuguese authorities can complete scientific studies determining whether or not this decision is justified. This position is also backed by the European Economic and Social Committee, which is why I am calling on Parliament to endorse it, in order to be fair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It constitutes an important European Union financial instrument in the area of fisheries. Together with the European Fisheries Fund, these represent the two main instruments for applying the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the adoption of this regulation in 2006, a number of elements of related supplementary legislation have been gradually amended, which is the reason for now amending this regulation in order to ensure consistency between all elements of the legislative framework. The Commission also believes that, in some cases, experience has demonstrated the need to ensure that the provisions of the regulation be adapted slightly to provide a better response to needs. I therefore propose a limited scope for this revision, with the objectives and structure of the original regulation essentially being retained.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while maintaining this essentially limited scope, we also believe it would be useful to propose certain additional amendments, which, although quite specific, could contribute to bringing this legislation more into line with recent changes in the sector and with its future prospects. The debate that took place before and during the drafting of the report contributed a great deal to the final result, as did the opinions and proposals of the shadow rapporteurs and other Members, all of whom I would like to mention and acknowledge at this point, and thank for their participation.</p>
<p class="contents">Among these proposed amendments, included in the report, I would highlight, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the reference to safeguarding coastal fishing activities, and the possibility of financing the development, in addition to the purchase, by Member States of new technology for use in the fisheries sector, such as equipment and software, and computer networks enabling sampling methods to be designed, managed, validated, analysed and developed, as well as the data relating to fishing to be exchanged.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of aquaculture, I would point to the possibility of introducing financing of the collection, management and use of environmental data in addition to the socioeconomic data previously provided for, thus promoting environmental and health monitoring and evaluation in this sector, in order to contribute to its sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to draw attention at this point to the three additional amendments that we are proposing to this report. There is currently widespread and growing recognition of the importance of fisheries management supported by up-to-date and thorough scientific knowledge of the status of stocks. This is an essential condition for its sustainable development. For this reason, we propose the inclusion of the possibility of increasing the EU co-financing rates provided for in the area of the collection, management and use of scientific data, both basic and supplementary, on the status of fish stocks. The proposal is to increase the ceiling from 50% to 60%.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, with regard to control activities, we propose a similar increase in the maximum possible EU co-financing rate, while maintaining the Commission prerogatives already in place regarding the possibility of financing some actions at higher rates. All of this comes in a framework where Member States and their control authorities play and should continue to play a key role in the steering and implementation of control measures within their waters.</p>
<p class="contents">These amendments result from an attempt at compromise, taking into account the objections raised by various groups, with regard to the 75% ceiling initially considered. They are backed by our group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left, and by a series of Members from other political groups, which indicates their importance and the consensus that, I believe, unites these Members, and could also unite them during voting in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report has aroused lively debate, given the huge significance of the technical measures, as they will influence the way fishermen and the sector as a whole do their work, by setting out the methods fishermen may use to catch fish in the zones covered by this regulation, with a view to protecting juveniles and restoring stocks: an aim shared by all, and by fishermen in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of this report is sensitive and controversial, as demonstrated by the difficulties the Commission has come up against since 2008 in trying to reach an agreement with the Council on the future of these measures. This was when only those two institutions were involved in the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, technical measures are governed by an old regulation that was amended by a succession of transitional measures and then renewed until 30 June 2011 as no agreement was reached with the Council on the Commission’s 2008 proposal for a new regulation, which was aimed at simplifying and clarifying the existing legislation to ensure the rules were implemented more effectively and to cater for the fisheries’ regional features.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, as the new deadline approaches the situation is radically different. Since the Treaty of Lisbon, for the most part the subject of fisheries now falls under the ordinary legislative procedure, whereby Parliament has an important part to play as co-legislator. It fully intends to play its part by bringing the fishermen’s points of view and those of EU policy-makers closer together. As an elected representative from a port town, I am always struck by how the fishing sector mistrusts and sees itself as remote from the common fisheries policy (CFP), whereas farmers for example clearly feel themselves to be more a part of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Added to this, the fishing sector is in crisis. There is growing dissatisfaction. The real challenge is the balance that must be found between the sector’s economic stability and hence the guarantee of decent incomes for fishermen and the sustainability and replenishment of fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the expiration of the regulation comes at a time when talks on the reform of the common fisheries policy are starting. This reform must adopt a bold framework and must get the fishing community, consumers and citizens on board. It must involve the whole sector in the scientific analyses that form the basis for the quotas and hence the sector’s level of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">This new framework presupposes that the Commission will draw up a concrete proposal on the future technical measures, an effort which at present both it and the Council appear to have been saving themselves. The new proposal must make provision to ensure that the technical measures are in keeping with real experience on the ground, through consultation with those working in the sector. It must also be in keeping with the new regulation and the framework of the new CFP, especially on the subject of regional variations in measures. It must ensure that the division of jurisdiction between the Commission and Member States is clearly defined, a factor which will aid understanding and ownership of this EU policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this background and these issues, I propose that we agree to the Commission’s request for an extension until 31 December 2012, without substantially changing the current technical measures except for the addition regarding the permissible mesh size for boarfish. However, I realise that this proposal is a form of concession to the Commission and that there are a lot of questions being asked and a strong demand for change in the sector, which is disappointed that this important project has been postponed. I am therefore adding a twofold demand to our approval: a request for an impact assessment on the technical measures currently in force, which is vital if we are to adapt them effectively, and a request for genuine consultation with all of the parties involved, especially fishermen themselves, in drawing up the new regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Commission’s new proposal should be made within a reasonable timescale for a new regulation to come into force on 1 January 2013, which is when the new CFP comes into force. It is vital that the Commission begin work immediately on this new proposal. It would be unreasonable to allow a further extension after this new 18-month extension period for the current regulation. The technical measures to which my report relates are transitional and have only been approved as such. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Carmen Fraga Estévez, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>− <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I must begin by regretting once again the complications that this report has encountered because of the resistance of the Council and the Commission to accepting Parliament’s powers of co-decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, we have a proposal for Greenland, as an overseas country and territory, to be able to export under the same conditions as those applied to a European Union Member State. This situation would benefit both Greenland, which exports 87% of its fisheries products to the European Union, and the Union; Denmark in particular, which is the recipient of the majority of these exports.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the conditions for including Greenland in the single market import arrangements is that it should accept EU health rules, and this does not pose a problem in the least.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the trade in fisheries products being subject to the common organisation of the market, the Commission, using the need for compliance with health rules as an excuse, tabled its proposal based on Article 203 of the Treaty, which meant a simple and straightforward consultation procedure for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Committee on Fisheries and the legal services pointed out this anomaly from the outset. However, as it presents no problems in terms of content, and given its importance to Greenland, we are allowing the report to be processed under the consultation procedure. Imagine our surprise when, just as we were about to vote on the text and without prior warning, the Council adopted a completely different proposal, with numerous changes attempting to obscure the clear link with the common organisation of the market and so avoid co-decision. Since Parliament had – as I said before – already adopted the text using the consultation procedure without any problems, such manoeuvring was uncalled-for.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, as we were faced with a new text, and given the clear proof that the Council’s goal was to erode Parliament’s powers, we decided that, this time, we would use those powers to the full and request a formal opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">In that opinion, the view of the Committee on Legal Affairs was – and I am quoting directly from the text – that ‘the purpose of the proposed decision is to require Greenland to transpose EU health rules as a condition for the application of the EU internal market rules as regards fisheries’, as specified in Article 3 of the proposal itself, which guarantees that the agreement’s rules will be adapted to the applicable rules established in the Union as regards animal health and food safety, as well as the common organisation of the market in fishery products.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Committee on Legal Affairs came to the unanimous decision that Articles 204 and 43(2) of the Treaty, along with Protocol No 34, which includes specific arrangements and procedures for products subject to the common organisation of the market in fishery products in Greenland, should form the legal basis for the proposal. Therefore, as rapporteur, I drew up another draft report, modifying the legal basis. That is what we are tabling for adoption tomorrow and, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, it is our first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">All, then, that remains is for me to tell the Commission and the Council – which I believe to be absent – that they now have an opportunity to correct and recognise the new legal basis, and, therefore, to consider this the first reading, as we will be doing tomorrow. The problem is with the legal basis and not the content.</p>
<p class="contents">I call for this problem to be solved with a view to the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now let me refer to each report in turn, trying to focus on the substance in order to gain time.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the agreement between the European Union and the Union of Comoros, I would like to thank Mr Capoulas Santos for his work as rapporteur and am pleased to see the very strong support of the Fisheries Committee as a whole on the substance of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will be aware, the EU’s commitment is to continue promoting responsible and sustainable fisheries in the waters of our partners, including the Indian Ocean region. It is very important to maintain bilateral relationships with this region’s countries and Comoros, in this case, in connection with the participation of the European Union in regional fisheries organisations such as the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be present there and that is why this agreement is important. At present, the European Union has four active fisheries partnership agreements in the Indian Ocean – namely with Seychelles, Madagascar, Mozambique and this one with the Union of Comoros. I would like to underline that it is very important for the Commission and the European Union to reach an agreement with Comoros, as the agreement plays an important role in terms of the presence of our fleet in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to reinforce the dialogue on the sectoral policy in order to encourage the implementation of a responsible fisheries policy in this region.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say a few words referring to the requests made by the rapporteur to the Commission in the conclusion to his report. I would like to report that the Commission is committed to keeping the European Parliament fully informed at all stages of the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements. We really mean it, and we want to make available all relevant information, but we do have to act in line with the commitments made in the Framework Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, the Commission services have been honouring this commitment for more than one year now. The Commission is sending the European Parliament the same information as to the Council and at the same time. In particular, I am committed to making available ex-ante and ex-post evaluations of our agreements as soon as possible. To give you just one example: in view of tomorrow’s vote on the resolution of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Mauritania, the Commission services have made arrangements that the evaluation report of this agreement will be available ahead of the foreseen schedule, so the members of this Parliament can vote after being informed about this report.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards participation of members of this Parliament as observers in international meetings, I must emphasise that the Framework Agreement applies to multilateral international conferences and meetings. At the same time, we intend to continue established successful practices of participation in bilateral negotiations. Nevertheless, any decision to include MEPs as observers in EU delegations is taken by the College of Commissioners on a case-by-case basis following the evaluation of the legal, diplomatic and technical possibilities pursuant to the Framework Agreement. I would, however, like to underline here that my personal attitude and that of the services is very positive and I would like to facilitate your participation.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the second report on Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy, I would also like to thank the Fisheries Committee and the rapporteur, Mr Ferreira, for their work on this proposal. Thanks to their efforts, we have a text before us which is acceptable to the Council also. I am happy to say that this text is also acceptable to the Commission, so there has been excellent cooperation between the three institutions on this file. After a successful informal trialogue held on 2 March, a consensus was achieved on the outstanding points, so the Commission hopes that a first reading agreement can be achieved on this proposal. I hope we will be successful on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to recall that this proposal rationalises the regulation on the so-called second financial instrument. This regulation covers spending in international relations, governance, data collection and scientific advice, and also control and enforcement. The revision intends to ensure coherence between the regulation and other elements of the legislative framework. It makes limited adaptations and clarifications of the provisions. I therefore urge the European Parliament to approve the proposal</p>
<p class="contents">I will turn now to the third report, on transitional technical measures, for which I warmly thank the rapporteur, Mrs Grelier. The purpose of this proposal is to extend existing transitional technical measures until the end of 2012. This is based on the assumption that the reformed common fisheries policy will enter into force on 1 January of next year. I hope we will be successful in that aim. My intention in proposing this extension is to avoid opening complex discussions on technical measures in the way of our reform. The Commission supports the amendment agreed by the Fisheries Committee on a mesh size range for boarfish, as it is based on scientific advice. I note the concerns of some Members and also by certain Member States who have sought additional amendments. We could not accept these as these had not yet been tested by scientists, or because scientists have actually not received full information from Member States in order to make an assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say a few words on the report concerning the imports of fishery products from Greenland, and I would like here to thank the Chair of the Fisheries Committee, Mrs Fraga, for her work. I would like to underline that the measures proposed by the Commission address a long-standing request from Greenland. These measures seek to simplify the relevant sanitary measures and certification procedures and make Greenland part of the Single Market for fishery products and derived products.</p>
<p class="contents">This is entirely in line with our commitment in the agreement of 2006 to contribute to the development of Greenland and to cooperate in the area of food safety. The Commission is very pleased to note that all parties concerned – the Member States in Council with unanimity, Greenland, the European Parliament and also the national parliaments of the Member States – are prepared to deliver on this commitment and support the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear: for us, the Commission, the relationship with Greenland is of extreme importance and I think that everybody understands why. It is a political priority, and I therefore hope that the discussions on the legal basis of this proposal will not risk putting in place these important measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I understood very well Mrs Fraga’s concerns about the legal basis of the proposal and the competence of the European Parliament. I can say that the Commission will not stand in the way of finding a pragmatic solution. Although we remain convinced that the legal basis of our proposal is correct, we would accept – and I would like to clarify this – the Council adopting the position of Parliament. That will be okay with us. It is now up to the Council to consider the options and move the case forward in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty. I hope we can resolve this issue very soon in order to avoid an impact on our relations with Greenland. This is our first priority, so I am here to say that I would like to facilitate the work which Mrs Fraga has done in order to find a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank the Committee on Fisheries and all the rapporteurs for their work. I am sorry I have spoken too much, but I had four reports to comment on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The committee approved this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However the committee felt that in the first instance there is little point in Parliament’s vote on this report since it comes after the agreement has been signed. The low level of funds committed in this instance mitigates the impact of this problem, but in future we would of course need to be able to give our opinion before such agreements are signed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the committee felt that the content of these agreements should have been analysed in greater detail, in terms of the provisions for monitoring actual catch quantities and protecting fish stocks in view of the pressure from the Committee on Fisheries and also to ensure that the local development component of the agreements is properly applied in practice. The Committee on Budgets therefore plans to propose an in-depth working meeting on this subject with the Committee on Fisheries in the very near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To begin with, I would like to say a few words on the Grelier report, which is a compromise between the political groups and the European Commission. I endorse the version of this report which was agreed on and voted through in the Committee on Fisheries. As a result of the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in 2010 the European Commission withdrew its draft Council regulation for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures, with the aim of drawing up a new plan. The new plan was intended to comply with the provisions of the Treaty and to take into account the reform of the common fisheries policy. The draft was to be put forward in the third quarter of 2011. Unfortunately, it appears that the Commission will not manage to prepare the draft regulation in time, and, what is worse, will not have the funds to change it. This does not bode well. By voting tomorrow to extend the provisional regulation, we are taking on a commitment to fishermen to work on the new regulation, which must ultimately systematise the whole range of provisions regulating permitted methods and places of fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, encouraging that, according to the latest information, the Commission will most likely want to transfer some competencies back to the Member States as far as technical measures are concerned. This is a very positive step towards decentralisation. Technical measures used in the individual sea basins differ according to local conditions. The fisheries management system should abandon the traditional top-down approach and instead emphasise the principle of regionalisation, which makes it possible to take into account the prevailing conditions in individual sea basins. We must therefore say a firm ‘no’ to all attempts to adopt a universal and joint fisheries management model, and call for the due attention to be paid to the particular characteristics of the various European seas. An individual approach will put us on the right path to sustainable fisheries management. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my capacity as coordinator, I am pleased to see that we have reached a compromise with the Council and Commission on two regulations. I refer to the Grelier report on technical measures and the Ferreira report on the second financial instrument. We shall also be able to vote in favour of the fisheries agreement with the Union of the Comoros, although I do not wish to hide the fact that I would like to see a fundamental realignment of the partnership agreements within the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are real problems between the institutions in relation to Greenland, where Parliament’s powers are not respected. I am gradually losing patience with the fact that the level of cooperation between the institutions is still so poor. This is something that I have raised time and time again already. I am raising the issue again today. The problem with the management plans must be resolved as a matter of urgency. I would appeal to the Hungarian Presidency of the Council to actively press for a solution. The fact that there is no representative from the Council here today is a clear sign of the Council’s lack of respect for Parliament. I find this incredible.</p>
<p class="contents">One final remark about the Grelier report. I am aware that some of my fellow Members are frustrated because it was not possible to incorporate the amendments they wanted. However, I find it very regrettable that our fishermen are forced to work with out-of-date technical measures. The fault in this case lies with the Council, which has been unable to agree to a new regulation. As a Parliament we have a great deal of responsibility, which is why we need to act responsibly and extend the existing regulation without amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The existing regulation on technical measures is causing major problems for small inshore vessels operating off the coast of Ireland and, indeed, off the west coast of Scotland. We cannot afford, as politicians, to sit and wait for the reform of the common fisheries policy when a new regulation is expected. Parliament has an opportunity to act now and I urge all political groups to support the very realistic amendments that have been tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">These small vessels which I referred to, short of 15 metres, are deprived of earning an income and, even more importantly, these vessels are forced to travel into dangerous waters. We are driving these vessels 80 kms off our coasts to catch fish outside the area, which is closed for cod recovery. My amendments refer to the use of tangle nets. These nets are used by small inshore vessels to catch shellfish and lesser spotted dogfish off the North-West coast. Tangle nets are not used to catch cod, they are not used to catch whiting or haddock and will have zero impact on these stocks, so these amendments, if passed, will allow these small vessels to survive in these areas. It is not good enough to suggest that we do not want to open discussions. That is what we are here to do.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to boarfish, this is a new form of fishery. It has been developed primarily by fishermen from my own country. In December the Council established a TAC, of which Ireland was allocated 67%, and I am glad to hear the Commissioner says that there is scientific evidence to justify this. There are no references to boarfish under the existing regulation, so therefore I am pleased that the committee decided to accept my amendment to use the Commission proposal as a vehicle to introduce the appropriate mesh size of 32 to 54, thus avoiding the need to introduce new legislation that would take too long.</p>

However, I would like to focus on the fisheries agreement with the Union of the Comoros.</p>
<p class="contents">If I ever need to remind myself why we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have up to now voted against these fisheries agreements, I only have to take out one of the assessments and read the agreement with the Union of the Comoros that we are now to vote on. The EU has had an agreement with this poor country since 1998. According to the assessment, the agreement provided the Union of the Comoros with EUR 2.7 million between 2005 and 2009. The agreement states that 60% of the money is to be used to support the local fishery sector and for controls and scientific estimates of fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the assessment, this developing country still does not have a single operating fishing port, not a single coastguard boat, no coastguard aircraft and no fishery research. The country’s own fishery sector is still completely undeveloped.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the Union of the Comoros receives EUR 2.7 million to let in EU boats. We taxpayers provide 65% of this amount and vessel owners 35%. These boats, the majority of which are intended for tuna fishing, have during the same period caught fish, according to the assessment, to the value of EUR 13.7 million. It is very good business for the vessel owners, but the assessment states that all of the so-called added value has been received by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">No Comorian people have been employed as crew on the boats. There has been no landing of fish on the Comoros. All processing of the fish has been done elsewhere, in the Seychelles, for example. I agree with the Commissioner that it is good for the EU to have a presence in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), but my question to the Commission is the following:</p>
<p class="contents">How does the Commission intend to ensure that this new agreement is implemented better than previous agreements? For example, how should the EU fleet be persuaded to employ Comorians on board and how will the Commission ensure that the agreement really contributes to development on the Comoros so that the figure for the money earmarked for development of the fishery sector is not just fine words, but also has substance? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These reports are a key factor in the implementation of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, attention should be paid to the difference in opinions between the European Parliament and the European Commission with regard to international agreements. It is accepted practice for the European Commission to be unduly secretive when it comes to negotiating agreements with third countries, contrary to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, which provide for greater involvement by Parliament in the drafting of normative acts. This runs counter to the principle of transparency and limits the role of Parliament, which after all must perform a supervisory function. Influence over the negotiating process would allow Members to discharge their mandate properly as Members of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would call for the Members of the European Parliament to play a greater role in the negotiating process, since the current system, whereby a general report on negotiations is issued by a European Commission official, is inadequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fleets at Grimsby are a few dozen fishing boats, where once there were a hundred. Two years ago West of Scotland fishermen tabled a plan to conserve white fish but, while they wait, stock depletion continues. A regional approach is suggested – why not? The EU divides the land into regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Much worse is the renewal of licences for European fleets to raid the waters of the Comoros islands – and raid it will be, for local fishermen cannot compete with the superior EU-powered trawlers. The same thing has been done to others in that area. Is the House surprised that Somali fishermen denied a living have resumed the age-old vice of piracy?</p>
<p class="contents">Five years ago, did Members see the TV pictures of hundreds of Western Saharans trying to seek refuge in the Canaries? EU licences had just been renewed for their waters and they too had seen it all before. In a pitiful, desperate attempt many died on the 800-mile journey in fishing boats never intended for the open sea. However, the EU does not care that people from the least-developed countries have been impoverished by its actions and, for that, it deserves to be condemned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is little wonder, because the common fisheries policy currently constituted has seen the destruction of our fleet but has not seen the build-up of fish stocks. From my point of view, the sooner we can get fisheries policy returned to Member States, the better. However, I recognise that this is unlikely to happen in the short term, so I have a few observations to make on this joint fisheries debate.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />First, the issue of establishing a Community financial measure for the implementation of the common fisheries policy. So long as the EU is able to interfere in our fisheries, it would seem to me that that interference should be properly funded. However, while we seek to guarantee the funding that is available for the administration of the CAP, we should bear a thought for the stakeholders – in particular our fishermen – who struggle to keep abreast of the multitude of current rules and regulations, let alone those they are consulted upon.</p>
<p class="contents">I am increasingly hearing from a variety of maritime stakeholders that the entire industry is struggling to deal with this particular issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now, I would like to congratulate Mr Ferreira on his report on Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea. The amendments to this regulation proposed by the Commission and Parliament will establish the level of EU investment that can be put into funding research. They will bring the regulation into line with the changes in the EU legislative framework on data collection, management and use.</p>
<p class="contents">I especially welcome the opportunities for funding scientific research into fisheries and aquaculture. We will now be able to carry out research into the European Union’s level of dependency on imports from third countries. As you know, 60% of our market relies on imports and this figure is rising all the time. It is vital that we increase our support for European producers, instead of increasing our trade openness in all directions, which is damaging European output.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank Mrs Grelier for her report. Technical measures are an extremely sensitive subject, and they must be changed as quickly as possible, once we have the Commission’s proposals on the common fisheries policy reform package. This report, which we will be adopting tomorrow, allows for the transitional technical measures governing the fisheries sector to be extended. This extension will allow us to avoid a regulatory vacuum after 30 June this year and will enable the fisheries to carry on their business until the reform of the CFP. It will also allow a thorough impact assessment to be performed on all the technical measures currently in force. It would really not be reasonable now to adopt any substantial amendments to this report, as this would prolong the legislative procedure and would entail long discussions in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mr Capoulas Santos on his report on the fisheries partnership agreement with the Comoros and my colleague Mrs Fraga Estévez on the Greenland report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tomorrow, we will vote on the import agreement with Greenland, for which I am shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament. I am pleased that we are now getting rid of the cumbersome and expensive bureaucracy, while at the same time we are fully meeting the EU’s food safety requirements. The agreement will give Greenland a good opportunity to sell its fishery products under the rules of the internal market, provided that these products meet the EU’s health and safety requirements. Greenland’s fish are currently already checked by the Danish food authorities, both in Greenland and again when they are exported to the EU. That represents expensive duplication of work, which the agreement will fortunately do away with. Everyone will benefit from this agreement, but it has clearly been too long in coming. However, it was also important for Parliament to be absolutely clear about the legal basis, and we hope that the Commission and the Council will support this.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also be voting on the Partnership Agreement in the fisheries sector with the Union of the Comoros. Essentially, I have a very positive opinion of sustainable fisheries agreements, providing sustainability in terms of fish stocks and for fishermen, for the local population and finally sustainability for the EU fishermen who make use of the agreements. Unfortunately, this agreement with the Union of the Comoros is not as sustainable as I would have liked it to be, as it does not contain an ultimate ceiling for how much EU vessels are permitted to fish. When the agreed quota of 4 850 tonnes per year is reached, each additional tonne will cost EUR 65.</p>
<p class="contents">The tendency not to put a ceiling on how much EU vessels may catch in the waters of third countries is damaging and wrong. It is not good enough for us to pursue a different fisheries policy according to whether we are in our own waters or the waters of a third country. I would also like to press for us to ensure to a greater extent that the money the EU pays out to third countries in return for concluding fisheries agreements is earmarked in such a way that it definitely benefits the local population. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The unintended consequence of this will mean that a temporary regulation that was introduced for a period of only one year will now run for at least three years, during which time the circumstances in the west of Scotland have changed dramatically, forcing our fishermen to dump good fresh haddock back into the sea, dead.

In 2008, the absence of any agreement on a draft regulation intended to simplify and clarify the EU regulation on conservation of fish resources led to the adoption of the current regulation, which established a set of transitional measures, initially provided for the period between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2011. The current legislative proposal extends this transitional arrangement for an additional period of 18 months – in other words, until 1 January 2013 – pending a new regulation on technical measures framing the reformed common fisheries policy (CFP).</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to maintain a regulatory framework for fisheries during this transition period, safeguarding the interests of fishermen without losing sight of the basic objective of promoting sustainable fisheries. The current intention not to extend the use of trammel nets, and to ban them at a depth of between 200 and 600 metres from 1 October 2010, does not constitute a good example of what has been described. The current ban on this fishing technique, which has been used for decades by a section of the Portuguese small-scale fleet for the sustained exploitation of species such as monkfish and hake, was a severe economic and social blow to the sector and to the fishing communities most dependent on the exploitation of these resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call for your support in adopting a proposal that I and my colleagues Mr Capoulas Santos and Mr Ferreira have tabled in the Chamber, which seeks to do no more than ensure that what was law until 1 October 2010 remains so until 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the draft regulation setting out Community financial measures relating to the implementation of the CFP and the law of the sea: the Ferreira report. Together with the European Fisheries Fund, this is the most important financial instrument for supporting fisheries, providing for financing in the areas of international relations, governance, the collection of scientific data and opinions, and the monitoring of the implementation of the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to express my complete support for the proposals tabled in this Chamber by the rapporteur to increase the possibility of EU co-financing to 60% in the area of the collection, management and use of basic data, as well as with regard to the collection, management and use of supplementary data. The widespread and growing recognition of the importance of fisheries management supported by up-to-date and thorough scientific knowledge of the status of stocks fully justifies adoption of the rapporteur’s proposals, as well as of his report as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am going to focus on two reports, given their importance.</p>
<p class="contents">One of them is about the agreement with the Union of the Comoros. This is a fisheries agreement between the European Union and a country in south-eastern Africa – I mention that so we also know where we are spatially – where 60% of the population lives below the poverty line and where their only form of income is tourism or state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement establishes the possibility of catching their excess fish. I repeat: excess fish. It also provides for compensation in order for the country itself to develop, and to improve its infrastructure and its own capacities. It establishes a partnership framework under criteria of sustainable and responsible fishing, preserving biological resources. We must take into account that there are migratory species such as tuna there and that every year the following year’s stock is established using scientific criteria. It facilitates scientific research and the presence of onboard observers, as well as the maintenance of the area’s fish, as it is limited to a coastal area so that home-grown fishing will develop.</p>
<p class="contents">This protocol is of great benefit thanks to the access that European fishing boats have to the area, development aid, improved employment and greater economic prospects. However, it also has a very important element: it prevents third countries from fishing unless they adequately ensure the preservation of the environment. Third countries catch 75% of the area’s fisheries resources.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that this agreement not only helps the Union of the Comoros, but also helps maintain the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular attention must also be paid to the important Grelier report on a regulation establishing technical measures that expire in three months’ time, for which an extension until December 2012 is being requested because, if not, there would be a legal vacuum, legal uncertainty and poor conservation of marine resources.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we would also stress the assessment of the attached declaration calling on the Commission to accept certain amendments: some technical measures proposed by the Member States. The issue of nets has already been mentioned here, and we are also talking about the question of depth. It affects certain fisheries and we believe that the Commission should include it because of the impact it has on the stocks themselves. It affects areas 8, 9 and 10, and is important to overcome these shortcomings that are emerging in the application of a regulation that not only damages fisheries but also local populations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is positive for the Comoros, for their people and for their productive sector, for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is positive because the report encourages cooperation based on fostering local development and because the financial compensation involved is channelled into this area. Secondly, it is positive because it encourages the region’s governments to respect human rights, which is a key condition to maintaining the agreement. Thirdly, it is positive because it supports the smaller-scale forms of fishing practiced there and guarantees that the 8 500 people in the Comoros who live off this type of activity will have their own fishing area: European ships will not be able to fish within a 10-nautical mile radius of each island.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is positive because it promotes sustainable fishing in the area, it includes a mechanism for objectively analysing fish stocks, and establishes mechanisms for scientific cooperation to that end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is an old saying in my country that there are as many opinions as people, and this is true of fishermen and fishing. Therefore, it is difficult for us as Members to speak unanimously on the matter but, at the same time, we must do our best. </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Greenland in particular, I think the Commissioner gave a fairly balanced view of the situation. There are issues obviously regarding the confidence of the European Parliament vis-à-vis the Council, but, as she said herself, a pragmatic solution will be found and that is obviously desirable. It is important from the point of view of the European Union. It is equally important, or more important perhaps, from the point of view of Greenland – a country that is almost totally dependent on the European market for its fish and, of course, almost totally dependent on fishing for its economy.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing we can say regarding Greenland is that the fish coming from there, as envisaged here in this report, will be verifiable and be of top quality – unlike many of the fish coming into the European Union from the monstrous fish farms in South-East Asia, the quality of which cannot be verified, and indeed which many think come from polluted waters.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore a huge area for us to deal with, in particular because the Commissioner herself earlier this afternoon in Question Time painted a somewhat grim picture of the sustainability of fish stocks and coastal communities into the future. For that reason, there is a need to develop a major policy regarding aquaculture within Europe as part of the future CFP. In the meantime, I welcome the proposals here and I accept the Commissioner’s words on what will happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before talking about the reports by Mr Ferreira and Mrs Fraga Estévez, I should like to express my support for the report by Mr Capoulas Santos, which recommends adopting the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Partnership Agreement with the Union of the Comoros, and reminds us of the need for Parliament to participate actively in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the fundamental aspects of Mrs Grelier’s report on technical measures. I call on the Commission to speed up its impact assessment and to prioritise the drafting of a regulation on these measures so that it may be adopted as soon as possible: before 2013, if possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ferreira report amends Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 on Community financial measures, one of the tools used to apply the common fisheries policy, alongside the European Fisheries Fund (EFF). The report clarifies its scope and adapts it to the real needs of the common fisheries policy under the new Treaty of Lisbon, so I think it is positive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, like the rapporteur, and given that one of the fundamental conditions of achieving sustainable fishing is ensuring up-to-date, accurate knowledge of fish stocks, I regret that it has not been possible to raise the co-financing rates as regards data collection, management and use.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fraga Estévez report affects the establishment of rules on animal health and food safety for the importing of certain fisheries products and fishing by-products, whether originating in Greenland or in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules affect practically 90% of Greenland’s exports in this area, which reached EUR 251 million in 2007. There is broad consensus on applying the rules governing trade within the European Union, with which Greenland remains associated, to these imported products. This will expand the single market in fishery products and their by-products.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that there is no agreement over what the legal basis should be and we therefore warmly welcome the Commission’s decision to promote an agreement. Parliament is following the report of its legal services, the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the position being maintained by the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that these issues can be resolved, that Greenland will be given the priority that it has and deserves, and that a legislative agreement will be reached. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the discussion on the Fisheries Partnership Agreements, we are now trying, in the framework of our proposal for the reform, to ensure the good implementation of these fisheries agreements for the benefit of the local population. Until we have the new proposal for the new generation of fisheries agreements, we have tried to improve the current situation. We are trying to ensure the implementation of the Comoros agreement and to do our best for the local population.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the problems mentioned in connection with Parliament and the information given to Members of Parliament about the agreements, the Commission has given all information – even restricted information – to Members of Parliament and this is what we will do in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the technical measures and Mrs Grelier’s report, I can understand that there were a lot of concerns because we are now prolonging the current regulation. We had to do so, because we have to wait for the implementation of the reform, but I can understand why you are urging us to take some measures in order to have new regulation before the end of 2013. What I can say – as I cannot give you promises I cannot keep – is that we will do our best to accelerate the procedure for a new regulation and also for the implementation of the basic regulation for the reform in order to give the Member States some competences regarding technical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the next issue – the Financial Regulation – I hope that we will achieve a first reading approach, because this would be very good for the implementation of the regulation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the case of Greenland, I would like to reiterate that we are here to find a solution on the legal basis of the proposal. For the Commission, it is very important to work on the substance because a good relationship with Greenland is an absolute political priority for us. I can reiterate that the Commission is here to facilitate and to find a compromise with the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also need to say, with regard to the comments made about the report on financial measures, that the amendments we are proposing do not jeopardise the consensus obtained to date in the trialogue. I believe that it is possible to go a little further whilst safeguarding this consensus, and in this regard I am thankful for the comments that have been made by a number of Members in support of the proposed amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, as several Members have said, that not adopting these amendments would constitute incomprehensible inconsistency on the part of a European Union that, on the one hand, wants increased participation in certain areas, to which it ascribes growing importance, while on the other resists allocating the funds necessary for actually acknowledging this growing importance.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report on transitional technical measures, I would like to highlight – which was also done during a number of speeches – the amendment supported by myself and two other Members, seeking to eliminate negative discrimination with no scientific basis, and I emphasise that there is no scientific basis justifying the negative discrimination against some segments of the Portuguese small-scale fleet that use trammel nets. Over time this fleet has demonstrated its ability to use the resources in question, namely sole and hake, in a sustainable manner. As there are no solid, scientific reasons justifying this ban, it should not have gone ahead in the first place, particularly in the light of the significant negative economic and social consequences that it would entail.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Members for their generally favourable comments on this report, which also echo the debates that took place during the meetings in the Committee on Fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the Commissioner’s standpoint on accepting the amendment specifying the mesh size for boarfish nets and on not agreeing to any specific requests for amendments to certain technical measures, on the grounds that they are not supported by any impact assessments for the vessels and the ecosystems concerned, or because the Member States have not sent the necessary scientific data. These measures are all interconnected and have not been evaluated.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress, as previous speakers have done this evening, the urgency for the Commission to carry out an evaluation of the current measures as quickly as possible and on the basis of this evaluation to draw up a new proposal that can be dealt with at the same time as the reform of the common fisheries policy, rather than after it. I wanted to draw your attention to this point, Commissioner, and I note your readiness to speed up the drafting of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I must mention once again the importance of joint work between the EU institutions and the fisheries sector on gathering and sharing the scientific data. I believe this is a necessary basis for a new, fair and collaborative common fisheries policy which has sufficient resources – and that is an important point – and which reconciles the economic necessities and the sustainability of the sector in the interests of all: the fishing community, consumers and citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any case, I had been considering the possibility of asking for this report to be returned to committee before it reached the final vote, but I later thought better of it and realised that it could only delay even further this proposal, which I believe is positive for Greenland and for the European Union, and that it would be advisable not to delay it more.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, anyhow, that the Council will go along with the intentions of the Committee on Fisheries, which are entirely justified, and I hope that a solution will be reached, given that the only problem is the legal basis and not the content.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, I am pleased that we have achieved this result; moreover, we always have the option of going to the Court of Justice if we see that it is advisable to continue with this matter. Anyhow, we will demonstrate goodwill tomorrow, by issuing our opinion, and we hope that the Council will respond and consider this Parliament’s first reading, as I have said.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, thank you to the Commissioner for being prepared to cooperate on this issue in a straightforward way, and thanks to all my colleagues who have worked on and supported this report. All that remains is to hope that the Council will go along with our intentions, which are justified, as I have said, and endorsed not only by the Committee on Legal Affairs but also by the legal services of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we all know, the EU’s fisheries policy has come under intense criticism for a long time now, and with good reason. There are a lot of questions relating to overfishing, fishing in the territory of developing countries and state aid for the fishing industry, all of which need to be resolved quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Ferreira on Community financial measures before us today deals with key issues as far as the reform of fisheries policy is concerned. These are: data collection, research, internal cooperation, the administration of fishing matters, and common fisheries policy monitoring systems. It is also important to ensure that the harmonisation of fisheries policy, especially with environmental and maritime policy, is a major priority, and it will also require resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Within the framework of reforming the CFP, the main priorities are making it more effective to better ensure the economic viability of European fleets, the conservation of fish stocks, the linkage with maritime policy and the supplying of quality foodstuffs to consumers. The measures adopted today by Parliament, such as a review of technical measures and the adaptation of existing legislation to take scientific data collected into account, come under this heading. The sustainability and competitiveness of the sector should be balanced. Fishing activity is essential to the economic and social development of coastal communities, because it contributes to the galvanisation of regions and fosters activity in related sectors. For example, in the Union’s outermost regions, which represent the European Union’s largest exclusive economic zone, the fisheries sector plays a fundamental role in their economic activity, making it a priority to ensure the sector’s sustainability and development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title24"></a><a name="creitem24"></a>
