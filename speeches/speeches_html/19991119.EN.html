I request that this procedure no longer be enforced in future. If someone leaves, that is nobody’s fault but their own or, to quote Lenin and Gorbachev, life will punish whoever leaves early. That person does not have a majority and will hopefully also be punished by the electorate one day.</p>

Yesterday, before the vote on the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, I made a protest because the amendments that I had submitted in French were not identical to the French version which was officially published. It was not, therefore, a translation problem. My amendments had actually been reworked by an anonymous reviser. Well, I read in the Minutes that the President explained to Mr Berthu that two of his amendments had not been very well worded. It sounds as if I worded my amendments badly. Well I disagree, my amendments were very well worded, and some anonymous reviser has taken it upon himself to amend the text. I must protest. It is a matter of principle. The officials of the European Parliament have no call to be altering amendments submitted by a Member of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Later, in the summer, something unexpected happened: the earthquake in Turkey. We quite rightly decided to grant humanitarian assistance to Turkey via the European Investment Bank. But that will cause a technical problem with the budget, because now, as a result of this unexpected event, we are approaching the ceiling that has been imposed for such transfers to the guarantee fund. If anything else should occur unexpectedly, we will either have to exceed the ceiling or make cuts in other areas of financial aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We have brought this problem to the attention of the Commission and received a very vague reply from them to the questions we asked, but, despite that, we cannot jeopardise the implementation of this financial aid. It will be jeopardised if we now adopt the proposed amendments. For this reason, although the Commission has not given us a completely satisfactory reply regarding the technical aspects of the budget, I wish to withdraw these amendments, and at the same time I would say to the Commission that there is a problem here, which we have drawn attention to, and we hope that in the future the Commission will take account of it and propose the ceiling be exceeded in the event of unexpected situations in which funding is required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That must also be clearly evident from Union acts. The rules will, however, be useless unless they are actually effective. Therefore it is essential to focus both on cooperation between developing and industrialised countries and on networking among the countries of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no lack of excellent plans and programmes within the EU. Examples we could mention are the drug prevention group in Finland that operates under the supervision of the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health, and the Pompidou Group, a European Council cooperation group on drugs that was established in the 1970s on an initiative by the French President and that is planning several projects to reduce the supply and demand of drugs. Now we also need a strong and clearly expressed political will to render the exchange and comparison of information as efficient as possible. We will not achieve results merely through acts and plans, but it is through practical action that we can maximise the welfare of our people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But this means that it is spreading itself rather thinly and the thrust of the document is that with more funding and tougher prosecution, we can knock the problem on the head. Quite interestingly, Mr Schulz’s proposal to give urban and regional experiments more of a chance, has been rejected. I fear that this text will now be used incorrectly, namely to support those, in particular, who advocate more repression against drug users and think that they will solve the problem in this way. As such, the PPE viewpoint has, in principle, dominated after all and this was a reason for me not to go along with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel that we are upholding a policy which genuinely attacks its causes and effectively combats drug trafficking and the associated money laundering. We are also upholding a policy that does not penalise those who suffer from drug addiction or their families, who should be supported by means of adequate public services, which are free, in terms of treatment and reintegration into society.</p>
<p class="contents">But the fight against drug trafficking and money laundering also requires action and coordination at EU level (and at UN level) in the fight that must be developed against powerful criminal organisations which, through illegal activities and money, undermine and tap into the economic and financial system. In order to achieve this, we need a genuinely “strong political will, expressed without any ambiguity”. We also need to turn words into deeds, by mobilising the necessary Community financial resources to combat this tragic situation that affects thousands of drug addicts and their families. We cannot continue to reduce “social costs” in order to meet the criteria imposed on national budgets by the Stability Pact, whilst repeating fine words about social support that are then never actually put into practice. We are convinced that if it has adequate resources, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction based in Lisbon can make a major contribution to deepening the study and the proposals for measures to combat the scourge of drugs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The financial stakes involved and the vast profits made behind the scenes are the main factors in sustaining and expanding this inhumane market whose victims are in the more productive and dynamic section of the population. This therefore has particularly dramatic consequences not only for users and their families but also for society as a whole. </p>
<p class="contents">The association of drug trafficking with arms smuggling, terrorism and international crime, as well as police, judicial and governmental corruption is a problem which cannot be resolved by prayers alone, nor can it be resolved on a superficial level with half-hearted measures or with measures designed solely to tackle the problem of drug addiction. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must bring to the fore and address those social issues which cause, reinforce and exacerbate the problem. In a society where ideals and values are gradually perishing, competition and profit are intensifying, and in a society uncertain of its future in which a large number of young people are being hard hit by unemployment, inadequate social security and a lack of social support structures to nurture education and culture, the youth of today are not being armed with the right values and criteria to resist both physical and psychological addiction. They feel disorientated and are being skilfully driven to drop everything in search of other forms of escapism. </p>
<p class="contents">Because of the nature and urgency of the matter, we need to adopt a clear, coordinated and specific policy which must be examined and adapted to address the tragic extent of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We agree with many of the remarks and proposals in the report and we would like to stress the importance of developing the joint and simultaneous objective of reducing supply and demand and combating drug trafficking. We would also like to stress just how vital help and support is for drug users in helping them not only to overcome drug dependency but also to integrate into society. We would like to highlight the need to make funding available to cover the major needs which have arisen to address the problem in a fundamental, effective and coordinated manner.

<p class="contents">For that reason, we are asking and calling upon all social and collective organisations, including trade unions, and the cultural and scientific world, to coordinate their efforts, to exert more pressure at a national and European level and to step up the fight against this major problem which has so tragically reared its ugly head in our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we have here is a classic ruling on the establishment of a process in one of the various pillars of our Treaty principles. Mr Newton Dunn chose the first pillar whereas we were of the opinion that the procedure should be left in the third pillar. The reason for this is that in the third pillar the group of offenders who are guilty of counterfeiting travel documents is more wide-ranging than in the first pillar where Mr Newton Dunn had established it, where the focus is exclusively on the tracking of the counterfeiting of documents for illegal immigrants. That may be appropriate from the ideological viewpoint but is politically wrong because someone who, as a drugs dealer, counterfeits documents must also be criminally prosecuted. In this respect, we did not want to vote against Mr Newton Dunn’s practical proposals with regard to the combating of document counterfeiting <span class="bold">– </span>which we support <span class="bold">– </span>as far as we are concerned it is exclusively a matter of the legal basis.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the Commission has presented a proposed regulation intended to amend another Community regulation, Regulation (EEC) 1911/91, which established a special legal status for the Canary Islands.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EEC) 1911/91 is in turn a regulation which amends the statute established for these islands by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community in 1985. The Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community – in article 25 and in Protocol 2 annexed to that Act – provided the Canary Islands with a special status which was designed to reflect the fact that those islands were not integrated into the Common agricultural policy and, furthermore, because it was not subject to the Community Customs Union, the Community customs rules, nor Value Added Tax. In this way, the Act of Accession intended to maintain as far as possible the special status which the Canary Islands had had within the Spanish State since their incorporation into the Kingdom of Castile in the 15th Century. It was a region which was not subject to the ordinary tax regime nor, therefore, the customs rules, owing to its great distance from Peninsular Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">The Act of Accession of 1985 contained a future development clause – section 4 of article 25 – which was aimed at preventing the Canary Islands, as a result of European Union development, from being excluded from European construction. I would say that public opinion in the Canary Islands was, on the one hand, in favour of maintaining this special status but, on the other hand, had no desire whatsoever to remain outside the sphere of European construction.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Single Act was adopted in 1986, it became necessary to amend that special status and this was done by means of Regulation (EEC) 1911/91. That amendment establishes three or four very important changes: firstly, the Canary Islands were incorporated into the Common agricultural policy and the Common fisheries policy; secondly, they were incorporated into the Community Customs Union, and are therefore subject to ordinary customs duties; and thirdly, it removed the special tax rules which they had, specifically the island taxes – the so-called special licence tax arrangements – which were designed to protect local industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation (EEC) 1911/91 has led to the progressive dismantling of the Canary Islands’ special tax rules and their incorporation into the Community’s common rules. But this has caused difficulties, because the problem with the Canary Islands, as with the other outermost regions – the Azores, Madeira and the French overseas departments – is that they are a long way from European territory, divided into small island areas, with very small markets, with enormous transport problems and, furthermore, with problems due, for example, to over-population, very irregular rain patterns and poor soil, which hinder the development of normal activities. This explains why, in the past, the Canary Islands always enjoyed a special status within Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">The dismantling of the Canary Islands’ special tax status, in terms of customs duties, would threaten to dismantle a series of small local industries – food, tobacco and small commercial industries – which would disappear if we were to remove that small degree of protection provided by their special taxes, specifically the tax on production and imports.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been thorough and has taken account of this, and has therefore begun a negotiation of an adaptation of the tax on production and imports, in order that that tax may not disappear. There has also been another issue: the Treaty of Maastricht of 1992 included a declaration recognising the special status of the outermost regions – the Canary Islands, the Azores, Madeira and the French overseas departments – and section 2 of article 299 of the EC Treaty, after its amendment by means of the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997, provides for special status for the outermost regions. The Treaty of Amsterdam is now in force.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the thinking behind the new status for the outermost regions – which was also confirmed by the Cologne European Council which asked the Commission to present measures for the outermost regions before 31 December – at the moment the incorporation of these regions into the European Union does not necessarily require tax and customs harmonisation, but rather allows differentiated treatment, for example the maintenance of the port charges in the French overseas departments and the special rules for the Azores and Madeira.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission’s proposed regulation began to be negotiated before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Committee on Legal Affairs – which in general approves the proposed regulation, since it is aimed at delaying the removal of the Canary Islands’ taxes and therefore plays a protective role – we believe that, after the entry into force of article 299.2, rather than a simple easing of the limits of the special treatment, we need to paralyse the removal of this special treatment because it is possible that, in the measures which the Commission must propose for the outermost regions in accordance with the said article 299.9, which provides for special measures in the field of fiscal policy, the Commission may allow a limited reinstatement so that the relevant small local industries do not suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs unanimously approved the regulations, but proposes a series of amendments intended to indicate that article 299.2, which is already in force, establishes an additional basis for the Commission’s proposed regulation. We are not trying to oppose the Commission’s regulation, which establishes an additional basis. That additional basis would justify a measure which one could describe as containing and detaining the removal of customs duties. As a consequence of that reference to article 299.2 and the thinking which I am explaining at the moment, the Committee on Legal Affairs has proposed a series of amendments to the annexes of the regulation to halt the removal of customs duties in any of the areas where they are currently in force. It is a question of maintaining the current protectionist structure of the taxes until the Commission presents its new proposals in the field of tax policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner knows, next week in Brussels a partnership meeting will take place in which the Commission will discuss the proposals with the governments of France, Spain and Portugal, the governments of the Autonomous Regions and the MEPs from those regions. Therefore, it would seem appropriate that the Commission approve and express its agreement with Parliament’s proposals – the proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs – which are very reasonable and are in accordance with the Commission’s thinking but reinforce it by referring to the new article 299.2, which will provide for and allow the development of a special status. It does not make much sense now to totally remove the system when in a few months it is possible that the Commission will have to propose its reinstatement. This is the thinking, this is the problem, and I hope that Parliament will follow the recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs, approve the regulation and also approve the 19 amendments which the said Committee has proposed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Good morning, Mr President. Firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Members who have presented amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the words of Mr Medina Ortega have clarified the approach and position which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has agreed unanimously, on this essential issue, an issue which is important for the Canary Islands, but which affects all the other outermost regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the subject of today’s debate, the Canary Islands, I must say that few regions have lived or are living through such an intense process of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Since their incorporation in 1986, the Canary Islands have held significant and intense debates. There have been public demonstrations for and against the full incorporation of the islands, there have been governmental crises and even the resignation of the President of an autonomous government, the specific cause of which was the conditions for the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">After thirteen years, it is time to make an assessment. To this end the regulation which we are debating at the moment in Parliament is very useful, since from this assessment we can reach conclusions which will allow us to determine the position we must take. The assessment is clearly positive, although we must recognise that there are enormous worries and concerns attached to it, as the rapporteur has explained effectively. These concerns stem from what we are debating here, but also from other issues which are being studied and dealt with by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that at the moment in the Canaries there is a lot of uncertainty with regard to the future of bananas, since the Canary Islands are Europe’s top producer of that fruit, which is so important from economic, social, scenic and environmental points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">However – and I repeat – today we are talking about Regulation 1911/91 concerning the application of Community Law to the Canary Islands. The arguments and explanations which the rapporteur has given us today are clear and describe the long journey made by the Canary Islands to arrive at the process of incorporation into the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless it is essential in our opinion that this reform is carried out within the time frame laid down. This is an absolutely essential issue. We should remember the mandate of the Cologne European Council to the Commission; we should remember that before the end of 1999 there was supposed to be specific and special treatment which has still not happened; we should remember that at the moment we are debating the Commission’s legislative agenda for 2000. It is important that in this legislative agenda we include the special treatments laid down in article 299.2 of the EC Treaty for the French overseas departments, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, because, otherwise, we would reach a situation or position in which these European regions, which are vital to each of the Member States and to the European Union, are put at an absolute disadvantage in relation to the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">To end, I would like to say that our Group supports the 19 amendments and the legislative text, but asks that we do not proceed to a second reading, but that this regulation be approved within the time limits laid down. We ask the Commission to be sensitive to the rapporteur’s views, to the views of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and that, please, the regulation be approved within the envisaged time limits because, otherwise, the situation in the Canary Islands would be of great concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course our intention is not simply to support a colleague. In reality our position – now through this intervention and later through our vote – is that of Spaniards and Europeans, and perhaps even more as Spanish and European Socialists, who are expressing their solidarity with the Canary Islands and their men and women. I am speaking of a solidarity which the Canary Islands require in a specific and particular way, precisely because of the specific and particular characteristics of their geography and history.</p>
<p class="contents">Let it be clear therefore that what we want is to give a little more to the Canaries, to compensate for adverse conditions, and thereby prevent a situation where they have a little less than the other Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Manuel Medina, has explained in a rigorous and full way the legal arguments which explain how the Canaries has been defended for centuries, within a Spanish context, by means of different mechanisms which allowed those distant islands to overcome the negative circumstances which I spoke of earlier, and, with the skill, tenacity and efforts of their men and women, firstly resist and then gradually build reasonably modern and prosperous societies.</p>
<p class="contents">We were aware of the problems of the Canary Islands when we negotiated the accession of our country to the European Community and the successive Treaties, up until Amsterdam, and the constant concern to always take that special situation into account was reflected in the special Protocol 2 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, back in 1985, in Council Regulation (EEC) 1911/91, which approved the said Protocol, and in section 2 of article 299 of the EC Treaty, which describes the outermost regions of the Union, with special mention of the Canary Islands and lays down the very flexibility in the application of general rules in certain vulnerable cases which we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">It was precisely Protocol 2, which I referred to earlier, which, applying traditional formulas to the new rules, established the so-called “APIM” (Tax on Production and Exports), a modest duty applied to certain products entering the Canary Islands, many of which originate from the Spanish Peninsular and others from other States.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment there is a process under way which will lead to the negotiation between the Spanish Government and the Commission, with a view to amending the said Regulation (EEC) 1911/91, which specifically regulates the APIM in question. The concern which this amendment has caused in the Canary Islands – and which we are recognising here – has increased as a result of a certain lack of confidence in the ability of the government of my country to appreciate the true nature and gravity of this problem and in its desire to tackle that problem in the said negotiation with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality there are only three alternatives. The first is the complete removal of the APIM, which would have very negative effects for the many small and medium-sized businesses on the islands which, although they make little profit from their production, survive thanks to the fact that similar products arriving from outside are taxed, and it is therefore still viable to continue producing them in the Canaries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second alternative is less harsh but ultimately just as harmful. It would consist of eliminating the APIM gradually until it disappears completely after a few years, perhaps maintaining them partially for a few products.</p>
<p class="contents">The third solution is the one which Professor Medina proposes and which we understand that the Canary Islands requires and wants, the one which this Parliament will probably vote for in a few moments. Based on the legal considerations of the EC Treaty, we argue that the APIM be kept as it is for now, and that it be consolidated within the obligatory reform of Regulation (EEC) 1911/91. We hope that this Parliament is up to the job and does not disappoint our fellow citizens …</p>

<p class="contents">In fact, when the Kingdom of Spain acceded to the European Community in 1985 the door was left open for an amendment of the status of the European model for the Canary Islands. In 1991, when Regulation 1911/91 was approved, we experienced Community adaptation with regard to the application of the provisions of Community Law in the islands.</p>
<p class="contents">At that point a transitional period of ten years was set so that the integration of the economy of the Canary Islands into the Community would not be traumatic for some local production sectors and, <span class="italic">de facto,</span> amongst other things, a tax on production and imports, the APIM, was established with a view to protecting the integration of small basic Canary Island industries into the Community Customs Area.</p>
<p class="contents">The said tax, which protected local industry in relation to imported goods, would be gradually dismantled between 1995 and the end of 2000. Curiously, this removal of the APIM has not had the desired effect amongst the sensitive industries in the Canary Islands and therefore the Spanish authorities, the Canarian authorities and the economic operators affected have requested that the Community authorities amend Regulation 1911/91 in order to stop the removal of the APIM until June 2000, which the European Commission appreciates.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, some of us, as Members from the Canary Islands, as well as considering it reasonable to extend the validity of this tax in accordance with the Commission’s proposal, have requested by means of amendments that it affect the most sensitive products, all the sensitive products produced in the Canary Islands.</p>
<p class="contents">We also request that this customs approach be applied to a new tax with a structure similar to the old APIM, with the aim of incorporating it into a package of specific measures of a fiscal nature which the Council, on the proposal of the Commission, must implement next year – as Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya and Mr Medina Ortega have just said – by means of the proposed permanent statute for the outermost regions – which include the Canary Islands – in implementation of article 299.2, which provides for differentiated treatment, as you know, with regard to the application of the provisions of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This very week the Autonomous Parliament of the Canary Islands, during a political debate on this issue, unanimously approved an agreement which includes fiscal measures and asks Europe to provide for the establishment of a tax similar to the APIM.</p>

<p class="contents">Following its examination of the APIM/Arbitrio on production and imports in the Archipelago, the Commission concluded that even if the majority of economic sectors could adapt to the requirements of the single market, the disappearance of the APIM on 31 December 2000 could irremediably affect certain product sectors. This point has already been made in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, in collaboration with the Spanish and the Canarian authorities, has identified the most sensitive products in a number of sectors. For these products the Commission considers it necessary to suspend the dismantling of the tax for a transitional period which will not go beyond 30 June 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I note with satisfaction that Mr Medina Ortega's report largely supports the approach proposed by the Commission. However, he considers it regrettable that the measure proposed is reserved to a limited number of products and that it does not refer to the legal basis provided by Article 299(2) of the Treaty. I can assure you that the Commission understands this position perfectly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like nevertheless to draw your attention to the fact that this constitutes a time-limited adaptation of the current rules. It must therefore be distinguished from any measure which could be taken on the basis of the new Article 299(2) of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal stipulates that the Commission, in collaboration with the Spanish authorities will examine before the disappearance of the APIM the effects of this tax on the sectors concerned. The Commission will submit, if necessary, a proposal to the Council based on Article 299(2) on the measures which would be necessary in order not to compromise the existence of certain particularly fragile local activities. The products included in the annex to this proposal are the result of work by the Spanish and the Canarian authorities and the Commission. Consequently, any amendment to the list of the products must, on the one hand, be justified economically and, on the other hand, be subject to a study by the Commission services in order to check the consistency of the measures with its other policies. The Commission has not yet received such justification which would enable it to study an amendment to the Regulation's annex. It is not therefore in a position to accept those amendments concerning the extension of the list of the products. However, I can assure both you, Mr President, and the rapporteur that in future negotiations on a proposal concerning the Canary Islands on the basis of Article 299(2) of the Treaty that the Commission will take account of your comments on the matter and the comments of Parliament during the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank you for your support for this proposal and I will undertake to draw the attention of the Commissioner responsible to this whole debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it is established that the industry is being caused injury by anti-competitive practice of any kind, the Commission shall, where appropriate, propose to the Council measures to address the problem. The first report shall be presented to the Council no later than 31 September 1999”.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with this requirement the Commission prepared its first report which concludes that the shipbuilding industry in the global market is facing serious over-capacity problems. The situation continues to deteriorate as capacities continue to grow, competition is becoming stronger and prices fall.</p>
<p class="contents">The report examines in detail nine contracts awarded to Korean shipyards and finds that none is concluded at prices covering full costs and that injury is caused to EU yards. The report suggests that action should be taken by Member States and the IMF World Bank fora in order to verify whether the conditions and assumptions under which the IMF-led rescue package was given to Korea are fully respected in the case of shipyards. The industry, Member States and the Commission should collect all the necessary information that could form a basis for the preparation and lodging of a trade barrier regulation complaint and assess the appropriateness of resorting to a WTO action, the Commission should continue its market monitoring efforts in cooperation with the industry and, finally, all parties concerned should make an effort to establish a level playing field for the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Industry Council discussed the Commission's report at its meeting of 9 November 1999 and issued a Council conclusion on the situation in world shipbuilding. It shares the Commission's view on the critical situation of the shipbuilding sector worldwide and calls for continuing action to address the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Council meeting, bilateral discussions have been held with the Korean Government at the level of the Korean Deputy Minister for Trade Affairs and the corresponding officials in the Directorate-General for enterprise and the Directorate-General for trade. A bilateral meeting of the Korean and the EU industry and administration is under preparation for mid-December 1999. The intention is to organise a meeting on shipbuilding in the context of the OECD.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue its own monitoring efforts with the help of the industry and will collate and evaluate all the information and evidence collected, in line with the Council's conclusion. If necessary, further meetings will take place. The Commission will present its findings to the Industry Council and to the European Parliament in the spring of next year. My colleagues, Mr Lamy and Mr Solbes Mira are cooperating closely with me on this issue.</p>

The Council of Ministers for Industry met on 9 November and I made the following comments in this regard at home. Europe has finally found strong words but deeds must now follow. We are now giving a clear signal to South Korea to abandon unfair methods of competition in shipbuilding. We will not accept domestic, i.e. European, shipbuilding being driven out of the market by unfair practices after it has been painstakingly modernised.</p>
<p class="contents">In Germany alone, 21,000 jobs are threatened in shipbuilding along with 125,000 more in the supply sector. The irony of the situation lies, above all, in the fact that the hidden subsidies were facilitated by credits from the International Monetary Fund to surmount the financial crisis in the Far East.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liikanen, following the interesting report from the Commission of 13 October, the shipyard action day, Europe, through the Council of Ministers for Industry, has given Korea a yellow card. Any continuation of Korean dumping practices must be punished with a sending off.</p>
<p class="contents">The European shipbuilding industry finds itself in a serious crisis, one that has not just come about today. An urgent decision must now be taken as to whether to support shipbuilding in Europe and in so doing support the preservation of the entire maritime industry or to leave this hi-tech branch of industry to others. There can only be one answer to this: a clear declaration of our belief in European shipyards. Anyone who has been closely involved with shipbuilding knows that what we are dealing with here today is high technology, a branch of industry which is very much part of the future. Europe cannot, and must not, give it up.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also critics, however. Firstly, there are those who consider shipbuilding to still be an antiquated heavy industry, whose artificial preservation in Europe would come at too high a price, although a glance at, or visit to, one of the highly productive and efficient European shipyards tells a different story. I would be very pleased to arrange visits along these lines because I can tell you that it would be worth it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, shipbuilding is sometimes classified as a hi-tech industry, but then it is implied that shipbuilders are over-dramatising their situation somewhat. It is said that they are just after financial benefits at a national and EU level, as happens in other branches of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Who gets the money? The shipowners or the shipyards? The image of the shipyard has, on the whole, changed dramatically. The number of people employed in coastal regions or monopolistic ports that are already depressed has declined dramatically as a result of structural change. New technologies, fields of work and areas of management in particular as well as new tasks have overtaken the nostalgic Kon-Tiki and the warship. Road to sea transport projects to relieve the traditional road networks require all types of ship, including just in time feeders<span class="italic"> </span>and modern container ships, rapid ferry-boats and high-speed yachts, multi-purpose ships for the fishing industry and the coast guard service, large and small cruise ships and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s maritime know-how in traditional roles and new market segments is a reliable, sustainable and natural resource and thus constitutes an added value for Europe. Europe’s medium-sized shipyards, in particular, have developed a high level of inventiveness in this field, but research and development, not just production and acquisition require money, and this is where aid comes in.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who knows me knows that I fight furiously against subsidies of all kinds, for distortions of competition follow hard on their heels, as a rule. It is not for nothing that I am, in addition, a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control. It is clear that if Korea continues to act in this way, it will undercut itself and will slide into financial ruin, with only itself to blame.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Korean economy is part of the global market. We are on the verge of new WTO negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Korea needs support to lift itself out of national bankruptcy. The IMF payments are making a clear statement.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, Europe needs Korea. Just look at the order books and the volume of investment, in spite of the worldwide overcapacity which has been mentioned. This means that until a trade policy is developed by both Korea and Europe by means of bilateral negotiations and/or multilateral negotiations within the scope of the OECD, IMF and the WTO, as mentioned already by Mr Liikanen, enabling fair competition, we need various measures which are valid for a determined period until the present critical situation has been overcome. In my opinion, direct but contract-related support could be part of this, temporarily. This is the only instrument that has a direct effect, is transparent and, furthermore, strengthens competition. Returning to so-called European individual solutions, on the other hand, can mean that competition inside Europe, in addition, is distorted yet further, as in the past. We therefore need a strategy of different approaches. We would like to assist the Commission and the Council of Industrial Ministers in this approach with all our strength and energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Caudron (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Commissioner Liikanen, for many years, firstly as a member of the “economic” committee and now as a member of the “industry” committee, I have been dealing with issues involving the shipbuilding industry.</p>
<p class="contents">More particularly, over the last three years, I have, on several occasions, expressed concern to the Commission about distortions of competition at world level, made worse by the fact that Europe has always set itself strict standards which our competitors prefer to ignore. What is more, in many cases the only response I received from the Commissioners and their departments was a blunt refusal to acknowledge the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission seems now to have become aware of the situation, and I am delighted to see this because, while one may regret the thousands upon thousands of jobs in Europe which have been lost in the meantime, as we say in French, “better late than never”. Today there no longer seems to be any point in going back over past problems and that is why, this morning, I shall ask you some specific questions about the future which are not just concerned with Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question concerns the United States. I have learnt that an American shipyard, one which has not built any vessels for more than forty years, has received the order for two passenger boats intended to serve the islands of Hawaii, since American law reserves the construction of boats serving internal routes for American shipyards. What do you plan to do about this? What does the European Union plan to do in order to open up the American market to European products in this field?</p>
<p class="contents">This is my second question. If my information is accurate, a proportion of the wages of workers involved in the construction of these passenger boats is paid by the United States Navy, on the grounds of the preservation of shipbuilding capacity. What do you plan to do, Commissioner, on the matter of this American aid which does not seem to be compatible with the regulations in force in this field?</p>
<p class="contents">My third question is to do with Korea. Since 1997, the Korean Gas Company<span class="italic"> </span>has been restricting tender competitions for the construction of methane carriers to Korean shipyards only, again constituting, in my opinion, an infringement of the international regulations on the opening up of public procurement. I ask you once again, Commissioner, what do you plan to do in order to open up the Korean market and fight against these decisions which do not appear to me to be legal?</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth question relates to the matter you referred to in your preliminary speech. We have learnt or, to be more precise, we have received confirmation that the European Commission had in hand the first part of the report on the market situation drawn up in application of the Council Regulation which you mentioned. This report indicates an anti-competitive practice by Korean shipbuilders, of between 13% and 14% of Korean costs of production. As you mentioned, the question arises as to who pays the differences observed by the Commission between Korean costs of production and sale prices? The answer seems obvious. It is the Korean banking system, supported moreover by the IMF and the Korean State. Until now, in spite of a number of reminders in this field, since it is not a new matter, the European Union and the Commission have taken no effective action to put an end to these indirect subsidies in Korea. What tangible action do you plan to take today in order to act rapidly?</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude, Commissioner, by telling you that it is true that the European shipbuilding industry still receives aid. Not a lot, but some. In any case, it is scheduled that aid for orders will come to an end in December next year and I do not think we can reconcile ourselves to a <span class="italic">laissez-faire</span> policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am asking you, Commissioner, to at last draw up a trade policy worthy of the name. That is why I am suggesting that you do not carry on saying, or having people say, that we do not have the instruments which would enable us to defend European jobs better in this sector. That is why it is no longer possible to let constraints be placed on Europe which are not placed on our industrial competitors elsewhere in the world, in the shipbuilding sector as in many others.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, finally, it is time to quite simply have done with the <span class="italic">laissez-faire</span> attitude which characterised the Brittan era. Are Europe and the new Commission prepared to do so today? Permit me, Commissioner Liikanen, to ask you the question once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, as in many other areas, the reason that contracts have been awarded to countries like Korea is surely because of the conditions that apply: for example workers in such countries get very low wages, working conditions and safety measures are very poor and unsatisfactory, because the health and safety of workers is not a priority. Like in many industrial sectors, businesses are relocating to countries where they can exploit workers to their own advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something that has to be addressed when we talk about, having a level playing field for the sector in Europe; in fact what we need is a level playing field internationally for workers. We have to protect workers' rights. We cannot exploit workers in some countries while protecting their rights in Europe. Someone mentioned the EU imposing stringent measures in this sector in Europe. But what should we do? Lift those stringent measures? They were applied for a reason. There were reasons for imposing such stringent measures in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to shipbuilding itself, I also think that we need to look at what kind of shipbuilding takes place. For example, as regards shipbuilding for the fishing sector, we have an over-capacity of fishing vessels within the European Union, so what kind of vessels should be built? I think that emphasis should be put on the building of coastguard or marine protection vessels to control and monitor the common fisheries policy. The vessels being built must support local industry and local coastal fishing. Safety must be given priority. When it comes to the building of vessels, we must ensure that the most advanced technology is used to ensure that they are as environmentally-friendly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of vessels are used for transporting live animals. First of all, the export of live animals is unacceptable. In fact, it is completely wrong, especially when they are going to be slaughtered. The kind of conditions they have to endure in large vessels are not acceptable, so if new vessels are being built we should ensure that the best standards possible are complied with and that measures are taken to ensure that, where live animals must be transported by sea in large vessels, all measures are taken to optimise conditions for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue that has to be looked at in the building of new vessels is the whole issue of waste and waste facilities – and not just the waste derived from the operating vessels but also the waste produced during the trip, because marine pollution is a very important issue and a lot of marine pollution is caused by ships.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to the issue of dumping vessels discarded within the European Union on other countries, we have to be very careful that we are not dumping unsafe and ecologically unsound vessels on countries at cheap prices. This is unacceptable – it is just shifting our problem to other parts of the world, and the marine environment has no borders so anything that happens in one area eventually comes back to roost here. The whole issue of unfair competition which people are criticising is caused by the fact that the industry itself is exploiting workers in certain parts of the world. This has to stop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The liberalisation of the industry and the policy of privatisation that has been pursued in various countries have not resolved the existing problems. In the last two years, the situation has grown worse as a result of constant anti-competitive practices – as has already been mentioned here – particularly on the part of South Korea. </p>
<p class="contents">Employers’ organisations and employees’ organisations have both drawn attention to the serious consequences of this situation. On 5 November, a day of action was held across Europe in which many dockyard workers in Portugal took part. From Viana do Castelo to Margueira and Mitrena, via dockyards in the areas of Oporto, Aveiro and Figueira da Foz the workers are demanding a policy of upgrading the shipbuilding industry, of protecting jobs that are stable, worthwhile and that offer proper wages and a policy of promoting the exploitation of existing potential. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to understand the current situation, we must remember that the 1994 international agreement on the elimination of aid for shipbuilding in the context of the liberalisation of the industry is not being fulfilled. This agreement should have come into force in 1996, but did not do so because it was not ratified by some countries, notably the United States, which was one of its main proponents but which, in the end, chose to continue supporting its own shipbuilding industry, as has also already been said here. </p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what the European Council said in 1998, when it drew up the new rules on aid for shipbuilding, conditions of international competition did not, in the end, improve. Support for the industry has ceased in the European Union but it has continued and even increased in other countries, amongst which South Korea stands out. We know that this country has been concluding contracts at prices that are below the real costs of production, by benefiting from international subsidies via the International Monetary Fund, after the Asian crisis, which is destroying the order books of countries in the European Union, as the industry’s employers’ organisations have stated. </p>
<p class="contents">The recent position of the Council on 9 November, despite being too little, too late, naturally shows that the fight put up by the shipbuilding industry is having an effect. It is therefore crucial that the Council and the Member States thoroughly examine the measures that are necessary to protect this very important sector of industry in the European Union. It is important to promote a policy which will stimulate shipbuilding and ship repair and, as is vital in the case of Portugal, to combine this with renewing merchant navy and fishing fleets and, at the same time, to promote the improvement of the living and working conditions of those involved. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also vital that the Commission makes this problem and its resolution a priority, that it recognises the need to review long-held positions and that it provides the European Parliament with full information on the damage that the European shipping industry has suffered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, the question of shipbuilding must, quite obviously, be tackled comprehensively, taking one area of production at a time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States have acknowledged expertise in the field of military shipbuilding. This is a field in which the Commission obviously does not have to intervene, but in which intergovernmental cooperation should be stepped up, so that Member States can safeguard and increase their expertise and independence, at acceptable cost. It would be very dangerous to allow disinvestment in this field and one can only regret the recent problems afflicting in particular the Horizon frigate programme and the abrupt withdrawal of some partners, which upset the overall balance of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the construction of passenger and merchant vessels, both highly competitive, labour-intensive sectors, here too the Member States’ remarkable expertise and outstanding capabilities must be protected and developed and not allowed to go outside Europe. As regards heavy manufacturing units affected by significant technological developments, Member States must be able to implement a policy fostering the technological conversion of their shipyards, so that the latter can become active in market sectors which allow them to exploit their know-how. The closure of any shipyard represents an irreparable loss of expertise for the Member States and for the European Union. The Union must not, therefore, on the basis of ill-advised notions of free competition, prevent states from promoting the conversion of manufacturing units with a view to preserving both know-how and jobs. In this respect, the example of the shipyards on France’s Atlantic coast, whose brilliant recovery following a period of crisis has been particularly spectacular, and the role the French State played in this process, should be pondered.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be very careful to ensure that the forthcoming WTO negotiations make it possible to put an end to the unacceptable dumping practised by a number of countries and do not endanger a sector in which world competition is intense, since it is highly labour-intensive, difficult to automate, and therefore prey to strong pressure in favour of relocation to countries where labour costs are far lower than those we have in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I wish to mention the subject of the construction of fishing boats. This sector, which may, in the overall scheme of things, seem a rather marginal one, does however play a crucial role in the balance of the economic and social fabric of our coastal regions. The European Community plays an essential role in this field. This sector is, in fact, almost totally dependent on the common fisheries policy. But for two years now the European Commission has frozen Community aid for the construction of new vessels and, by the same token, that of Member States, until the objectives for the destruction of boats outlined in the multiannual guidance programmes have been reached. </p>
<p class="contents">This deadlock, which has serious consequences, was compounded by a refusal to take the sale of boats to third countries into consideration in calculating the reduction in capacity of the European fleet. In considering only the boats destroyed, the Commission is thus behind a considerable loss of earnings to the detriment of fishermen and ship-owners. What is more, the Commission is today proposing to prohibit any renewal in the sectors which are not advancing as quickly as others and is making it compulsory to find and destroy any capacity which exceeds by more than 30% the renewed boat capacity in the sectors which are up to date with the MAGP objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation and these proposals entail a worrying ageing of the European fishing fleet, discourage young people from investing their energies in it, cause a significant loss of sales for the specialist shipyard sector, making some of them dangerously vulnerable, and entail a clear risk for our seafarers as far as safety is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Council will be able to make the Commission see reason and carry through the proposals which the European Parliament made at the time after close consultation with Member States, in the report by our fellow Member, Mr Arias Cañete. Whenever a shipyard disappears, particularly valuable know-how built up over time, linked with the seafaring history of a region, disappears along with it. Everything must be done to prevent this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must also show consistency. After urging the construction of netters, on the grounds of the selectivity of the drift net, the Commission then, under pressure from some lobbies and some Member States, without scientific basis and in a discriminatory fashion, prohibited the use of this same drift net in some seas only. It recommended experimenting with alternative gear, but did not envisage a specific financial chapter or a specific kilowatt package enabling boats to be built in line with the new regulations which it had issued. Now, it has been confirmed, after analysing the results of the first experiments, that existing netters cannot be adapted to comply with the new conditions, and new boats will have to be built.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore be grateful to you, Commissioner Liikanen, if you would point out to your colleague, Mr Fischler, that shipowners are having trouble understanding this logic, or rather this absence of logic. The Commission shall obviously have to make the necessary arrangements to enable the construction of ships required by the changes in regulations which it has decided on.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, Commissioner, if the European Commission really wishes to make a contribution to the expansion of the shipbuilding sector in Europe, it is enough for it to clearly defend the principle of fair trade at the WTO talks, to leave Member States the freedom to intervene directly in this strategic sector in order to convert shipyards, by means of technological modifications, for activity in profitable market sectors, to promote cooperation between businesses in order to contribute towards improving the overall efficiency of each type of shipyard and, finally, in the context of the common fisheries policy, to take the necessary decisions to enable the controlled renewal of our fishing fleet, the continuation of the expertise of our shipyards and the vitality, Mr President, of our coastal regions which are dependent on fishing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blokland (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the shipbuilding industry within the EU Member States has been undergoing an overhaul for many years now. This has coincided with a subsidy race at world-market level. Taxpayers and shipyards in various Member States are at the receiving end of this, whilst shipowners who can purchase ships at far below their cost price come out on top. I think that the Commission, the Council and the ladies and gentlemen here present will all agree that this situation must be brought to an end as soon as possible. Opinions on how this should be done vary. </p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, this debate should not be restricted to the practice of unfair competition, something that the South Koreans are guilty of. Everyone within the shipbuilding industry knows that there is no level playing field within the European Union either. The Council is therefore right in deciding, for the time being, not to make any changes to the agreement to end the generic support to the shipbuilding industry as of 1 January 2001. This request is mainly expressed by the Member States that have been paying out most of the support per order for years now. As far as tangible support is concerned, this amounts to 3.5 times the amount given by the least generous government. Subsidy policy is always bad policy because it sustains bad management and often even rewards it.</p>
<p class="contents">A far better alternative would be a well-thought out industrial policy for the shipbuilding industry aimed at innovative production methods, which are intensive in terms of the knowledge involved and which enhance efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The current shipbuilding directive contains various obscure support schemes in respect of research and development, environment, innovation and regional support policy, which result in the “good” shipyards being punished and the “bad” ones rewarded. Any government should do the opposite in fact. </p>
<p class="contents">The OECD agreement, which provides for abolishing order support, in particular, is not a panacea. South Korea and also the EU Member States are clever enough to keep supporting their maritime industries in a non-transparent manner. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission should lodge a complaint with the WTO against South Korea without delay and at the same time continue the inquiry into the orders placed with South Korean shipyards. If ships are sold at approximately 20% below cost price, then this is a sure case of dumping. Pressure must be exerted at the same time. </p>
<p class="contents">The Daewoo shipyard, which has been bankrupt for some time, but is still launching ships, should be dismantled and not resold. I would also ask the Commissioner to institute an inquiry into the actual subsidy level per order within the European Union. The transitional regulation to abolish generic order subsidies should also be reconsidered. Countries that make an unlimited budget available for this create a run on subsidies. The consequence will be that excellent ship yards – these are often the most efficient ones – will go under in the course of 2001-2002 and it will be much harder to compete with Japan, South-East Asia and the United States with the least efficient ship yards which will then be left in the European Union. A possible delay in the discontinuation of generic order subsidies can be considered if the transitional period is abolished. I would appreciate it if Commissioner Liikanen were to take this into serious consideration. </p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commissioner ask the IMF to investigate where the subsidies to South Korea eventually ended up? </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to reiterate what I said on 31 March 1998. The strategic significance of the European shipbuilding industry is evident. We want to be able to continue to build our own ships, even if we are forced to help the sector out due to external circumstances. But let us not make a mess of it within the European Union by having all sorts of obscure regulations and by blowing taxpayers’ money in the process. I am sure that that would not do the sector any good whatsoever. The end goal should still be the same: the abolition of all kinds of government subsidies so that each shipyard gets the price it deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hopefully these measures will work, as South Korea’s operations really weaken the prospects for success of European shipyards in the face of already intense competition from elsewhere. As the Finnish Minister for Trade and Industry clearly stated at the meeting, the EU, however, must not give as good as it gets when it comes to South Korea; in other words, it must not return to the idea that it is not prepared to give up its shipyards. To borrow the Minister’s words, continuing such support would be tantamount to the EU shooting itself in the foot. This is precisely what the South Koreans must be hoping for.</p>
<p class="contents">For a long time now the Commission has aimed to give up shipyard aid in its present form, and this aim should absolutely be maintained. The idea is to replace shipyard aid with newly designed investment and environmental aid schemes and grant more aid to research and innovation, which is what Mrs Langenhagen so eloquently spoke about. With the new schemes the Commission aspires to support a more environment-friendly, safer European fleet, as was decided in 1997 in connection with the guidelines for state aid for maritime transport. I gladly welcome this policy, as long as it is also implemented in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I would especially like to remind the Commissioner that the Union promised Finland, when we were negotiating membership, that it would take account of our remoteness and climate when deciding its aims for navigation policy for the whole continent. In July 1999, the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications notified the Commission of the interest subsidy programme for vessel acquisitions, set up to promote the purchase and basic repair of safe and environment-friendly cargo ships which can sail easily through icy waters, these being essential in Northern Europe. There is broad national consensus on the issue in the Finnish Parliament, as shown by the fact that, exceptionally, on its own initiative, the parliament increased powers to solicit acquisitions in the 1999 budget. As a former Minister of Finance, Commissioner Liikanen will understand the significance of this. Now, however, it would appear that officials in the Commission’s Directorate-General for competition have a firm intention to interpret the programme in question as aid to shipyards, although the programme does not affect the competitive position of shipyards, as a ship receiving aid can be ordered from any country whatsoever. This is also what was stated in the Commission’s letter of 4 August 1999 by officials in Directorate-General VII when they pointed out that the aid had no connection with shipyards in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to take the opportunity of asking the Commissioner how the Commission intends to ensure environmentally friendly developments and greater safety in maritime transport in Northern Europe, if it does not allow the implementation of the action framework it created itself. Although we have clearly decided to abandon shipyard aid, the recent events in South Korea cannot be allowed to lead to a situation where the Union starts to confuse the old-fashioned shipyard aid with the action based on the 1997 guidelines, which did not relate to competition policy but were purely in line with sustainable development and the ‘safety of the seas’ doctrine. Finally I would ask you, Commissioner Liikanen, how it is possible for a Member State to create a policy on navigation if it cannot trust in the directions given by the Commission? How has the Commission in its recent exchange of letters with the Finnish Government taken account of the protocol on navigational policy in our negotiations for membership? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I find this debate very depressing because we seem to be covering the same old ground, discussing an issue we have dealt with many times before in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it depressing because I was born in a small port town where, at the time, there was a boatyard on practically every corner. They were wooden boats. There was a profession, that of boat-builder, which was a proud profession. I realise that progress is inevitable and that it is not possible for such a profession to be maintained today, but the situation is alarming. The fact that Europe will end up with no shipbuilding industry is worrying. It was we Europeans who opened up the world through navigation: the Scandinavians in the North, the Portuguese and Spanish towards America, Africa and Asia, the Dutch, the Danish, the English and the French have sailed all the oceans in ships built on our lands and in our shipyards.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we live in a globalised economy, which means that rationalisation is needed and that is why a series of restructurings has been undertaken. However, I believe we are reaching a limit. Specifically, the disappearance of all types of aid on 31 December 2000 is going to cause a problem. Although I agree with some of the previous speakers, such as Mrs Kauppi, that it is not good to maintain a subsidy system, in the long run this situation clearly harms the sector itself. Furthermore, we have been abolishing subsidies in the shipbuilding sector, yet it has continued to fall apart.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment the shipbuilding sector is in tatters. Wherever you go there is a closed shipyard and thousands of people who have lost their jobs. For example, since 1984, <span class="italic">Astilleros Españoles</span> (Spanish Shipyards) has undergone three restructurings. Last Wednesday there were worker demonstrations in Spain, in all the shipbuilding cities – Bilbao, Cádiz, Puerto Real, Seville and Asturias – accompanied by a considerable degree of violence, because we are threatening the lives and security of many millions of homes.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another problem. In this globalised economy, it is good that subsidies should disappear, but not when there are some countries which still have them. This also raises another question – as some speakers such as Mrs McKenna have said: Is it a good thing that some countries such as Korea maintain this policy? I believe that if we look at the figures properly, it is clear that if ships are sold at less than they cost to make, the country is losing out. Therefore, that policy harms that country and its workers. Let us remember that a few years ago the Korean workers took to the streets to ask for equal status. The general theme of globalisation – as the Commissioner knows – is being discussed at the moment or will be discussed in the World Trade Organisation. I think that this is one of the questions which should concern us.</p>
<p class="contents">The European shipbuilding industry is threatened from all sides. Some of the speakers – Mrs McKenna herself I believe – have referred to the crisis in the fishing industry. It appears that the ideal is the destruction of the Community fishing fleet. For transport – including oil-tanker traffic – there are flags of convenience. But even the few ships which sail under the European flag have to be manufactured outside Europe, because it appears we are not capable of withstanding distorted competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, on behalf of the Spaniards who at the moment are enormously worried about this issue, I hope that the Commission will communicate our concern to the Council, our disagreement with the latest resolutions of the Council of Ministers for Industry – which seems prepared to adopt a meekly <span class="italic">laissez faire </span>approach and abandon the little which remains of the European shipbuilding sector – and our hope that either measures will be taken to prevent the unfair competition which is occurring or, if not, that steps will be taken to restore Community aid to compensate for the cases of inequality, incompetence and bad practice which are occurring today in all shipbuilding centres. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They propose that we fight unemployment and say that we must put an end to unemployment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, employment plans are not much use if, on the one hand, jobs are constantly being lost in many of our sectors and, specifically, in the sector which we are talking about today, the shipbuilding sector, which involves 300,000 jobs in Europe and around 45,000 in Spain. This seems to us to be an impossible equation. If you remove the subsidies to our sector, if the Korean sector continues to be subsidised, if working conditions in Europe are to be as they should be, that is very advanced, and in Korea they are terrible, the equation is impossible. It is going to be impossible to maintain this sector. And I do not want this to happen in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain there are seven regions with a shipbuilding sector. Commissioner, I come from a small region of a million inhabitants. In recent years, as a result of European policies and the policies of successive governments, we have lost 6,000 direct jobs in the steel industry, 6,000 direct jobs in mining, 10,000 small agricultural businesses, we have lost jobs in the arms industry and we have lost jobs in the shipbuilding industry.</p>
<p class="contents">When measures are introduced in the European Union – and I know that what I am going to say is out of fashion with many of my colleagues – much account is taken of the laws of the market and of competitiveness. The human factor is never, or almost never, taken into account. And the human factor is fundamental in the European Union. I am afraid to say, Commissioner, that if we continue to lose jobs in the fundamental sectors of our industry, our institutions will no longer have any credibility. If the aid stops in December, if aid is maintained in Korea, if in Spain furthermore it is proposed that 18,000 million pesetas of aid, which was granted to the shipbuilding sector, be returned, we are destroying the sector. Let us not fool ourselves, let us not use rhetoric. I am very sorry to say this, Commissioner, but if we do not adopt urgent and energetic measures, this sector, as well as other industrial sectors in the European Union, is going to go to ruin, to put it politely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">After the Council of Ministers for Industry, on 9 November, and the Commission’s report to Parliament on the situation of the world market in the shipbuilding industry, today we have heard this Commission statement to Parliament, which indicates that there is generalised concern within all the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">But I agree with Mr Medina Ortega that this should not be a “remake”, because the concern and the measures announced, while significant, do not seem to us to be sufficient at this particular moment. Although this Parliament totally supports these measures, we ask above all for more urgency, more efficiency and more thoroughness. Free trade, but also fair trade, because everybody knows about the unfair practices in Korea, which make it impossible for our shipyards to be competitive, as has already been pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, Commissioner, with all the political, economic, financial and commercial means at its disposal, must ensure that international rules are obeyed and put an end once and for all to Korean dumping, because the European sector can be viable in an environment of fair competition. Commissioner, we must also take advantage of the current unity in the European sector – I am referring to employers and unions – which has been shown in recent times and in recent days, to relaunch the European shipbuilding sector. We have to look for and find a European solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me, Commissioner, to say that I believe that the future of the shipyards in Europe is a political question which requires brave, clear and unequivocal decisions on the part of the Commission of course, but also on all our parts, especially after the conclusions of the latest Council of Ministers for Industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The aid which we have talked about today is also an instrument which the Commission must clarify, especially if it is a future strategy <span class="italic">erga omnes</span>. Parliament and European industry must know this as soon as possible, since we believe – and after this debate I believe it too – that while the world markets are not stabilised, transitional protective measures are still necessary. And we ask for these measures – and I insist – urgently, since many of our shipyards run the serious risk of disappearing, despite being technically and economically viable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, since I am also from a peripheral region, I would like to mention the enormous impact on regional development which the shipbuilding industry has, since that industry is based in many of these regions, many of them also included in Objective 1 of the European Regional Policy, with very significant shipyards which generate much direct and indirect employment, a social equilibrium which the countries undergoing cohesion need so much, which demands European solidarity. On their behalf I ask, in the case of the shipbuilding industry, for special consideration within the European Union’s regional and competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude, Commissioner. I believe that Parliament’s message today is one of support for energetic action by the Commission in this field. Thank you for your statement and for the efforts which the Commission has been making, but do not be afraid to apply measures energetically and urgently, as we have asked you today in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The South Koreans have, in six years, trebled their shipbuilding capacity. They have not done it with their own money, but with loans. American loans were pressed on them, and the American banks did this in order that they might receive back the largest possible profits. Later the South Koreans left these loans, which had been pressed upon them, unpaid. The debts, however, were guaranteed, so that the International Monetary Fund sent South Korea money to pay off the American banks. In other words, the IMF has itself contributed to the current situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The South Koreans were also advised to devalue their currency, as it was a way for them to free themselves from this economic crisis that we have caused them. They have devalued their currency by many tens of per cent and, as a consequence, their prices have become more competitive. They did not have to cut wages to reduce their price competitiveness; they only did what we advised them to do, which was to devalue their currency. South Korea is thus operating in a world that we have made for them.</p>
<p class="contents">All those politicians who are now complaining about the problems South Korea has caused us are wrong if they claim that globalisation is irreversible and that we can do nothing about it. Globalisation is something which politicians can do nothing about if they do not want to. If pay in South Korea has gone down from six euros an hour to four euros an hour, it is not the South Koreans who are to blame. We are to blame, because we caused the economic crisis in South Korea. Now that crisis is simply spreading from South Korea to our shipyards. I hope that politicians will show more credibility in this matter and look into the basic causes of the problem, and not just those effects which have been spoken of a good deal here. We have wanted to ease the effects of the problem, but that will not happen if we do not do anything about its causes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a matter of fact it is impossible to avoid it, but we are talking about an extremely sensitive political issue and that is why it is important that the Commission and the Council know that there is a broad consensus in Parliament on this matter and great concern to find a solution to the problem. </p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Langenhagen said, the crisis in Europe’s shipbuilding industry has not appeared overnight, but has been with us for more than 25 years. In fact, as the official statistics available to us show, in the last 20 years this industry has lost four-fifths of the jobs that it had in Europe, which is in fact a huge proportion. And it is becoming particularly tragic because this massive loss of jobs – in an industry that once employed half a million people – is generally taking place on the periphery of Europe, as you can tell from the nationalities of almost all of the Members who have been speaking here. And it is on the periphery of Europe that, as we all know, there are the fewest opportunities for employment. </p>
<p class="contents">But now, in the current state of play, the situation is becoming particularly unsustainable. Korea is not the whole problem. As several Members have pointed out, the Korean problem has occurred as a result of a combination of situations and factors, some within our control and others outside it: there was the Asian crisis, hyper-devaluation by more than 30% of the national currency – the won – and there was the concomitant support from the IMF which led to this unique – I would call it bizarre – situation in which Korea finds itself, not to mention the unfair way it has competed with us in recent times. </p>
<p class="contents">But we must not forget that this is also the case with the United States. The United States, whose propaganda image is as the champion of free trade, of the free market, only takes this position because of what it can gain from it: on the audio-visual industry, on the food industry, on anything that is of interest to them. But when it comes to other industries, such as this one, they are highly protectionist. We would do well to keep this in mind! </p>
<p class="contents">This Council position must be followed up. It is indeed important for the Council to take a political stand, but it must be followed up. I think that it is crucial that the European Union exerts considerable pressure in order to have Korea make a voluntary production agreement in addition to everything that has already been discussed in terms of rules designed to prevent this kind of distortion to competition. </p>
<p class="contents">For one thing is essential: it is not just the jobs that Europe could still lose in this industry that are under threat. The problem is that the shipbuilding industry, covering all the kinds of ships that we have discussed today, is an industry of strategic importance for Europe. And so, of course, it is undergoing a structural change: the type of ship is going to change certainly, but in an industry of such strategic importance, Europe cannot remain in foreign hands in terms of the building and the supply of these ships. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the opening of a new trade round in which everyone will be talking about free and fair trade, what is happening in the shipbuilding industry is really quite ironic. And that is why I think that we in the European Union must be prepared to remember this industry in Seattle, because there is no reason why this industry should remain outside the GATT rules. If this does not happen, if this is globalisation, then there is nothing more to say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As has been mentioned, the whole issue of shipbuilding has a deep impact on public opinion. We are getting closer to the opening of the world trade negotiations in Seattle and we urgently need the support of the public to be able to go forward with globalisation. But if our public thinks that there are rules for some but not for the others, this has a devastating effect for these negotiations. There have been discussions on this matter in the Commission which for that reason alone we take very seriously. We need free trade but we need fair trade, as has been said here.</p>
<p class="contents">I will reply to those points which are directly my responsibility. There have been others and I will forward those questions to my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Caudron asked what has happened so far. After the Industry Council I invited the Korean Ambassador to the Commission on Wednesday, presented the conclusions of the Council and explained to him our concern about shipbuilding. We consider it extremely important to have a strong shipbuilding industry in Europe. We will not accept aggressive measures which would lead to its destruction. We also informed the Korean side that it is important that their government supports meetings of the industries. In the shipbuilding context and OECD, the intention is to organise a meeting now between both industries to analyse the situation and to draw the necessary conclusions. Industry needs to meet but we need public support from both sides for the conclusions reached at this meeting in December. Here I am working closely with my colleague, Pascal Lamy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the issue of IMF and the World Bank, I was in contact this week with the President of the Industry Council and he has promised to take the issue up in the Presidency so that ECOFIN, which is meeting in November, can discuss the IMF and World Bank role in the area. The Finance Ministers in the member countries are, as it were, the counterpart of the IMF and World Bank and it is very important that all the member countries are urged to consider the issue of the possible negative impact of the IMF and World Bank support on the shipbuilding market. They need to inquire carefully whether support to shipbuilding and shipbuilders has distorted the situation in the world market.</p>
<p class="contents">After these issues have been discussed, on the one hand by the Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, IMF and the World Bank and, on the other hand, by OECD, we must assess the situation and take any necessary further actions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the American shipbuilding issues are concerned, the Jones Act is the famous American legislation. It requires orders in United States yards for internal navigation. So under this particular legislation the vessel must be built in the USA. This Jones Act has been exempted under GATT. The only possibility is that the Commission and member countries take the issue up in the WTO context. This has been discussed earlier but was resisted very strongly by the Americans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the question of shipyards which partly work for the in defence industry, that area has been exempted. This issue can be raised if competitors can show that this particular arrangement has caused injury to their shipbuilding market. I will analyse the questions which Mr Caudron put and come back to them later.</p>
<p class="contents">I will transmit the other question to my colleagues and I will keep you properly informed about events in the area. There are many countries which are seriously concerned. As Mrs Langenhagen said, we should not only consider the people who are working directly in the shipyards; there is also a huge skilled population working for shipyards in other industries. The negative impact of this distorted market situation is very serious. I and my colleagues will follow that very closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>In its conclusions concerning the agricultural aspects of the forthcoming Millennium Round, the Agriculture Council has clearly stated its firm will to safeguard the existing - and developing - model of European agriculture based on its multifunctional character.</p>
<p>In the conclusions of its meeting on 27 September 1999, the Council recalled that 'as was decided by the European Council in Berlin, the decisions adopted regarding the reform of the CAP within the framework of Agenda 2000 constitute essential elements of the European Union's position in the forthcoming negotiations shall be founded on the full Agenda 2000 package decided by the European Council'.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council saw a need to 'take an offensive line within the forthcoming WTO negotiations in order to achieve, inter alia, the following aims: taking full advantage of the expansion in world trade while maintaining and developing the European model of agriculture with its multifunctional characteristics and with high quality and safety standards; placing market liberalisation in a setting which brings international recognition of the constraints imposed on European farmers and agricultural products and does not call into question the principle of the Community preference.'</p>
<p>The aim of developing the existing European model of agriculture based on its multifunctional aspects was particularly highlighted by the Council which expressed its firm resolution to continue developing this model and to act to assert its identity both inside and outside the European Union.</p>
<p>The multifunctional nature of agriculture has been recognised in a wider context: at their meeting in March 1998, OECD Ministers noted that 'because of its multifunctional character, agriculture plays a particularly important role in the life of rural areas'. This is especially true in the case of European agriculture which has its own specific nature and characteristics related to its territorial coverage and the existence of different regions, to the size of its rural population and the large number of family farms, to the diversity of its products and differences in its yields and to the multiple roles increasingly taken on by it.</p>
<p>It follows from what I have just said that the Council recognises that family farms constitute one of the basic elements of the European multifunctional agricultural model - a model which the Council has undertaken to develop, thus ensuring the future of such farms.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0594"></a>

<p>Already in 1986, the Council issued Regulation 3528/86 on protecting the Community’s forests from atmospheric pollution. This measure, which came into effect on 1 January, 1987 and has been extended several times, is, at present, due to last for 15 years, and before its expiry on 31 December 2001, the Commission will provide the Council with a report on how this regulation has been applied.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Council urged the Commission to reinvestigate measures to prevent atmospheric pollution in connection with the resolution passed on 14 and 15 December 1998 on forestry strategy in the EU. The objective is to continually assess and improve the efficiency of the European monitoring system relating to the health of Europe’s forests, taking account of all possible effects on the forest ecosystems.</p>
<p>In the resolution in question, the Council also considers it essential that its forestry strategy inter alia promote, in compliance with the rules of the open market economy, the use of environment-friendly products such as wood and other products from forests that have been managed and used sustainably, and also support forestry and the wood processing industry, as they are important for income, employment and other factors that affect the quality of life.</p>
<p>In addition, the European Forestry Information and Communication System (EFICS) was introduced in 1989, and this system, again in compliance with last year’s Council resolution, should be developed in order to acquire better and more reliable data on forests, with an emphasis on the importance of cooperation with the relevant NGOs and international organisations.</p>
<p>Finally, the Community and the Member States try to promote in a systematic and coordinated way the sustainable management and use of forests, their protection and their development, when implementing a pan-European process for the protection of forests and cooperation as agreed with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and also within the framework of global conferences on the protection of Europe’s forests.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0605"></a>

<p>Action against the use of the death penalty is a major part of the EU’s general policy on human rights. In June 1998, the Council laid down guidelines for EU policy in relation to third countries in matters concerning the death penalty. The EU’s basic aim is to abolish capital punishment worldwide. To realise this aim, the Council is urging countries where the death penalty still exists to bring in a moratorium on executions, and is calling for minimum standards to be applied. Furthermore, it is asking countries to associate themselves with international legal instruments banning the death penalty.</p>
<p>The EU produced an initiative, in accordance with its guidelines, by proposing for the first time a motion for a resolution on the death penalty in the fifty-fifth session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in 1999. This initiative succeeded very well: it was sharper in tone than former resolutions, and, furthermore, it had more supporters – 72, as opposed to 65 in 1998. The EU also organised a panel discussion on the death penalty at the session of the Commission on Human Rights, which was attended by NGOs and government representatives from different countries.</p>
<p>The Council has just decided to continue with its policy, according to which it will raise the issue of capital punishment in multilateral forums, and it decided for the first time to propose a motion for a resolution on the death penalty in the general assembly of the UN (Session 54)). The resolution will urge all countries that still have the death penalty to impose a moratorium on executions with the purpose of abolishing capital punishment entirely. The Council believes that this EU initiative will give greater strength to the international trend to abolish the death penalty.</p>
<p>In addition to the initiatives in international contacts undertaken by the EU, there are situations when the Union will intercede in individual cases. The European Union is especially worried about cases where minimum standards are being violated. For example, when the death penalty is used for the most serious crimes of all, it should never be used with people who were below the age of 18 when the crime was committed, pregnant women, mothers or the mentally ill. The European Union also considers it very important that minimum standards are acknowledged, which are, for example, basing the sentence on clear and convincing evidence, the competent jurisdiction of a court, following correct procedures and adequate legal aid.</p>
<p>In the case of Joaquín José Martínez, the European Union will closely follow what ensues from taking the case to the Florida Supreme Court. If the outcome is negative, the European Union is ready to make official contact on the matter on the initiative of one of its Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0607"></a>

<p>The EU is actively promoting the entry into force and universal adherence to the CTBT; the Council has to that end adopted a Common Position last July. On the basis of the Common Position, the EU during September carried out demarches by the Troika to all those countries on the list of 44 countries specified by the Treaty and whose signature and ratification is necessary for its entry into force, but which have not yet done so, calling on them to sign and ratify the CTBT without delay. The EU also participated actively in the conference held in Vienna on October 6-8 to facilitate the entry into force of the CTBT in accordance with Article XIV of the Treaty, which contributed to building political support for the goal of early entry into force of the CTBT.</p>
<p>At the European Council meeting in Tampere on 16 October, the Member States reiterated their commitment to intensify their efforts to bring the Treaty into force at the earliest opportunity. In the same spirit, the Council will give its backing to continued efforts towards the early entry into force of the Treaty and to encourage all States, which have not yet done so, to sign and ratify the CTBT.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0616"></a>

<p>It must be pointed out that the Council has already replied to many questions put by Members of Parliament on the Echelon surveillance system. The most recent of them (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-1999-0523_EN.html">H-0523/99</a>) was dealt with in Question Time in October.</p>
<p>The question of surveillance, as the honourable Member knows, is at present being looked into by the competent bodies of the Council in connection with a proposal for a convention on mutual legal redress in criminal matters. This proposal is based on Article 34 (2)(d) of the Treaty on the European Union. It particularly reconfirms the rules of legal surveillance in cases in which legal investigations being undertaken within the territory of the Member States of the European Union extend across borders. The European Parliament has been heard concerning the proposal for a convention, which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (C 251, 2 September 1999).</p>
<p>Regarding planned action by the Council concerning the protection of people’s rights in this area, it would seem important to point out that all Member States have ratified the convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that there is special mention in the Treaty on the European Union of a respect for human rights as one of the cornerstones of the Union. In addition, the European Council at Tampere decided to initiate preparations for an EU Charter on Fundamental Rights.

<p>The honourable Member’s question relates to the work of the Council, on the one hand with regard to the external air and sea border checks carried out by the Member States, and, on the other, with regard to the reasons for migration and refugees coming from some African countries.</p>
<p>We have taken action especially within the framework of the Schengen Agreement to make external air and sea checks by Member States more effective, and with the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam this action has now been included in the European Union Code. Although Member States implement this action, the Council monitors their effective enforcement via the competent bodies. For example, we embarked on practical action, in cooperation with selected African countries, to prevent illegal immigration by air or sea on the basis of a Schengen executive committee decision on the coordinated use of document experts made on 18 December 1998. In addition, the Schengen executive committee adopted, through its decision of 28 April 1999, a plan for reciprocal visits by contact persons, who will act as advisors and support in the implementation of external border security and control.</p>
<p>In addition to the Schengen code, this sort of practical action is also being developed in the name of the whole of the EU on the basis of EU codes that already exist, in particular the common position established on 25 October 1996, which concerns assistance and initiation work in connection with border crossings in third countries. Such measures, which are coordinated through the competent bodies of the Council, do not at present, however, affect any African countries.</p>
<p>Regarding the reasons for migration and refugees coming from African countries, we would refer to the action plan for Morocco, which the Council adopted on 11 October 1999. The plan is one of five action plans, each of which defines a comprehensive and consistent approach, with attention being paid to the situation in the main countries that migrants and refugees come from and/or pass through. For each country selected, the action plans will contain proposals for a coherent and balanced combination of different EU schemes in the areas of foreign affairs and development aid, as well as humanitarian and economic aid.</p>
<p>In the action plan for Morocco, it is considered that Morocco is a country that people leave from or pass through on their way to Europe, for economic reasons. The action plan recommends mainly the following: to exploit existing channels in order to better compile relevant information, to disseminate correct data on immigration, to develop strategies to prevent the smuggling of illegal immigrants, and to promote measures to try to implement repatriation agreements. We are promoting direct foreign investment, vocational training and encouraging entrepreneurship and small businesses. We will facilitate voluntary repatriation and resettlement as well as help Moroccans legally resident in EU countries adapt to society.</p>
<p>The European Council that met in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 considered that the first action plans adopted by the Council are useful, and asked the Council and the Commission to report back on their implementation at the European Council convened for December 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0635"></a>

<p>According to the information received by the Council at the end of September, 8,960 people from minority groups are recorded to have returned to the Serbian Republic in 1999. The present estimate is at least double that figure, as many who have returned are not registered.</p>
<p>The EU continues to give its full support to the efforts of High Representative Wolfgang Petritsch. The High Representative has said that the return of those belonging to minority groups is one main focus of his work. He has recently proposed a package of reforms on property legislation, which other international organisations working in Bosnia-Herzegovina fully support, including the UN peacekeeping forces, the UN delegate for refugees, the OSCE and the SFOR. The reforms of property legislation will remove one of the greatest obstacles to the restitution of lawfully owned property and thus to the return of refugees. The EU expects the return of those representing minority groups to return in both directions as a result. In addition, the EU has given the returning migrants financial support through the European Community humanitarian assistance office.</p>
<p>It must be said that the return of those representing minority groups to the Serbian Republic also depends on external factors, such as the return of Serbian refugees from the Serbian Republic to Croatia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0640"></a>

<p>The Council is committed to a democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and fully supports the UN civilian operation efforts in Kosovo in order to achieve this goal. For this reason, the Council expects all sides to fully implement Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council in all respects. The EU and its Member States are investing heavily in personnel and funding in the reconstruction of Kosovo and restoring order there. The EU is paying particular attention to the fourth pillar of the UN civilian operation in Kosovo. This pillar is under EU command and it concerns responsibility for reconstruction and financial resuscitation.</p>
<p>The Council severely condemns the continuation of ethnic violence. With the help of the UN civilian operation in Kosovo and the peacekeeping forces there we must do all we can to end the violence. Full advantage should be taken of negotiating mechanisms with local leaders working within the framework of the UN civilian operation in Kosovo. All inhabitants of Kosovo, irrespective of ethnic origin, must be able to stay or return there and live in peace without harassment or intimidation. This was and is the basis of the EU’s firm commitment in Kosovo.</p>
<p>The stability of the countries in the area is vital for the stability of the whole region. Consequently, the Council is fully committed to respecting the territorial integrity of the countries in the area. The European Union will play a leading role in implementing the Stability Pact, which aims to support the countries of Southeast Europe in their efforts to promote peace, democracy, a respect for human rights, and economic prosperity and stability in the whole region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0655"></a>

<p>The conclusions of the Symposium held in Brussels on 21-22 October for the foundation of a European Museum, with the financial backing of the EU, have provoked some highly negative reactions and anger in the Greek people but also among experts. The view that the history of Europe really begins with Charlemagne and that it develops in opposition to Byzantium not only distorts history but attempts by means of the Museum and the Great Book of Europe to indoctrinate Europeans with ignorance, racism and intolerance. When Ancient Greek and Roman culture are removed from Europe's history, when Byzantium is actually considered as an enemy, Europe is reduced to crusades and conquerors, to colonies and violence. It is noteworthy that the President of Parliament and present and former presidents and members of the European Commission participated in the Symposium.</p>

This has provoked a great deal of protest from a number of people in Sweden who are immigrants and who quite rightly see this requirement as discriminatory. Indicating the holder's country of birth does not in any way promote traffic safety in the Member States and hence does not serve any purpose on a driving licence. According to the officials responsible at the Commission, Sweden is the only country to have complied with this Directive by introducing a letter code for the country of birth on its citizens' driving licences. Other Member States have interpreted the Directive in such a way that it is not possible to tell from a driving licence where its holder was born.

<p>The honourable Member is correct when she states that Community driving licence models - both the paper model and the credit card format - require the place of birth of the licence holder to be mentioned.</p>
<p>The necessity of indicating the place of birth derives from the need of certain Member Sates to individualise a licence holder by means of a supplementary criterion in addition to the surname, first name and date of birth of the licence holder.</p>
<p>Such a requirement was originated by the Vienna Convention of 1968 and was retained by the Council when adopting Directives on driving licences<a href="#defann_24_3" name="refann_24_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The obligations imposed by Directive 91/439/EEC apply equally to all of them and have been transposed accordingly.</p>
<p>However, the relevant provisions do not state in what way this indication has to be carried out. The indication of the place of birth may thus differ considerably: the full address, the city of birth, a postal code, the country of birth are all acceptable forms of indication that may be used. A certain room for manoeuvre is permitted whilst still staying within the spirit of the Directive.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission did not object to the request by the Swedish authorities to indicate the place of birth by means of a code.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

When will the Commission submit proposals with a view to replacing existing Community legislation? Is it true that blackmail by the US Administration (in relation to Concorde at US airports) plays a role in this matter? Is it true that the Commission is afraid of having another dispute with the USA on the WTO agenda? If the Commission decides to postpone the ban on hush kits, will it involve the EP under the codecision procedure, or will the EP be ignored?

<p>The Commission has explained in the recent meeting of the Committee for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that there are currently reasonably good prospects for a positive outcome in 2001 of the ongoing activities of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on the development of a new noise stringency standard. These prospects may offer the Community the possibility of making a strategic choice between the entry into force of the Hushkits Regulation on 4 May 2000 with the ensuing risk of a conflict that might jeopardise the development of a new ICAO noise standard and the adoption at ICAO level of a noise standard with an increased environmental benefit compared to the Regulation. As the United States have confirmed their willingness to fully contribute to the successful completion by 2001 of the ICAO activities, the Commission could accept under certain conditions to propose a further suspension of the date of application of Council Regulation 925/1999 (EC) if this suspension can be supported by the de-escalation of the present US pressures for a withdrawal of the Regulation. This strategic choice is, therefore, dependent upon the quality of guarantees that the United States will be able to give.</p>
<p>It is obvious that any proposal aimed at amending the Hushkits Regulation can only be adopted with the full involvement of the European Parliament in the framework of the codecision procedure.</p>
<p>As set out in the Commission Communication of 29 September to the Council and the European Parliament on progress made in the consultations with the United States on the noise stringency issue, the inherent characteristics of the ICAO process make it impossible at this stage to give a 100% guarantee about the final outcome of this process. It is exactly for that reason that the Commission can only envisage under certain conditions a further suspension of the date of application of the Regulation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0652"></a>

<p>Nevertheless, in its Road Safety Programme 1997-2001, the European Commission announced its intention to promote measures for 'more friendly roadsides', including barriers.

<p>The honourable Member is right in saying that in general there is in Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC) a railway network which functions reasonably well. In fact, for over 50 years most candidate countries followed a policy which distorted demand in favour of monopoly public transport and railways.</p>
<p>However, the priority of most candidate countries now lies clearly on extending and improving the road network, for political reasons as well as a result of market demand.</p>
<p>In the last few years, however, the Community has supported rail development and significant Community financing has been granted, under the PHARE programme, for railway infrastructure investment as well as for technical assistance for the restructuring of the railway companies. For example, the single largest PHARE contract ever signed in the Czech Republic concerns the modernisation of a railway section in Corridor IV<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, with a contribution of EUR 34 million. Similar large-scale projects have been or are being supported in other candidate countries.</p>
<p>In the draft Accession Partnerships with the candidate countries, issued recently by the Commission, it is proposed that railways be considered as a medium-term priority. This is to say that the required efforts of alignment with the acquis in this sector should begin in the course of the year 2000, and that assistance under the pre-accession financing instruments will then be available to secure progress.</p>
<p>The Commission, in liaison with the EIB, and the relevant International Financial Institutions are coordinating their respective financial assistance instruments, within the framework of a Memorandum of Understanding, with a view to fulfilling in an optimal manner the priorities set out in the Accession Partnerships. This includes in particular assistance to the railway sector in the CEECs.</p>
<p>In the future, large-scale infrastructure investment measures will be covered by the so-called Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA), which will come on stream in January 2000 with a yearly budget of more than EUR 500 million for transport. One of the features of the ISPA strategy for the selection of transport projects, which will soon be approved, concerned the promotion of railway transport and a significant number of proposals in the pipeline for financing are for railway infrastructure projects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1.	The European Convention on Human Rights, within the meaning of Article 6 of the Amsterdam Treaty on European Union, establishes the basis of the principles to be applied by the Union in this area. Even if it does not explicitly deal with the problems of disabled people, the rights of these persons are recognised in a general sense.</p>
<p>	In addition, these rights are specifically recognised by the European Social Charter.</p>
<p>2.	With reference to these texts, in its reports on the progress made by applicant countries towards accession, the Commission has made it clear that, in its opinion, the rights of disabled people are an integral part of human rights which these countries must observe within the meaning of the political Copenhagen criteria. The Commission has therefore observed and analysed </p>
<p>. the adoption and transposition of the relevant law that entered into force in Hungary on 1 January 1999 and the difficulties that still remain there,</p>
<p>. the situation in Romania over the course of 1998 and the progress achieved in 1999,</p>
<p>. the problems faced by certain disabled people in Latvia, as well as</p>
<p>. the progress made in Estonia and the situation in Slovenia.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Commission, these analyses and statements should contribute to an improvement in the situation in the countries concerned as regards disabled people and also other human rights.</p>
<p>3.	It should also be pointed out in a general context that by the time of their accession, applicant countries will have to have transposed the European Employment Strategy which contains guidelines on the subject of the disabled and the labour market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0667"></a>

<p>Austria notes with concern that all applicant countries display serious shortcomings in their environmental and energy policies. There are two possible solutions here: either the maximum possible alignment of standards in the areas of environment and energy policy at the actual time of accession by the individual countries or generous transitional periods. Undeniably, the first option will require substantial financial resources if standards are to be aligned in good time. The question as to who is to provide these resources has not been clarified. The second option would lead to a state of affairs in which, at one and the same time, the opportunities of the internal market can be exploited by the applicant countries but European environmental and energy standards do not need to be complied with in the medium term: this would result in serious distortions of competition.</p>

<p>The honourable Member is correct as regards the shortcomings of the applicant countries in terms of environmental protection and energy policy. Certainly, suitable solutions have to be found, inter alia, in the form of transitional measures.</p>
<p>The Community needs a large internal market that functions smoothly and that guarantees a better protected environment for all its citizens. Environmental pollution does not stop at borders or customs authorities. Our markets are already closely interdependent and they are becoming increasingly integrated year by year. We should not therefore be asking ourselves the question, as is often the case, whether imminent enlargement with transitional measures would be better or whether deferred enlargement without transitional measures would be preferable. Rather it is a question of giving precedence to the most pressing problems and establishing priorities. The internal market for energy presupposes reasonable energy prices that cover costs and efficient regulatory mechanisms in all countries and we will have to ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken even before accession. Framework regulations on the environment which form the basis of all future practical measures are another example. As regards the Accession Partnerships, this question therefore numbers among the short-term priorities.</p>
<p>In all of this, it should not be forgotten that everyone will benefit from the extension of our environmental and energy standards to other European States: New markets are opening up for the European economy and the citizens of Europe will live in a better protected environment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0549"></a>

<p>At this stage, the Commission does not intend to take a particular initiative with regard to the sale of organic products in canteens.</p>
<p>Organic farming is a production method which currently is already strongly supported throughout the whole marketing chain by the particular protection given in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. Moreover, the Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund provides for possibilities of financial support to organic farming in particular in the framework of its chapter VI, agri-environment.</p>

<p>The preparation of meals for canteens and their presentation as resulting from organic production requires that certain specific inspection measures provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 be respected, in order to ensure the origin of the products sold from organic production.</p>

The area devoted to opium cultivation has increased by 43%, from 64,000 to 91,000 hectares. 97% of opium production in 1999 is in areas under Taliban control and the number of Afghan districts where it is grown has risen from 73 to 104. Global opium production has increased from 3,750 tonnes to 6,000 tonnes - an increase of 60%.</p>
<p>For some years, the UNDCP has been engaged in costly intensive programmes to eradicate the cultivation of opium poppies in Afghanistan, which are directly managed by the Taliban, who are known for the violent and segregationist system they have forced on the country. The EU budget provides funding for the UNDCP and its programmes, including the one involving Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Given the prevailing political and economic climate in Afghanistan, and in the absence of a reliable partnership with legitimate public authorities, the Commission considers that there is limited scope for effective drug control intervention inside Afghanistan. It has provided and continues to assist the Afghan civilian population through humanitarian aid. The Community is aware that alternatives to opium production are normally not competitive economically and strict law enforcement mechanisms are necessary to support them. The Taliban have a direct interest in the opium and heroin trade and have tried to link it with international recognition. The Commission has therefore not financed and UNDCP alternative crop development programmes in Afghanistan either prior to, or since, the emergence of the Taliban movement. It continues however to monitor the activities of UNDCP and has noted the quality of recent analytical work undertaken on various aspects of the drug problem. The only activities financed by the Community in the field of drugs in Afghanistan relate to small NGO projects for treatment and prevention services for drug addicts and drug demand reduction. This will be helpful in eventually designing effective programmes when favourable conditions exist to address the issue in official partnership with a recognised government in Afghanistan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0560"></a>

<p>The Extraordinary European Council held in Tampere made progress towards a European legal area comparable to the Single Market or the EMU in terms of width and depth. Achieving this ideal to the full will take time; in the meantime, simple, yet pragmatic and efficient steps can be and are being taken in so far as out-of-court dispute settlement is concerned.</p>
<p>On 30 March 1998, the Commission adopted Recommendation 98/257/EC on the principles applicable to the bodies responsible for out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes.</p>
<p>This recommendation sets out principles for all bodies responsible for out-of-court settlement of consumer disputes. The principles are: independence, transparency, adversarial principle, effectiveness, legality, liberty and representation. The Recommendation encourages Member States to identify bodies respecting all the principles and to notify the Commission thereof with a view to building a network of these bodies. At the Consumer Council on 8 November, the responsible Member of the Commission reminded Member States which had not yet reacted, to notify the Commission about their respective systems.</p>
<p>The Commission Communication of the Action Plan for implementing the Financial Services Framework, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=99&amp;nu_doc=0232">COM (99) 232</a>, includes the initiative to create a network of existing out-of-court structures in the area of financial services with a view to improving the opportunities for consumer redress in cross-border transactions. This initiative fits perfectly into the overall strategy identified by the 1998 Recommendation.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the Commission attaches major importance to the issue of access to justice. Particularly in the light of the Tampere Conclusions, the Commission is currently examining ways in which cross-border legal protection of consumers (including those using financial services) can be improved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0561"></a>

<p>The Commission has adopted a final negative decision on the land acquisition scheme at reduced prices in former East Germany. For certain beneficiaries, the reduced price constitutes compensation for loss suffered in the past; however, this is not true for newly settled farmers. For this category, the measure constitutes state aid. The aid rate is higher than the rates the Commission normally accepts for the purchase of farmland outside less favoured areas. In addition, the aid in question is discriminatory as most beneficiaries must have been resident in former East Germany on 3 October 1990, a condition that in practice can only be fulfilled by (East) German nationals.</p>
<p>The German authorities have abided by the Commission decision which has led to a stand-still of land sales. On 25 August 1999, an amended law has been notified which enlarges the potential group of beneficiaries and strikes out any residency requirement on a given date. Furthermore, the aid rates would be brought into line with the aid rates usually accepted by the Commission.</p>
<p>At present, we are examining whether the new arrangements exclude any discrimination. Additional information has been requested from Germany in this respect. Once all the information is available, the Commission has to take a decision about the compatibility with the provisions in the Treaty concerning state aids within a period of two months.</p>
<p>Should the Commission decide that the measure is incompatible, it will not be legally possible for Germany to apply for an approval of the land acquisition programme in its original form, for which the Commission has already given a final negative decision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0568"></a>

<p>A – The electricity grid link between Spain and Morocco, partly financed by an EIB loan, was intended to enable Spain to supply Morocco with electricity at extremely competitive rates during the summer period when a considerable energy deficit is experienced. The amount of energy which this line can carry is of the same order as that produced by a large power plant. This electricity line will therefore have the opposite effect to the construction of a nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>B – There is no question, in supporting the construction of the Morocco-Spain electricity cable, of thereby promoting nuclear energy production in Morocco for exporting onwards into Europe. The Tan-Tan nuclear reactor project would consist of a very small unit (10 MW) intended for seawater desalination.</p>

<p>The Commission last assessed Greece's performance in relation to the convergence criteria in the Convergence Report of March 1998. According to Article 122 (ex-109k) of the EC Treaty, the Commission and the ECB shall report to the Council on the progress made in fulfilling the conditions for participation in the single currency at least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation. This means, first, that the same convergence criteria will be applied to Greece as for the other Member States for assessing the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence; and second, that the Commission will examine the fulfilment by Greece of the convergence criteria in the year 2000, possibly at the request of the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>According to the Treaty provisions, the Commission and the European Central Bank shall report to the Council on the progress made by Greece in the fulfilment of its obligations regarding economic and monetary union. Then, after consulting the European Parliament and after discussion in the Council meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, the Council makes the final decision on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. In between the formal reports, the Commission is not carrying out a formal assessment of the convergence performance of the Member States with a derogation. However, the Commission closely monitors the economic performance and policies of the Member States in the context of the regular surveillance exercise, including the excessive deficit procedure.</p>
<p>As regards economic developments, it is evident that Greece has made significant progress with respect to the fulfilment of the convergence criteria laid down by the Treaty. Public finances have improved: the government deficit was below 3% of GDP in 1998 and the debt ratio has been on a downward path since 1996, although it is still above 60% of GDP. The Greek drachma has participated in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System since March 1998, and in the new Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) since January 1999. The differential of long-term interest rates with the euro area has narrowed. Finally, the inflation rate is on a declining path and has reached 1.5% yoy (HICP) in September.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0573"></a>

<p>The damage caused to the Attica Psychiatric Hospital by the destructive earthquake of 7 September 1999 has been of particular concern to the Commission. In an effort to redress the adverse situation that emerged at the Hospital following the earthquake, the Commission has been discussing a series of measures with the Greek authorities along the following lines:</p>
<p>1.	Special measures for the immediate transfer and temporary housing of patients who live at present in overcrowded accommodation, through co-financing renting of buildings and the recruitment of additional qualified staff (mental health professionals, nursing staff) to cope with the increased need for staff arising from the dispersion of activity in different buildings and locations.</p>
<p>2.	The revision of actions for the de-institutionalisation of patients, that had already been agreed with the Greek authorities in the 1994-99 CSF for Greece, in the light of the extraordinary circumstances following the earthquake with a view to accelerating the effort through the immediate transfer of patients ready for de-institutionalisation to out-of-hospital structures (apartments, hostels).</p>
<p>The above activity will be implemented against the background of a broader operational plan, which is at present being compiled by the competent Greek authorities, for the transformation of the Attica Psychiatric Hospital into a modern psychiatric hospital for patients referred to it for more specialised therapy by other mental health services. This plan will include both the required infrastructure works as well as the operational interventions to achieve the objective set with particular emphasis on patient de-institutionalisation and the creation of the required out-of-hospital structures and sector specific mental health services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the honourable Member may be aware, the Commission investigates all notified concentrations with a Community dimension to assess whether they will significantly impede competition in the common market. Although it is true, that, for example, in the package tour sector, a concentration and consolidation process is ongoing, it is not true that a monopoly situation has been or would be created in any Member State. On the contrary, the application of the merger control law by the Commission has proven to be an efficient instrument for maintaining and developing effective competition within the common market, in avoiding the creation or strengthening of dominant positions.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to draw the attention of the honourable Member to a recent decision of 22 September 1999 in which the Commission has prohibited the acquisition by Airtours of First Choice in the UK leisure travel market.

<p>The Commission attaches the utmost priority to the quality of childcare in crèches as an important part of its overall social policy. The health and safety of the children is vital and provision must be beyond reproach. The Commission will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the children in crèches.</p>
<p>Significant improvements have been proposed to secure the prevention of abuse. The Commission has prepared a set of internal guidelines that would provide the staff working in the crèches with a set of instructions and administrative rules to be followed in the even of suspicion or complaints concerning the abuse of children attending the crèches. These guidelines were submitted to the relevant Belgian public body - ONE (“Organisation de la naissance et de l'enfance”)/Kind &amp; Gezin for consultation in September of this year. The Commission expects to receive the reply very shortly. For the staff employed in the crèches, a training programme centres on issues relating to child abuse is under way. The programme will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2000. Improvements are also required to relieve overcrowding in certain crèches and preparatory action to achieve that is being undertaken.</p>
<p>The general policy which requires that the safety of children is ensured is followed in the crèches that are directly managed by the Commission, and in those in which management is subcontracted. As a result, the Commission ensures that the relevant established standards are respected in terms of education, health and medical follow-up, teaching and management staff, the general environment and relations with parents. In this area, the Commission follows the guidelines and recommendations of the ONE/Kind &amp; Gezin.</p>
<p>In addition the Commission continues to pursue its contacts with the Belgian public bodies responsible for matters relating to young children, ONE/Kind &amp; Gezin, with the purpose of setting up a neutral, professional and independent system of control and evaluation of the service offered by the Commission crèches.</p>
<p>The company responsible for the management of the Clovis crèche, Esedra, was chosen following a call for tender published in 1995, which set out the necessary organisation, operational and educational requirements, on the basis of a list of technical specifications.</p>
<p>A number of companies replied to the call for tender and in 1995, following the use of the established procedures, Esedra was considered to be the company that responded best to the requirements and specifications which had been set out, both in terms of management and its education programme.</p>
<p>The current contract with Esedra runs, at the latest, to 30 July 2000. The decision to maintain the contract with Esedra in 1997 and 1998 was taken because the Commission took the view that at that time there was no evidence of serious failures by the company in terms of the management and running of the Clovis crèche. It was not deemed appropriate, at that time, to prejudge the outcome of the investigations that were then under way.</p>
<p>The Commission has decided, however, to launch an early call for tenders with a view to concluding a new contract for the management of the Clovis crèche. The first public indication of the Commission's intention to conclude a new contract was published in May of this year, and was republished in July in order to ensure a greater degree of competition. Seven offers were received. When the procedures connected with the tender have been completed, the current contract will end.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0577"></a>

The region, which accounts for over 30% of the country's landmass has received less than five percent of European infrastructure funds coming to Ireland since 1994 and not surprisingly lags behind the rest of Europe at 60% of EU GDP. There is deep concern that the continued absence of real regionalisation will perpetuate these comparatively low levels of investment in much needed infrastructure and that regional bodies will not be permitted to have a sufficiently strong role in the allocation of EU funds in the regions. Should this be the case, can I ask the Commission to fulfil the very welcome promise made by Commissioner Barnier at the hearing to visit the region and ensure that all actors involved are given a fair voice in decision making?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Up to the present, Ireland has been defined as a single region for the purposes of European regional policy with a single Objective 1 Community Support Framework under the responsibility of the central government. The Commission has encouraged the involvement of regional partners in the programmes co-financed under the Structural Funds in Ireland in accordance with the regulations. For the future, Ireland has been redefined for the purpose of European regional policy as two regions with the result that the new Border, Midland and Western region will be eligible under Objective 1 in its own right for the period 2000-2006. This change will, on its own, tend to have the effect of introducing a more decentralised approach to programme management in Ireland.</p>
<p>In relation to infrastructure spending, the Border, Midland and Western region has been allocated, during the period 1994-1999, some 33% of the total expenditure across the country, although it is recognised that there are gaps remaining in infrastructure endowment as compared to other parts of the country.</p>
<p>The Irish Government is, at present, preparing the National Development Plan which will form the basis for the negotiations with the Commission on the use of Structural and Cohesion Funds in 2000-2006. One of the Commission's priorities for the Objective 1 region will be the development of a regional strategy for Borders, Midland and Western region with an effective management structure and partnership at regional level. It is, however, the national government that is responsible for deciding the appropriate administrative arrangements at regional level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0579"></a>

<p>The accident of 30 September in the JCO Ltd. uranium conversion plant in Tokaimura and the incident of 4 October in the Wolsong-3 nuclear power plant in South Korea highlighted once more the importance of ensuring the highest levels of safety in installations dealing with radioactive materials. The accident in Tokaimura showed that the question of nuclear safety is not circumscribed to nuclear power plants but affects all installations where significant amounts of radioactive material are handled.</p>
<p>The European Commission attaches great importance to the question of nuclear safety, and will continue to do so. The accident at Tokaimura will lead to an increased effort concerning facilities other than nuclear power plants, namely in the area of training of operators and safety culture.</p>
<p>The research on nuclear fission is part of the Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for research and training activities. The framework programme is implemented through direct research actions performed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and indirect (shared cost) actions managed by the Research Directorate-General.</p>
<p>In the Fifth Framework Programme for the period 1998-2002, EUR 281 m have been allocated to the JRC, with an indicative breakdown of EUR 122 m for nuclear fission safety, EUR 138 m for nuclear safeguards and EUR 21 m for decommissioning and waste management.</p>
<p>For the indirect actions the key action on nuclear fission has been allocated EUR 142 m.

<p>The region of Transcaucasus is of vital interest to the European Union for many reasons - stability of the entire Caucasus region, economic interests (particularly in the energy sector), access to Central Asia. This being so, the strengthening of relations between the Union and the Transcaucasian republics ought to be a Community political objective of the first rank.</p>
<p>In the light of the foregoing and despite the laudable efforts by the Commission representatives in Tbilisi, it is hard to believe that the Union's presence in this region reflects the priority which it ought to have. More specifically, although the Commission has a delegation in Tbilisi it has only offices in Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Does the Commission not feel that it would be in the Union's own best interests to strengthen rapidly its presence in these two countries, in particular by opening delegations in Yerevan and Baku? More generally, what steps is it contemplating to lend a fresh impetus to relations between the Union and the three Transcaucasian republics? In particular, is it planning to offer rapidly to these three republics Association Agreements opening the way for those that so desire to full and complete membership of the European Union?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission recognises the strategic significance of the Caucasus and is deeply committed to developing an effective partnership between the Union and the countries of the region. With enlargement of the European Union to the East, these relationships increase in importance. It must be ensured that borders with these countries do not become the dividing line between poverty and prosperity in Europe. The Commission believes however that full implementation of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements should be the first priority in building the Union's relations with countries of the region.</p>
<p>The strength of this partnership cannot be measured simply in terms of whether or not there is a Commission delegation in each country. With the present arrangements, the Commission has been able to give strong support to the process of economic and political reform in the region backed by Community financial assistance amounting to some EUR 850 m over the period 1992-1998. Much of this assistance has been directed to measures to support a peaceful solution to the present conflicts in the region.</p>
<p>Like any organisation, the Commission is obliged to work within a limited budget. The need to respond to the Kosovo crisis in particular has put pressure on resources. At present, the Head of Delegation in Tbilisi is also accredited to Armenia as non-resident Head of Delegation. The Commission will soon open a supporting office in Yerevan to facilitate its activities. In addition, the Commission has appointed a Special Envoy, resident in Brussels, who has particular responsibility for Azerbaijan and who is preparing to open a full Delegation in Baku as soon as resources are available.</p>
<p>But the Commission remains committed to building up its representation in the Caucasus where possible. The Commission counts on the support of this House in the relevant budget discussions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0582"></a>

<p>The question put by the Member of Parliament concerns the limitation applied in Austria to the number of students in medical training who are permitted to go on to practical training (the so-called “Turnus”) in order to qualify as general medical practitioners, and also the limitation of the number of doctors permitted to work in some health insurance schemes.</p>
<p>Community Directive 93/16/EEC ensured minimal harmonisation of professional medical training conditions with a view to facilitating freedom of movement within the Community. Aside from the terms of this Directive, the Member States are free to determine their own regulations on training, access to and practice of the activity concerned. The responsibility of Member States for access to training and establishment of a numerus clausus was specifically confirmed by a decision of the Court of Justice in 1986. Nonetheless, as far as the measures governing access to higher and university education are concerned, the Member States are bound to refrain from any discrimination on the basis of nationality, which would thus be in contravention of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>As far as national measures to limit the number of doctors involved in some activities or the arrangements for the practice of a profession are concerned, the Commission considers that they do not, in principle, contravene Community law.</p>
<p>The question which has been put, which is limited to individuals trained in Austria, therefore comes under the jurisdiction of the Member State concerned. According to the information available to the Commission, in Austria there are various possibilities of attachment to health insurance schemes as well as, in practice, in the medical sector outside health insurance schemes (where the reimbursement of services is possible in some circumstances).</p>
<p>In general, there are restrictions upon access to medical training in the great majority of the Member States.

<p>Will the Commission indicate how it intends to build on the positive commitment given on 4 October 1999 by one of the US companies at the forefront of GM food development, that it does not intend to commercialise the so-called ‘terminator’ technology, which can be used to ensure that crops produce sterile seeds, thereby depriving farmers of the right to hold over seed produced in one growing season for use in the next, and which can have particularly serious consequences for subsistence farmers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission noted and appreciates the public commitment referred to by the honourable Member according to which the company declared 'not to commercialise sterile seed technologies, such as the one dubbed ‘terminator’'.</p>
<p>Sterile seed technology, including ‘terminator’ technology, is one of a class of so-called 'genetic use restriction technologies' (GURTs). Genetically engineered seeds that carry the specific technology produce plants with inviable seeds and affect the established agricultural practice of farmers using 'farm-saved' seed.</p>
<p>Another set of technologies activate or de-activate specific genes responsible for the value-added traits resulting from the respective genetic modifications. These technologies are still in the conceptual or developmental stage, and it will take still some more years prior to their commercialisation. The Commission will be vigilant in monitoring such developments.</p>
<p>In the Community, the current regulatory situation can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>Council Directive 98/95/EC of 14 December 1998 amending, in respect of the internal market, genetically modified plant varieties and plant genetic resources, the entire set of established seed legislation, which shall be implemented by 1 February 2000, has established a link between the procedures for 'agricultural' approval of new plant varieties and those applicable to the required assessment of the risks of genetically modified plant varieties for human health and the environment. For the time-being, the latter procedures are those laid down in Council Directive 90/220/EEC.</p>
<p>At this stage, it is too early to determine the possible impact of sterile seed technologies on human health and the environment.</p>
<p>But there is another aspect to be considered. At the time of adoption of Directive 98/95/EC, the Commission has undertaken 'to examine the concept of an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages resulting from the use of seed of genetically modified varieties in respect of the established agricultural practices'.</p>
<p>This examination is under way but has not been completed yet.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0603"></a>

<p>The recent catastrophic earthquake in Greece and the broad-based show of solidarity by the peoples of the European Union for the victims highlighted the need to establish a legal basis so that the institutions of the European Union can give practical expression to the good intentions of its citizens.</p>

<p>Does the Commission intend to put an end to this blatant inconsistency by taking the initiative to make provision for the necessary legal basis to enable the European Union to offer practical assistance in the event of major natural disasters by contributing towards meeting the immediate basic needs of the victims and helping them to survive?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is sensitive to the concerns expressed by the honourable Member. It points out that from 1977 to 1995, it administered the budget heading B4-3400 for emergency aid to Community populations stricken by natural disasters. During this period, this resource was used on 172 occasions to provide support to victims in all Member States. For 18 years, this action made it possible to provide emergency aid very promptly to victims and their families in order to assist them in dealing with the expense occasioned by such disasters.</p>
<p>The Commission also recalls that in 1996, Parliament eliminated the appropriations for this activity, despite the fact that the Commission proposed that it be continued, thus contributing to presenting an image of Community action that was human and compassionate to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that in the meantime, Parliament has supported the development of Community cooperation in the field of civil protection: a Community action programme for the period 2000-2004 is going to be adopted. However, in spite of a number of interventions by Members of Parliament or by groups, it has not deemed it appropriate to issue a clear political sign with a view to the reestablishment of the emergency aid which would perfectly complement the civil protection action programme.</p>
<p>It is therefore up to Parliament to clearly express its position as to whether emergency aid should be re-established or not, before the Commission considers the possibility of presenting a proposal to establish a legal basis for aid in the event of natural disasters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0604"></a>

The first article stipulates that, “If one or more animals on a holding comply with none of the provisions laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 820/97, a restriction shall be imposed on movement of all animals to and from that holding. If the keeper of an animal cannot prove its identification within two working days, it shall be destroyed without delay under the supervision of the veterinary authorities, and without compensation from the competent authority”.</p>
<p>The cattle targeted are those which do not have any of the elements stipulated by the identification system: ear-tagging, registration on a computer database, passport, registration on individual records to be maintained on each farm. In cases of exceptional seriousness, after expiry of the given deadline, slaughter is justified, particularly in the light of infringements committed which may represent a risk to human and animal health.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0615"></a>

<p>According to the usual procedures provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 the draft report has been immediately forwarded to an expert consultation (peer review) with specialised experts from five Member States to examine in detail the monograph in all areas of human health and environmental safety (physico-chemical properties, toxicology, residues, ecotoxicology, fate and behaviour in the environment).</p>

<p>The introduction of these vessels is not in conformity with the objectives of the MAGPs (multiannual guidance programmes).

<p>In the context of mergers and other processes of corporate restructuring due account must also be taken of the existing Community and national legal requirements in force related to worker information and consultation and to the protection of workers against dismissals. It seems particularly relevant to mention within this context the Community Directives on collective redundancies (98/59/EC), transfers of undertakings (77/187/EC) and European Works Councils (94/45/EC).</p>
<p>Under the Community rules on competition and, in particular, the EC Merger Regulation No 4064/89 (as amended by Regulation No 1310/97), the Commission examines mergers and acquisitions where certain minimum turnover thresholds are achieved by the companies concerned (= concentrations having Community dimension). The parties to such concentration have to notify the project to the Commission and are, as a rule, not allowed to implement it before the receipt of a clearance decision.</p>
<p>If the Commission, after its market investigation, comes to the conclusion that a concentration would create or strengthen dominant position impeding effective competition, it declares the proposed deal as incompatible with the common market.</p>
<p>In making this appraisal, Article 2(b) of the Merger Regulation establishes that the Commission shall take into account, inter alia, the market position of the undertakings concerned and their economic and financial power and the interests of intermediate and ultimate consumers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0622"></a>

<p>On 24 November 1995, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. On 15 December 1997, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 97/66/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector. The implementation period of both Directives expired on 24 October 1998.</p>
<p>Both Directives have the aim of ensuring the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, and in particular their right to privacy, in order to ensure the free flow of personal data in the Community. These Directives are, therefore, relevant to the matters raised in the honourable Member’s question.</p>
<p>However, the scope of the Directives is naturally limited to the issues which come within the framework of the EC Treaty. In addition, both Directives allows Member States to provide, under certain conditions, for exemptions to safeguard national security, defence and public security and to assist the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences as well as unauthorised use of the telecommunications system. Any citizens who feels that his or her privacy is prejudiced can either complain to the national supervisory data protection authorities or address a national court.</p>
<p>The Commission will report to the European Parliament and to the Council at regular intervals on the implementation of these Directives. It will, in particular, examine the way in which exemptions are applied to Member States.</p>

<p>The Spanish Government is once again implementing Community regulations in a negative manner, which is at odds with the political responsibilities of cross-border territorial units and contrary to the principle of subsidiarity, since in its pursuit of a centralist policy which generates territorial imbalances it is seeking to appropriate and channel off 55% of the Structural Fund appropriations for the 2000-2006 period which should be invested in the Objective 1 Autonomous Communities. Thus a mere 62,569 million pesetas (EUR 376 million) from the European Funds have been allocated to the draft budget for Galicia for the Year 2000: this amounts to a mere 45% of the funds which should be allocated directly to Galicia under EU law, while the rest (55%) has remained in the hands of a central government which used the European Funds in a particularly discriminatory manner in 1994-1999, thus harming the interests of the Objective 1 Autonomous Communities, and notably Galicia.</p>

On the other hand, this molecule appears to have only a limited action on the epidemiology of the illness since it is apparently effective only on Trypanosomiasis (T. Gambiense) rife in West Africa. Under the aegis of the WHO, and in collaboration with the manufacturer, these negotiations are in progress in order to improve the manufacturing process and investigate new partners. It is not, however, in the power of the Commission to exert pressure on industry for it to get involved in non-profitable activities.</p>
<p>The Commission recalls that the reappearance of sleeping sickness in Central Africa is due not to the inaccessibility of treatment, but to other reasons, particularly the discontinuation of prevention measures or the impossibility of fighting against the vector in war zones. The exponential increase of the number of cases of trypanosomiasis in these inaccessible areas (Angola, Congo Republic, etc) represents a major health problem in these regions. Merely fighting the vectors is insufficient to disrupt the transmission cycle of the epidemic and treatment campaigns will be needed in order to eliminate the pools of infected people. Projects implemented by the NGOs are scheduled in these regions but they are still dependent upon geographical accessibility.</p>
<p>In the past, the Commission has supported research projects for the development of new active molecules for various diseases, including Trypanosomiasis, and will continue to do so. The budgetary allocation for research against infectious diseases has been increased considerably for the fifth framework programme for research and development, thanks to the creation of key action II of the Quality of Life Programme. The INCO Programme is due shortly to publish an invitation for the submission of research projects into medicines based on North-South research partners.</p>
<p>Accessibility to certain essential medicines in developing countries is likely to be considerably increased by the continuation of technological research and development operations, the implementation of new European regulations on orphan drugs, improvement of the management of the distribution of pharmaceutical products in a number of low-income countries and the establishment of more effective medicinal policies based on increased support to the health sector. Action to improve the accessibility of health care is not just focussed on new medicines and vaccines, but is intended to respond to public health priorities for which basic essential medicines are often lacking.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0630"></a>

Since the museum of Europe currently being established, which is also financed by European Union resources, uses similar definitions, locating the beginning of Europe, for example, with Charlemagne, restricting it to the Catholic church, leaving out Greece, Rome and Byzantium, etc., and giving rise to all kinds of suspicions as to its ulterior motives, which body decided on the delineation of Europe and the funding of a museum with aims such as these, and when did it do so? Are approaches such as those advanced by the museum an ideological standpoint for the next enlargement?</p>

<p>The honourable Member refers to an intervention made on 19 October 1999 by the responsible Member of the Commission in charge of Environment to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament. The Commissioner committed herself to keep the Committee regularly informed on developments intervened in the framework of Commission efforts in the field of implementation of Community environmental law.</p>
<p>It should be first recalled that a fair amount of information is already available to Parliament (and also the public since it can also be consulted on the Internet) on these matters, e.g.:</p>
<p>-	The Annual Report of the Commission on monitoring the application of Community Law, which includes an extensive chapter on the environment containing also comprehensive tables over the present situation on the implementation of each directive per Member State.</p>
<p>-	Annual Survey on the Implementation and Enforcement of Community Environmental Law, produced by the Directorate-General for Environment and supplied to Parliament pursuant to the Council Resolution on the Commission's Communication on Implementing EC environmental law.</p>
<p>-	Press releases produced by the Directorate-General for Environment on decisions taken by the Commission concerning infringements.</p>
<p>Additional information is also available within the framework of the 'International Market Scoreboard' which includes environmental directives. This scoreboard belongs to the responsibility of the Directorate-General for the Internal market, but receives input from the Directorate-General for Environment with regard to environmental directives. This scoreboard is updated on a six-monthly basis (April and November) and is sent to the Council, European Parliament and Member States to help them to follow progress made.</p>
<p>A first step would therefore be to improve the way in which this information is presented and conveyed to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament. The Commission will make sure that this is done on a regular basis. The Commission is also currently examining how the scope and quality of this existing information could be improved in order to provide us with the best possible overview of the situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-1999-0641"></a>

<p>The Commission decided to decrease certain refunds in the milk sector because of the increased export activity for those products coupled with improved world and internal market situations. World market prices for skimmed milk powder (SMP) and whole milk powder (WMP) have increased from low points reached in July and the US dollar has been showing positive trends for some weeks. In addition, the internal price of SMP has increased substantially reflecting strong demand from both external and internal sources leading some industrialists to claim there was insufficient supply for their internal needs. In light of the market opportunity presented and the requirement to make the best use of scarce budgetary resources, the Commission has made a prudent change in export refunds. The Commission underlines the prudent nature of the change adopted because, while the internal and external markets allow it now, it is difficult to predict what the Community's opportunities for selling on the world market will be next year when the effects of increased milk production outside the Community may limit the Community's outlets. The decision taken ought to be politically acceptable in light of the fact that it was taken on the basis of the rules for fixing export refunds, the gap between the external and internal prices ought to be bridged by an export refund.</p>

<p>In June 1998, the Council, meeting in Luxembourg, decided that the use of driftnets for tuna fishing should be phased out by 1 January 2002. It also decided, in Regulation 1239/98/EC,<a href="#defann_79_1" name="refann_79_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> that the fleet should be reduced by at least 40% for 1998 and that lists should be drawn up yearly. It is more than clear that the provisions of this Regulation are not being complied with: the lists are not being forwarded on time, the number of vessels using driftnets is actually increasing, etc.</p>
<p>The Commission, however, in its reply of 6 October 1999 to a question on the subject, stated that, according to information applied by the Member States, the obligation laid down in Article 11 of the Regulation is in fact being complied with.</p>
<p>Has the Commission taken any action since that date to ascertain whether this Regulation is being strictly adhered to? Can it state what checks it has made on the implementation of its provisions?</p>

<p>The Commission is dealing with research on aircraft emissions from two different aspects.</p>
<p>The assessment of aircraft emissions has been dealt with in the Fourth Framework Programme for Research and Technical Development (FP4) under the specific programme 'Environment and Climate' and is continued in the Fifth Framework Programme (FP5) under the Key Action on Global Change Climate and Biodiversity. A couple of research projects under FP4 dealt with the issue of measurements of aircraft emissions of water vapour. In particular, the project POLINAT II (Pollution from Aircraft Emissions in the North Atlantic Flight Corridor) has performed successful studies of measurements and modelling of aircraft emissions including water vapour, carbon dioxide and nitrogen species. The results indicate that these atmospheric species could have a potential impact on climate change.</p>
<p>Moreover, Key Action 4 (Aeronautics) of the specific research Programme 'Competitive and Sustainable Growth' (FP5) is devoting major research activities to the enabling technologies for the abatement/mitigation of the atmospheric impact of aircraft emissions, such as CO2, NOx, particulates (smoke) and aerosols, the latter two of which together with the emitted water vapour (as CO2 a basic product of the combustion process of fossil fuel) form contrails and cirrus clouds at cruise altitude of the aircraft in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.</p>
<p>For a worldwide review on the ongoing activities in the area, just recently, i.e. in June 1999, a Special Aviation 'Aviation and the Global Atmosphere' has been published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report is the first and only assessment up to now for a specific industrial subsector. This 300 pages report, by far the most comprehensive assessment carried out on the effects of aviation on the atmospheric envelope and the possible strands for mitigation, states that emissions from air traffic producing water vapour are considered to have a potential major impact on climate change. The report<a href="#defann_80_1" name="refann_80_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is available from Cambridge University Press, UK. The Commission has contributed to this assessment through its own basic European assessment report, published in 1998, and the results of various research projects it has supported since the early nineties under the Research Framework Programmes, and in particular under FP4.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The second report concluded, however, that there was a need for the 1991 Directive to be updated and extended, in particular to cover a wider range of criminal activity and to apply to a number of vulnerable non-financial professions and activities. The Commission tabled the corresponding proposal in July 1999<a href="#defann_81_4" name="refann_81_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. This proposal included in particular criminal activity damaging or likely to damage the European Communities' financial interests. Work on it has already begun in the European Parliament and the Council. The Tampere European Council of October 1999 called for this proposal to be adopted as a matter of priority.</p>
<p>The fight against money laundering has both first and third pillar elements and parallel to the work on the directive a number of initiatives to reinforce police and judicial cooperation in this area have been adopted or are under discussion under Title VI of the Treaty.

<p>The abolition of the drachma green rate and its replacement by the Euro exchange rate has had serious negative repercussions on the income of Greek farmers. The relevant EU regulation, which is supposed to deal with the problem of the countries remaining outside EMU, has turned out to be ineffective in practice and to be inadequate to cope with the nominal reduction in the prices of agricultural products caused by the EU's currency policy.</p>
<p>Given that allocations have been provided for, most of which have in fact not been used, for offsetting exchange losses in trade with third countries, following the creation of the euro and the abolition of the green rate, does the Commission intend to amend the regulation in order to regularise the rates and to pay compensatory amounts to Greek farmers in order to eliminate the reductions in prices and subsidies due to currency parity considerations?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The agrimonetary compensation linked to the introduction of the euro is governed by Council Regulations (EC) 2799/98 (agrimonetary scheme of euro) and 2800/98 (transitional measures for the introduction of the euro). It results from Articles 4 and 5 of Regulation (EC) 2799/98 that agrimonetary compensation can only be granted if certain conditions are fulfilled, notably, that an appreciable revaluation has taken place. These conditions are not fulfilled in the Greek case.</p>
<p>Although the euro value of the drachma applicable to prices is lower than the agricultural conversion rate applicable up to 31 December 1998, the reduction of the conversion rate (-3.414%) cannot be considered as an appreciable one, as defined in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) 2800/98 as the threshold rate is not reached. Concerning the conversion rate applied to the 'direct payments', the Greek situation is heterogeneous. For premia applicable to livestock and for the structural measures, the 1999 conversion rate gives rise to an increase in national currency of 4.628% compared to 1998. On the other hand, the 1999 conversion rate applicable to arable crops is lower (-7.876%) than the rate applied in 1998. But here again, the reduction of the conversion rate is not appreciable because it does not exceed the threshold as defined in Article 5.5 of Regulation (EC) 2799/98 and therefore, no agrimonetary compensation can be granted.</p>
<p>The euro values of the Greek drachma during 1999 do not meet the conditions fixed in the above mentioned Regulations. Therefore, no agrimonetary compensation can be granted in the Greek case. Furthermore, the Commission does not intend to make a proposal modifying current legislation in this matter.</p>

<p>According to this year's EU report and the statement of the Member of the Commission responsible for environmental matters, ozone pollution poses a serious problem for the Greeks and other citizens, particularly those in Mediterranean countries. Measurements of ozone levels reveal that it often considerably exceeds the precautionary limits set by Community legislation. The representatives of the Mediterranean countries have maintained that the cost of the measures required to reduce the ozone pollution of the atmosphere by 70% by 2010 (with 1990 as the reference year) is exceptionally high and that they are unable to make any definite commitments. </p>
<p>Does the Commission intend to undertake the promotion of the legal framework necessary to safeguard public health and protect the environment, through a reduction in ozone pollution and the provision of adequate financial resources to surmount the problem of the cost of measures, particularly since these represent a burden upon the Mediterranean countries that is out of proportion with their part in creating the problem?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Several years' monitoring of ozone levels in the Community showed widespread cases whereby the current ozone protection thresholds of Directive 92/72 on air pollution by ozone<a href="#defann_83_1" name="refann_83_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> have been exceeded in particular in Central Europe and in the Mediterranean countries. The Commission last June adopted a proposal for a Community strategy against ozone<a href="#defann_83_2" name="refann_83_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which comprises a proposal for a daughter directive related to ground-level ozone under the current framework of air quality legislation<a href="#defann_83_3" name="refann_83_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The proposal sets interim target values for ozone in ambient air to be achieved as far as possible by 2010. Given the transboundary nature of ozone pollution, efforts to reduce the emissions of ozone forming substances have to be coordinated on a European level. Therefore, the Commission's strategy includes also a proposed Directive setting limits for the total emissions in 2010 (National Emission Ceilings Directive) differentiated for each individual Member State.</p>
<p>The ceiling for each Member State was derived so that the underlying environmental objectives were met in the most cost-effective manner for the Community as a whole, while reflecting the polluter-pays principle. Costs for each Member State of implementing the ceilings were part of the analysis underpinning the proposal and the specific conditions in the Mediterranean as regards the formation of ozone were fully taken into account.</p>
<p>Cost per capita or GDP incurred in most countries in Southern Europe are lower than the Community average. The exception is Greece which because of its location at the periphery of the Community has to make a relatively high effort. However, the proposed emission ceilings for Greece will lead to a pronounced decline of the pollution load especially in Athens. Additionally, analysis of the cost of damage from ozone exposure to humans and vegetation in Greece has clearly shown that costs for abatement are more than balanced by the benefits from reduced ozone exposure for Greece. As Member States have full flexibility on what action is appropriate to comply with the emission ceilings in their particular circumstances there is no specific financial support planned in relation to that proposal. The Commission believes that existing regional funding schemes provides for any emerging need for support.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that when the new protocol under the UN-ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution enters into force, it will require additional efforts from Greece's neighbours like Bulgaria. This will mean a remarkable relief for Greece compared with the ceilings in the NEC proposal, which had to be based on no further reductions beyond 'current legislation' outside the Community. In order to accommodate this development, the proposal for the national emission ceilings Directive and the ozone Directive include a revision clause committing the Commission to revise the emission ceilings by the end of 2004 accordingly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Whilst welcoming the future enlargement of the Union, serious questions arise as to the implications of this process on the historic nations and regions. As a representative from Wales, I am deeply concerned about the implications for future representation in this House of nations and regions within larger Member States such as the UK. Stateless nations such as Wales and Scotland are underrepresented within the EU in comparison to Member States with a similar population. Whilst accepting the inevitability of a reduction in the number of present Members in this House to accommodate new Member States, can the Commissioner give a guarantee that it will be done in a fair manner and not at the expense of underrepresented regions?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
