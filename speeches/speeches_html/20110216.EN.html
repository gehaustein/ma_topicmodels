As this interpretation was not contested by anyone pursuant to Rule 211(4) of the Rules of Procedure, the interpretation can be deemed to have been adopted. As a result, the vote on the Mathieu report on the procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State has been removed from the agenda for this part-session.

We discussed the subject of Croatia’s progress on its path towards the European Union. I am extremely pleased that today we can discuss the status of the negotiations and the outlook for Croatia’s future in the European Union directly, with all our fellow Members present. I am also pleased that Commissioner Füle, who is responsible for our neighbourhood policy, is present in the Chamber. I would now like Mr Martonyi to take the floor on behalf of the Council. Mr Martonyi and the Hungarian Presidency attach a great deal of importance to enlarging the EU to include Croatia, and this is therefore an important item on the Hungarian Presidency’s agenda.

<p class="contents">This meeting provides a timely opportunity to review progress on Croatia’s accession process and present the Hungarian Presidency’s plans for this first semester of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, I would like to welcome Parliament’s active engagement with the enlargement process, and its constructive contribution to the general debate on enlargement and on Croatia’s accession process in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have underlined several times, enlargement reinforces peace, democracy and stability in Europe, serves the European Union’s strategic interests and helps the EU to better achieve its policy objectives in important areas which are key to economic recovery and sustainable growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is a key driver for political and economic reform. It moves forward at a pace which is largely determined by the candidate country’s respect of the Copenhagen criteria and its capacity to take on the obligations of membership.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is one of the main priorities of our Presidency, and our work during this semester will be to advance the policy in line with the renewed consensus on enlargement adopted by the European Council in December 2006, as well as with the Council conclusions of 14 December 2010, which have been endorsed by the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Croatia, conclusion of the accession negotiations, as stated in the conclusions of the European Council, is within reach, and our goal is to conclude the negotiations by the end of the Hungarian Presidency – provided of course that Croatia completes the remaining benchmarks for closing the negotiating chapters.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to finalise the accession treaty as far as possible, thereby paving the way to Croatia’s accession to the EU which we look forward to. Therefore, as highlighted in your resolution, this semester will be crucial for Croatia’s negotiating process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now speak very briefly about the outstanding issues. So far, since the start of negotiations, 34 of the 35 chapters have been opened for negotiation, of which 28 have been provisionally closed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore very close to the conclusion of the negotiations. However, we still have to close a couple of difficult chapters such as competition, agriculture and rural development, fisheries, regional policy and coordination of structural instruments, the judiciary and fundamental rights, and financial and budgetary provisions, some of them of course with budgetary implications.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Council conclusions on Croatia adopted last December, we highlighted key issues that require further work in these areas. You have been informed of them. We would also like to underline some points which are duly reflected in your resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has noted that encouraging progress has been made by Croatia in many areas, including the rule of law and the fight against high-level corruption. At the same time, it is clear that further efforts are required. These concern judicial independence and efficiency and the fight against corruption at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council also encouraged Croatia to step up its efforts to fulfil the remaining benchmarks, including the building of convincing track records, in particular as regards competition policy, as well as the judiciary and fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, let me underline the importance we attach to the monitoring process in the alignment with – and implementation of – the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, with a view to ensuring administrative capacity and to building a convincing track record.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the Commission’s assessment of progress in the field of the judiciary and fundamental rights in March will be very important as regards the possible closing of Chapter 23 later in the semester. Moreover, on the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the Council noted Croatia’s generally good cooperation with ICTY, while reiterating that full cooperation remains essential, in line with the negotiating framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the Interagency Task Force has started to explore important new avenues, the Council has called on Croatia to continue the administrative investigation in order to account for the missing military documents.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Council welcomed Croatia’s active role in regional cooperation as well as the improvement in its relations with neighbouring countries and its efforts aimed at reconciliation in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into force of the arbitration agreement on the border issue with Slovenia at the end of November was a very welcome development in this regard. Bearing in mind the importance of good neighbourly relations, the Council has encouraged Croatia to build on this progress in its efforts towards resolving all outstanding bilateral and regional issues in cooperation with the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me reiterate that there is still a lot to be done during our Presidency. Croatia should spare no effort to fulfil the remaining benchmarks, to maintain and improve what has already been achieved and, in line with the negotiating framework, to conclusively address all other obligations still outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, it goes without saying that we count upon the support and cooperation of all Member States, of the European Commission and, of course, first and foremost, of the European Parliament, in this endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to keep up this momentum in order to conclude the negotiations successfully, as underlined among the priorities of the Hungarian Presidency until the end of June, i.e. until the end of our Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It acknowledges the impressive progress achieved by Croatia in meeting the criteria for accession, while recognising the efforts that are still necessary to conclude the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and Croatia have provisionally closed 28 of the 35 negotiating chapters. The ministerial accession conference of 19 April should be able to provisionally close additional chapters where Croatia has either fulfilled, or is very close to fulfilling, the closing benchmarks. As noted by the December 2010 General Affairs Council, the conclusion of negotiations is within reach.</p>
<p class="contents">As with all negotiations, the most difficult issues remain to be tackled in the final phase. As Minister Martonyi has just underlined, the Hungarian Presidency announced earlier its goal to finish negotiations in the first half of 2011, if all criteria and benchmarks are fulfilled. This is an ambitious goal which can only be achieved if Croatia continues to make an exceptional effort to fulfil the remaining requirements in time.</p>
<p class="contents">The main outstanding challenges are the closing benchmarks for Chapter 23: Judiciary and fundamental rights and Chapter 8: Competition policy. Croatia has been working hard in both areas, but now is the time to go the final mile.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the judiciary and fundamental rights, the main areas where Croatia is called upon to deliver on its commitments are: establishing a credible and sustainable track-record in the fight against corruption; strengthening the independence, accountability, impartiality and professionalism of the judiciary; addressing the issue of impunity for war crimes; meeting targets in the Housing Care Programme for refugees and improving the implementation of minority rights. Full cooperation with ICTY remains a requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">In each of these areas, there are clear benchmarks to be met. The Commission is currently taking stock of the progress achieved by Croatia for each of the benchmarks, on which we will report in our upcoming interim report on this chapter due by the middle of March.</p>
<p class="contents">I had a very useful and constructive meeting with Prime Minister Kosor yesterday. We discussed the importance of maintaining the momentum of the accession negotiations and of tackling the remaining outstanding issues. The Croatian authorities are well aware of what they still need to do. Indeed, I was very pleased to be reassured of the Prime Minister’s personal commitment to ensuring that the work continues at full speed until the European Union accession process can be concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">I could not agree more with those who call on the European Union neither to make ‘special discounts’ nor to impose artificial hurdles on Croatia. The principles of full respect for the conditionality that applies to the candidate countries, and full respect for the commitments that the European Union has made, remain the cornerstones of the enlargement process. This is the essence of its credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to give its full support to Croatia, which is working hard to achieve its goal of accession to the European Union. I am sure, and here I am following the line of Minister Martonyi, that the Member States will decide that accession negotiations can be concluded as soon as we can ascertain that the remaining closing benchmarks have been met. I am equally sure that, when Parliament is requested to give its consent on the draft Accession Treaty, it will play this critical role in accordance with the very constructive approach that it has shown with regard to Croatia’s accession process.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with your rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, I firmly believe that the citizens of Croatia, after being called upon to endorse their country’s accession to the European Union, will be able to vote for their representatives in the next elections to the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will start by mentioning what, I am sure, was a very successful visit to this House yesterday by the Prime Minister, Jadranka Kosor. Mr President, you mentioned that Croatia’s accession is not only important for Croatia and for the European Union, but it is also important as a signal to the whole region. The first point that I would like to use to emphasise this relates to the reforms. If a country carries out the tasks that have been asked of it, then we must also keep the promises that were made with regard to membership. As Mr Martonyi and the Commissioner have said, there is still work to be done. The message must still be: please also take the final steps of the reforms so that we can achieve our common goal of concluding the treaty in June.</p>
<p class="contents">During the conversation with Mrs Kosor, Mr Schulz said that the dispute in the Gulf of Piran would previously have been settled by fighting a war. Today, we sit around a table and try to find a method of negotiating these matters. That, too, is an important signal to the region as a whole – I am thinking of Serbia and Kosovo here – that such disputes can be settled, not by fighting, but simply by negotiations and dialogue. The Prime Minister said that in her country the government and opposition were moving in the same direction with regard to the EU. My last conversation with Zoran Milanović, the leader of the Social Democrat opposition, also confirmed that to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, we discussed Albania. Albania, too, could take this as an example of how to go about things when it comes to important common concerns, over and above any political debate.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore send a dual message to Zagreb and Croatia as a whole to the effect that we – the Council, Commission and European Parliament – are working together to be able to conclude the negotiations in June so that the treaty can be concluded and we can then give our consent in the autumn, so allowing the ratification process to actually be carried out, but please – and this is addressed to Croatia – deal with the issues that are still outstanding. With regard to combating corruption, courageous steps have already been taken, but there are a few final steps that are still needed. With regard to the reform of the justice system and also where the shipyards are concerned there is still work to be done. However, all of these points are also referred to in our report, and they do not represent insurmountable barriers, but provide the opportunity for Croatia to still fulfil the relevant requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, we should send a joint message today from all of us here to Croatia, and indeed to the whole region, to the effect that if a country carries out the tasks it has been asked to do, the European Union will also keep its promise of allowing it to become a member of this Union. Mr President, as you too said yesterday: it will also benefit the European Union if we accept Croatia, provided it has done what it has been asked to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank the shadow rapporteurs once again. If we are able to send out a signal that is as united as possible to Croatia and the whole region, we will have taken a major step forward for the peaceful integration of the entire region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was a year old and the people rejoiced as they did in Hungary, the Czech Republic and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Then on 28 June 1991 came the brutal attack by the Yugoslav People’s Army. At that time, everything seemed to have reverted back to how it used to be. I was in Vukovar when this small, blossoming model of Europe was destroyed and hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes and thousands lost their lives. Since then, I have been able to accompany Croatia along the path towards the European Union. We quite clearly have to acknowledge that Croatia has made an extraordinary effort to move along this path.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has come up with the key word today. He spoke of fairness. We could give the Swoboda report the overall title of ‘Fairness for Croatia’, because that is the heart of the matter. It is not about privileges or discounts – that has rightly been said – but about fairness. Croatia is ready for accession to the European Union now. Final efforts still need to be made in a few areas in the next few months. However, we must not create artificial barriers for this country, as has, unfortunately, repeatedly been the case over the last few years. Croatia belongs in a historical and cultural context with Slovenia and Hungary. It should have been accepted into the European Union along with these Central European countries – Croatia is also very much a Central European country. This did not happen for a multitude of reasons, but now the time is ripe. That is why we are pressing for this. We are not setting any dates – we are sticking to our line that criteria are more important than dates. However, we are calling very strongly for no artificial barriers to be created and for this country to be treated fairly and justly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In retrospect and given the circumstances in which Croatia became an independent country twenty years ago, we could perhaps say that it has been waiting long enough, if not too long, for membership. Minister Martonyi, you have given us very specific information about your plans concerning Croatia’s accession negotiations. We support your plans and hope that they will become a reality in their entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">For the leadership in Zagreb, there remains much to be done in the months before Croatia wraps up negotiations. Chapter 23 has throughout been the subject of the special attention of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). We discussed and agreed on this yesterday during the friendly conversation between Mr Verhofstadt, President of the ALDE Group, and Mrs Kosor.</p>
<p class="contents">This chapter holds the key to the rule of law, to dealing seriously with the legacy of the past, to an effective and impartial judiciary, to legal certainty and equality for all citizens. Any democratic country based on the rule of law – any member of the European Union – must ensure freedoms such as openness and media independence, protection of minorities, gender equality and protection of everyone who is different.</p>
<p class="contents">The Croatian Government and Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor deserve credit for tackling corruption and crime in a determined way. Croatia should also be credited with successfully establishing friendly relations with its neighbours, but it should be encouraged at the same time to resolve the issues outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">When we give Croatia the green light for the last round of negotiations and for its last push on the way to full membership, we should point out that this report is addressed to all the countries of south-eastern Europe which have the same expectations. We, too, have expectations: we expect Europe to complete the enlargement process and become a continent of cohesion and equal values.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to add just one more sentence. Only in this way will the European Union, in today’s world, be able to become, and play the part of, a world leader. Thank you for your patience, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Posselt that it is a fair report. We very much look forward to welcoming Croatia – as has been said – as soon as it has met all the criteria. It is a special country to be joining, and the EU will have a special responsibility to make sure afterwards that all the other countries in the Western Balkans will be able to join too. It is from that regional perspective that Croatia needs to be the best in the class now, so that its fellow classmates can join afterwards. We have a responsibility to the other countries, because if we fail now and make mistakes now it will be much harder for others to join. We cannot give up on this objective for the Western Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you have mentioned Chapter 23 on corruption. We believe that the EU also has to be honest about itself, and really to consider to what extent it was also implicated in corruption. Therefore, we also call on OLAF to look at what the implications are for the EU. I urge all Groups to join that effort, as we need to be honest with ourselves too.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is that how we deal with the past is an important part of joining the EU. The ICTY has been mentioned. This is crucial, but we also feel that the local war crimes tribunals need to work better. A report by Amnesty International highlights that there are still a number of pitfalls and deficiencies. We feel there is room for improvement, for example on witness protection, and we would like to see improvement there as well. We feel it is crucial for the EU to insist on that aspect of the past and working with the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from this, we are all looking forward to welcoming Croatia to this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">According to the Council, the conclusion of accession negotiations with Croatia is within reach, but we know from the Commission that corruption issues and judicial reform have not yet been properly dealt with. This is very serious. Our concerns are not artificial.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia, with a population of 4.5 million, apparently suffers from nearly a million backlogged court cases, with a significant number of cases connected to the abuse of property rights. Media freedom is also under assault. Former ministers have been charged with corruption. Some might see this as evidence of action. Actually it reveals the depth of a malaise that has hardly been addressed. Widespread corruption among politicians and the judiciary has meant a failure to tackle organised crime directly connected to the Balkan route.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the litany of problems outlined here, Croatia’s early accession seems a foregone conclusion.

<p class="contents">The greatest progress in the accession process was made in 2010, when our Croatian friends concluded negotiations on a number of complex chapters and made fundamental changes to the constitution, as well as making progress over a civilised solution to border disputes with neighbouring countries. The official visit of Serbian president Tadic to Vukovar showed that relations between Croat and Serb citizens can also be built on mutual respect, esteem and understanding.</p>
<p class="contents">The speed at which the accession process is finalised now rests solely with the Croatian side, who, after fulfilling all of the conditions for EU accession, must also seek the consent of their citizens for such a step in a nationwide referendum.

<p class="contents">Croatia has had to make extensive and intrusive legislative changes. It has also had to withdraw support from its vital industries and the people who work in them.

However, as I was able, during my time as chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, to closely observe the previous twelve Member States to join as part of the enlargement process, I can say that Croatia is a country that has done a considerable amount of work over a long period of time in order to fulfil the criteria and, for that reason, the progression to a ‘yes’ is a positive one.</p>
<p class="contents">We should support this for political reasons. It is also a signal to other countries that may perhaps have to wait a long time until the door to Europe is open rather than, by and large, being closed. The general political message is important. However, based on our experiences with other countries, I would say that Croatia needs to work on reforming its judicial and administrative systems in its own interests, too – irrespective of the accession process. When proceedings remain unresolved for too long or accusations of corruption are made but the proceedings taken against the accused take too long, it damages the overall development of the country. More work ought to be done in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Croatia’s membership of the EU is getting close now, but a few challenges still remain, for example the fight against corruption. Croatia has adopted new and better legislation, but now the reforms need to be implemented. Effective investigations, prosecutions and court rulings are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Right now all eyes are on the case of the former conservative Prime Minister, Ivo Sanader, who is in prison in Austria. We applaud what journalists and politicians in Croatia have shown by uncovering the corruption in the political elite. However, the case of Ivo Sanader also represents a moment of truth for the EU, as corruption requires the involvement of two parties. Given the accusations that Ivo Sanader attempted to influence the EU in an improper manner, I have proposed that the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, should work together with Croatian investigators to clarify this information because, of course, we do not know if it is true.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) wants to delete this important part of the resolution, but, along with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we are calling on all of the political groups to support it.

<p class="contents">The progress so far has been impressive, but I want to emphasise that this positive momentum should now feed into other areas where much remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points I would like to stress here today. The first is the reform and strengthening of the judiciary. A robust and independent judicial syste	m is absolutely essential in order to fight corruption and to ensure the rule of law in the long term. It is not merely a matter of arresting criminals; it is about dealing with them afterwards. Otherwise, efforts to tackle corruption and organised crime will have no effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to mention is the need for society in Croatia to build on tolerance. The European project is about reconciliation, and this applies not only between countries – and I applaud the improved relations with Croatia’s neighbours – but within them as well. Threats of violence against minorities are completely unacceptable. I fully understand how difficult this is, but I am of the firm belief that this would not only boost the accession talks, but also that the effort itself would be of direct benefit to Croatian society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today I would like to express my great respect and admiration for the reforms undertaken by the Croatian Government and Croatian society, particularly those relating to the fight against corruption and organised crime and reforms of the public administration and the judiciary. It goes without saying that there are still areas requiring improvement and completion. I hope that this is achieved as soon as possible. It is also true that we are hearing reports from Croatia that the Croatian people are not entirely convinced that membership will benefit their country. I believe that it would be wise for us to take steps which help to reverse this trend without delay, in cooperation with the Croatian Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is beyond dispute and I am pleased about that. There are two issues, however, which I am still seriously concerned about.</p>
<p class="contents">Corruption in this Balkan country is still widespread, see for example recitals 7 and 8 of the resolution we are debating. That is having a major impact on the economy and on trade relations with this country. We urgently need a better approach to tackling this problem, possibly in cooperation with European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">My second concern is the poor administrative organisation in the country, see recital 28 of the resolution. Sound administrative organisation is necessary if EU legislation is to be properly implemented and if Croatia is not to be caught napping by events.</p>
<p class="contents">As long as these two bottlenecks remain unaddressed, I will continue to feel concerned about the swift pace with which the Hungarian Presidency wants to bring about Croatia’s accession. In my opinion, past experience should lead us to make the quality of accession our objective, not accession itself. That will help us to secure people’s support, and the support of my Dutch citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The theory is complete, but it still needs to be proven in practice. However, there are three areas where significant work still remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Croatia must work closer with the International Court of Justice in The Hague to speed up progress with regard to human rights and the prosecution of former war criminals. As stated by Amnesty International in ‘Behind a Wall of Silence’, there are blatant individual cases of human rights violations that are still be dealt with. The protection of human rights is a key issue for the EU. We must not be prepared to compromise where this is concerned, and indeed we are not prepared to compromise where this is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the corruption. It still permeates society, industry and politics. I welcome the efforts of the Croatian Government to tackle corruption in its own country, but at the same time we must insist that this problem is also rigorously pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Croatia must ensure, in its own interests, that swift progress is now made with regard to the reforms initiated in the judicial system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On this occasion, the members of the Croatian committee asked me if I knew how many Poles were currently on sailing holidays in Croatia. It turned out that the answer was several tens of thousands in total. The millions of tourists who visit this beautiful country today can tell us that Croatia is a modern and democratic country, and confirm that it is ready for membership of the European Union. Yet those same members of the Croatian committee also asked me how Poland was restructuring its shipyards. In other words, several problems still remain, as everyone here has mentioned, and they are problems which need to be resolved. In spite of everything, I hope that Mr Martonyi’s hopes will be fulfilled, that our Hungarian friends and the European Commission will conclude the negotiations and that today we will hear from Mr Sikorski, the head of Polish diplomacy, who will be with us in Parliament, that Poland will have the pleasure of witnessing Croatia’s accession to the European Union while holding the Presidency of the European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I sincerely hope that, for Croatia and for Mr Swoboda, this really will be the last report and that Croatia will join us as soon as possible. In any case, membership will allow Croatia to make up for some of the time it has lost in joining the EU.</p>

I suggest that the authorities in Zagreb take advantage of Croatia’s accession to the European Union in order to tackle decisively the culture of corruption and crime. Developing the freedoms of objective media and protecting objective journalists working for the Croatian public television broadcaster is another matter of paramount importance.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia’s accession to the EU will mean that we are embracing and holding out a hand to the Balkan region. I look forward to us working together with our Croatian colleagues to bring stabilisation and progress to this, still turbulent, region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that Croatia's entry into the EU will give an impetus to reforms in the region and will be a success for the whole of Europe. Croatia recently signalled this itself by providing free legal translations of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>to its neighbours from the former Yugoslavia – Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia. The country has thus shown that it is willing and able to contribute to the region's European future.</p>
<p class="contents">Accepting Croatia into the EU will give a clear signal that the EU honours its undertakings towards the Western Balkans and that expansion is an open-ended process. I would like to highlight that although every country on our continent has its own problems, we should be careful when pointing the finger at eastern European countries, when talking about corruption and crime.</p>
<p class="contents">These are not a trademark just of this region, but a challenge for all of us, and only through combined efforts can we limit the negative tendencies in this area. Transparency and democracy are immutable values and it is for this very reason that we have to support and encourage reforms in the Western Balkans. I wish Croatia all the best and look forward to greeting it here as the 28th Member State of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly, we can only agree with the statement of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán that the unification of Europe cannot be complete without the integration of the countries of the Western Balkans. The states of the former Yugoslavia that remain outside are like gaping black holes in the map of the EU. The accession of Croatia marks the beginning of the change of that situation. As Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said yesterday, it is our moral obligation to provide this encouragement for the countries of South Eastern Europe, because for them there is no alternative to integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Particular emphasis should be given to the determination shown by Croatia itself, for example by the Prime Minister, Mrs Kosor, not only with regard to concluding the negotiations themselves, but also with regard to cooperation with the country’s neighbours and the International Criminal Tribunal. The prospect of concluding negotiations in the near future and the mood prevailing in the Chamber will also help Croatia. It is an important sign that any future problems will not be allowed to accumulate, and that the 20-year wait will end with the signature of the Treaty of Accession. Let us also acknowledge the symbolic gestures made by Croatia, for example by passing on a translation of the full <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> to all its neighbours working towards membership.

In several respects, Croatia has achieved a higher degree of development than some EU Member States. It is obvious that, as Mr Martonyi mentioned, there is still a lot to be done. Mr Hannes Swoboda has an excellent understanding of the complexities of the Western Balkan region.</p>
<p class="contents">The success of Croatia could serve as an incentive for Serbia and the other countries of the Western Balkans. It is important for our friends in the Western Balkans and our Croatian colleagues to understand that their internal reforms must be implemented not for the sake of the EU, but for the sake of their own people. I believe it is of exceptional importance to improve the situation of Serb, Hungarian and other national minorities, and to ensure the well-deserved return of the Serbs who fled or had been driven away, the Serbs of Krajina, and to settle the neighbourhood relations between Slovenia and Croatia. We must appreciate that the Croatian head of state has made several gestures toward the historic reconciliation of Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is my sincere wish. What will prove possible, however, depends on the Croatian Government and the cooperation between it, that is the ruling coalition, and the opposition in the Croatian Parliament. What we also need now is much greater social sensitivity and responsiveness amongst politicians. The current economic crisis is pushing any benefits which accession to the EU might bring Croatia’s economy and its citizens to the margins of social priorities and is increasing criticism of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, Croatia also needs its people to vote yes in a referendum. Any slowing down of the momentum of Croatia’s accession would not have any disastrous consequences for Croatia, but it would send out an extremely negative message to the countries of the Western Balkans which are on the way to the EU. Without negotiations being concluded, Croatian MPs will not be able to gain observer status in this House and there will be no membership.

<p class="contents">Indeed, if there is <span class="italic">one</span> lesson we have learned from the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, it is this: that we should not be giving a <span class="italic">specific</span> date. Instead, we need to make clear what still needs to be done. One more point: one of the issues on which Croatia could be doing a little more is the protection of sexual minorities. It would be nice if our current EU Presidency set a good example by allowing the gay pride in Budapest on 18 June 2011 to go ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

British Conservatives support the enlargement of the EU to include countries that fully meet the Copenhagen criteria, as we believe that a larger EU should result in a more flexible and less centralised union.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia should be congratulated for its efforts to stamp out corruption, as evidenced by the arrest of former Prime Minister Sanader. I am pleased that Slovenia will no longer be blocking Croatia’s accession over the two countries’ border dispute. This was always a bilateral issue but should in no way preclude Croatia from joining our Union. There is also a small dispute with Montenegro, for which I am the rapporteur, which will be resolved by the ICJ.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that Croatia’s accession will accelerate the integration of the whole region of the former Yugoslavia into the EU, in particular as Montenegro’s rapporteur and a strong friend of Serbia. I hope that Croatian membership will inspire both countries to press ahead with reforms and that Croatia will not try and settle old scores, once it is in the Union, by blocking Serbian accession. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is not surprising, as culturally and historically it is firmly rooted in Central Europe. Croatia has proven its readiness to join the EU many times, for example with the settlement of the fishing dispute. Further efforts are, of course, needed in connection with corruption, but clearly there is no lack of will here, as can be seen by the arrest of the former prime minister, Ivo Sanader. There has also been some movement with regard to dealing with war crimes. In this regard, it remains to be seen what role the German arrest warrants issued for high-ranking former members of the Yugoslav secret service will play.</p>
<p class="contents">Croatia seems to be prepared to move away from its past, for example by providing support for returning war refugees. In this regard, it would also be desirable if the EU were to support not only the war refugees, but also the displaced people and to seek a solution to the restitution claims of the Danube Swabians. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This leads me to draw attention to the considerable misgivings of certain sectors of public opinion, as this accession has come at the wrong time.

<p class="contents">After the fall of the Berlin Wall, there was a wave of post-communist accessions and today we proceed on a case-by-case basis.

<p class="contents">That is my proposal, because the competence for accession does not lie with Europe. Competence for accession lies with the States and with the peoples of those States. We have a duty to make a success of this accession.

<p class="contents">I firmly believe that all these efforts have been very well demonstrated by this morning’s very constructive and very useful debate. I also firmly believe that the resolution to be adopted will underline Parliament’s crucial role, which indeed goes beyond the concrete item of Croatia’s accession.</p>
<p class="contents">This will send an extremely important message to European public opinion, to the citizens of Europe, to the effect that enlargement does indeed serve their best interests, and it will perhaps convince them that the enlargement fatigue which developed, and was felt, right after what we now call the reunification of Europe, has gone, and that the train of the enlargement process has to go on.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it will also send an extremely important political message to the other candidate and aspirant countries. This is also underlined in your report and resolution. We all know that the key factor of stability, cooperation and reconciliation in the Western Balkans is indeed the European perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">So the European perspective has to be credible and has to be underlined and demonstrated by concrete measures. That is precisely the upcoming accession of Croatia to the European Union. We all know that what we have here is unfinished business. Europe is still not a whole and our fundamental objective is to take this process on.</p>
<p class="contents">Some extremely important remarks and comments were made with respect, for example, to whether the accession negotiations have been too long or not. It is true that they have lasted almost six years and that this is longer than the negotiation process was for our countries. What I would recommend now is that we look to the future and try to speed up this process as much as we can.</p>
<p class="contents">Very many important advances and achievements have been made on both sides, and I would only underline again and again our determination that, with combined efforts on all sides, we can now make a credible, good quality enlargement. This would be an extremely important message for all of us, inside and outside the present European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank you again for your extremely important thoughts and comments, and also to express my thanks to the Commission – all that of course in the hope that we will be able to realise our objective, which is, I repeat, to conclude negations before the end of June this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Speeding up Croatia’s accession is crucial if one considers its strategic geopolitical position as a gateway to markets in Central Europe. Hence the need for an integrated development of ports and connections to the European corridors, especially in view of the fact that Croatia will enjoy a significant flow of EU funding, of which 60% will be allocated to infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">For this to happen, Croatia should continue to adopt the necessary reforms. In particular, it should strengthen public administration and the judiciary, fight corruption and ensure full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. I welcome the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. I am disappointed about the situation of the Croatian shipbuilding industry, a sector that was once the pearl of Yugoslav industrial exports, but which is now in almost total ruin.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Croatian Government is able conclude the restructuring process as soon as possible so that it can also close the chapter on competition. In particular, I emphasise the importance of the accession of Croatia in relation to the integrated maritime policy in the Adriatic, which will soon officially be an almost completely European sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It shows that the country is close to completing the accession negotiations. However, at the same time, as in previous years, it draws attention to persistent, and often serious, shortcomings. In light of previous experience with the Croatia-Slovenia territorial dispute, it is concerning that there has not been significant positive progress in respect of Croatia’s numerous territorial disputes with its other neighbours (in particular, Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also Serbia and Montenegro). The extremely slow approach to the punishment of war crimes against the Serbs continues to raise some important issues. ‘Several hundred cases’ remain to be investigated and prosecuted; the fact that the Croatian judiciary is ignoring these cases ensures the continuing distrust of the Serbs. Croatia has also still not submitted the documents known as the artillery diaries to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague (ICTY). The time has therefore come to consider how far the EU should get involved in this matter. Even the 2010 return of Serbian refugees was very limited. The report does not say how many of the 130,000 Serbs who returned to Croatia after the war were from Serbia and how many were from the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The number of Serbian refugees in the Republika Srpska (Bosnia and Herzegovina) has remained relatively stable for several years (between 25,000 and 35,000 persons). The Croatian authorities have made their return impossible mainly by failing to resolve issues such as the return of property, housing, tenancy rights, pensions and so on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question is what this step will be like. Will it be a long step fraught with obstacles, perhaps even artificial ones? Or will it be an easier, shorter step, one that is based on cooperation and one that appreciates the performance of the difficult commitments undertaken so far? The Croatian people have done considerable work to ensure the conclusion of the accession negotiations, and the recognition of their cooperation is well deserved, whether it be for their efforts in the reduction of corruption, conflicts of interest and organised crime, or for the improvement of their neighbourhood policy. Some questions, of course, still remain open to this day, most of them being of a bilateral nature, but it is important to stress that these should not be confused with European matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that Croatia is worthy of becoming a Member State of the EU, and is worthy of successfully concluding the negotiations during the term of the Hungarian Presidency. The position of Croatia in the Western Balkans is of strategic importance. This role is reinforced by the three agreements signed by Croatia and the Hungarian Government on the strengthening of energy supply security, joint research in cross-border hydrocarbon fields and the storage of oil supplies. I honestly wish for the Croatian people that all natural – and perhaps artificially erected – barriers are removed from the path of their accession, because Croatia is not only mature enough for, but also worthy of joining the EU. What I ask of you, my fellow Members, is to contribute with your supporting votes to Croatia joining the EU as soon as possible, because that way, the accession would be achieved in the symbolic 20th year of Croatia’s independence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only Croatia, but the other countries of the Western Balkans, too, are looking with optimism towards their future in Europe. This, in turn, will bring about stability, and the irreversibility of the process of democratisation, and economic growth in this region, which carries a heavy historic legacy. I commend the efforts of the Croatian Government in combating corruption, ensuring the proper use of EU funds and endeavouring to conclude the chapters of the negotiations that are still open. Significant progress has also been made in improving relations with neighbouring countries. I consistently support the EU accession of Croatia taking place as soon as possible, because, as a Romanian Member of Hungarian nationality, I have been closely monitoring the fate of the Hungarian community in Croatia. It would be to my great satisfaction if we could soon welcome another Hungarian community living outside their home country into the European Union. The European Parliament must clearly support Croatia’s accession efforts. It is not the easing of requirements that is needed, but the facilitation of meeting those requirements. I agree with my fellow Members who are asking the European Commission to specify the further dates for the conclusion of the process as soon as possible, and to close the accession chapters while we are still in the term of the Hungarian Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Croatian Government has gone to great lengths to tackle the process of reform and protection of human rights. Improvements are still required on some points to ensure that Croatia can be considered ready for the European Union and the objectives enshrined in the Europe 2020 Strategy: the fight against corruption, protection of minorities, including Italian minorities, shortening the duration of judicial proceedings, support for court infrastructure and equipment, strengthening of tax reforms and public spending cuts.</p>
<p class="contents">If Croatia continues to implement all the reforms necessary for the completion of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, then from next autumn the European Union will have a valuable addition to help increase its wealth and ensure geopolitical balance between East and West, starting from the Mediterranean region and the north-east of Italy. The development of European macro-regions, from the Adriatic and Ionian region, which will include Italy, will quickly bring Croatia into the heart of European programmes and policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">An enlargement policy which facilitates the consolidation of democracy, particularly in the Balkan countries, should however also be in the interests of the European Union. The European Parliament should be positive in its assessment of the changes made in Croatia to date, since the country is demonstrating a great deal of willingness to resolve its internal problems. We must be open to new Member States. I hope that the pace of negotiations will make it possible for the Croatians to sign the Treaty of Accession during the Polish Presidency, since this country deserves to be a member of the European Union.

Indeed, it is of particular importance for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that Europe has to overcome a number of serious challenges if it wishes to remain competitive with the rest of the world. Some of these challenges have been generated by the financial and economic crisis, but some of them are inherent in our limited capacities and determination to fulfil the objectives and targets of the 2010 Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">As is often said, crisis can be an opportunity – both in the Ancient Greek and in the Chinese interpretation. It can be an opportunity for a breakthrough, for a solution and to make progress. That is why we believe that the crisis is currently a key factor in motivating Member States to adopt quickly a new European strategy for jobs and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. This is the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this strategy will play an important role in helping Europe recover from the crisis and emerge stronger, both internally and at international level, by boosting productivity, growth potential, social cohesion and economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is essential if we are going to be able to remain competitive globally, not least in the face of rapidly growing markets in Asia. It is also essential if we are to maintain the social model, our way of life, which is a key characteristic of Europe, dear to us all, and which we must preserve.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2020 Strategy confirmed five EU headline targets which constitute shared objectives guiding the action of Member States and the Union as regards promoting employment, improving the conditions for innovation, research and development, meeting our climate change and energy objectives, improving education levels and promoting social inclusion, in particular through the reduction of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of meeting these targets, the Commission developed and presented seven flagship initiatives containing the actions it proposes to take to strengthen the single market and to boost growth and jobs: the Digital Agenda for Europe, Innovation Union, Youth on the Move, Resource Efficient Europe, an Industrial Policy for the Globalisation Era, an Agenda for New Skills and Jobs and the European Platform against Poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">For each initiative, both the EU and national authorities have to coordinate their efforts so that action at national and European level is mutually reinforcing.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2010, the first implementation report prepared by the Presidency, in close cooperation with the Commission and the incoming Hungarian Presidency, provided an overview of work undertaken since the launch of the strategy in June. The report highlights the most important work done in the Council, in all its forms, regarding the seven flagship initiatives. Furthermore, the report stresses the technologies progress achieved in the various policy areas which play a major role in the new strategy: the single market, cohesion policy and agricultural policy. It also lists the activities and initiatives that have been conducted at EU level in the last six months as regards the five EU headline targets.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me emphasise some important elements concerning economic governance. The implementation of economic governance reform is a fundamental condition for fighting the crisis and boosting the European economy. This is why the 2020 Strategy is closely linked with what is known as the ‘European semester’: a new key instrument of macroeconomic surveillance, to be applied for the first time under this presidency. This new process started in January 2011 with the presentation of the Commission’s annual growth survey.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hungarian Presidency is paying particular attention to ensuring that the European semester runs smoothly and successfully. To that end, we will organise a series of debates in all relevant Council meetings in the run-up to the March European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council has, in particular, been tasked with preparing a synthesis report for its meeting of 21 March, which will set out the main messages on the work being undertaken in the various sectoral councils. This report will be presented to the European Council in March and will form the basis for the discussions, with the aim of agreeing on a set of priorities for structural reforms and fiscal consolidation.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from the March European Council, Member States will finalise the drafting of the national reform programmes and stability or convergence reports, which will be submitted to the Commission in April. After that, work should be taken forward with a view to elaborating country-specific recommendations which the Member States will take into account when finalising their budgets for 2012 and implementing their growth strategies. I recognise that this calendar is very tight, but we hope to complete it by June or July.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2020 Strategy is key in ensuring the future economic success of the European Union. It is closely linked to economic governance reform, which will also play a key role. Unless we remain competitive and can secure strong growth in the future, we will find it increasingly difficult both to maintain a sufficiently high level of social protection internally and to bring Europe’s voice to bear on events externally.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the major challenge for Europe in the years to come. I am absolutely sure that we can count on the support of the European Parliament to help us deliver. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Andor, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, as you know, the Commission adopted the first Annual Growth Survey in connection with the Europe 2020 Strategy last month. The Annual Growth Survey makes a break with the past and sets in motion the first cycle of economic policy coordination under the European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">The main idea behind the European Semester is very simple: to ensure the stability of economic and monetary union, we have no choice but to carry out ex-ante coordination of economic policies within the EU. The recent debt crisis in some euro area countries illustrates this all too clearly. This more robust and demanding approach shows that the European Union recognises how closely interlinked the Member States’ economies are and how policy choices in one Member State can have an impact on the others.</p>
<p class="contents">Managing the European Semester will be a real test for the EU. Strengthening political ownership of the Strategy and local partnerships has been a key priority for us. The challenge now is to demonstrate that the Union can collectively identify the key policy reforms most urgently needed and provide the right policy responses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Annual Growth Survey is very clear about the top priorities. It sets out an integrated approach to recovery with 10 priority actions under three main headings: first, a rigorous fiscal consolidation and restructuring of the financial sector to step up macroeconomic stability; second, structural reforms for higher employment; and finally, growth-enhancing measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken good note of your concerns on the key messages of the Annual Growth Survey, to the effect that they may seem to depart from the Integrated Guidelines. However, I want to be clear on this. The Commission has deliberately chosen to focus this year’s Annual Growth Survey on the most immediate challenges stemming from the current economic crisis and on the need to frontload the reforms that are necessary for economic recovery and job creation. The Annual Growth Survey is fully consistent with the Integrated Guidelines, including the Employment Guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Parliament’s support to the Commission’s proposal to maintain the Employment Guidelines unchanged for 2011. Indeed, it is vital to ensure a stable policy framework until the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 Strategy in 2014 for Member States to have enough time to implement the necessary reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Employment Guidelines also provide the basis for the draft Joint Employment Report (part of the Annual Growth Survey), which identifies the most urgent measures in the area of employment, including: first, introducing employment-friendly taxation systems, namely by shifting taxes away from labour; second, reducing labour market segmentation; third, removing barriers to balancing private and work life; fourth, supporting unemployed people, through high-quality training and job search services, to get back into work and go into self-employment; and finally, increasing the participation of older workers in labour markets.</p>
<p class="contents">More importantly, the Employment Guidelines will form the basis for possible country-specific recommendations which the Council may address to Member States on the basis of Article 148 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Annual Growth Survey provides the basis for discussion at the Spring European Council in March and for the economic policy guidance to be addressed to the Member States. The Commission expects the Member States to take this guidance into account when they draft their stability or convergence programmes and the national reform programmes under the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will examine the national reform programmes, which are due in the second half of April. On the basis of that examination and in line with the Treaty, we will propose country-specific policy guidance and recommendations that Member States should take into account when finalising their budgets for 2012. The policy guidance and recommendations should be adopted by the Council before the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by stressing the importance of your role in the successful implementation of Europe 2020 and specifically the seven flagship initiatives. Your role as co legislator is fundamental to their successful implementation. Setting the right framework conditions is vital if we are to meet the Europe 2020 targets. Discussion of the new multiannual financial framework will start soon. The Commission will present its proposals by June. Your role as a budgetary authority together with the Council will be crucial to ensuring that the Europe 2020 priorities are reflected in the EU budget. If we are to be credible we need to make sure our financial priorities are in line with our strategies and political priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time of fiscal constraints, it is more important than ever to show that the EU has added value and that a euro spent at EU level can have a greater impact than a euro spent at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">To ensure the success of Europe 2020 we need political ownership at all levels. Only if everyone plays their part can we achieve our objectives and set the right course for future growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pervenche Berès, </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to say how much I welcome this first opportunity to debate the European Semester and the importance that should be given, in this semester, to the Annual Growth Survey.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, you, Commissioner, along with the members of the College, have decided to renew the Employment Guidelines and this Parliament intends to acknowledge that decision. We would simply like to draw your attention to three points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the content of this Annual Growth Survey. We are struck by the fact that the issues of employment and unemployment appear to be secondary to budgetary consolidation objectives. When you raise these issues, which are directly linked to the operation of the labour market, we feel that you are breaching the social contract between the people of the Member States and their governments. You are proposing that the retirement age should be raised, that the amount paid in unemployment allowance should be reduced, that wage levels and the mechanisms for calculating these should be modified, and that shops should be allowed to open on Sundays.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that this constitutes an extremely dangerous breach of the social contract. We also believe that greater attention should be paid to the most vulnerable populations, whether they are young people, women, older people or the disabled. We also think that there is a considerable danger of seeing budgetary consolidation as the be-all and end-all of this Annual Growth Survey.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second concern is the fact that, as you have said yourself, you are going to draw up national reform programmes on the basis of this Annual Growth Survey. However, it is here that important matters will be decided. How are you putting the debate in Parliament on those issues to good use, now that the guidelines are being renewed? How do you envisage democratic debate on this issue? How do you join up Article 148, which coordinates employment policies, with Article 12, which coordinates economic policies?</p>
<p class="contents">There is a great deal of confusion today for the European Parliament, insofar as we are considering at the same time, the Europe 2020 Strategy, President Van Rompuy’s working parties, the package on economic governance, into which this Parliament is putting a great deal of effort, and a revision of the Treaty to maintain a European financial stability mechanism. Moreover, while this is in train, we are also debating the possible amendment of that mechanism. You are launching the European semester at the same time as Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy are launching the competitiveness pact. At the same time as all this, you are renewing the Employment Guidelines, which in all likelihood will be no more than a very vague space to be defined in these national programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner, I would like to alert you to a third concern of ours. When, last year, with the support of the Belgian Presidency, we managed to change the direction of the Employment Guidelines, there was one point on which we placed great emphasis: the issue of governance. What do we mean by this governance? It means that economic and social policies cannot be conducted successfully if they are not accompanied by genuine democratic debate. Now, democratic debate means giving power to the European Parliament, power to national parliaments and genuinely respecting, involving and including social partners. We often have the impression that your proposals ignore these elements, which are part and parcel of the democratic life of our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, unless we get to grips with this issue, we are in danger of being inconsistent, of turning our people away from what we are trying to achieve together and of neglecting that which is the key to our success, namely the Community spirit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Semester offers a structure into which the existing tools of the Integrated Guidelines, provided for under Articles 121 and 148 of the Treaty, should be incorporated, with the strong involvement of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking wider, it is in the Semester that monitoring of the Stability and Growth Pact and macroeconomic surveillance can join up with the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Integrated Guidelines. This means that the Semester can provide a coherent framework for the various economic governance processes in the Union in a mutually enhancing fashion. More broadly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs emphasises that economic governance must be based on the Community method. Processes must be transparent and accountable if they are to connect with, and have the support of, citizens. This mandates the involvement of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Where Parliament already has been given a role, it must have the time required to fulfil its democratic mandate. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs stands shoulder to shoulder with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in pursuing that demand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we now need to draw lessons from the crisis, if we are to make better use of our internal market, bolster the sustainability of our pensions and also enable the labour market to function better.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group therefore welcomes the Annual Growth Survey and the Ecofin conclusions of 15 January 2011, which encourage ambitious expectations for the European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us in this house want a Europe of sustainable economic growth with healthy businesses and enough jobs for all our citizens. We can only achieve that with a stable currency and a stable economy. In order to attain both, the Member States must keep their domestic finances in order, because that will not only help us prevent problems such as those we are currently witnessing in Member States which are struggling with soaring deficits and debt, but also lay the foundation for growth and jobs for our citizens, and also for our children and future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will continue to work for a strong European economic governance package, based on three pillars: a robust Stability and Growth Pact, ambitious macroeconomic surveillance and an ambitious Europe  2020 Strategy. However, that demands that we use the community method and involve the European Parliament and national parliaments. If we do that, we will not need a new competitiveness pact, because we will have already achieved our objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What you are recommending to us is nothing new. Ask your staff to show you the documents from the last ten years. The same thing can be seen in all of them, namely that public expenditure is too high, and the only mechanism for adjustment to new times relates to wages and they are always too high. I have not seen any other recommendations. Whether it is raining or snowing, whether we are in a crisis or a boom – it is always the same ideology, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with empirical economic reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to suggest something to you: send those people who write these things for you, who carry out the economic analyses in the Council and the Commission, to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs sometime. We want to get to know your economic models. We want to discuss with them whether they do not see that Europe is on the brink of recession. Remove the German export rates and the German growth rates for example and then you will see what I am talking about. I will then ask you why there is not a single word about investments – when we have lowest level of investment so far, which we ourselves can no longer afford – why there is not a single word about improvements in revenue and nothing about following the cycles or about the fact that we must finally learn to grow together or how we will get out of the crisis. There is nothing about any of these things in your documents.</p>
<p class="contents">You missed the start of this year, and you will have to make a great effort to meet the expectations of citizens in Europe. However, let me tell you something: if this is the spirit in which you intend to take a decision in March concerning the cconomic governance package and the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, my group will be unable to be involved in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the time, some of my Group’s proposals on economic governance were dismissed as too ambitious and too far-reaching, but today I am happy to note that several of our suggestions are realities.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, there is a significant gap between the ambitions declared in the Europe 2020 Strategy and the financial resources needed to attain the goals. In the draft 2012 budget, the Commission needs to clarify, clearly identify and make visible the expenditure related to the Strategy. This is also true for the upcoming revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to address the Member States directly. There is a clear unwillingness in the Council among the Finance Ministers – including my own, Anders Borg from Sweden – to invest in the future. National budgets need to reflect the Council’s stated ambitions, and EU projects need budgets if they are ever to happen. Mark my words, without the money in the right place there will be no growth and jobs strategy, and we risk failure.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore urge the Commission to come forward with more concrete legislative proposals and the Member States to show more commitment. We need binding commitments to reach headline targets and legislation in key job-creating areas, such as energy efficiency targets at a common European level. Existing initiatives, such as the Strategic Energy Technology Plan, the Lifelong Learning Programme and the Energy Efficiency Action Plan, have already been adopted, but you in the Council failed to bring the money to the table. We need financing of these projects. They all have the potential to create jobs and growth.</p>
<p class="contents">With our 2020 resolution, the ALDE Group sends a strong message to the Council that the current governance structure is too weak, the method of open coordination has failed and the Community method should be restored. I applaud the huge majority behind the joint resolution. This is a strong message from Parliament that we need action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What exactly is your recommendation? To cut public expenditure! You do not get stable public finances by cutting expenditure. There is no talk of revenues. The aim is also to increase flexibility, to reform, as you will argue, the labour markets – in other words, to clearly create flexisecurity without the security. You will argue that we must take these measures to enable the economy to recover.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that is not all. There are also measures for the financial sector. Let us talk about those, because this is a good example of double standards. What do you have to say about the measures on pay and public expenditure? We must strike soon and strike hard. However, when it comes to the financial sector, you say that we have to look at things, examine the impact, and, above all, have transition periods.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of economic governance and budgetary consolidation, you are quick to state: 1 January 2011 –1 January 2012. For the banks, it will be 1 January 2019, just as if no study or transition period were needed to help the labour markets adapt or to put public finances on a stable footing.</p>
<p class="contents">Can you tell me what Europe 2020 has to do with all that? This is, after all, the issue but it is not what you are telling me about. Europe 2020, Commissioner, Members of the Council, is rendered absolutely impossible by the recommendations you are making within the Annual Growth Survey.</p>
<p class="contents">You are taking us for a ride when you pretend that it is possible to conduct the necessary investment policies in the areas of research, education, poverty reduction, the fight against climate change, and employment by conducting the policies that you are recommending.

Hardly anyone on the outside knows any more what strategy, what stability mechanism, which pact is being proposed, supplemented, brought into force or amended by whom and pursuant to what regulations. One thing that is clear is that the Europe 2020 Strategy has not so far provided a solution to the problems experienced by the people during the crisis. Quite the contrary – it continues to pursue the misguided EU policies that were part of the reason for the crisis in the first place. It continues to count on the Stability and Growth Pact. This is now intended to be tightened up and strengthened with better sanction mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice, this means austerity measures to the detriment of citizens. It means extending working life, in other words pension cuts. Whether the indexation of wages and salaries is now to be abolished or the basis for negotiation between the social partners is to be restricted or the rules governing working hours made more flexible – all of this means wage restraint and cuts. It also means the reduction in the formative state intervention in the economic life of society. In this regard, many people talk about limiting debt. It makes no difference to me if it is called economic governance, the stability and growth policy, the competitiveness pact or a Commission recommendation on the basis of the Annual Growth Survey. This antisocial policy is not something that my group and I can support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it does of course make a difference whether parliaments still have some say with regard to this policy. Yesterday’s debate on the amendment procedure for the Treaty gives reason to hope that the Members of this Parliament are united on one point. We should not allow ourselves to return to the governmental secrecy policy of the 19th century. Nobody wants that. Equally, however, we should not allow ourselves to revert back to a two-speed Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There remains one problem: supporting solar energy. Indeed, we subsidise China, now the world’s leading exporter of solar panels, and India, the leading exporter of wind power equipment. Hence the need to support research into the production of solar panels designed and produced in Europe and to promote the adoption of economies of scale in the photovoltaic-solar sector, by introducing such devices, for example, extensively in European cities.</p>
<p class="contents">Something very different should have been done: a pan-European energy company should have been set up to safeguard a European public service, given that the distribution networks and their infrastructures already constitute existing, natural monopolies, which should clearly come under the same management.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, due to over-enthusiastic economic liberalism, priority was given to other solutions that certainly do not benefit consumers or users, but the shareholders of these big monopolies. We should remember that the production of CO<span class="sub">2</span> from cars has not dropped for 150 years.

<p class="contents">The large-scale importation of workers from outside the European Union bears witness to a short-term vision and is out of kilter with the priorities I have just mentioned. Some 25 million people in the European Union are unemployed. Let us start by helping those people into work first, instead of resorting once again to large-scale immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Bringing skilled workers into Europe, or what we might describe as a brain drain, creates even greater problems in their countries of origin, which only serves to further crank up the immigration of unskilled people into Europe. This is a vicious circle and we need to recognise that no one stands to benefit from this situation in the long term.</p>

A dynamic and competitive agricultural sector is required in Europe, which can make an effective contribution in terms of boosting sustainable, smart growth that is also conducive to inclusion. Reliable food production, sustainable management of natural resources and maintaining the territorial balance and diversity of rural areas are key elements of an effective common agricultural policy and of a productive agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Industrial policy needs to have an infrastructure. Implementing a single railway area is a vital step towards deregulating rail transport. The completion of the Single European Sky and speedy implementation of the SESAR project are just as important. One of the most important factors is the development of trans-European networks, not only in the transport but also in the energy sector, by allocating sufficient financial resources to value-added projects for Europe. The Nabucco project, for instance, will deliver benefits for all Member States by removing the European Union’s dependency on a single source. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Richard Wilkinson, the British researcher who has written the book ‘The Spirit Level’ and who visited the European Parliament in Brussels last week, has described it very well: we need equality and we need small gaps in order for us to have societies where security and confidence reign. This can be translated directly into the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, if we want to succeed, employees and their trade union organisations must be involved and respected. At the moment, however, the crisis is instead being used to attack trade unions, employees and free wage formation and to strike at unemployment benefits and pensions. These attacks must stop.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we women in Europe must, of course, have the same opportunities as men. This is not always evident in Parliament’s resolutions, but it needs to be evident in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a strong, modern industry and industrial policy and far-sighted investments, including in infrastructure, must play a central role in our work going forward. The work on climate-smart, resource-efficient processes and products, green energy and green jobs must be stepped up. How else are we going to compete?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need to have clear support for the energy efficiency policy. We know that we will not meet our current targets because they are not binding. We must have binding targets, because that is vital to enable us to achieve the targets for growth and competitiveness that are the main elements of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The low level of ambition and the lack of political will are astounding, particularly as energy efficiency measures are one of the best and smartest ways to reduce financial costs for consumers, strengthen companies and really make a difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that we should ask ourselves what economic responsibility actually means. We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance see a very large discrepancy between the policies pursued in Europe and those pursued in the Member States right now. On the one hand, we can see the Annual Growth Survey, and we can see the European Semester leading to fewer jobs and less growth in Europe. On the other hand, in the Europe 2020 Strategy and in the Employment Guidelines we say that we want to create more and better jobs. There is inconsistency here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that we have 23 million unemployed in Europe. We have 5.5 million unemployed below the age of 25. We have increasing numbers of poor workers. The figures are rising, and the economic policies that we are pursuing are not improving the situation. I believe that, if we want to create new jobs in Europe, it is vital that we truly implement the Europe 2020 Strategy and the guidelines for employment in our economic policies.

<p class="contents">To respond to that question I want to make clear the first agreed point. There can be no sustainable growth without a stable macroeconomy. Some of the quick solutions that have been proposed here, especially from the leftwing Members, would mean bread for today and hunger for tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The second agreed point is that Europe 2020 is a compendium of good intentions, it sounds good, but we have to move from contemplation to action. What are we going to do? How are we going to finance the proposed initiatives and actions? Is the ambition contained in the words of the 2020 Strategy compatible with the budgets cuts that have been announced?</p>
<p class="contents">The third agreed point is that we need a complete picture if we are to set ourselves on the right path towards stable growth. To date this picture does not yet exist. What is currently happening in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council shows that among them there are a huge amount of scattered, incoherent and inconsistent ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three important actions to be taken. Firstly, stifling countries in difficulties cannot continue, and can be solved by a joint issuing of European bonds. Secondly, the bonds specified in the Monti Report have to be implemented, but they are not mentioned in the Europe 2020 Economic Strategy. Thirdly, we have to use the European Investment Bank’s resources, two thirds of which are the Commission’s, and which would only have to be increased fourfold in 10 years in order to equal the money that the Marshall Plan had for the reconstruction of the European economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, there are two problems: firstly, the debate on the Europe 2020 Strategy is still cut off, structurally, from the economic governance package, from the European Semester and from the Annual Growth Survey and, as a result, we have either a fragmented strategy or parallel strategies, strategies which run in tandem, without adequate coordination, which thus risk undermining each other.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is that the Council’s and the Commission’s current emphasis is on tightening up the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and budgetary discipline and reform, with no convincing answers or solutions for the effective implementation and financing of the Europe 2020 Strategy objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there is a risk, as happened with the Lisbon Strategy, that many of our objectives will get no further than the drawing board and I worry that this will happen unless we are able to put persuasive arguments to the people of Europe, who are bearing the brunt of the crisis, who cannot and should not have to follow technical debates on the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and on indicators and penalties.

You have given us a lot of fine words. Do you really think that guidelines, ‘flagships’ and all manner of things that you dream up and which keep you busy for hours and days at a time will enable you to provide employment and give confidence to the people of Europe? You are wrong. If you look at the state of the world today, I do not think that the Chinese, the Indians or the emerging countries are very impressed with what we are doing about growth.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, in my capacity as rapporteur on the economic governance package, I am almost inclined to keep quiet in your presence, and I would like to say just one thing to you: in our work, we shall be extremely firm. Do not think that if you Council Members simply tell us to speed up, we will have an agreement in June. We will have an agreement when this Parliament has held debates and when the Council has listened to us. As far as I am concerned, the creation of Eurobonds, which could create a global market backed up by the euro, is part of this package. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most jobs come from economic growth and a healthy private sector. There is no alternative to that. Governments do not create jobs and are not job creators.</p>
<p class="contents">The major problem in Europe is the lack of competitiveness. The difference between Germany and southern Europe is almost 35%. That gap is very large, which is why Mrs Merkel has spoken of a competitiveness pact. I agree with that, in itself. Actually, the Lisbon Process was supposed to be an idea along those lines, but little has come of that.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is <span class="italic">one</span> thing I would like to warn you about, and that is the harmonisation of corporation tax. That is a very bad idea. It is also a very French idea, and we must dismiss it, just as we must dismiss the idea of an economic government. It will be a job killer. Last week, a study conducted by the OECD in 21 countries showed, once again, that if we want greater employment in Europe, we need to lower corporation tax. That is the sort of thing we need to be looking into, because this Parliament does not create any jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe this is because here in Parliament we do not act in a specific enough way and we are not honest enough, but rather pursue something resembling a general, headlines policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we actually doing to promote growth and stability? Are we ourselves actually contributing to a more proper and wiser way of dealing with finances? Are we really carrying out a critical review of whether we are making the right kinds of expenditure, or does every one of us not have a new idea every day about where we could spend more money? If we do not have the strength to focus our financial resources on projects for the future – and that will involve altercations, debates and decisions – then there is no point in talking about innovation and research only to then fail to make the necessary funds available. That is rather dishonest.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to breathe life into the economy, we must also pursue a policy that stimulates the economy and not endlessly sit thinking about how we can interfere with industry or the economy. We cheerfully take more decisions – even today we are constantly calling for new decisions that will interfere with the development of the economy. Does anyone believe that the question of mandatory energy efficiency – to name just one example – will help to drive the economy forward? Do you really believe that, with the decisions we have often made in connection with energy, we have stimulated the economy? Or have we obstructed it? I would like us for once to talk a bit more honestly about this and then to make somewhat fewer decisions, but perhaps ones that will really bring about progress. That will be more challenging and it will take more effort, but it is in the interests of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This also means that all countries that introduce structural reforms or changes in fiscal policy or, for example, review the Sunday opening hours of shops, must also examine whether such measures facilitate the development of the employment system and contribute to increasing the employment rate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also crucial in all decisions to consult with social partners. The European Semester will be the first real test to this realisation, when Europe together, led by the Hungarian Presidency, will be able to assess for the first time the degree to which these directives can be transposed, and whether we will be able to embark on the path of implementation. I believe that the Hungarian Presidency and the Hungarian Government has a special role in this, not only in its position of presidency, but also in leading by example, in taking this into account in all economic policy changes and all employment policy decisions, and in providing an example to the other countries.</p>

Therefore, an instrument like the European Semester makes sense. However, it must stop at interfering in tasks that have traditionally been the job of the social partners, such as wage negotiations and negotiating collective agreements. We really must exercise restraint in this regard. It does not make any sense for Europe to decide how high wages should be in the individual countries. We ought to concentrate more on eliminating market obstacles in order to allow the European economy to flourish. This relates to oligopolies and monopolies, but also to barriers to market access. It should also not be the case that various sectors are assured of particular profit margins. More competition is needed here to enable the European economy to develop its potential.</p>
<p class="contents">It must also be the task of the European Union to bring our infrastructure up to the state of the art. I am talking here about energy, transport and communications. Europe ought to have the necessary resources in this regard, in particular so that we can eliminate the existing bottlenecks between Member States. We also need to consider what resources we can make available to Europe. This includes a clear basis for our own resources. Therefore, I would make a clear appeal to the Council and the Member States at long last to give Europe the resources it needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly this also concerns education, as well as the area of research and development, where, as Europe, we have a part to play. However, the question of money is crucial here, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must take care to ensure that this strategy is not misused at European level to pursue a social clearance policy in the Member States. I am extremely shocked that, in its Annual Growth Survey, the Commission is proposing pay cuts and a reduction in social protection. Some previous speakers have already talked about this. The impact on the people locally will be disastrous. It is unacceptable for the people, the workers, to bear the costs of budgetary consolidation alone.</p>

The Annual Growth Survey once again mentions open-ended contracts, which were previously mentioned in the Agenda for New Skills for New Jobs. Mr Andor, we debated this once before in November 2010: young people cannot be integrated into the labour market by watering down employee rights. Experience in Europe has shown that this watering down simply results in a shift to precarious working conditions and does not create new jobs. We need specific measures in order to help those people who are most at risk and not flagship initiatives that operate alongside each other rather than being integrated with one another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To be successful on competitiveness in Europe, we need an institutionalised competitiveness process. We have to identify success factors and we also have to see how to tailor them to the situation. We already have a large number of instruments – competitiveness-related instruments – indeed, with a little bit of political will, we can use a substantial part of the institutional framework to launch a Commission-led competitiveness process based on the Community system.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring here to the European Semester, the growth survey that has already been mentioned. I could also mention imbalances and precision – especially in the scoreboard, which should include structural competitiveness-related factors. There is also the 2020 Strategy, which should be vigorously implemented now and not after 2013. All policies should contribute to improving the competitiveness of the European economy: we need all hands on deck and decoupling Europe’s core from the rest of it would simply generate a divided Europe. Sustainable jobs can only be created if Europe sticks together.</p>

I welcome the Commission’s proposal, which intends to maintain the 2010 Employment Guidelines in 2011. We are in agreement with this and we support this. However, the Treaty of Lisbon requires annual guidelines, and we must therefore indeed track and monitor the changes, maintain contact between each other, between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and must, of course, still make modifications if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore recommend that, during the review of the 2020 Strategy and during the work under the European Semester, the Integrated Economic and Employment Guidelines be used as a guide of sorts, and if there are any differences, we should take the trouble and make amendments. Problems might very well arise. I recently learned that, in the preliminary National Reform Programmes, there has already been a certain slippage in respect of employment commitments, and instead of the 75% target we are looking at commitments of around 72%. This obviously needs re-thinking in order to avoid a similar case to that of the Lisbon Strategy, where we undertook too much and then managed to implement little. Still, I would advise that some basic principles be laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree on the issue of pensions and wages. There should be no intervention, subsidiarity should be respected, and specific national commitments are required with regard to special groups, young people, people with disabilities and people with multiple disadvantages.</p>

It depends on what we are able to produce, and it is this on the basis of which we can provide appropriate pensions. As such, the strategy we are discussing, the one that intends to make Europe competitive, functional and successful, is what gives us the possibility to increase pensions even in countries that are currently still in a less advantageous situation.

It has not been an easy time for Europe. The Member States are still struggling to cope with the aftermath of the crisis. Measures to implement the new strategy have been put on the back burner. The ambitious Europe 2020 plans, which include an increase in employment levels to 85%, a 20% reduction in the number of people at risk of poverty and an increase in research spending to 3% appear to be under threat already, less than a year after implementation of the strategy began. Unemployment currently stands at 10% in the EU, and there are still no signs of it dropping significantly. In fact the opposite is true; if we assume that Europe continues to exit the crisis at the current slow rate, unemployment will rise even further for at least the next few years. Low levels of employment create favourable conditions for the spread of poverty and social marginalisation, as confirmed by the Eurobarometer report of June 2010. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While some people are certain that this is all just hot air and that the strategy is not worth the paper it is written on, we see very dramatic and real scenarios that we will have to face – I am thinking about measures to increase the flexibility of the labour markets. These are bringing hoards of poorly qualified, cheap workers to Central Europe, and the result is wage dumping.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal formulated in the strategy for 40% of the younger generation to have a higher education qualification seems particularly naïve. I would like to know what the point of that is. We already have a situation – I am thinking of Italy – where there are hardly any appropriate jobs for young academics, who have to keep their heads above water by taking low-paid jobs. Why do we actually need such a high number of academics when there are no suitable jobs for them? It is true that we need higher qualifications, but we will not achieve that simply by hanging a university degree around the necks of 40% of the population. That is not the right way to go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that, by having an employment policy, we shall not only resolve an economic problem but also a social one. I should therefore like to send out a message to a specific category of workers that must be taken into account in the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been talk of young people, a lot of which took place just this morning. However, there is a category of workers – a crucial generational category of workers – comprising those who are over the age of 50 and therefore close to retirement. Should we wish to raise the retirement age and create a more active society, we must adopt a strategy for workers in precarious jobs and for workers over the age of 50 who are experiencing difficulties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the schedule, work on the National Reform Programmes will be completed in April. I would like to stress the importance of involving both national parliaments and regional and local authorities in work on the National Reform Programmes, and in this respect I would also like to make reference to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions. Making changes to the guidelines at this stage could disrupt the process. I would like to draw attention to the need for an integrated horizontal approach to the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy. I would therefore also like to reiterate the significance of the cohesion policy instruments for the Europe 2020 Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Perhaps you could also tell him that, under these conditions, the European Parliament will not be an easy partner and that the economic governance package needs the Commission to pay greater attention to what emerges from this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you could also tell him that the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, of the entire Treaty of Lisbon, and particularly of Article 9, which requires you to make social issues a horizontal issue, will not go unheeded by this Parliament. We are waiting for the Treaty of Lisbon to be applied in full. We are constantly being told that a minimum revision of the Treaty is needed and that its potential must be fully exploited. As far as the potential of Article 9 is concerned, we sometimes get the impression that the Annual Growth Survey completely ignores it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to tell you what has struck me at the end of the debate. We sometimes get the impression that, even after this crisis, people at the European Commission continue to think along ‘old lines’, believing that the most important thing is to reform the labour market. We are well aware that, according to the dominant way of thinking in the European Commission – one that you undoubtedly do not subscribe to – to talk about labour market reforms is to talk about flexibility – not about flexicurity, but about flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the last 10 years, even before the crisis, have taught us that this mindset – the belief that growth is all it takes to create employment – is no longer enough. The real challenge we face is that of employment, whether our own employment or that of the countries around us.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when I see the debate getting under way on the subject of competitiveness, I see a debate that overlooks this priority for employment, and that worries me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Andor, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Madam President, I would like to thank Members for this very substantial, inspirational and stimulating discussion. I would like to answer all the major points that have been raised as questions or comments and observations concerning the annual growth survey, the Economic Semester and Europe 2020 in general.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing is that we get the picture right, both about the documents and also about the economic situation in the European Union. The inconvenient truth is that Europe is experiencing a recovery. Last year we already had economic growth in the European Union – but not in every Member State – and that is where the second part of the inconvenient truth comes. We are experiencing a very fragile and divided recovery. The Commission has looked at this situation very thoroughly and developed policies accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to maintain and strengthen the recovery, and we have to address the current division. This will not, however, be possible without addressing the weaknesses that have been exposed by the crisis in economic and monetary union, which we will do by developing further the architecture of economic and monetary governance in the European Union. That is where the complications begin and where it may be true that the priorities are not always immediately recognised by everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, economic growth is the priority and all other policies in this phase serve this. We need to strengthen growth and make it more robust, but in order to do this we need a greater level of financial stability, and for that we also need fiscal consolidation. It is inevitable that, in the coming years, fiscal consolidation will remain on the agenda in the interests of stabilisation and of being consistent with the kinds of cyclical intervention which the Member States implemented against the recession in previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a smart consolidation which does not undermine demand in the economy and which preserves the integrity of the EU economy as a whole. This lesson has to be learned. This must begin by stabilising the euro. I could obviously use stronger expressions here, but let us just stick to this one. We need to stabilise the euro and economic and monetary union. The lesson we share is that, in order to do that, we need to strengthen the economic leg of this Union and the economic leg of policy coordination at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just ask a question and leave it as a question on this. The question is whether the strengthening of the economic leg of governance can succeed without a collective effort on wages, on coordinating wage developments in the European Union. When I say that, and when we include suggestions in this area in the annual growth survey, it does not mean that we would question the importance of the social dialogue – quite the contrary. We have praised countries with a tradition and culture of strong social partnership. We recognise that they suffered less from the crisis and, in particular, suffered fewer losses in terms of human resources. Unemployment remained lower in these countries. We advocate the strengthening of social dialogue in other Member States which have suffered more and which responded to the crisis with less flexibility than countries like Germany, the Netherlands or Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also increased the level of social dialogue at European level. We recently held macroeconomic dialogue with the social partners and we will have a new tripartite social forum in March in order to enhance coordination and dialogue with the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reject very categorically the notion that the Commission is doing business as usual. In the last year the Commission has introduced a number of qualitatively new initiatives. We are pursuing a robust agenda for Financial Regulation. Commissioner Barnier’s work should not be underestimated.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of Europe 2020, we outlined a new concept for industrial policy at European level which does much more for competitiveness and the sustainability of jobs in the European Union. We are pursuing a number of innovative approaches to boost investment and to find funding for it. A group of Commissioners has been working to develop innovative financial instruments. The first example of this is going to be an outline for supporting developing energy networks in Europe. This is absolutely necessary in order to develop the energy markets and the necessary infrastructure that is vital for it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have launched the microfinance facility. I am grateful to Parliament and the Council for the final consensus that made this possible last year. Just last week I was present in the Netherlands at the launch of the first EU-supported microfinance facility and there are more in the pipeline in order to support potential entrepreneurs, perhaps after the experience of being unemployed: women coming back to the labour market after childbirth or people who have already been working and want to seek a new form of enterprise beyond 50, or even 60.</p>
<p class="contents">When we discuss employment policies – and a good example of this was a couple of weeks ago when the EPSCO Council was hosted by the Hungarian Presidency in Gödöllő – we focus on how to generate job-rich goals, but also on the groups in most difficulty. In this case I must mention in particular young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Youth unemployment is very dramatic in some Member States. Again we have to be aware of diversity. Luckily, there are some Member States where youth unemployment is low, but the European average is too high. In some Member States, like Spain and the Baltics, it is at a tragic level. The governments have been alerted and a complex set of policies, from education to employment services and other types of measures, is required. But youth is not the only problem group. It is true that we have to do more with regard to the employment of older workers. That is why we designated 2012 the European Year for Active Ageing.</p>
<p class="contents">On the institutional questions concerning the Employment Guidelines – which I believe continue to be our focus and provide guidance and substance – there is a clear role for the European Parliament under Article 148 of the Treaty. The Employment Guidelines are to be renewed. This is confirmation that we want them to continue until 2014; they should neither be subject to major changes nor overruled by annual growth surveys. The guidelines provide long-term orientation, while the growth survey is an annual exercise that concerns its substance. But it is obviously true that the NRP exercise is crucial and that the Commission is pursuing it very seriously in the context of Europe 2020. Parliament will be involved in the discussions in various ways. I should refer here to the multiannual financial framework negotiations. The EU budget also has to reflect 2020 priorities and we will keep Parliament informed about the preparation of the national reform programme as the country-specific recommendations develop.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that there is concern at this early stage about the future of Europe 2020. In a way, a spectre is haunting Europe 2020: that of the Lisbon Strategy. I have had many opportunities in this House to discuss why we believe there is a much better chance, through a more focused system of targets and also a more focused system of reporting and implementation, of success with Europe 2020.</p>
<p class="contents">Only the Commission can ensure that there is consistency between these initiatives. We have a number of balls in the air and we have to make sure that none of them falls while conducting economic policies: Europe 2020, economic governance, the single market and cohesion policy. None of them must be damaged in this exercise. All of them need to be pursued in a very robust way, ensuring that all 27 Member States are involved. The Commission is obviously against the concept of a two-speed Europe. We have to ensure that the divided recovery which we are experiencing does not turn into political divisions in the coming period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also would like to extend my special thanks to Mrs Perez for her excellent report and the very important observations and criticisms that she made.</p>
<p class="contents">We may have a different reading of the reality, as referred to by Mrs Danuta Hübner, both for a crisis and for the recovery, but I believe that we all agree on one point, and that is that nobody is interested in a jobless recovery. We are all striving for a balance between fiscal consolidation and growth and job creation. Indeed, fiscal discipline and the raising of employment levels should go hand in hand.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general note, on economic issues, we all know that now we have a comprehensive approach, a comprehensive ‘package’ or ‘<span class="italic">Gesamtpaket</span>’, as some people say, most of the elements of which have just been referred to by Commissioner Andor. As far as the Presidency is concerned, I would just like to underline again that we have to focus upon two of all the elements of the package. One is certainly the implementation and the application of the European Semester. This is the first time, it is the first exercise. It will have a major impact on the subsequent development of the whole European integration process.</p>
<p class="contents">Just to mention two things briefly. One is that we have a very tight schedule, so the deadlines must be respected by all, and the headline targets will have to be achieved. We have to make all possible efforts to ensure that the overall deadlines are met through the contributions of the individual Member States, in the fields both of employment and innovation, and of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just mention, about energy, that there was a very successful meeting of the European Council on 4 February. For many of us it represented a kind of breakthrough, both for the establishment of the integrated energy market and for energy efficiency. Important decisions were also made with respect to the external aspects of the common energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would just like to mention the fight against poverty, the fight for social inclusion. In this respect, I would like to congratulate you on the resolution you have just adopted on Roma integration. I would like to extend my very special congratulations and thanks to Lívia Járóka, who played a decisive role in the preparation of the report, and also in the adoption of this extremely important resolution, which will be very helpful for us when we work on and finalise the European framework strategy for Roma integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The other element we want to concentrate upon is the six legislative texts. Here I would like to assure Sylvie Goulard that we do not only want to listen to Parliament. We indeed would like to have, and we have to make, an agreement with Parliament under the terms of the ordinary legislative process. We will have to do everything possible so that this process is accelerated and can be successfully concluded by the end of the Hungarian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to get into the other elements of the comprehensive package. I would just like to underline one thing. The Council wants to fully respect the Community method. We have no reservations whatsoever in this regard. As we said many times before, the Treaty of Lisbon changed many things. There were major shifts in competences. We all know about them. But the Treaty of Lisbon did not change the heart of the European architecture and this is the Community method. We will strictly abide by that. Of course, we always have to be in line with the Treaty. I would just like to refer to the fact that if you read carefully the conclusions of the European Council of 4 February, you will find there that everything must be in line with the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Now my last remark is very short. It is about the money. As was pointed out by Lena Ek, policies need money and policies need financing. I could not agree more. But we know very well that there are divergences in the approaches of the Member States. At this point in time I would just like to underline one thing from the point of view of the Presidency: we warmly suggest that first we discuss the substance and thereafter discuss the figures and the monies and the resources. There will be a long debate. We will have very useful orientation debates on cohesion policy, on energy policy, on agriculture and so on, but, as is said sometimes, </p>

<p class="contents">The provision of high-quality higher education and support for the involvement of young people in research and development activities can ensure the success of the effort to boost economic competitiveness.

The principle of gender mainstreaming is key to the professional education and training system. It is an essential requirement if women are to benefit from long-term professional development which is adapted to labour market demands, if better use is to be made of their potential and if employment levels among women are to rise, particularly in traditionally male professions, low carbon sectors of the economy and senior decision-making positions. I would call for professional education and training to be adapted to women’s needs, and for more women to participate in such education and training. At present, it does not take account of the different needs of women and their economic and social conditions. This means that women find it much harder than men to return to work or enter the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">If it is to function effectively, the professional education and training system for women must be comprehensive, or in other words it must encompass experience, life stage and women’s multi-dimensional needs as regards education, including the specific needs of disabled women, elderly women, women living in poverty and female immigrants, for example. Flexible, affordable access to high-quality training should be a priority. A significant role should also be played by incentives for employers, which would facilitate the organisation of training courses for women working in small and medium-sized enterprises and at home. In order to achieve the aims of the Europe 2020 Strategy, it will be necessary to link professional training more closely to the demands of the labour market, in order to create new training opportunities for women in the fields of science, mathematics and technology. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A strong social protection system, investment in active labour market policies and education and training opportunities for all are essential to reduce unemployment and prevent long term exclusion. The flexicurity is not applicable in Member States with low possibilities of strengthening social protection systems due to budget restrictions and macroeconomic imbalances, as in Romania, and I consider that reducing labour market segmentation has to be achieved by providing adequate security for workers under all forms of contracts. Any labour market reforms must be introduced by reaching a high degree of social consensus through agreements with the social partners at national and EU level. A legislative agenda is essential to eradicate the existing pay gap between women and men by 1% every year in order to achieve the target of 10% reduction by 2020. The Europe 2020 Strategy should include a target of reducing poverty amongst women in the EU as 17 % of the women are classed as living in poverty, mostly single mothers, immigrants and older women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In recent decades industrial production has relocated to third countries with low production costs, as a result of European companies being in hot pursuit of profits, and at the cost of job losses in the EU. A strong cohesion policy, which is financed appropriately and covers every European region, must be a supplementary key element in the Europe 2020 Strategy. This horizontal approach is a prerequisite for successfully achieving the targets proposed within the Europe 2020 framework, as well as for achieving social, economic and territorial cohesion. One example of this is the EU Strategy for the Danube Region, which will contribute to its prosperity, economic and social development, as well as ensure security in the region.

Its objectives are fundamental, especially when it comes to enabling us to fund pensions and construct a European social model based on well-being. The elements that could constitute the foundations of this social model have been brought into question by Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy’s proposals. Indeed, the proposals contained in the competitiveness pact include the abolition of the automatic indexing of wages to inflation. The argument is that such a move would increase competitiveness and consequently employment. There is nothing to show that this will automatically be the case. The abolition of automatic indexing could even cause, in certain circumstances, developments which increase inflation, something that nobody wants. There are still many other means by which to strive to create employment, such as strategic investment or training in sectors of the future. The indexing of pay and social benefits is an instrument which some countries have embraced in order to reduce the risk of poverty among workers, which is a growing phenomenon in Europe. This provides an opportunity, therefore, to meet another objective of the Union for 2020: 20 million fewer poor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The last European Council confirmed it. It is driven by greater liberalisation; moving the market into new areas; labour market flexibility; and unrivalled attacks on wages and social rights. The instruments for implementing this agenda have been set out: so-called ‘economic governance’ and the recent Franco-German ‘competitiveness pact’. In practice, they want what the European Union and the International Monetary Fund are applying in various Member States under the umbrella of the ‘assistance plans’, as they are perversely known, with catastrophic consequences in economic and social terms, to be more widespread and imposed as a rule. The implementation of the proposed measures conceals the real causes of the difficult economic and social situation in countries like Portugal. Worse still, it would have particularly serious consequences for these countries and for the living conditions of their citizens. We are facing an extremely serious threat to the rights of European workers and citizens, which is bordering on a revanchist crusade against employment and social rights. It seeks to degrade these rights by attacking wages, raising the retirement age and removing restrictions on the free movement of workers within the EU. This could lead to the devaluation of the EU labour force and even greater flexibility in terms of employment laws. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The strategy was greeted with some scepticism, which was reasonable considering the complete failure of the Lisbon Strategy. Many commentators forecast that it too would remain nothing more than an empty document, full of goals that were as noble as they were unrealistic. There can be no one among us who has forgotten the fundamental goal of the Lisbon Strategy, namely that by 2010 the Union would become the most competitive economy in the world. Where are we now? The great economic crisis and budgetary crises in the euro area have forced the Union to fight for survival, rather than for a position as a global economic leader.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Europe 2020 Strategy also doomed to failure? There is good reason to believe so. Instead of thinking about how to create a knowledge- and innovation-based economy, or how to reduce social exclusion, we are discussing the extent to which funding will be limited in the Community budget. It is becoming increasingly evident that there is a lack of political will actually to address the strategy proposed by the Commission. It seems that once again the problem of a long-term vision for the Union’s development has been obscured by current problems. In order to enable the Community to retain its place in the global economy, to compete not only with the US and China, but also Brazil and India, it has to set long-term goals for itself and work towards them consistently. We already have a plan; now we just need to ensure that it is implemented consistently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new Member States must also make sure that they maintain sufficient freedom of movement and competitiveness in order to resolve the deepening structural and employment problems they have retained after the Eastern European changes of regime. Wrong decisions and serious governmental negligence in the past also require us to pay attention to the situation of families: the labour market does not only consist of employers and employees, but also of multi-generation families maintaining more or less close relations. These not only represent the foundation of society but also the key to its future. Closer cooperation between generations could in itself give a considerable boost to employment (e.g. employment of young mothers, support to people with disabilities in finding work, maintaining the activity of the elderly, even in the civil sector), and common planning (e.g. housing situation) could also help avoid individual and family debt crises and bankruptcies, which are sufficient to force families into the grey economy due to high repayment instalments. This previous way is no longer feasible. New approaches will also be required, as the old formulas are no longer sufficient, and the European Union, too, must come to realise this. The EU must also support solutions which may seem unconventional at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should include gender equality in all targets, flagship initiatives and national reforms – and women should be considered in all policy areas. The open method of coordination is a weak means to carry out common goals, therefore results will only come if there is real commitment!</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe 2020 Strategy's employment targets call for an increase in women's employment. This, the reconciliation of work and family life and the elimination of gender stereotypes in the labour market are a must. We need to involve more women in vocational training, the sciences and educational fields that have been until now considered as 'masculine'. We have to end the gender-based segregation of the labour market, especially when it comes to the new green jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">Fully including women to the labour market is a way to put an end to the demographic crisis. If we provide secure and decent work, the means to reconcile work and family life and if we manage to include men more intensively in household duties, then all studies show that women would be more willing to bear children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must remember that a smart energy system is the future both in terms of the environment and these jobs. Such a system would allow us to decouple economic growth from energy consumption. If this will be the case, we will be able to produce more for the same or less energy consumption and create thousands of jobs which can not be outsourced. We have to make sure that smart energy does not remain a dream. We are building today a whole new energy infrastructure in Europe. We have to ensure this lessens the divide between Western and Central Europe in terms of sustainable jobs. A two-speed Europe on energy will not solve energy poverty or inefficiency. We should give a helping hand to those regions which are behind, even if it is not easy in today’s economic realities. We need a smart energy system for all European citizens at the same time. We must prevent a piecemeal system where some citizens only see the future 50 years after the others. Simply put, we need smart energy jobs for all Europeans, not just for those who would have received them even without Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(Poland is divided into 16 regions).</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, one of the 4 regions of Latvia – Latgale – remains one of the most unprotected. Application of funds in Latgale is many times less efficient than in Latvia as a whole. This situation is reflected on the labour market of Latgale. While the unemployment rate in the capital city of Latvia (Riga) is 8-9%, in Latgale it is 20-25%. European employment programs are inaccessible to the population of such towns as Livani, Preili, Kraslava, Ludza, Aglona and Dagda.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of solving the issue of organisation and stimulation of production in Latgale, the Latvian government is continuously increasing taxes, which leads to widespread bankruptcy of small and medium-sized companies. To avoid social tension the inhabitants of Latgale are given LVL 100 per month as a sop.</p>
<p class="contents">The common policy of the Latvian government has resulted in the emigration of more than 150 000 workers. I appeal to the European Commission for urgent intervention in the situation. It is necessary to work out an Employment Framework for outlying regions of the EU such as Latgale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the years we have seen a huge increase in the number of these products, and the most recent estimates indicate that about one and a half million medicines are sold illegally in Europe, particularly via the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">These data constitute a serious threat not only to patients but also to European producers. At stake here are the protection of public health and the safeguarding of consumers, who must be given an assurance that strict safety measures and effective sanctions will be employed by Member States. With today’s vote, effective and flexible rules will be introduced, and we will also fight against organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">To understand the safety requirement affecting the sector, one need only think that, in 2008, approximately 34 million illegal medicines were seized. We could perhaps have been a little bolder with regard to the traceability of medicines and active ingredients from third countries. Nevertheless, the step we have taken today is still important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their number is continuously increasing, and we must therefore do everything in our power to prevent falsified medicines from entering the supply chain. Even though this does not threaten the entire pharmaceutical industry, it still undermines people’s confidence in pharmacies, not to mention the fact that falsified medicinal products may contain sub-standard active ingredients. Estimates indicate that the number of boxes of falsified medicines could reach 42 million by 2020, exposing the European economy to significant risk.</p>
<p class="contents">The European pharmaceutical sector realises a total annual turnover of more than EUR 170 billion. We must prevent unfair competition from foreign producers that place medicinal products on the market, the manufacturing process of which cannot be checked. Furthermore, I believe it is important that we discuss matters such as the sale of medicinal products over the Internet.

<p class="contents">This is an opportunity for Member States to better regulate the matter, but we must remember, Mr President, that citizens can order medicines from another Member State and that this regulation should not be seen as another opportunity to benefit the pharmaceutical industry. Instead we must continue to progress along the trail of liberalisation that the EU is currently blazing by adopting measures such as this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a requirement and a duty that we must fulfil on behalf of all European citizens, who are often unaware that they are buying a falsified medicine.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the thrust of the report, which introduces obligations to be met not only by distributors but also by all those involved in the supply chain. Indeed, it is often in the intricacies of the various steps in the distribution chain that high-risk products are introduced. Monitoring must not, however, only be carried out when products are placed on the market. Rather, inspections should take place at the sites where medicinal products and active ingredients are produced, including in third countries.</p>

The latter placed the sole responsibility for compliance with wholesale distributors, thus failing to guarantee the reliability of the pharmaceutical supply chain in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we voted on today introduced measures to further ensure the safety of pharmaceutical products such as, for example, the stepping up of inspections of manufacturers outside the European Union on the basis of a risk analysis. The proposed amendment also includes the need to publish in an EU database a list of certified wholesale distributors, in other words distributors for which compliance with EU legislation has not been established through inspection by the Member State alone.</p>
<p class="contents">We could nevertheless have hoped for a more ambitious outcome. I refer particularly to the introduction of mandatory inspections of active-ingredient production sites in third countries. These were omitted on the grounds that implementation costs would have been too high. If they had been introduced, we could have avoided the oft repeated situation of European companies having to meet very high quality standards, while companies that produce in other parts of the world benefit from regulatory frameworks that are undoubtedly less stringent.

Occasionally, we face criticism that on one hand we talk about the important role of this business sector – in manufacturing, in the creation of one third of the GDP in the European Union and in the creation of secure jobs – but without good instruments providing financial support to these companies. Most of the EU funds for development and innovation go primarily to large companies due to their requirements. This should be changed, since small and medium-sized enterprises are unable to meet the demands made of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The crisis has severely limited small and medium-sized enterprises’ access to credit and loans, and new regulations that are targeted at the banking sector may make matters even worse. Let me mention here the Basel III package, which has already been approved, with regard to its precautionary standards. I believe that access to funding for business development, particularly in the field of innovation, is especially important. We emphasise the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly as a group of ‘sleeping innovators’. These small and medium-sized enterprises need to enter the European market on a wider scale. This will help to revive the economy, create jobs and achieve the objectives established in the Europe 2020 Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This need is also imposed by the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises’ interests if – as Basel III proposes – higher equity capital requirements are established for banks. It is also required by the situation of many financial intermediaries, who are deterred by the administrative burdens created by complex European financial regulations, and it is influenced by the difficulties created by different tax and support systems. It is prompted by a requirement to make European Union support programmes consistent in order to provide better guarantees and a good balance between national and EU schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support the proposal to establish a one-stop shop for the various EU financing instruments aimed at SMEs. Simplifying bidding and procedures for access to markets is an important means of support even if it proves necessary to increase funding.

This is a major impediment to job creation and indeed growth. In countries undergoing severe austerity measures – like my own country, Ireland – this issue is particularly severe and I believe it needs to be dealt with immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to act at EU level to ensure that banks are willing and able to finance SMEs. Recapitalisation of banks is important, but recapitalised banks with the SME sector on its knees is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">My real fear is that we are going to end up with a highly capitalised banking system, while the real economy is on floor. We all talk about growth, and that is the only way that many of the peripheral economies can climb out of the abyss that they are already in. Yes, it is a balancing act, but we have a situation where the health of our financial institutions is improving day by day but SMEs still remain in intensive care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur when she notes that there are major differences between pension systems in Europe. They have been greatly affected by the severe financial and economic crisis with rising unemployment, declining growth, lower investment returns and growth in public debt. Pension funds find it more difficult to ensure adequate pensions and, in some cases, to honour their commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">During the reform of their pension systems, many Member States have made swingeing cuts. Financial sustainability is important, but we should also take into account the need to ensure an adequate income. Budget sustainability and adequacy of pension systems are not conflicting goals but two sides of the same coin: true sustainability cannot be achieved without an adequate retirement income.</p>
<p class="contents">By virtue of my experience as Minister for Employment in Italy, Mr President, I can confirm that if there is no compliance by the Member States, it will be very difficult for individual States to adapt to this type of legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had great expectations that this would be a ruling that would have a knock-on effect on other countries in Europe. This, unfortunately, did not happen, and the Commission has not been willing to put pressure on other countries that tie their people to certain pensions. Therefore, it is also important that the European Parliament has now determined that pension systems shall have an earning capacity for citizens. There is to be transparency with regard to costs and returns and we must remove the barriers to mobility across borders. All of these are good and sound liberal principles, but if we take this to its logical conclusion, people should also be able to move their pensions from one fund to another if the unemployment or pension fund that they have been assigned to by their trade union or employer does not do its job properly. We did not achieve that much this time round, but we have nevertheless taken a step in the right direction today, and I think this is good for the internal market and for citizens’ chances of getting a decent return on their pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thirdly, Member States such as Poland which implemented a difficult pension reform, resulting in a deficit increase and public debt, should not be penalised by the excessive deficit procedure. Fourthly, the pension system should encourage longer working lives, which is consistent with the trend in the labour market.

The first is the lack of recognition of the importance of the third pillar in pension systems. Second, although the difference in retirement income between men and women resulting from the pay gap, breaks for periods of care and greater unemployment among women has been acknowledged, there are no flexibility criteria for women of retirement age who cease to be employed, and there is no adequate recognition of periods of care for the purpose of defining retirement age. This would, however, be desirable. Thirdly, European citizens’ right to a common programme of welfare education and information about their pension and insurance situation should be affirmed, in particular for young people and workers throughout the course of their working lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We obviously have to remember that there are 27 different Member States in the EU. Their economic circumstances still vary in many respects, and pensions differ greatly in terms of size. We basically have to ensure, however, that pension income is adequate in the different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am mainly concerned about the pensions of those young people who work in the different countries, the different Member States of the European Union. How can we make sure that pensions can be transferred more satisfactorily from one country to another, and not just from pension fund to pension fund, as there are big problems with those too? I would hope for flexibility in this. In this we perhaps need European­wide coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the pensions debate will continue, as recently I read that in 2010, for example, the life expectancy of children born in Finland is 100 years. If we consider that 30 years are spent studying and 30 years are spent at work, then they will be on a pension for 40 years. We will therefore definitely have to think about systems in a new way, so that this situation can be dealt with in a manner that is sustainable for everyone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, a certain consultancy is essential, in my opinion, because the European Union and the Member States must look for a solution immediately to economic and demographic challenges such as, for example, forecasts that the ratio of inhabitants over 65 to the population of productive age will rise to 53% in 2060. At the same time, there are only two workers to every pensioner. In this context it is natural that average public expenditure on pensions and expenditure related to ageing will increase, and it will become ever more difficult to provide adequate pensions. It is therefore necessary to encourage people to enter the labour market, increasing employment levels and economic growth. The importance of the family is also not sufficiently emphasised, as my colleague Mrs Záborská has said. Nobody talks about the need to have children to improve our pension system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in fact facing serious demographic challenges. The birth rate is very low, life expectancy is increasing, and public spending is growing due to ageing societies. Debates on raising the retirement age are being held in many countries. The current economic and demographic situation forces us to give serious thought to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, life expectancy is increasing. We are working under better conditions, which allows us to work for longer. Pension systems fall under the competence of the Member States. However, the time has come for them to be coordinated at EU level, for example in relation to the functioning of the internal market and the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. Expenditure on pensions and medical treatment significantly affects the state of public finances in the individual Member States.

Hopefully it will put the issue of pensions centre stage in EU matters.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the core issue is: how are Member States going to finance adequate pensions for their citizens? What systems will they put in place using some combination of the three pillars to ensure that their pension systems are sustainable?</p>
<p class="contents">There is a yawning gap between current pension provision and what will be needed to provide pensions at current levels for the next 40 years. Indeed, an estimate from a major insurance company states that the gap between what we are currently providing, both public and private, and what will be needed to ensure that pension provision remains at the same level in 40 years’ time for the EU 27, is EUR 1.9 trillion per year. That is a staggering figure and, while measures such as, perhaps, longer working lives or other initiatives will help to bridge that gap, there is still an enormous fiscal black hole.</p>

From this perspective, it would be a symbolic act because it would take place 20 years after the declaration of independence from the former Yugoslav Republic. On the other hand, concluding the negotiations in this manner would send out a very strong signal to the other candidate countries in the Balkans at a time when, as we are aware, the Union’s power of attraction seems to be waning.

The few chapters that are left until negotiations can be concluded should be closed before the middle of the year. The most important factor here is the political will demonstrated by Croatia, which has declared its determination to implement all the provisions and criteria for membership. This political will also relates to the resolution of difficult relations with its neighbours. All of the countries that have recently become EU members know that final negotiations are the toughest, because they include many provisions that apply to large social groups.

Its progress in many areas is encouraging, including in the fight against corruption, yet at the same time further efforts are needed, including with regard to the independence of the judiciary and greater efficiency of the latter, the public administration reforms and competition policy. We are encouraging Croatia to persist in its actions to defend the rights of minorities and to support returning refugees. One of the problems which must be resolved by Croatia is improved cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. It should also adopt and accelerate the restructuring and privatisation plan for the shipyards which are experiencing difficulties. The biggest challenge, however, may prove to be the scepticism of Croatian society towards accession to the EU.

So it is progress of a kind that at least the ordinary people of Croatia will have the final word over EU accession. Under the current constitutional arrangements, a referendum must be held within 30 days of the contraction of the accession treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I think there are real losses potentially to Croatia. It is a country with an educated and industrious workforce that could do extremely well pricing itself into the market and exploiting the advantages of relatively cheap exports; but I am a democrat, and of course, if the people of Croatia vote in favour of EU accession, if that is their considered will, then I will support their bid when it comes before this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">I just raise the question of why some of the existing Member States should not also consult their people on the issue of continued membership. On a major constitutional issue of this sort, it seems quite proper that the existing politicians should not be allowed to make permanent derogations of sovereignty without first asking the permission of those they represent. Our parliamentarians are not the owners of our freedoms. They are their temporary and contingent custodians and, if they want to alienate power from Westminster, they should have the courtesy to ask our permission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must take into account the concern expressed by EU citizens over the quality and safety of the medicinal products they are consuming. All the more so given that experts are observing alarming tendencies: a sharp increase in seizures of falsified medicines by customs (an increase of up to 384% since 2005); a trend towards the falsification of life-saving medicines, which can have fatal consequences; counterfeit medicines are increasingly being found in legal supply chains. EU citizens must be very careful when purchasing medicines online, because here the chances of acquiring falsified medicines increases by up to 50%. Patients need to be absolutely sure that the medicines they consume really are the medicines they expect them to be. The EU must therefore react swiftly and constructively to the dangerous tendencies mentioned. This directive is a first step towards ensuring that only high quality medicines are distributed in the EU. To achieve this objective I feel that it is very important to establish strict controls and determine responsibility at all levels of manufacturing, distribution and sales. Then EU citizens will feel safe when using genuinely high quality medicines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Figures released by the WHO and also quoted in European studies are alarming. Falsifying of medicines is steadily increasing: in 2008 alone, 34 million falsified medicines were seized in the EU, and that is without mentioning the online market for these products, in which it is estimated that 50-90% of the medicinal products available are falsified.

<p class="contents">I believe that strict regulation to protect public health is essential not only in the legal pharmaceutical supply chain, through the implementation of devices to detect tampering with packages and to track active ingredients in order to establish the source, or through inspections of third-country production sites, but also on the Internet.

Falsifying of medicinal products must be viewed as a criminal act that denies patients the necessary medical treatment and is harmful to their health, sometimes even leading to their death. Therefore the objective of the directive should be the protection of public health, ensuring a high level of quality control of the import of medicinal products, since this is one of the key entry doors of falsified medicines to the European market.

There is data indicating a sharp increase in seizures of falsified medicines by customs. For instance, 2.7 million medicinal products were confiscated at EU custom borders in 2006 and 2.5 million in 2007, hence seizures of medicines are up 384% compared to 2005. The report observes a trend from the falsification of ‘lifestyle’ medicines to life-saving medicines, including medicines to treat cancer and heart disease, psychiatric disorders and infections. Treatment with such falsified medicines can have fatal consequences. Furthermore, there is a trend towards targeting the classical supply chain. Besides the Internet, the licensed distribution chain is increasingly targeted. Out of the 13 Member States that had data, seven reported incidences of counterfeit medicinal products in the legal supply chain. Patients need to be absolutely sure that the medicines they consume really are the medicines they expect them to be. The use of falsified medicines can result in therapeutic failure and can put lives at risk.

This situation is highlighted by the fact that, in 2008 alone, the customs authorities announced that more than 34 million counterfeit medicinal products were confiscated in Europe. Admittedly, the EU has not yet reached the situation of other geographical areas where up to 30% of the medicines available on the market are counterfeit. However, the EU must not allow this situation to be reached. It is currently estimated that 1% of medicinal products sold are counterfeit, but there are warnings indicating that this proportion is on the rise. The new safety regulations adopted by Parliament, the penalties imposed on the manufacturers of counterfeit medicines and the control system between manufacturers and consumers are intended to halt the growth of the pharmaceutical black market in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the introduction of new, mandatory safety regulations governing the trading of medicinal products, including those sold via the Internet, is a welcome step. Selling counterfeit medicines is a criminal activity with serious repercussions which can affect a huge number of consumers who very often choose the easy route of the Internet to order medicines which they would otherwise not be able to access without a medical recommendation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The verification requirements pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to should be stepped up in order to avoid these risks. Safety features for medicines should also be harmonised within the EU, and should enable each individual pack to be identified and its authenticity verified. They should also identify any falsified products, while ensuring the functioning of the internal market for medicines. The risk-assessment process should take account of criteria such as the cost of medicines and the history of falsified medicines in the EU and in third countries, as well as the effects these falsified products have on public health, in terms of the specific nature of the products in question and of the severity of the conditions they are intended to treat.

Nevertheless, this type of crime is neither regulated in the same way nor subject to the same level of penalties as narcotics-related crimes. Illegally producing medicines by copying, or quite simply omitting, their active ingredients does not require large-scale facilities or investment. It is easy to make a large profit. Estimated figures have revealed that proceeds from the sale of falsified medicines in 2010 exceeded EUR 50.6 million, which therefore represents a 95% increase as compared to the estimated figures five years ago. This increase is largely due to the lack of detailed legislation in some countries because of either a lack of resources or the unwillingness to implement it, and to the fact that the level of penalty set out does not have a truly deterrent effect.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the compromise reached by the rapporteur: it is balanced and its primary objective is to protect patients. This is a step in the right direction, even though it excludes important issues such as, for example, the fact that generic medicines and non-prescription medicines are not covered by the implementation of safety features. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It may even be the cause of them, for example with the 2004 Directive on traditional herbal medicinal products, coupled with the 2006 Regulation on health claims. The former includes the requirement for products to be registered with the European Medicines Agency, a procedure so complex and so costly that only 200 herbal medicinal products had been registered by the end of 2010. The other gives the European Food Safety Authority the power to authorise or not health claims for food supplements, including plants, an authorisation which it gives so rarely and refuses on such arbitrary grounds that it has even upset the Commission.

From studies it is clear that the use of falsified medicines is so dangerous for patients that it puts lives at risk: it is therefore right to consider falsification to be a criminal act warranting the adoption of a strong stance by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence my support for the points contained in the report, namely: that there should be clear definitions relating not only to the scope, but also to the different actors in the supply chain, in order to clarify their roles and responsibilities; that sanctions should be equivalent to those applied for illegal acts involving narcotics; and that there should be enhanced transparency and regulation of medicine sales on the Internet, thereby enabling consumers to distinguish between illegal operators and online pharmacies.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, more than ever, active collaboration between different national and international agencies is emerging as a key factor in a more effective system to combat pharmaceutical falsification. Such a system can ensure appropriate monitoring not only of pharmaceutical falsification within the European Union but also of falsified medicines exported to third countries, the numbers of which continue to increase. The guiding principle should be patient welfare in all cases. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is estimated that 1% of medicinal products currently sold to the European public through the legal supply chain are fake. In other parts of the world more than 30% of the medicines on sale can be fake. More and more innovative and life-saving drugs are counterfeit. It is well known that the Internet represents one of the main routes for falsified medicinal products to enter the European market. Medicinal products purchased over the Internet from sites that conceal their actual physical address are estimated to be falsified in more than 50 % of cases. People looking for cheaper medicines on the Internet are often hooked in by fraudsters selling counterfeit medicines with ingredients that pose a health risk. A lot of fake medicine is getting into the legal supply chain during repackaging. For too long we have lacked a proper response to dishonest repackagers and fraudsters rampant in the vastness of the Internet, while an ever increasing number of people buying medicines from untrustworthy websites have begun to put their health or even their lives at risk. I am pleased that penalties for counterfeiters have been set, along with measures to ensure a more stringent review. Registered pharmacies in countries where the sale of medicines over the Internet is permitted must obtain a special licence; their websites must carry the European logo and be included in the European database. Patients need to be absolutely sure that the medicines they consume really are the medicines they need to take. The protection of public health against falsified medicines should be the main focus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In light of the number of counterfeit medicines confiscated in the European Union (more than 34 million counterfeit pills were confiscated in 2008), it is high time for the European Union to set up an effective traceability system to guarantee the origin and the quality of medicines available in the European Union. This is all the more necessary given that counterfeit medicines pose a real risk to European’s health in view of the substances – toxic substances at times – that they may contain. The new measures introduced, that is, electronic serial numbers on the packaging of prescription medicines allowing them to be traced from the factory to the patient; limitation on handling during repackaging stages; and strengthening of inspections of manufacturers and wholesalers, represent a concrete step forward that will guarantee the people and patients of Europe a greater level of safety.</p>

The number of falsified medicinal products is rising extremely rapidly in the EU. They may contain inferior or falsified ingredients, or they may not contain any at all or their doses may be incorrect. Although the scale of this problem is still relatively minor in Europe, unlike in other regions, I voted for this report as I think that there are a number of factors indicating the need for measures to be adopted promptly at EU level. The new directive will include penalties imposed on the manufacturers of counterfeit medicines, enhanced safety regulations and a verification system whose aim is to prevent dangerous medicinal products reaching the European market.</p>

The Commission proposal avoids giving specific definitions, despite the many recommendations. This kind of approach may lead to incomplete or unenforceable protection for patients who are consumers of medicinal products. That is why I welcome Amendment 120, which makes the Commission's proposal much less ambiguous. Particularly useful is the definition of a ‘falsified medicinal product’. The proposed text regarding ‘supply chains’ is also excellent, and if approved would strengthen the right of patients to protection. I consider the implementation of Recital 5c of Amendment 120, enabling the enforcement and monitoring of compliance with EU rules, to be imperative. The amendment brings EU regulations into line with the findings of the Court of Justice. In this context, the proposed text also allows Member States to take their own action in support of greater consumer protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The responsibility of the guilty should be no less than if they were drug dealers.

We should highlight the positive effect of this proposal, which promotes debate on a crucial subject, with the ultimate aim of combating falsified medicinal products. In fact, the falsification of medicinal products is a crime that deprives the patients of the medical treatment that they need and damages their health, possibly even causing death. The main objective of the directive, as the rapporteur rightly points out, should be the protection of public health. This objective must be reflected in the directive’s legal basis. It also seems essential to me to safeguard the distribution network for medicinal products, establishing clear and precise definitions, not only with regard to the scope of the directive’s application, but also with regard to the roles and responsibilities of the various parties involved in the supply chain: retailers, distributors, brokers. I voted in favour, as I believe it is essential to promote a legislative measure on this, in order to deal with this growing threat to health and to improve patient safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The challenge for the European authorities, judicial as well as customs, is enormous: they have to trace the sources and curb this trafficking, which is endangering millions of lives worldwide. I therefore welcome the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council to establish a common legal framework in the 27 Member States to limit the risk of falsified medicines. Of the main advances, I would mention: the principle of cascading accountability covering all actors in the chain – manufacturing authorisation holders, wholesale distributors, brokers, and so on; the compulsory use of a security device (serial number or seal) on the packaging of prescription medicines; the introduction of stricter rules on inspections carried out in cooperation with the European Medicines Agency; and the drafting of a list of entities authorised to sell products remotely.</p>

The absence of a framework law encourages falsification, which is an organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen disproportionate growth of this criminal activity, with a 400% increase in seizures of falsified medicinal products since 2005. It is estimated that 1% of the medicinal products currently on sale to the European public through the legal supply chain are falsified and that this number is increasing. In other parts of the world, more than 30% of the medicines on sale may have been falsified. In addition, increasing numbers of innovative and life-saving drugs are falsified.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore approved today a new law to prevent the entry of falsified medicines into the legal supply chain and to protect patient safety.

The same applies for the definitions of the different actors in the chain of supply, clarifying their roles and responsibilities. It is essential to make a distinction between those actors who are already formally recognized - and which role is considered liable - and those who are outside that category, although being relevant to the liability of the distribution chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore it is important to make the distinction between traders and brokers, as well as to clarify their roles and responsibilities.

This issue was not addressed in the Commission's proposal, and the work of the ENVI committee has therefore substantially improved it by adding important safeguards for consumers who purchase medicines online. But the nature of the Internet means that we cannot eliminate the risk. Consumer awareness of this risk needs to be improved, and so I welcome the inclusion of awareness-raising campaigns for the public which has been agreed as part of the compromise.

This is a major problem – the Commission puts the number of boxes of falsified medicines sold within the legal supply chain each year in Europe at 1.5 million. Even more alarming is the fact that volumes are increasing by up to 20%. Falsified medicines are silent killers. The people distributing them are dangerous criminals and should be viewed as such. Penalties for counterfeiting medicine should be the same as for drug trafficking. This will require improved coordination between various national and international institutions. We must clamp down on the sale of falsified medicines online, because the Internet is one of the main routes for falsified medicinal products to enter the European market.

There can be no doubt that the appearance of falsified medicines in official distribution channels represents a threat to the entire European pharmaceutical system, by undermining the trust of citizens in the quality of drugs purchased in pharmacies or other legal outlets.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the most disturbing aspect is the change in the risk profile. To date, counterfeit products have mainly come under the heading of ‘life-style’ drugs, whereas there is currently a dramatic increase in the number of counterfeit life-saving medicines. It is therefore important to establish a clear and unambiguous definition of a ‘falsified medicinal product’. but also to define all the entities in the distribution chain, such as sellers and agents who must operate on the basis of permits and abide by the rules of good manufacturing practices, as do the manufacturers and distributors. In view of the above, I consider that it is necessary and a matter of priority to support any measures aimed at minimising this problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the EU, which account for around 99% of all businesses and provide over 100 million jobs, make a fundamental contribution to economic growth, social cohesion and job creation, are a major source of innovation and play a vital role in sustaining and increasing employment. However, the limited ability of SMEs to access finance is a major impediment to their creation and growth, particularly faced with the current financial and economic crisis. I therefore agree with the resolution’s call for a significant increase in funding for innovative financial instruments under the EU budget to cater for the financing needs of SMEs, and in light of the Europe 2020 Strategy. However, it should be noted that the current EU financial regulations on the use of European funds and programmes are unduly complicated, and the expense in terms of time and money involved in complying with these regulations is out of all proportion to the benefits for the final recipient of the funding. I therefore agree with the call for the Commission to propose simplified and less costly regulations and guidelines, especially for programmes intended to support low-volume SME finance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One job in four depends on the industrial sector, as do our global competitiveness, innovation and research.

<p class="contents">Many companies in the EU are dependent on EU funding and incentives, which is why access to credit must be guaranteed and improved.

I agree with the initiators of this motion for a resolution that the scheme needs to be as coherent as possible during the 2014-2020 financing period. I support the initiators’ idea of asking the Commission to encourage Member States to carry out the necessary reforms.

Only a brave decision in favour of grass-roots democracy, based on employment reforms that make work more attractive and on payslip federalism that takes account of the different costs of living in each region of Europe – against which both wages and pensions would be readjusted – would constitute a real change of direction towards renewal. I would point out the central role of SMEs in all of this. There are large numbers of them in Europe, which means that they create jobs and sustainability. Lowering the cost of work by reducing taxes, and giving our small enterprises the chance to carry on working and investing in the region are essential moves to ensure equalisation of contributions for the older generations and a future of certainty and quality of life for the new ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to draw attention to the fact that an increasingly capital- and risk-sensitive banking sector is asking for more collateral and higher risk premiums, both requirements resulting in insufficient financing and missed business and employment opportunities in this very large sector of the economy. Given this, I believe that the availability of credit and loan guarantee schemes are crucial to exploiting the growth and job potential offered by SMEs. There is a need therefore to leverage existing programmes at national and EU levels. It is very important to continue to implement guarantee instruments in the framework of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), the Risk-Sharing and Financing Facility under the Seventh Framework Programme and the Structural Funds (JEREMIE). Their proper implementation is currently being hindered by overly complex administrative procedures, therefore the Commission should make it easier to use the Structural Funds in connection with SME finance instruments, particularly to finance revolving funds for guarantee schemes, whilst avoiding the creation of structures which duplicate existing schemes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission should also push for the removal of barriers to the development of European venture capital and bond markets, and should expand risk-sharing facilities for investments in equity. There is a related need to increase awareness of the risks of many national taxation and support systems, which provide strong incentives for debt financing and disincentives for equity financing. I think that the complexity of EU financial regulations and guidelines for European financial instruments is a serious problem, in particular when European funds and programmes are used to support individual enterprises through the provision of relatively small amounts of funding. The expense in terms of time and money involved in complying with these regulations is out of all proportion to the benefits for the final recipient of the funding. The fragmented nature of programmes supporting SMEs is also problematic. The Commission should establish greater coherence between the CIP, FP7 and JEREMIE programmes and create a one-stop shop where SMEs would be able to obtain clear and comprehensive information about how to make use of these instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their importance to national economies and their growth potential for the labour market is undeniable. Portugal is an example of this: approximately 300 000 SMEs represent more than 99% of the total number of companies, and these are directly responsible for more than 2 million jobs and have a combined turnover of some EUR 170 billion. As a result of the recent economic crisis, the financing capacity of these SMEs, which was already limited, became significantly worse, specifically because of even more restrictive credit conditions imposed by the banking sector. The functioning of SME finance schemes therefore becomes all the more essential, specifically through a greater Union budget allocation for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme of the Structural Funds and the Seventh Framework Programme. It is also important to progressively correct market failures and remove administrative barriers. The right measures should be taken at the right time so that the national economies of the Member States can achieve their potential for growth and contribute to the growth of the labour market; this will enable the Member States to develop, which will result in social cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A review of support tools is also appropriate in the context of an economic crisis that has had a particularly virulent effect on SMEs, as eloquently documented by the loss of 3 250 000 jobs between 2009 and 2010 alone (more than a third of the new jobs that this sector had created). In this context, I consider it important to stress the cooperation between the European Commission and the European Bank, giving particular support to investments that are able to maximise the effectiveness of SME finance programmes. In particular, it is necessary to ensure the continuity of credit through action on liquidity and capital requirements and new initiatives in three strategic areas to boost the competitiveness of companies in a phase that is still difficult but certainly more development-oriented: internationalisation, innovation and growth in size. With its directive against late payment by public authorities, Europe has already sent out an important signal to support SMEs, and it is right to continue in this direction if it wishes to stimulate economic growth in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The participation and active role of SMEs are imperative for the advancement of the competitiveness of the single market. Following the financial crisis, it has become evident that the European financial markets are currently unable to provide SMEs with adequate finance mechanisms. Innovative and growth-oriented small businesses need to raise equity capital from external sources, because they either do not have their own financial resources or cannot access bank credit facilities. A more business-conducive environment for micro and craft enterprises should be supported through the promotion of high-quality support services, better legal and fiscal measures, and social protection for new entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="contents">More adequate and sustainable financial instruments should guarantee that SMEs have better access to capital. The Commission should redouble its efforts to remove red tape from existing EU support schemes and facilitate cross-border banking, by removing all existing obstacles to the usage of competing clearing and settlement systems and by applying common rules on trading. The Commission should conduct a comparative analysis of what is actually being made available to SMEs in the equity investment market and what their actual needs are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The government is conducting the well-planned and calculated liquidation of SMEs in Latgale by closing access to information about stabilisation funds, and by increasing taxes and the number of controlling and repressively fiscal bodies. All this leads to the elimination of the tax base, and as a result Latvia is on the edge of bankruptcy today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the proposal aiming to create better conditions for start-ups and innovative enterprises to have access to private equity. We must make every effort to ensure that existing financing facilities are effectively implemented both at national and EU levels, simplifying administrative procedures and making it easier to use the Structural Funds. It is very important for the Member States to implement fundamental reforms in SME taxation and support systems. There also needs to be increased funding from the EU budget for innovative financial instruments, with more funding being allocated to the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme. Furthermore, administrative obstacles must be reduced for SMEs, streamlining management in connection with innovative financial instruments, coordinating SME financing programmes and creating a one-stop shop. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is planned that approximately 70% of EU funds for entrepreneurs will be disbursed using the loan funds.

According to the experts, assistance provided in the form of a preferential loan or guarantee is better in the long term than non-reimbursable aid. Entrepreneurs benefit less from preferential loans. However, many more companies can benefit from these loans, and the money lending system, once supplied with money, should theoretically work indefinitely.</p>

I would also stress that it is the Member States that are mainly responsible for pensions. However, the European Union can add value by providing coordination between the various schemes and by sharing best practices, since it also has competence in the area of pension portability and supervising institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORP Directive).</p>
<p class="contents">I am only voting for this report because of the compromise based on more than 450 amendments, which include some of the main concerns regarding the White Paper. I would also caution that a decent and sustainable pensions system can only be achieved by combating an economy with jobs that are precarious, low paid and of a poor quality.

Europe is ageing and due to the worsening of the demographic situation and the declining birth rate, the number of people of retirement age is constantly rising. The importance of social security and pension funds is therefore undoubtedly increasing, particularly given the current economic crisis. People have to feel safe in their old age, and this can only be achieved with stable, well functioning pension systems. There are currently 100 different pension systems in the European Union. Due to major differences across the Member States, EU citizens feel unequal. People who have worked hard all their lives, particularly in the new EU Member States, receive different sized pensions compared to citizens in the old EU Member States. This makes them feel like second-class citizens. Undoubtedly, the regulation of pension systems is a Member State issue, but it is clear that there needs to be more European Union coordination in this area. The EU must care for those who need help most: the disabled, the unemployed and people of retirement age. In the interests of the welfare of its citizens and through the Member States, the European Union must try to level out pension systems. This would undoubtedly contribute to improving people’s living standards and the EU’s economic growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Pension systems come under Member States’ remit, with different rules about the retirement age and the money spent on social security. The financial crisis has led to a rise in unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, as well as to an increase in budget deficits and to problems relating to the funding of pensions. This has highlighted the fragility of certain financing schemes. The predominance of temporary jobs has reduced the level of contributions to pension systems, thereby adversely affecting their stability. The European Parliament’s report and the European Commission’s Green Paper seek to maintain pension systems which are adapted to citizens’ needs without questioning the states’ authority and suggesting that a single model would suit all.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that solidarity between states and generations is an important factor in EU policies’ success. There is coordination at EU level of aspects of the pension systems relating to the operation of the internal market, such as compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact and the EU 2020 Strategy. I voted for this report which encourages the efforts of Member States to meet the expectations of their citizens in terms of an adequate, sustainable and safe pension system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The financial crisis has led to a growth in unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, and has demonstrated the fragility of certain pension fund systems. There are rising budget deficits in many Member States and problems in the financing of pensions.

The percentage of people who are retired is rising. In an effort to keep pensions at a sustainable level, the Member States have no choice but to reform their pension systems. This is directly linked to the sustainability of public finances and the rules for a healthy eurozone, the Stability and Growth Pact. I wholeheartedly support rapporteur Oomen-Ruijten when she highlights the importance of pension build-up via the employer (what is known as the second pillar) and individual pension build-up (the third pillar). Unfortunately, we can no longer assume that the state pension (the first pillar) will be enough to sustain the level of lifestyle which workers have worked to achieve. The aspect of subsidiarity requires further elaboration. At the eurozone level, we need agreements by which Member States will guarantee that the reform of their pension systems will translate into sustainable public finances. Which choices are made as part of that process should, in my view, remain a matter for Member States alone. Questions such as women’s participation in the labour market should be a matter for <span class="italic">their</span> social and labour market policy.

The financial and economic crisis, combined with demographic changes, has had an impact on pension systems. Because of higher unemployment, slower growth, smaller returns on investments and larger public deficits, it is more difficult for pension systems to provide adequate pensions. In particular, young people with a high level of education are entering the labour market later, and so they do not work long enough to claim a pension when they reach the legal retirement age.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be borne in mind that inadequate pensions may lead to a decline in consumption and, because of reduced demand, to economic instability in a country.

Although setting the retirement age and the size of pensions is the responsibility of the Member States themselves, the European Parliament and the Commission are proposing measures that would help to overcome the threats to pension systems. Furthermore, a certain amount of coordination of the reforms of national pension systems is unavoidable as we establish the internal market and implement the Europe 2020 Strategy. It is unfortunate that the Commission’s Green Paper scarcely pays any attention to gender equality. Women have atypical contracts more often than men, or take precarious jobs, and therefore they earn less on average. Furthermore, women interrupt their careers more often due to motherhood and to care for children and elderly or disabled family members, and they therefore lose insurance guarantees and ultimately receive smaller pensions. It should be recognised that there is no such thing as a perfect pension system. Economic and financial capabilities vary across the Member States, therefore more attention needs to be paid to the means of improving pension systems, such as timing the start of working life, ‘flexible’ assessment of retirement age, better reconciliation of work and family life, and the general criteria for setting a minimum pension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Raising the pension age is one of the relevant solutions when discussing the fact that states are no longer going to have a working population of sufficient size to pay for the pensions of those who have left the labour market.

These measures therefore prompt a drive to modernise and coordinate national policies on the adjustment of pension systems, sustainability, balance between the duration of working life and pensions, greater transparency of pension systems and protection of solvency. I agree, in particular, with the attention paid by the rapporteur to female workers, who are often discriminated against with regard to male workers where pensions are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with the need to prolong workers’ careers through a modern employment policy and improvement of working conditions, and I agree with the need to make pension systems and the information provided to citizens more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very concerned, however, about the serious impact that the measures called for in this document may have on the Member States’ coffers, many of which are already under great pressure as a result of the tough economic crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The goal of a 75% employment rate laid down in the Europe 2020 Strategy should help secure the sustainability of pension systems, as it is linked with higher levels of employment, greater productivity and economic growth. The holistic approach adopted by the Green Paper intends to impart fresh impetus, both at national and EU level, with the objective of establishing pension systems that are robust, suitable for the long-term, sustainable and safe. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are one of the main sources of employment in the EU and make a significant contribution to the sustainability and adequacy of pension systems in Member States.

The text makes provision for an increase in the retirement age of European workers and for retirement ages to be linked to life expectancy. European workers, having paid to rescue the banks and been subjected to exhausting austerity measures, are again being forced to pay for the consequences of the crisis, a crisis which they did not cause, by working longer years for a smaller pension. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left moved an alternative resolution, which was, unfortunately, not accepted, against the Green Paper on pensions and highlighted the potential for improving pensions and retirement ages for the benefit of the workers. This can be done without increasing the age limit, through increased labour rights, especially for young people, better pay and, at the same time, higher taxation on financial capital and financial transactions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This strategy must take into consideration the current economic and demographic situation, but also the completion of the internal market. We must therefore not forget that freedom of movement within Europe is a fundamental right of European citizens, which entails the mobility of individuals and namely of workers who must be able to benefit from an effective and efficient labour market, as well as from the guarantee that they will have access to a sustainable, secure and adequate income after retirement.

In truth, the proximity of the reversal of the age pyramid – as a result of demographic changes caused by the population’s increased longevity – is threatening the financial sustainability of the pension schemes. On the one hand, the number of unemployed is increasing; on the other, more funds are being expended on pension payments. Moreover, young people are entering the labour market increasingly later, and so are not taking part in the contributory system. Since we do not want ‘old age’ to become synonymous with poverty, we must create a guaranteed minimum pension that grants quality of life to the elderly. Such a measure will help to eradicate poverty and enable older people to live in dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">All these problems are reflected in the European Commission’s Green Paper on pensions. What is now needed is a series of policies coordinated at EU level.

The majority of the Members of the European Parliament, including those of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, therefore took the side of the antisocial policies that the Commission and Council are implementing, so legitimising the neoliberal path that they are following and wish to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing so, they have forgotten the workers in various European Union countries who have been struggling against the rise in the legal retirement age, fighting to safeguard a caring and universal social security system; a system that values the smaller pensions, and respects the elderly, enabling them to live in dignity, whilst contributing to the eradication of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">As the alternative resolution that we tabled says, it is possible to improve pensions without increasing the legal retirement age, provided that there are more jobs with rights, particularly for young people, better salaries and more taxation of financial transactions. For example, recent studies show that a general tax of 0.1% on financial transactions in European Union Member States could provide an increase in annual revenue of around 2.1% of gross domestic product, or almost EUR 262 billion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How can we believe, in your ultraliberal and internationalist Europe, that such harmonisation can be anything other than an encouragement to take out individual insurance with private companies? A potential market of hundreds of billions of euros. At the same time, pensions paid under the first pillar – public, compulsory and pay-as-you-go pensions – will be whittled away as a result of the Stability and Growth Pact, and tomorrow as a result of Mrs Merkel’s pact. The occupational pension funds that one would like to see developed are still pension funds, and we know what part they played in the global financial meltdown. We also know what they are good for during a financial crisis: ruining savers. One cannot but worry about the pathetic prudential regulations to which they are subject, even in Europe. The social security system as a whole, and the pension system in particular, is the responsibility of the Member States alone. The problem that needs to be resolved is not just financial, it is demographic, too.

<p class="contents">However, I welcome this proposal above all because it provides for more efficient pension provision that is to be both sustainable and safe. I am firmly convinced that pension provision should not only enable older EU citizens to live in dignity, but it should also be a reward for their working life as a whole. If we want the European citizens of tomorrow to be motivated in their work and to be open to cross-border activities, it is important, even today, to offer them the prospect of adequate and sustainable retirement pension provision, harmonised at European level. Nonetheless, the responsibility for pension provision remains with the Member States, meaning that pension systems primarily fall within the competence of the Member States and therefore the only thing that should be provided by Europe is coordinated guidance for Member States.</p>

There are major disparities between pension systems in Europe, and new Member States and their citizens face extra problems because it is so desirable to establish a diversified pension system (with several pillars), in order to spread risks. The financial and economic crisis has shown that no pension system is immune to such events but that large budget deficits, high unemployment and very limited scope for increasing the burden of taxation and other levies particularly hit pay-as-you-go systems, and some Member States, such as Lithuania, even had to take drastic measures, that is, reduce pensions, which in my opinion is intolerable and unacceptable. The Member States must make every possible effort and preclude such reduction measures, which are painful for the poorest people.

However, we can describe it as a good starting point, since it provides an overview of the pension system enlarged to 27 States. The establishment of a European pensions platform could be a perfect opportunity to open a debate between the EU Institutions and social partners concerned.

I believe that pensions should be secure and stable, especially nowadays in the context of an ageing European population and the financial crisis. Current statistics provide a clear signal that the problem is getting worse and that demographic changes in Europe are unequivocal. Experts have shown that at present in the EU four people are working to support one pensioner, but in about 50 years’ time there will only be two.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear therefore that further work on the pension system is needed and further reforms are essential. This is why we must strive for increased international activity by the Member States to ensure that the coordination of pension systems will be effective and efficient. In addition, in accepting the report, the European Parliament is stating clearly that there can be no room for discrimination on the grounds of age or gender, which is particularly significant in the context of the social debate on equality of men and women in the workplace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every country is having to grapple with the demographic changes and the associated lack of financial viability of its pension systems. Private pensions, which were to provide additional support, have not brought the much talked about relief to the pension systems but have instead placed state pensions under even more pressure. Against this background, the people in Hungary, for example, have almost been forced to go back to the state system. In this regard, the unfulfillable promises of returns by pension funds are also problematic, as revealed during the course of the economic and financial crisis. Interference like that at EU level often brings with it a whole series of problems, for example in connection with the compensatory allowance for pensions, which opened the floodgates to abuse.

What we actually need, in particular, is a more family-friendly policy in the Member States – I am thinking for example of the introduction of family tax splitting into income tax law. The contribution of families to safeguarding the intergenerational contract should be taken into account in social legislation by means of a gradual reduction in social insurance contributions.

The legislative framework is certainly complex, but the European Commission White Paper on pension systems already indicates which way the Union is heading. The report specifically aims to establish adequate, sustainable and safe criteria, calling on Member States to debate the subject, to publicise the proposals formulated and to work together to produce a true joint plan through the Open Method of Coordination. We are discussing the economic governance package at EU level in order to reform the Stability and Growth Pact and to establish common rules. No State can get away from pension reform if it wishes to put its finances in order.

In fact, although this falls under the jurisdiction of the Member States, the pension system is directly linked to the financial market, as well as being one of the areas covered by the Stability and Growth Pact. It is becoming necessary, for demographic reasons of which we are all aware, to consider a strategy that increases cohesion and coherence on pensions. We must create initiatives which redefine the future of young and old, and solidarity between generations and people, thus contributing to a sustainable, secure and adequate income after retirement. There are marked differences between the various pension schemes in Europe, but it is important to create a common platform by clearly defining the division of responsibilities. In this way, it will be possible to create a sustainable and safe system together; a modern system which recognises freedom of movement in Europe, which is based on the assumption that mobility is essential, particularly for the younger generations and, of course, for an effective and efficient labour market. For all these reasons, I voted in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Providing EU citizens with an adequate, sustainable pension, now and in the future, is a priority for the European Union.

Member States must improve the adequacy of pensions by combating gender discrimination on the labour market, especially through a 10% reduction in the pay gap by 2020. The public pension system must be strengthened to the detriment of the private system. We must not privatise the public pension system simply to ensure the stability of pension funds for current and future pensioners.</p>

Although European competences are limited in this regard, it was also important or the European Parliament to give its opinion as a follow-up to the Green Paper issued by the Commission. That has been done with the adoption of the very comprehensive Oomen-Ruijten report, which confirms the need to reform pension systems due to the unfavourable trend in the ratio of the number of people aged over 65 to the working population. Moreover, the resolution is in line with the recent Eurobarometer survey, showing the wisdom and maturity of European citizens, 73% of whom take the view ‘that they will have to work longer or save more for their old age’. The predominant idea of prolonging working life beyond the age of 65 has, admittedly, met with mixed reactions among the general public. However, this may be a blessing in disguise, as other levers will necessarily have to be activated. In the case of my country, Belgium, alone, where the rate of employment among older workers is one of the lowest in the European Union, there is an urgent need to encourage Belgian workers to remain longer in the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, it goes without saying that a steady income is a safeguard against poverty. I am also pleased with the recognition of pension rights for women and a greater emphasis on gender equality, along with the recognition that discrimination against older people in the labour market should not be allowed. The resolution also pays due attention to the transferability of accrued pension entitlements. No one these days works for the same company, or even in their own country, for their whole life.

It is intended to form the basic element of the new anti-grassroots EU Competitiveness Pact designed to demolish European social security systems and replace them with private, individualised insurance, a new cash cow being milked at the workers’ expense for the benefit of capital. In practice, public spending on social security, pensions and welfare is being abolished. The three pillar system reduces the State pension to a poorhouse benefit, thereby throwing the gates wide open to the so-called third pillar of private insurance. There are calls for an increase in the retirement age, depending on life expectancy; in other words, work to the grave. The Greek Communist Party voted against the EU’s abortive anti-labour paper on European pension systems. Faced with these developments, we would point out that the workers urgently need to rise up <span class="italic">en masse</span> and stop these new anti-insurance measures and the new savage attack being organised by capital and the bourgeois governments in the new EU Competitiveness Pact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Life for pensioners in my country is not the easiest. Recently it has become even harder − last year Lithuanian pensioners’ monthly pension was reduced by 5%. The time has come to stop applying double standards. In some European countries, such as Lithuania, the government maintains that the crisis is over and that the economy is gradually beginning to recover. However, when we need to take practical measures, our leaders state that they cannot find the required resources to return pensions to their former level. Suddenly they declare that the crisis is not yet over. In reforming our pension systems financial sustainability is important, but so too is providing an adequate income. Genuine sustainability cannot be achieved without ensuring that pensions are adequate. Ageing society and financial pressures show that our labour market is changing. It is necessary to take this into account when reforming pension systems. A balance between flexibility and security on the labour market supports the adaptability of the economy and thus contributes to sustainable, secure and fair pensions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Various Member States are considering arrangements to shrink their national debts by tying pension funds to their debts. Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy have already directly mentioned the centralisation of pensions in their plans for a single, centrally-ruled Europe. I am against any regulation of pensions at a European level. Pension systems are structured differently in the various Member States. They are almost incomparable. In addition, the pension systems in the various individual Member States vary considerably, in terms of size, reliability and supervision. I do not want to see the robust Dutch pension system suffer because of the chaos in some other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">What I do find sensible, however, is that Member States should share information about their pension systems with each other and that they should make efforts to address specific problems by that means. I refer here, for example, to university researchers who move to other Member States, whose tax authorities then collect additional levies on the pensions they have built up elsewhere. An immediate halt should be put to such excesses, but that does not mean that we need to revamp the entire system on a European model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The inclusion of private debt in any assessment of sustainability of public finances should not be included in this report, as current market conditions would not support this kind of assessment. Furthermore, applying capital requirements to pensions could potentially drive up costs without adding security for employer-funded occupational pensions.

Indeed, respect for fundamental rights, the situation of refugees and the privatisation of the shipping sector are the most advanced chapters. I would also like to welcome at this point the implementation of the peace agreement and everything that this entails. Cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is crucial to the successful conclusion of the negotiations. I hope in the future that the Croatian authorities will allow investigators to have access to the necessary documents. One of the issues mentioned in the document is war crime trials. Those who have been brought to justice are either not convicted or receive token punishments. I wish to stress the importance of administering a fair justice system for any candidate country.</p>
<p class="contents">The legacy of conflict in the 1990s and a lack of respect for minorities’ rights are unacceptable from a future Member State. Legislative intervention is desired in this area. The Hungarian Presidency’s intention to complete the negotiations by the end of the first six months in 2011 is commendable and Croatia can potentially cross the finishing line on time. Its accession will send out a positive signal in the region, reaffirming the EU’s credibility with regard to the conditionality of this process.

Further development of its infrastructure could provide enormous potential to the country. With this in mind, its cooperation with the European Union on the implementation of sections of the TEN-T, TEN-E and e-TEN, which also affect Croatian territory and could be developed into a PPP system in full cooperation with the EU, is proving very fruitful.

However, the percentage of women occupying positions of business leadership remains low and gender wage differences persist. I call for further active promotion of the participation of women in economic and political decision-making bodies, and for swift implementation of the Gender Equality Law, including the principle of equal pay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Croatia is in a privileged location: it is a transport corridor of great importance for the import and export markets of the East and Far East.

In 2010, negotiators for the EU and Croatia closed 11 chapters, achieving a total of 28 (from the required 35). Last year’s achievement emphatically shows Croatia’s determination to continue with its reforms and will soon allow its citizens to benefit from EU membership. During the last meeting of EU and Croatian ministers which took place on 22 December 2010 in Brussels, the negotiators closed three important chapters, namely those concerning justice, freedom and security, foreign, security and defence policy, and the environment. The closure of these chapters indicates that Croatia’s legal system has been strengthened and that progress has been made in several areas simultaneously, such as wider cooperation between Croatia and the international community concerning military missions and civil affairs (“foreign, security and defence policy), and the guarantee of better air and water quality for the population of Croatia (environment).</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations on the accession of Croatia to the European Union began in October 2005. In spite of some logistical problems, Croatia’s accession is strongly supported by EU Member States and many of them expect a rapid progress towards the closure of the seven remaining chapters by the end of 2011. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome these measures, but Zagreb needs to demonstrate convincingly that it has left behind its widespread culture of corruption and impunity.

Solving problems of this type requires a huge effort not only from the authorities, but also from society. One cannot change the situation of sexual or ethnic minorities without exerting some influence on the citizens’ outlook. However, as the example of new Member States has shown, belonging to the European Union gradually helps to foster acceptance of persons of foreign descent or differing sexual orientation.</p>

I welcome the Croatian Government’s efforts to combat various forms of corruption and the reforms of the public administration, and the judiciary being implemented. However, in order to properly implement the principles of the rule of law and gain citizens’ confidence in the judiciary, the number of unresolved cases must be significantly reduced and the length of court procedures shortened. Furthermore, we must ensure that war crimes trials are unbiased and impartial. I agree with the proposal that greater attention must be paid to the safety of the Danube power plants due to be built. Furthermore, the Croatian Government urgently has to address the structural weaknesses of the economy and devote greater attention to regional cooperation, in order to tackle bilateral issues with neighbouring countries.

<p class="contents">Regarding corruption, although I acknowledge the commitment of the Croatian Government, which is evident for example in the trials involving two former ministers and a former prime minister, this is nevertheless a phenomenon that continues to be a serious and widespread problem. Judicial system reforms must also continue, notably by continuing the prosecution of war crimes and improving witness protection programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest challenge, however, could be that of explaining the benefits of EU membership to a somewhat sceptical population. Indeed, a recent Eurobarometer survey indicated that the majority of Croatian citizens believe that EU membership would not benefit the country, which is a concern. I therefore call on the government and civil society to work to ensure that the Croatians see the European project as being theirs as well.

I am pleased with the progress of the negotiations, but I want to see action before then. I do not want us to regret Croatia’s accession later: let Bulgaria’s and Romania’s accession be a hard lesson to us. On paper, combating corruption is clearly one of the priorities of the Croatian Government, but we have seen very few corruption cases actually come to court. The vast majority of cases remain stuck at the investigation stage. This is remarkably often the case where senior officials are under investigation. I want to see Zagreb take action. After all, Croatia will receive some EUR 4 billion euros after it joins the EU. We must be able to trust the Croatian politicians who will be responsible for spending that money.</p>
<p class="contents">We must learn from our experience with Bulgaria and Romania. These countries joined the EU too quickly and, as a result, European money has found its way into all the wrong kinds of pockets.

Reforms which began in previous years have contributed significantly to the development of many areas of life. It is particularly heartening to see increased cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague and also progress achieved in the field of women’s rights and protection of ethnic minorities. Regional initiatives, such as an understanding between Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia for a joint railway undertaking are indications of a desire for peaceful cooperation, and contribute to increased economic development in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union Member States should continue to support Croatia’s reform programme, paying particular attention to its most pressing problems, namely corruption, high levels of unemployment and the difficult situation the fragmented agricultural sector finds itself in.

Dear Minister Martonyi, President-in-Office, dear Chairs, rapporteurs, today we are considering legal matters: the very important signing into law of a very important piece of European legislation. It is important because we are giving another check to balance the powers of our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation on the European Citizens’ initiative, which has been adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure, aims at providing our citizens with the same political initiative that the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament already enjoy. One million signatures are needed – only 0.2% of our citizens – to invite the European Commission to act in matters that concern them directly. It allows them to be heard. I will indeed establish a direct link between the citizens and the Union’s institutions, bridging the gap between them, between all of us in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament and the Council worked hard to achieve a rapid adoption of this citizen-friendly regulation at first reading. I would like to thank all those who contributed to this success: the various Presidencies – in particular the Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies –, the Commission and the Members of this House. I would like to give particular thanks to the Chairs of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) and the Committee on Petitions (PETI), Carlo Casini and Erminia Mazzoni. I will ask you to come forward for the signing of the procedure. The four rapporteurs, Alain Lamassoure, Zita Gurmai, Diana Wallis and Gerald Häfner – I hope you are present and we can go through the procedure together – as well as the many other Members involved as shadow rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">You can be proud of the work done for our citizens. With the Council we shall now sign this act into law but, before that, I will ask our guest, who will often be present in the European Parliament this half-year, Minister Martonyi, to say a few words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was a common goal which we all shared, and that was to enhance the democratic functioning of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One way of doing that has just been found, and that is to foster the participation of the citizens themselves in the democratic life of the Union. That is how, and that is why, the right of the citizens’ initiative was included in the Treaty, and now citizens can approach the European Commission directly and invite it to submit a proposal for a legislative act of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that this is a milestone on the path towards more democracy in the Union. It is also the first element of direct democracy. It establishes direct contact and dialogue between the institutions and citizens and encourages cross-border direct dialogue and cooperation. It also encourages a sense of ownership: Europe is not them – Europe is us, and Europe will develop as we shape it ourselves, all of us together. Yes, our motto, ‘A strong Europe with a human touch’ depends upon all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve these goals and to implement the Treaty, clear, simple and user-friendly rules of procedure had to be established. This has now been done and was the result of the good cooperation between all the institutions – the Commission, the Council and first and foremost, the European Parliament. I would like to extend my special thanks to Mr Maroš Šefčovič of the Commission; I would like to express my thanks to the Spanish and the Belgian Presidencies, both of them members of our trio; and very special thanks and congratulations also have to be extended to the European Parliament, to all those who were involved in this extremely important job: the chairs of the committees, and also the rapporteurs Alain Lamassoure, Zita Gurmai, Diana Wallis and Gerald Häfner, and all the other Members who participated in this extremely important work.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a demonstration of the excellent cooperation and understanding not only between the European institutions, but also among the different political families or groups. I can only express my hope that this cooperation and this understanding will have set a model for the future, both for the institutions and for the political groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For a second time in three years, the issue is on the agenda. Once again, rising food prices are causing social unrest and political instability in several countries. Families in the poorest regions of the world are in difficulty. Moreover, the Food and Agriculture Organisation tells us that the outlook is not good, with prices set to rise further this year as a result of adverse climatic conditions. This is a pressing issue. It was discussed between Agriculture Ministers and WTO Director-General Lamy in Berlin on 22 January 2011, and once again in the Agriculture Council on 24 January this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for this latest rise in prices are complex and are a mixture of structural and temporary factors. On the demand side, we have more people to feed than ever before. On the supply side, droughts and floods have played their part in wrecking harvests, input costs have risen and this has all been compounded by financial speculation in the commodity markets.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can the European Union do to address this problem? We need to get our internal policies right, we need to improve global governance in this area and we need to make a real contribution to the most vulnerable. Now is not the time for complacency, but we did make some important progress in all three aspects as a result of the last food prices crisis. The Council, along with Parliament, is engaged in an intensive debate on the future development of the common agricultural policy. This is highly relevant with regard to global food security. Recent Council debates put food security at the centre of the discussion, asking the question how best to ensure that agricultural production in the EU will be both economically viable and environmentally sustainable in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also say that we have read with great interest Parliament’s resolution on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security, based on the report by the honourable Member, Daciana Sârbu. There are ongoing discussions in the Council concerning the Commission’s Communication of 18 November 2010 on the future of the CAP, and the Hungarian Presidency plans to adopt Council conclusions at the Council meeting of 17 March.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the discussions concerning the legislative proposals scheduled to come out in the second semester of 2011 will lead to concrete progress. We have made important progress towards a more coordinated and long-term international response to world food security. We are a long way from reaching the Millennium Development Goal to halve the world’s hungry people by 2015. Hunger and food insecurity remain a reality for a billion people, but one of the UN’s recent achievements, following much work by the EU, has been the creation of the global partnership for agriculture, food security and nutrition. This is being implemented by the revitalised Committee on World Food Security in the FAO.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has also been spearheading the renewal and modernisation of the Food Aid Convention in order to better contribute to world food security and to improve the ability of the international community to deliver food assistance to the most vulnerable populations. This is the way forward in order to enhance global governance in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">From a food security perspective, I would like to remind you of the Commission’s Communication on humanitarian food assistance, adopted at the end of March 2010, and the subsequent Council Conclusions in mid-May 2010, thus outlining a new policy framework for EU humanitarian action to strengthen efforts to tackle food insecurity in humanitarian crises. The Commission’s Communication on assisting developing countries in addressing food security challenges, also adopted last year, called at the same time for a new common food security policy framework, further strengthening EU leadership in the global food security agenda and improving the effectiveness of EU assistance. To this end, the Commission and Member States are jointly developing an implementation plan to translate this policy framework into concrete actions on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also mention the EU’s EUR 1 billion food facility, which was agreed by Parliament and the Council. We are in the third year of operation of this instrument which helps farmers in the developing world to increase agricultural production capacity. This is a tangible sign of our determination to bring real assistance to the most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Decisions are about to commence on the future orientation of the EU development policy based on the Green Paper on EU development policy in support of inclusive growth and sustainable development. With the Green Paper process, the Commission takes the initiative of attributing priority to economic growth generation, agriculture and food security in development cooperation in order to achieve inclusive and sustainable development in developing countries on the grounds of pro-poor solutions. Given the rising food prices and rapid population growth, enhancing developing countries’ own food production capacities is of paramount importance.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the new impetus given by the G20 Seoul summit to the WTO Doha development agenda. The EU would give full backing to a deal which would make a significant contribution to providing stability by getting rid of export subsidies and prohibiting export restrictions. The latter only serve to exacerbate price volatility and have exactly the opposite effect of the one desired.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now come back to the issue of financial speculation. The extent to which it contributes to price volatility is unclear, but there is a good reason to enhance transparency on the commodity markets. The French Presidency of the G20 has identified this as a priority for the coming year. The Hungarian Presidency of the EU is ready to work shoulder to shoulder with the French Presidency of the G20 to achieve concrete results. The Hungarian Presidency is fully committed to working with you towards a first reading agreement on the Commission proposal on over-the-counter derivatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The world’s poor and hungry deserve an adequate and lasting response to their worries about rising food prices. The European Union has been at the forefront in efforts to tackle the issue since the first crisis three years ago, but more needs to be done. The Council remains fully committed to a collective and coherent response, both at EU and international level. I am sure we can count on your support in all our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dacian Cioloş, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold">− </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me this opportunity to make a statement on behalf of the Commission on rising food prices. It was at my request that this issue was debated at the Agriculture Council of 24 January. I therefore also welcome the opportunity given to me to have this dialogue with the European Parliament on a subject of such vital importance.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, I would like to address two topics, which I think are interconnected: firstly, the situation on the world’s agricultural markets, where prices have been rising for several weeks, and, secondly, the G20 process on issues of food security and the volatility of agricultural prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us begin with the situation on the world’s agricultural markets. Different reports produced by several international institutions, including that of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), on rising agricultural and food prices have once again placed the world on alert. Are we in the process of reliving the same rise in prices as in 2007-2008? Although prices, particularly grain prices, have risen sharply since the summer, and also more recently, we do not seem to have reached the price levels of 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation around the world as regards common wheat is tight, but there is not a problem with market supply. Current harvests in the southern hemisphere are larger than expected. Nonetheless, to facilitate the end of the marketing years for the European Union market, we are thinking of suspending customs duties for imports under the tariff quotas for common wheat of low and average quality and for feed barley in the belief that this is one of the measures that could help to ease the market a little at European level. It should be noted that the forecasts for global common wheat stocks at the end of the 2010-2011 marketing year are higher than in 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">As for sugar, the prices are once again at record highs with, for white sugar, a price close to EUR 625 per tonne in mid-January. The increase in prices follows two years of a global deficit resulting from low production. The production of the current marketing year was recently revised downwards in certain countries, including Australia. However, according to the latest forecasts, the world sugar balance should be in balance for the period 2010-2011.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is a lesson to be drawn from all this. While markets may be tight, there has certainly been an over-reaction at the level of prices given what the physical fundamentals tell us. Food security and the underlying issue of the volatility of agricultural prices are clearly global issues, which must be dealt with at a global level, and I am glad that the issue of food security and volatility is one of the priorities set by the G20 in Seoul. This is a major challenge for the Commission as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development I have already, and repeatedly, expressed my commitment in this area, in Berlin at the end of January for example, with my counterparts in the various countries involved in the G20, but also recently, within the United Nations, with the Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, during a recent visit to New York.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also remember that the issue of food security is clearly stated as being one of the challenges of the common agricultural policy (CAP) in the Commission Communication on ‘The CAP towards 2020’. It is a crucial issue both for the European Union and the world’s poorest countries, which is why I am working closely with Commissioner Piebalgs on these issues in order to also adapt the EU’s development policy to this issue of food security better.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I would like to share with you my thoughts on these issues, in particular on four areas: transparency, stocks, volatility management options and the role for trade. We hear that volatility is aggravated by a lack of transparency both for the physical markets and derivatives markets. For the agricultural markets there are sources of data on production, consumption, trade and stocks. International organisations, national services and specialised organisations, such as the International Grains Council, produce detailed data on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, certain data can be improved, especially data concerning stocks, on which there is a lack of information, in particular on the worldwide distribution of stocks. The G20 leaders meeting in Seoul also asked the competent international organisations to improve information on stocks and production forecasts. Improving the relevance of these data is a prerequisite for improving the transparency of the markets. We also need to examine the issue of a forum for discussion at a global level among key market makers, both exporters and importers, so that crises are not simply noted when they occur. That is why these three issues are linked: we must first have the information, then be able to process these data, and, finally, have a forum, at international level, where the situation noted can be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has published several communications on the price of agricultural products and foodstuffs. In its most recent communication, the Commission launched actions to improve transparency along the entire food chain, and I am cooperating with European Commission Vice-President Antonio Tajani to move this key issue forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Proposals have also been announced to improve the transparency and supervision of products derived from agricultural commodities. As volatility increases, it is important that futures markets continue to fulfil their risk hedging and price discovery role. We therefore need a balanced and rigorous approach, and I welcome the work carried out by Commissioner Barnier in this area and am fully in favour of his work also covering the specific issue of agricultural raw materials.</p>
<p class="contents">On 2 February the Commission published a new, more global, communication on the commodities market and the financial markets that are derived from it. This constitutes a contribution to the discussions conducted within the G20 both on the volatility of commodity prices and on the supervision of derivative markets. We want to contribute, together with our G20 partners and more broadly, to more effective regulation of derivative markets in the interest of producers and users alike.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I think that we need to work as a matter of priority in the coming months – until the summer I think – on the following issues: first, the availability and transparency of information relating to private and public stocks as well as to production and consumption; second, the collection, processing and dissemination of this information; the security mechanism for countries facing a situation of food tension; the role and organisation of food aid at international level and in the European Union; the improvement of international governance, for example through mechanisms for institutional dialogue between key countries; the levels of investment in sustainable agricultural production and research not only in the European Union but also in the poorest countries. The priority to be assigned to agriculture in development policies is also an issue to be addressed, especially as the Commission is preparing to adapt and reform development policy. I think that, in this context, the European Union should have a far greater presence, not only with food aid but, above all, by providing support to countries in the south to enable them to develop their own local production capacities in a sustainable manner.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union we need to look more seriously – and I have every intention of doing so – into identifying market mechanisms that would enable us to prevent catastrophes in certain sectors as a result of temporary squeezes on the income levels of producers and input costs. I am thinking in particular of livestock breeding.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn, finally, to the role of trade. We believe that trade can contribute to global food security as it enables available food to be distributed around the world. Export restrictions have only strengthened the spiralling increase in prices to the detriment of already fragile countries. However, trade policy concerning foodstuffs should be connected to other policies relating to food at the international level if we want a coherent approach on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I can assure you that I am closely monitoring trends in food prices and I want to work in the future in consultation with you, here, in Parliament, and with the Council, on this issue, so as to come forward with concrete proposals, first and foremost with the reform of the common agricultural policy, but also with other, more specific, instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those of us in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who are in the Chamber today are more accustomed to debating agricultural matters at midnight. I am delighted that when agriculture suddenly becomes food, we debate this very important issue in the middle of the day when people can hear. I think we should remember this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me say very clearly that the disconnect between agriculture and food is part of the problem that we are debating here today. The realities of agriculture and the low farm incomes in both Europe and the developing world are central to this debate and, lest we also forget, one of the crucial problems – and the Commission identified it in its position paper – is that rising commodity prices and rising food prices do not translate into higher farm incomes. The real problem is that the costs of producing food are rising faster, and this is a treadmill on which farmers cannot continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge for us as policy-makers is how to increase food production in a sustainable way, how to produce more from less, how to manage our stocks and how to deal with the issue of stock dislocation that the Commissioner has identified. Global stocks are no longer the key figure; we need to know where the stocks are and to realise that they will not come out of China or India.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do – and I think this has started to happen since my report during the last Parliamentary term – is to put agriculture and food centre stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by saying this: we need to be cautious as to how we reform our agriculture policy. We must maintain and increase food production within the European Union as part of our contribution to global food security. And yes, let me endorse your point about agriculture in the developing world: it has been neglected for far too long. It is now high time that our policies assisted that agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The issue we are addressing is rising food prices and the consequences that may have for a certain number of populations around the globe, as well as in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first like to make the following observation. The trend towards ever higher agricultural and commodities prices is, in my view, a long-term trend, which will continue for three main reasons: first, world demographic trends and a rising world population; second, the fact that, with global warming, we are experiencing problematic weather hazards such as drought and floods; third, because the world is also developing. With new emerging economies consumption levels are increasing. Therefore, the tight situation on agricultural markets and agricultural commodities is a trend that is on the increase. It is aggravated by price volatility, and price volatility is a consequence of the financialisation of the global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we should be addressing if we want to resolve the agricultural issue and the food issue. To do this – what the Commissioner said is important – there are two elements: yes, there needs to be transparency on stocks, but we also need a public policy on stocks in Europe and stock management at a global level, especially at the level of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regulation of the financial markets and market speculation is essential, in particular by ensuring that there is no longer any connection between the speculative volume and the physical quantities exchanged on the markets. As regards food, it is unacceptable that speculators speculate without taking account of the consequences this may have for world food and humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to draw two major conclusions. Firstly, we need a strong European policy and to strategically reassert Europe’s commitment to being a global player in the food and agricultural sectors. Secondly, we need to change our development policy to ensure that globally – and Europe is a global player – we once again invest in agriculture, because we need agriculture to feed the world.</p>

I very much welcome that. One of the reasons is that the massive volatility that we are witnessing today in food prices has at long last acted as a wake-up call to politicians across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last 30 years, we have all become complacent as food prices declined year after year after year in real terms. Food has never been cheaper than it has been in the last few years. We have come to expect our supermarket shelves to be overloaded and groaning with food 24 hours a day. Too much food was thought to be the problem. That dominated the debate up until 2007, rather than the problem being too little.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent price spikes are a turning point, a sign that the days of plenty may be drawing to a close. Our current agricultural production model has been based on cheap energy, an abundance of land and plentiful supplies of water. That model cannot meet the challenges we face in the future. A rising population to 9 billion, growing demand from developing countries and the impact of climate change. As Professor John Beddington, the UK’s Chief Scientific Officer, recently predicted, unless we take action we face a perfect storm of scarce energy supplies, scarcity of water and food shortages.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to act now and build a new agricultural model. Europe needs to take the lead and the reform of the common agricultural policy gives us the opportunity to map out a sustainable food production system that can meet that huge demand in world food supplies that is going to be needed in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are only at 3% of the 2008 level. The fall in production in certain traditionally exporting areas due to climate change, the diversion of cereals to biofuel production and the financial speculation accentuating the price rises are responsible for this situation, as evidenced by the reports of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the French authorities, and as also indicated by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of this new food crisis are exacting a heavy toll on the 1.2 billion people in the world who live on less than USD 1.5 a day. Since October, 44 million more people have joined those who live below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="contents">Just two days before the meeting of the G20, what is Europe waiting for before it takes measures similar to those voted in favour of by the United States? Since 13 January 2011, the US administration has demanded the limitation and the transparency of the positions taken by the financial funds on the agricultural commodities markets. This is a first step towards countering the appetites of the speculators.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact is also dramatic for European farmers. They are no longer able to feed their animals. Hundreds of farms have gone bankrupt. Five years ago, wheat was worth EUR 100 per tonne; today it is traded at close to EUR 300. This is a whole new ball game.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is demanding that farmers adapt to market signals. It would do well, today, to follow its own advice. Faced with this crisis, the European Union cannot wait until 2014 to find solutions. The crisis must be confronted and I propose three concrete actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly the immediate creation, in the relevant countries, of cereal stocks to be made available to farmers at a subsidised price. Secondly, the indexation of meat prices paid to farmers to fodder prices. Thirdly, for 2011, a mechanism for transferring part of the aid directed at supporting cereals towards livestock farming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have seen that in recent days.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to take us back a little bit. I have been a Member of this Parliament since 1989. When I came to Europe in 1989, we did not have a food problem. We had beef mountains, we had butter mountains, we had milk lakes and we had cereal mountains. Now they are all gone and we are not producing enough food fast enough to feed ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">So where has the food gone and why have we only a small supply? When a drought in any part of the world can actually cause total confusion in the whole market for everyone else, this is not a situation that we can allow to continue.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a situation in the European Union where farmers are leaving the industry hand over fist in every Member State. In actual fact, what we are doing is to encourage them to go even faster, and we have no young farmers coming into the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">We must act before it is too late to reverse the trend in rising global food prices. This action must be taken sooner rather than later to alleviate the pressure that has been put on ordinary people.</p>
<p class="contents">Shelter for ordinary people can be constructed through a strong common agricultural policy which ensures high-quality food at reasonable prices without negative impacts on the environment. A strong pillar of direct payments is vital for the world and to meet food demands. Further steps can be taken to solidify this in the future, which is much needed as far as investment and, indeed, research and development is concerned. Hopefully we can find a way to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem as I see it is that everyone comes here to these debates and makes all the right statements, says all the right platitudes, but they are not prepared to take the tough decisions necessary to help those most in need.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that talking is no longer enough: it is action we need on global stocks and volatility in the market, and until you start to tackle that problem, you will not solve the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me that the drama of the hunger riots of 2008 has still made too little impression on the minds and hearts of those with political and economic power and also of those who are unscrupulously speculating on the agricultural commodities markets. The number of starving people worldwide has once again risen above a billion, and it is the poorest people in the world who are most affected by the price rises on the food markets. They have to spend more than 80% of their money each day on food.</p>
<p class="contents">The global promises of 2009 to provide more than USD 20 billion in agricultural aid to the developing countries, including USD 6 billion via the World Bank, for the fight against hunger have not been honoured. So far only USD 925 million has been paid. Speculations on the agricultural commodities markets no longer concern foodstuffs but are now almost exclusively concerned with financial market activities and transactions, which have a direct effect on food prices. I am therefore pleased that the Commission is now starting to abandon its reticence towards this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the speculation in relation to price developments has not become more transparent, nor has it been controlled or restricted. However, that is crucial if we are to be able to act effectively here and to bring about changes. I therefore call on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to give the fight against hunger top priority in all policies, agendas and strategies and also to consider new methods and new approaches, such as food sovereignty, so that ultimately those who work the land have more creative power and influence over the supply of food to their own people in their regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

British farmers producing beef, sheep meat, pig meat and eggs have actually seen a drop in the value of their produce over the last year; poultry meat is unchanged and milk only marginally higher; sugar beet will fall next year.</p>
<p class="contents">These businesses are facing huge cost increases themselves and cannot sustain the status quo for more than a few months. Then they will either succeed in claiming higher prices from the retailers or they will cease production. Either way, retail food prices can only go higher.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the EU doing about this? Well, it is making it unnecessarily expensive to import non-GM soya beans. It is charging farmers a global warming levy on their electricity bills, whilst those same farmers have lost thousands of tons of sugar beet and potatoes in the ground due to very cold weather. The EU wants to increase the public subsidy to organic farming rather than allowing this sector to be consumer-led. Any switching of conventional production systems to organic will lead to a reduction in food supplies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, the agricultural industry which has been dealing with this for some time, as well as rising feed prices and rising fertiliser prices. Profit margins have been reduced and many farmers, especially those in the intensive sectors, face financial ruin.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Parliament today to consider the consequences if we did not have support for farmers from the common agricultural policy. What would we be paying for food in that financial climate? I would also urge Parliament to consider very strong support for the common agricultural policy in the very important debates that are coming up.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that we have a policy that will support farmers and ensure adequate food supply at a fair price. I would also say that fairness is absolutely essential, and in fairness we need transparency within the food supply chain.

<p class="contents">I believe that, with regard to speculation, moderation is required. It is clear that there is a definite link between certain financial activities and increased volatility and prices for raw materials. However, looking at the entire issue solely in terms of financial speculation would certainly be a mistake, since part of what we call speculation is actually the legitimate hedging of prices on the part of producers and, as we are well aware, these producers could not do without this hedging possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a situation must be avoided in which direct investment in commodities has a harmful impact on price volatility because of its massive scale or its purely speculative nature.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the proposals made by Commissioner Barnier on financial matters, in particular the regulation of short selling and derivatives, and also the revision that is going to come from the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), must give Parliament the opportunity to take account of aspects of commodities speculation in financial regulation and supervision, which will be put in place to ensure that those markets are also regulated in an effective yet pragmatic manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you said that these efforts should continue, and I believe that Parliament which, in a financial crisis, has complied with and, sometimes, anticipated what the Commission proposed, will live up to its responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I welcome the declaration of the Hungarian Presidency indicating that Europe would support the French Presidency of the G20, which has made the regulation of the commodities markets one of its priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a real risk of a global food crisis. That is not my phrase: it came from the government of one of the founding Member States of the European Union. The signs are worrying. The prices of some essential food products such as cereals do not stop rising and even hit record levels in January, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation. The problem is obviously not European and, as has already been highlighted here today, the contribution of each of the hypothetical causes explaining the phenomenon is very far from being known</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the Commission is not ignoring the issue, and its communication of 2 February is a document that deserves to be read closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the specific nature of agricultural production deserves particular attention in the context of the common agricultural policy (CAP), by dedicating proper risk-analysis instruments to development cooperation policy, and by backing food production to the detriment of other forms of international aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to welcome France’s stance in the G20 here, influencing the regulation of the financial markets and the combating of price manipulation, as well as establishing rules that could prevent the sudden interruption of trade flows, as happened with Russia recently, for example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is worth remembering there have been food riots on every continent but ours over the last year, and we are seeing governments fall on a virtually daily basis, it seems, across the rest of the world, while we have at least been able to provide a degree of a safe haven for our citizens so far.</p>

I do not believe that global food security is something that we can achieve or should strive for.

All commodities market analysts agree that there are two main factors behind the rise in food commodity prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the large-scale printing of new money in the USA and the European Union in recent months. This influx of new money into the markets is pushing the price of food and other commodities upwards. It is not speculators that are to blame here, as the report under discussion today asserts, but rather the misguided policies of American, European and other central banks.</p>
<p class="contents">The second factor pushing up food prices is the EU and US policy of forcing consumers to make ever greater use of biofuels. The commitments that the EU and the US have assumed in this area have led to a sharp increase in the amount of non-food commodities grown on agricultural land. As a result, less and less agricultural land is used for food production, and it is therefore only logical that food prices increase. If we want to succeed in lowering global food prices, we must abandon this absurd policy on biofuels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This phenomenon, of rising food prices, is felt by consumers in Hungary and other European countries alike. Those who do not feel it are farmers and, in particular, smallholders. How is this possible? Where does the money go? This puzzle, this mystery is solved, among others, by point (d) of the excellent motion for a resolution submitted by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, but the whole motion for a resolution is in itself excellent and I must congratulate them on it. It also offers detailed answers and solutions. Point (d) draws attention to the phenomenon of speculation. It states that there has been an increase in speculation by purely financial institutions, that is, the commodity market speculation of money capital, which is causing an artificial inflation of commodity prices. We therefore partially have the solution. The money goes to the speculators, and to the purchasers and traders whose hunger for profits often knows no bounds.</p>
<p class="contents">How proud the Hungarian people would be if the Hungarian Presidency treated the resolution of this issue, that of food speculation, as a priority. I must ask the attending representative of the Hungarian Presidency whether we can by any chance count on this, and I ask Mr Cioloş, EU Commissioner for Agriculture, what solution he envisages to food-related speculations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This underlines the dreadful consequences for those suffering countries. We must respond and we must continue responding until they stand on their own feet.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 2008 this Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of my report on the EUR 1 billion food facility to provide financial aid to developing countries in light of soaring food prices at that time. The purpose of this facility was to respond to those soaring prices, the causes of which were mainly, though not exclusively, droughts in grain-producing countries and rising oil prices. The situation remains extremely volatile, affecting producers and consumers in both the EU and developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must learn how to cooperate with other countries such as Thailand. In the region, Thailand is a major producer of food, yet when some of its neighbours like Burma and Vietnam were in poverty and running out of food, we did not accept Thailand’s offer to cooperate with us and act as our agent in the region. We have to learn how to do that. We must ensure a quick transition to stability in North Africa. We must ensure that aid is delivered to regions hit by unforeseen natural disasters such as Haiti and Pakistan, and in this regard we must continue to mobilise the reserve for emergency aid, allowing the EU to respond promptly to specific aid needs arising from such events. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Just last year, when the developing countries rose up in what was called the ‘food riots’, Europe simply proposed emergency response measures, that is, to send seedlings and fertilisers, as though the problem were cyclical, when we have long been warning of structural problems. We have a common agricultural policy (CAP) that lacks effective regulatory mechanisms because the liberal majority still believes that nothing must restrict the market. There is widespread, economically destabilising and morally unacceptable speculation on agricultural products of developing countries that are prisoners of single-crop farming for export, with a Europe that does not support them and allocates only 4% of its development aid to the agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">With this resolution, Parliament as a whole finally acknowledges that the right to food is a basic human right, that it is unacceptable that the hunger of some is exploited for the benefit of others, that regulation is indispensable in ensuring price stability, and that trade agreements must preserve small family farms and the right to food.</p>

Food prices have now risen sharply, which has made the situation even worse for many people.</p>
<p class="contents">A package of measures is needed to tackle the multiple causes of the price rise. In this regard, it is important to prevent price speculation and to establish stocks. In so doing, the dominant position on the market of some food corporations and chain stores must also be examined. The developing countries also need greater support from us to develop their agriculture. That is the only way we will succeed in providing food for the poorest people and improve their economic situation.</p>

Now, the United Nations FAO has warned that rising energy costs, growing world population, greater wealth and climate change are about to present huge challenges to the world food system and to the cost of food.</p>
<p class="contents">This will have two important consequences on European governments. First, the rising cost of food and energy hits the very poorest families hardest. Second, at a time when Europeans most need a period of price stability while the economy recovers, rising food prices will fuel inflation. In the short term, the temptation will be to import cheaper food and to expect the food and farming industry to absorb the greater cost.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither route would be wise. Over-reliance on imported food would dangerously expose consumers to price volatility, and over-pressuring the farming sector, which already faces steep cost increases and depressed margins, would endanger productive capacity.</p>

The first concerns the need to plan medium- and long-term actions. In this sense, answers must come from the new common agricultural policy, which must ensure food security for European citizens, provide consumers with food at affordable prices and protect farmers’ incomes. With the new CAP we must give – and this is what we are in fact doing – strong support to farm incomes under the first pillar and support measures for rural development, increasing investment in agriculture and food security.</p>
<p class="contents">The second response is the need to intervene with emergency measures to protect the weakest link in the chain, because when food prices fluctuate, the effects are actually quite strange: when prices rise, producers and farmers do not derive any benefit, but when prices fall, producers see their profits and their already meagre earnings decrease. It is clear then that there are problems in the supply chain and a lack of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, these serious problems in the supply chain include, for example, abuse of dominant purchasing power, unfair contractual practices – including late payments – unilateral changes to contracts, advance payments for access to negotiations and uneven distribution of profit margins along the food supply chain.</p>

The record increase in the prices of cereals, sugar and vegetable oils is a clear sign of the increasing imbalance between global supply and demand.</p>
<p class="contents">A further – sadly possible – rise in prices would have dramatic consequences particularly for those parts of the world where food expenditure accounts for more than 40% of per capita income. It also poses a real risk of creating tensions throughout the entire planet in an increasingly interdependent world economy. The European Union must therefore have a clear awareness that agricultural policies – the common agricultural policy for the European Union and the Farm Bill for the United States – have a role of extraordinary and strategic importance to play in the world order, a role that goes far beyond the legitimate protection of farmers’ incomes.</p>

<p class="contents">In the wake of deregulation of the financial markets, futures trading on the commodity exchanges changed from a hedging tool to a tool for speculative transactions. The most important exchanges are located outside Europe.</p>

I must also stress that, in most cases, the rise in food prices does not result either in an increase in farmers’ incomes.

The article was about the fight for bread. I think that there will hardly be a topic that will occupy us as much during this and the forthcoming decades as the question of the availability of food. It is therefore good that we are talking about it as the reason for that – namely increasing demand – will not be going away and so prices will also continue to rise. We must now give political attention to this whole situation. We must consider how we can produce food and make it available. Commissioner, the idea of proposing further set-aside areas within the framework of the common agricultural policy by means of screening is the wrong approach. We need to make the land that we have productive.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not view all of this in too negative a light. For years we have complained that food prices are too low. If we consider, for example, whether EUR 100 for a tonne of wheat really is an appropriate price then we have to say perhaps not. If we consider what proportion of the price of the final product, for instance bread, is represented by the price of the raw materials then I think that the increase in the prices of the raw materials is not the only reason for rising food prices; other factors are also involved. Thus, this whole issue is also an opportunity for agriculture to put itself in a better position for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The statistic is that, whenever food prices increase by 1%, 16 million people around the world are plunged into dire poverty. The observation is that, it is impossible to prevent volatility, especially on agricultural markets, extreme volatility is not inevitable and it can be combated, however difficult this may be.</p>
<p class="contents">The three courses of action, which have already been mentioned, are: firstly, to give priority, in development policy, to subsistence farming and regional food markets; secondly, the need for a public regulation policy, including through stock-piling and stock management; thirdly, an outright ban on speculation on basic food products.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must be there, at the forefront, especially at the level of the G20. What I have heard from János Martonyi, Commissioner Cioloş and, in other places, from Commissioner Barnier, is to be welcomed.

For us farmers, commodity futures trading is a basic component of the buying and selling of harvested crops. It provides an important opportunity to achieve planning certainty through the early setting of prices and quantities.</p>
<p class="contents">In contrast to the situation in our prosperous industrialised nations, rising food prices are a particular problem in the poor regions of the world where people have to spend a large proportion of their income on food.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not intervene in the markets every time the prices change in an attempt to combat natural fluctuations. However, without internationally applicable framework legislation for the financial markets, we cannot even start to think about regulating the commodities markets, because if there is too much money in the financial market it will find suitable equivalents, and commodities are currently highly regarded. Therefore, we should not be surprised if agricultural commodities are now also a sought-after trading objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current food price increases can be blamed partly on the poor harvest. If something is in short supply, the price of that item naturally rises on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the issue is that the shortage of certain agricultural products, Commissioner, may to a large extent be ascribed to the misguided agricultural policy of the European Commission, which has long discriminated against the new Member States and their famers through its subsidy policy. Do not be surprised, Commissioner, if farmers who cannot get prices for their products that will at least cover production costs simply do not sow the crop or break up their herds. They are waiting patiently until hungry and rightly annoyed citizens direct their anger against those officials in Brussels who have long failed to resolve the general and widely recognised problems of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">You know, Commissioner, the shortage of agricultural products in the new Member States is not caused by poor harvests but by the fact that it no longer pays our farmers to produce under your subsidy and pricing policy. They are waiting, however. When they are given the same subsidies as their counterparts in France, they will definitely start planting crops. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, however, a permanent concern of the Commission and the European institutions, since we are lucky enough to have a common agricultural policy, which needs adapting, but which is an important tool in enabling us to manage these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that this debate has also shown us that our stability now increasingly depends on international balances and world stability. This must be incorporated, even when we talk about our common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is also clear that rising food prices is a worrying trend which, in addition to the issue of volatility and the considerable variation in prices, makes the problem we have to solve even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that, if there is a need for greater production on the market, there is a need for investment in agriculture. However, for farmers to be able to invest, they need, above all else, stable incomes to give them the courage to take this step.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, in the medium and long term, our common agricultural policy must be conceived with this in mind. It must offer a minimum of stability and encourage investment so that our farmers can produce and supply our markets.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also emerged in the course of the debate that it is necessary to ensure that our common agricultural policy and the agricultural policies of developed countries are also in step with the development of agriculture in the southern countries and that our policy to support cooperation and development with the southern countries is in step with the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, our common agricultural policy must guarantee the sustainable development of agriculture. It may be necessary to review the instruments at our disposal for managing these extreme market situations, while allowing the market to play its role without, however, being deprived of the necessary instruments to enable us to act and to avoid being caught unprepared for crisis situations. The common agricultural policy still has work to do on this point in the months and years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of speculation, and hence of volatility, needs to be addressed, and I am not speaking euphemistically. The Commission has already set out proposals, which it intends to follow up, to deal with this situation. On this point, therefore, we are not talking simply of wishes but of concrete proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also consider the role that the European Union has to play on the international scene with regard to the food problem. This issue cannot be stabilised in the European Union if it is not stable at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">It may also be necessary to review our role in agricultural policy and in development policy and the way in which we address the food issue through different policies: trade policy, development policy, and financial policy. Perhaps here too we need concerted action.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also taken account of the need to act in the short term in certain sectors, and I am thinking in particular of the animal sector which, it is clear, is going through a difficult period as a result of strong pressure from all sides, low prices for producers, who are not benefiting from rising prices, and also high prices of inputs. I have taken note of this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also noted the various proposals and suggestions that you have put forward. As regards the balance of aid between the crop sector and the animal sector, for example, the Member States already have the possibility to act on the decisions taken in 2008 in the health check of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of stocks, it is an issue that must be analysed once again and reviewed since, with high prices, it is now impossible to speak of intervention stocks. However, it may be necessary to decide what role such stocks can play and how they could influence the proper functioning of the markets. I think that these are questions we must ask ourselves before we put forward proposals to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say to Jaroslav Paška that differences in payment between Member States do not necessarily come from the Commission. It is a decision taken by the Council, and by the agriculture ministers. The final decision always comes from the regulation proposed by the Commission, but these are regulations of the Council and, now, of the Council and of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to make clear that no subsidy is given to agricultural production for biofuels in the European Union. Therefore, it is not the common agricultural policy that is stimulating the production of biofuels. Nor is it the intention of the Commission to set land aside. Something quite different is involved but, in any event, land is not going to be set aside in a situation where we actually need to produce.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the various points I wished to add in response to the issues raised. I also thank you for this fruitful debate and I hope that today’s debate will still be fresh in people’s minds in a few months’ time when we will discuss the resources to be allocated to the common agricultural policy, a policy that is a basic instrument in addressing food security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the high level of political attention afforded by Parliament to this issue provides a helping hand to the Presidency to fulfil its agenda with regard to the rising food prices.</p>
<p class="contents">As has also been highlighted in this debate, due to the extent and depth of this issue, it requires multifaceted cooperation and complex solutions across various areas such as agriculture, regulation of financial products and services as well as development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to biofuel production, I would just like to repeat that the EU is fully aware that the unsustainable production of biofuels can have negative effects, notably mass deforestation and food shortages. That is why the EU is committed to stepping up the development of second-generation biofuels made of non-food crops. The EU has also abolished the perverse financial incentives for biofuel production at the expense of food production.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the deep structural global roots of the problem, Europe needs to play a leading role in tackling food prices and food security at global level. This is already taking place through a number of international organisations and programmes such as FAO and the World Food Programme, as well as through more general forums such as the G20.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to add that, on a personal level, this debate has reinforced my long-standing conviction that, to tackle global challenges, such as hunger in the world, volatility of food and raw material prices, turbulence on the financial markets, regulation of financial products and services, there is a need for much more global governance and more global rule-making.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, based upon its unique experiences with governance and rule-making, does have a very special mission and responsibility here. It is for this reason that we believe that Europe and the European Union have to take a leading role in combating all these challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hungarian Presidency is pleased to note that it can count on Parliament to maintain the work being made by the EU, both in terms of policy and of efforts at international level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Immediate and sustained action must be taken to guarantee the food security of the citizens of the EU and the planet as a whole. It is essential to develop sustainable agriculture in developing countries and to allocate an appropriate share of EU development aid to the agricultural sector. The spectacular reduction in the level of development aid allocated to agriculture since the 1980s is regrettable, and it is to be hoped that recognition of this need will reverse this trend. The European Commission really must give priority to agriculture in its development aid, particularly aid to allow farmers to gain access to markets and aid to small and medium-sized family farms. Humanitarian food aid must respond to the needs, challenges and structural limitations of developing countries, with account being taken of production, distribution and local transport as well as the trading capacities of these countries, in order to help lay the foundations of their long-term food security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, these price rises are not a short-term phenomenon, but seem to be developing into a long-term trend. This is compounded by a growing demand for food, notably for cereals, poor harvests in recent years and low stocks, and also unfortunately financial operations and a weakening dollar. All this is causing chaos on the markets. From our point of view the social consequences are more significant. The populations of many countries are growing exponentially, and they are permanently malnourished and hungry. Their despair creates a source of increasing political tension.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot observe these events passively. We need international cooperation under the auspices of the UN and the European Union. Countries that are members of the G-20 should effectively counteract speculation in agricultural products. We should look again at the regulation of agricultural markets in Europe so as not to artificially restrict potential growth. There should be no speculation in global hunger as the effect of this speculation will be that many innocent people will die of hunger, especially in the poorest nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

World grain consumption increased to 41 million tonnes between 2005 and 2010 compared to 21 million tonnes between 1990 and 2004. According to various analysts, a substantial food crisis in 2011 is a reality; it would take just a single failed crop. The biggest exporting countries Russia, Ukraine, China and Mexico have already been forced to import in order to ensure their supply. The reasons for the increase in prices are vague, and one can no longer talk about the trends of the agricultural produce market. Recent price increases have been dramatic and unpredictable as a result of various speculations. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the growing use of biofuel is increasingly reducing the share of grain used for animal and human consumption. This has caused a very tense situation where we need to realise that increasing food prices lead to a growth in inflation, feed protectionism and cause unrest, all of which could lead to social, economic and political instability in Europe as well as globally. Europe, as one of the biggest importers of food products, has a great influence on global food prices, but that equally makes it vulnerable to various price shocks. I support the endeavours of the European Commission to accept a new legislative package by spring 2011 which would give the Commission greater authority to regulate markets and prevent speculation. The European Union must find means to ensure sustainable prices and a sustainable economy. A balance needs to be established between security and openness as well as development. We must be ready to face a potential crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

French President Nicolas Sarkozy raised a very pertinent question a couple of weeks ago: If money markets are regulated, why aren’t commodity markets? We must take action against speculation far more effectively at both EU and global level. The main cause of the food price shock has been the tremendous fluctuation in supply. Only 10–20% of cereals change hands on the global market, and yet a reduction in production can result in a state of panic. Based on forecasts of diminishing supplies, importers drive up prices.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not fair towards either the producers or the consumers that internal prices, too, are determined by export prices, since at least 80% of production is used where it has been produced. Russia, in its former position as an exporter, and currently as an importer, has been a fundamental influence on the European cereal and oil seed market. The supply shock is further exacerbated by speculation on the futures markets, resulting in a food price shock. The main problem is therefore not caused by a physical lack of food, but by food prices the poor can no longer afford. This results in foodstuffs remaining in storage instead of being sold at equitable prices. High prices have a debilitating effect on consumers, in particular those in the poor strata of society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, much more than short-term remedies, what is needed is the courage to establish a new architecture that reconciles the need to increase food production by 70% in the next 40 years with the increasingly limited natural resources. Therefore, what is done or not done in Africa, in Asia, in the Americas or in Europe affects everyone, everywhere, with consequences for availability, for access and for food prices. This is severely affecting the poor, as well as producers of meat and milk. That is why the response must be global and goes far beyond the field of agricultural policy: it is essential to invoke a set of other policies, without which we will not truly be achieving the necessary solutions. At global level, these solutions include advocating food as a right, supporting the countries’ abilities to feed themselves, supporting farmers and ensuring their fair access to value in the food chain, limiting financial speculation, protecting access to land, and creating food reserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should therefore remember that when we discuss the price of food, in fact we are talking about fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The reform of the European Union’s common agricultural policy is taking place at the same time as a rise in global market prices for food. If we are to respond to these changes in a sustainable way, based on human rights, we will need a comprehensive outlook and policy. The price of food and food price trends are affected by several critical issues in global agriculture, such as climate change, energy policy, and the availability of natural resources and how efficiently they are used. The European Union should be a pioneer for a new way of thinking about agriculture. We need a food policy in which whole elements of the entire food production chain are assessed critically and its effects on health and the environment are taken into account. A more natural and resource­efficient food policy needs to be supported and guided by means of both economic and policy measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Speculation on food prices should furthermore be restricted. Michel Barnier, Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, has proposed new measures to curb speculation on basic commodities in the derivatives market. Barnier has the right idea. The dramatic fluctuations in the price of food are harming farmers, consumers and even entire national economies. Commitments made in the derivatives market must be made more transparent and subject to greater monitoring, and, if necessary, restrictions on trading using the price of food should be introduced. The creation of a sustainable food policy is at present one of the most important issues for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only does an increase in food prices threaten the lowest income groups, but it also reveals much deeper and more serious problems that will pose a major threat in the future. Global food production is threatened by a number of factors, such as pests, diseases and natural disasters. These factors are currently being exacerbated by extreme weather conditions that are probably due to climate change. A good example of this would be the drought and fires in Russia in 2010, or the floods in Pakistan, and more recently in Australia. We can expect the problem of rising food prices to get worse in the future. It is pointless to discuss the causes of climate change here, because the risks are real and to doubt them is an unacceptable gamble. However, food prices are also affected by economic factors, especially abuse of the market system through government manipulation of the US dollar exchange rate and irresponsible speculation in commodity trading. Europe must realise that decisions made now will affect the future of the whole food system. In the short term, we can focus on minimising food waste, decreasing dependence on imports, reducing or stabilising demand, and establishing regulatory mechanisms on the market in order to prevent speculation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the end of the day, this is a matter of food supply, and in developing countries it is a question of the essential supply of basic foods. The European Union is called on to speed up the progress of the global fight against poverty and hunger – there are around 1.4 billion people suffering extreme poverty. Poverty is an issue within European borders, too. The only means of guaranteeing food supply in Europe is through the European common agricultural policy. The challenges faced by agriculture are huge and they encourage the tendency to produce ‘more from less’. Higher food prices will not automatically be reflected in higher incomes for farmers; the gap between producer and consumer prices is widening. The reality of price management is complex: scarce raw materials, higher production costs, high fuel prices, dependency on harvests, exports and the world market – a dense network of causes that have to be disentangled by means of targeted measures. In order to tackle these causes, measures and agreement across all policy areas are urgently needed. I call on the Commission to make fundamental progress in strengthening agricultural production in Europe and in the developing countries.

The situation in Europe is not so critical, as our citizens’ incomes are incomparably greater than those in developing countries. Nevertheless, our voters too are becoming aware of increasing food prices. According to World Bank statistics, around 44 million people in developing countries have fallen into poverty since last June, since food prices at the beginning of 2011 have reached the 2008 level, when rising food and oil prices had a significantly adverse effect on poverty throughout the world. Of course, the price of oil in the world has an effect on food prices, but we should still remember that in the summer of 2008, oil was standing at USD 140 a barrel, whereas today it costs about USD 100, which means that the rise in prices has been partly caused by speculation. In order to avoid such situations in the future, the G20 countries must develop a mechanism to prevent such a price rise and speculation in foodstuffs. In order to achieve this, we must have joint working at an international level. The problem posed by variable food prices is further proof that we need a powerful common agricultural policy that is fair and provides a level playing field for all European farmers, so that our population can obtain good-quality food of high value at acceptable prices. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, as recent experience in my country shows, by manipulating public opinion a little it is very easy to influence rising food prices. Due to resellers the price of sugar rose by more than 10% in one day in the whole of Lithuania. Therefore we cannot leave everyday foodstuffs to self-regulation. They may be considered an investment, the management of which requires specific knowledge that the growers of agricultural products (farmers) do not possess. Although the free movement of goods is one of the fundamental principles of the functioning of the EU free market, it is necessary to take more stringent measures both at Member State and EU levels, to restrict speculation in foodstuffs and defend the rights of the weaker half – consumers, small-scale farmers and traders – in relations with large processors and shopping centres. The second dimension is the close link between food products and energy sources and the interrelationship between their prices. On the one hand, in order to combat gas emissions that are driving climate change, we promote the use of biofuel (and have even set obligatory quotas for its use). On the other hand, the growing on agricultural land of plants intended for biofuel, rather than products intended for food, is precisely the thing that is driving up food prices. Thus, although combating climate change is one of our priority objectives, we must find a means of not influencing the prices of foodstuffs, for instance, only land that will never be suitable for growing agricultural products should be used for biofuel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Štefan Füle, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Madam President, it is my pleasure to be here with you today. As you are certainly aware, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission is visiting the southern Mediterranean at the moment and has asked me to address you on her behalf on the events in Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">The political reality of Egypt changed spectacularly last Friday when President Mubarak stepped down after 30 years in office. His departure has opened the way to the possible transformation of Egypt. Let me repeat this in front of this House: the European Union salutes the courage of the Egyptian people who have pursued their struggle for democratic change peacefully and with dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">A great responsibility now rests on the shoulders of the Supreme Military Council to guide Egypt towards the democratic future for which its people have striven. We have taken good note of the commitments to revise the Constitution, to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, to honour international treaties and obligations and to limit military rule to six months.</p>
<p class="contents">There are already reports on the first steps taken. The proposal for a constitutional amendment should be delivered within ten days and submitted to popular vote within two months. We will closely watch the steps that are taken and we hope they will pave the way towards democratic, free and fair elections later in the year.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union responded to the events in Egypt as soon as the public protests escalated. We repeatedly called on the Egyptian authorities to ensure an immediate transition and to respond to the democratic ambitions of the people. The High Representative contacted directly the Egyptian Vice-President Omar Suleiman when concerns of rising violence or human rights abuses arose.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union immediately expressed its readiness to lend full support to Egypt’s transition process towards democracy. The European Council asked the High Representative to develop a package of measures supporting the transformation process in Egypt and Tunisia. She was also asked, together with the Commission, to adapt European Union instruments to stimulate the transition and the country’s economic and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">We have started work on how we can best support Egypt and we are aiming at the kind of joined-up foreign policy response that the Treaty of Lisbon allows. In doing so, we are listening to all voices, including those of the Members of this House. You have a crucial contribution to make as democratically elected representatives and also as an arm of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative and I will also report on this process to the Foreign Affairs Council in a few days’ time. I would like to add at this point that High Representative Ashton has convened a special session of the Foreign Affairs Council for this Sunday.</p>
<p class="contents">In Egypt, as in Tunisia, the European Union is unequivocally supportive of the transformation process that has started. There is, however, an important difference. In the case of Tunisia, the political situation has become a little clearer. We have managed to establish a dialogue with the transitional government on the needs of the country and the possible European Union response.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative has been in close contact throughout with international leaders to discuss the challenges facing the region and to ensure a coordinated and, therefore, strong international response.</p>
<p class="contents">We will first seek to adjust our ongoing programmes to support the aspirations of the Egyptian people for reforms as and when matters clarify. The European Union already has a wide portfolio of programmes in place in Egypt and spends close to EUR 150 million a year there.</p>
<p class="contents">For several years, we have been financing projects on democratic reforms, good governance and respect for human rights. EUR 40 million were allocated to this objective in 2007-2010 and EUR 50 million are planned for 2011-2013. We also have more funds mobilised, in particular for civil society, through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. The new situation in Egypt should create the right environment to put these funds to maximum use and push forward the implementation of much more ambitious programmes than was possible in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond the existing programmes and funds, we intend to listen to the Egyptians and hear where they consider the country needs our support most. Their demands, in terms of democracy, social and economic perspectives and free, fair and inclusive elections, must be met. The European Union stands ready to support this reform process based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Egyptian authorities have already approached us with initial requests, including on dealing with suspicions of the misappropriation of public funds. We are coordinating with Member States on this and the Foreign Affairs Council is expected to address this issue. As and when other requests come, we will do our utmost to be responsive and mobilise our expertise on democratisation, elections, human rights, economic and social reforms, as well as any other issues where Egyptians may see a need.</p>
<p class="contents">However, let me be clear. It is not for us to dictate outcomes or impose solutions. The future lies firmly in the hands of the people of Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned at the beginning that the High Representative and Vice-President is travelling in the region as we speak. She was willing to visit Egypt as part of her trip and she expressed that will to her Egyptian counterparts. She has now been invited to Cairo by the Egyptian authorities and will travel there on Monday evening, after the Foreign Affairs Council. This will be an opportunity for her to listen to the Egyptians and to assess the priority needs of the country on the road to democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the Egyptian people, who have seen their legitimate expectations of greater dignity and democracy satisfied, and, secondly, the international community that, not without a certain cynicism, has gone from being the ally of yesterday to the nuisance of today and, perhaps, to the accused of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Madam President, I do not believe that we should deceive ourselves. The departure of Mr Mubarak and Mr Ben Alí are necessary conditions, but not sufficient, to guarantee the process of democratic transition, over which there still hang many uncertainties. The most important thing is: to consolidate democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, it is also evident that, although democratic freedoms and human rights can be initiated by sixteen days of protest and public spiritedness, and be proclaimed by law from morning to night, economic and social progress cannot, unfortunately, be marshalled in the same manner. We have seen this in the heavy economic losses that both Egypt and Tunisia have been suffering in recent days.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the Commissioner’s speech, I would like to say that, after the initial hesitations and some problems with the EU’s image, it appears that things are back on track. Baroness Ashton is in the region and what Mr Füle proposes makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, to firmly and wholeheartedly support the process of democratic transition and the political reforms in those countries.Secondly, to carry out a critical review of the European neighbourhood policy in a way that strengthens the democratic clause.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard today, in the Enlarged Bureau, from the Polish Foreign Minister, the next President-in-Office of the Council, and his initiative to establish a Polish foundation on the subject of democracy and human rights. This could also be extended to the entire EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the EU has mobilised large amounts of resources in its Euro-Mediterranean policy with poor results. The EU’s image has suffered in this conflict, even more than that of other international players. However, the EU’s appeal remains intact.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say, Madam President, that this is a good opportunity to underline that the EU understands, once and for all, that today history is being made in the present and in these historic times we are living through we have to act as a global player and perform the necessary duties or we will have to resign ourselves, Madam President, to not playing on the international stage in the role we want to maintain and we will have to restrict ourselves, as was the case until now, to picking up the bill for major global problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, they opted for either supporting authoritarian regimes or mechanically transferring the Western model of democracy to the Arab countries. Not only did both strategies fail, but they are responsible for the emergence of Islamic fundamentalists and the alienation of secular parts of the civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The present events in Egypt prove that Islam need not only be fundamentalist, but that it can also be democratic if we accept that democracy may have a variable geometry, and if we let it grow naturally from its specific soil. At the same time, we must admit that the popular uprising was on one hand the result of the evolution of Egyptian elites in the cyber or Internet society, and on the other hand the consequence of the existential hardships brought on by the global economic crisis. If the European Union does not immediately and consistently address the need to overcome these hardships, the revolution might move towards anarchy; and from there towards another dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must not only applaud the fact that no Israeli flags were burnt during the recent events in Egypt, but also observe that the lack of a long-due solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at the origin of the feeling of failure which upset Arab society and fuelled its neurosis. Therefore, the European Union should immediately take the initiative in order to use the transformation in Egypt – which today is a mere hope – and turn it into a real opportunity for internal democracy and regional peace.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the trips of the High Representative/Vice-President to the region, and her readiness to adapt and upgrade the necessary European instruments to cope with the challenges, are good news. Her action must be supported by all of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This intervention was absolutely necessary two weeks ago because the European Union had taken a wishy-washy attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that the situation in Egypt demands three things: first of all, the Commission has to come forward with a credible and global plan for Tunisia and for Egypt – how to strengthen civil society, what to do to fight corruption, how to help in building democratic institutions, how to create an independent justice system and how to help economic construction and development. These are questions not of millions, Commissioner, but of billions. I think you will have to come forward as fast as possible with a global plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, yesterday our group had a videoconference with Dr Ayman Nour, one of the leading opposition leaders in Egypt, and there are a number of concerns. In all this debate in Egypt on the change of the constitution, I can tell you that the secular democratic political parties are not involved for the moment and that is a message to give. Secondly, to deal with this in two months and to organise elections in two months is a non-starter, because it means that we will not have normal political parties there participating in this. Then there is the whole question of the proportional representation or an individual representation system there.</p>
<p class="contents">I sent a message to High Representative Ashton to ask that, in her contacts on Monday, she raise these three questions that are fundamental for a real democratic society in Egypt in the near future. I think that Parliament should back her in these three claims and hope that she expressed these three elements, these three concerns, in her contacts in Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Commissioner, this is not the end. We see things happening in Bahrain, in Yemen, in Algeria, in Iran, in Libya, in Morocco and in Kuwait. What we also need now is a bold message from the High Representative on what is happening in these countries; we should not wait until a number of things have happened. On these issues we also need a clear communication from the Commission, and mainly from Baroness Ashton, on what is happening in these countries, expressing our support for the masses in those countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first issue, which will not be resolved in two weeks, is that the Commission is wondering what a realpolitik means in a climate that has existed for years in the Mediterranean region and perhaps elsewhere. In other words, what kind of relationships can and should the European Union have with these dictatorships and what form should they take. For it is all rather extraordinary. Today everyone says that Mr Mubarak was a dictator. I did not hear that a month ago in the European Parliament. He was not a dictator then. So if you wish to freeze assets, do not simply freeze the assets of Mr Mubarak’s friends, but freeze those of Mr Mubarak and his family, as you did in Mr Ben Ali’s case; you did not just freeze the assets of Mr Ben Ali’s entourage.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that what we are seeing today in Egypt and Tunisia is a democratic tsunami. What did we do when a tsunami claimed scores of victims? We mobilised exceptional funds precisely to help the peoples affected. We must now mobilise exceptional funds to help the peoples of Tunisia and Egypt, because the reasons behind the revolt were primarily hunger and poverty, and if this poverty is not alleviated during the democratic transition, there is the danger that some of the protestors will join the ranks, for example, of the fundamentalists and the hardliners. We cannot delay.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Commission should offer a substantial package to Tunisia and Egypt and say that democracy is a good thing, because it also brings funding. At the same time, I do not think that a trip by Baroness Ashton is sufficient as things stand today. There must be a special envoy, because we must continue discussions with the committees. For example, in Tunisia and Egypt, the committees re-drafting the constitution do not include members of the opposition parties or women. There are only men, even though women took part in the demonstrations. We must therefore support this process, and I believe that the Commission should do as it did in the past for the East, and offer its help with any constitutional aspects needed – in other words, it must be present on a political, legal and economic level.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one last point. On the subject of this region, you are aware that discussions are currently taking place on the technical upgrading of the association agreements with Israel. I do not think that this is the right solution. I do not think that this is the right signal to send out. Israel must be protected, but the policy of everyone in that region, including the Israeli Government, must be reviewed. This is not about calling Israel into question, but rather the policy of its government. To gift Israel today with the technical upgrading of the association agreement would send out a bad signal to the entire region.</p>

For the past thirty years, the two countries have, mercifully, been at peace.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hard to overemphasise how important the Camp David accords are to Israel’s security. Israelis are really afraid that the radical Muslim Brotherhood will indeed fill the vacuum created by the Egyptian revolution. It is bad enough that Israel faces the terrorist threat of Hezbollah on the Lebanese border, the fanatics of Hamas launching rockets from Gaza and the existentialist threat from a nuclear-armed Iran. However, an Islamist takeover in Egypt would almost certainly result in the revocation of the Egypt-Israel peace treaty and the opening of the Rafah border to Hamas.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should make our help conditional on preserving the peace treaty, and not countenance supporting any political developments in Egypt that threaten the security of our strategic ally. Supporting a democratic Egypt is incredibly important for us, and the economic challenges are massive. I fully support the idea of mobilising loan finance from the EIB and EBRD, as suggested by the High Representative yesterday in the Financial Times. Our political parties and groups in Europe must also help set up secular, pluralist, democratic sister parties in Egypt to compete freely in elections in six months time, when the military will hopefully leave power.</p>

We have shifted from our necessary tutelage over the Mubarak and Ben Ali regimes –a collaborative approach which as I say was necessary– to a situation in which we are now seeking to decry these dictatorships and also seeking to have a degree of tutelage over the revolutionary process for democratic change staged by some sections of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">The revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt have something in common. The protesters are very young, the role of political organisations has been negligible –although this has not been the case with trade unions– and both revolutions are demanding a democratic welfare state, with religion completely out of the picture, which is something we should rejoice in.</p>
<p class="contents">However, our neighbourhood policy has been lacking in credibility. One cannot play a necessary collaborative role towards two dictatorships one day only to revile them the next day and seek to have tutelage over the Egyptian constitutional reforms, which will shape the future state.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Füle, we fail to understand why Article 2 of the association agreements has never been implemented. Clause 2 has never been implemented. Not in Egypt, not in Tunisia, not in Morocco, not in Israel. Never. This clause is a key element of the association agreements, yet it has never been implemented. Its terms are very clear: any countries signing association agreements with the European Union must observe international law and human rights. This key clause has never been put into practice, it has never been activated. Therefore, we do not share this philosophy whereby free trade takes precedence over human rights in the Mediterranean region.</p>

However, as Europeans standing on the outside, we should guard against such emotion and keep in view the reality of the situation. If we now generally rejoice at the bursting out of democracy in Egypt or even in Tunisia, then we are ignoring reality. The reality is that we have a military regime in Egypt, which – we hope – is only a transitional regime, and in Tunisia there is a regime that is not in a position to keep thousands or tens of thousands of people from emigrating illegally.</p>
<p class="contents">Europeans must, of course, be the friends of the peoples and the allies of freedom. However, with the future in mind we must also act accordingly in relation to regimes and dictatorships that are still firmly in place in other Arab countries. I believe that we can only do so if we are under no illusions and if we help these peoples to develop what is needed for democracy: the rule of law, a free market economy and the structures that are required for democracy to even be conceivable.</p>

In so doing, however, we must not forget to work together with civil society. We need to do that in order both to support human rights and to develop democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that we need to recognise that stability is not the only decisive factor. Real stability will only come about if we support freedom. If we do not seize the opportunity now and provide assistance to the courageous people in these countries, there is a risk that we will then find ourselves in a vacuum and unable to bring about a change – a wind of change – as we did in 1989 in Central and Eastern Europe, but instead we will see a situation like that of Iran in 1979.</p>
<p class="contents">Providing assistance now also means stability and security for us – freedom and stability go hand in hand. I am therefore thankful that, after the difficulties during the start-up phase of our new service, the External Action Service and the Commission are clearly now making progress and coming up with sensible proposals. In this regard, it is important that we not only improve and enhance our assistance from a structural point of view, but also offer – whether our offers are accepted is up to the people there – to help these countries to build democratic structures so that they are in a position to enter into a democratic contest and so that the democrats win the elections and not, at the end of the day, those people who are perhaps organised by a military regime or the Muslim Brotherhood. In this regard, we need to be more courageous and perhaps set out our programmes in a slightly more intelligent way than we have done in the past.</p>

That was the case with the American and the French revolutions, as well as the major revolution in Europe in 1989/91. It is important for us to be clear about one thing: this is and remains the Egyptian revolution. It is not a European revolution that we would be able to steer. Instead, what Baroness Ashton is doing there is right, namely to listen and not to try to dictate events there as Europe would wish.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one thing is key: there should not only be an election in Egypt in August, the Egyptians must have a genuine election. It is good that the Muslim Brotherhood has involved itself in the process to amend the constitution, has founded a party and will take part in elections. However, the secular powers must be equally involved so that the Egyptians will have a genuine election in this revolution for freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say a few words about adaptation of the instruments. That is jargon and hardly anyone understands what it means. What does it mean? Firstly, it means providing more money to enable the European Investment Bank to do something. But what else does it mean? We need a European foundation for democracy to enable us, in future, to work more efficiently, more quickly and more democratically with these civil societies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Previously, I suggested that Parliament and the Commission should send a special observation mission to Egypt, and now we should grant this delegation the power to make decisions. At stake is not only support for free elections, but also the provision of an emergency aid package, especially in view of the fact that the Egyptians themselves are appealing for financial aid for Egypt.

I believe that the rule of law alone will provide an element of stability and serve to stabilise the entire region. In other words, this is extremely important. We must organise a donor conference and, above all, we should not be scared. These revolutions are secular revolutions on the part of Tunisians and Egyptians who simply want democracy and development, which are intrinsically linked. However, we should review our neighbourhood policy and explore the issue of relations between states, but also relations between different public opinions.

It is historic, but also unexpected, as are all popular revolutions, I hear you say. However, this new situation requires us to totally rethink our vision, our policies and our relationships with these countries. Proposals have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the caution with which we have reacted to date is easily and worryingly explained by our obsession with stability, by which I mean that safety-first approach fuelled by our fears, an approach of which the sole priorities were the fight against immigration, terrorism and radical Islam, along with some economic interests, not least access to energy.</p>
<p class="contents">We accepted authoritarian regimes, when their sole aim was to confirm our fears. The people’s revolt has made the failure of our policies plain to see; we no longer have the right to go on basing our analyses on the same fears, or, worse still, the same xenophobia-tinged beliefs. That is why we must stand side by side with those who aspire to greater freedom and democracy, in places where it is possible to be Muslim, democratic and secular.

A group of lawyers has been briefed and will have 10 days to table its proposed amendments. This is very good news. The most controversial articles, in particular regarding the unlimited number of presidential terms, the restrictive conditions concerning who can stand in presidential elections, the methods for supervising elections and the limited opportunities to appeal after legislative elections, will have to be revised. The democratic transition is therefore under way. However, the revision of the constitution is not the only issue which must be tackled. Economic well-being and social cohesion are essential conditions for the emancipation of a people and the smooth running of a country. The European Union, for its part, cannot stand by and do nothing while these changes take place. Once she has welcomed the democratic transition, Baroness Ashton will have to upgrade the partnership agreements and place the rule of law, justice and human rights at the heart of her concerns.

The turmoil has taken everyone by surprise and it does not seem that any contingency plan was made for such an eventuality, which is not localised but widespread. The socio-political base provoking the changes in the Arab world is not dissimilar across those countries which are now in transition to what we hope will be a democratic environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Baroness Ashton is on record as stating that the EU has a ‘democratic calling’ to listen to people who want change – and we are witnessing a changing world because what will happen in the Arab countries will have an effect on political, social and economic issues worldwide. One particularly important issue is that of security and stability, and there is no doubt that the ‘democratic calling’ concerns countries mostly considered as being allied with others that currently have democratic political systems. At this point, it is not known where the democratic transitional process will lead or what position will be taken by the traditional democracies and especially the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title17"></a><a name="creitem17"></a>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Neelie Kroes, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, I am pleased to inform you that, when the plane was touching down this morning in Strasbourg, I got the good news that the Hungarian Prime Minister has agreed to amend the media law so that it complies with all aspects of EU law that we, the European Commission have raised, including the concerns raised regarding the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">They assure me that the amendments will be adopted by the Hungarian Government at its next session. The body language of the representatives of the Hungarian Government gives me the feeling that this is correct and that it will be tabled in the Hungarian Parliament within the coming days.</p>
<p class="contents">The four areas where the Hungarian authorities agreed to amend their law are the following.</p>
<p class="contents">Number one: balanced coverage. The amendments agreed would limit the balanced reporting requirements to broadcasting, as in other Member States, and would no longer apply those requirements to on-demand audiovisual media services or the written press. Moreover, any restrictions on broadcasters would need to respect the principle of proportionality. Of course the Commission will monitor the way that principle is translated into secondary law.</p>
<p class="contents">I mentioned four areas. The second one is the country-of-origin principle. The amendments agreed would mean that foreign broadcasters could no longer be fined for breaching the Hungarian media law’s provisions on protection of minors or incitement to hatred. Instead the Hungarian authorities could suspend transmission of such services on Hungarian territory, which is in line with the AVMS Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">What does that mean? It means that broadcasters legally established and authorised in other Member States, and compliant with the laws of those countries, would be free to broadcast to Hungary without running the risk of being subject to fines by Hungarian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Number three: media registration. The amendments agreed would mean that audiovisual media service providers would have to register only after they begin offering their services, and that is in line with the directive. It means that audiovisual media service providers and publishers would no longer be subject to prior authorisation by the Hungarian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Number four: offensive content. Additionally, the Hungarian Government agreed to amend another provision of its media law that raised concerns with respect to the freedom of expression. A provision of the media law specified very broadly that media content may not cause offence, even by implication, to individuals, minorities or majorities. The amendments agreed would limit the prohibition to discriminatory treatment. Moreover those provisions would no longer apply to media service providers established in other EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We will work closely with the Hungarian authorities to make sure that the agreed changes are now adopted into Hungarian law and applied in practice. We will continue to monitor the situation, but that is quite clear. Needless to say, the Commission is also verifying the national rules implementing the AVMS Directive in other Member States and will raise similar concerns where necessary. The Commission does not shy away from using its powers. It does not shy away from defending media freedom and pluralism when it is needed, and the present case hopefully pre-empts and proves that.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Commission acknowledges and shares the concerns that many of you and parts of civil society have about the general state of the media in Europe. I am ready to go further and take action in the matter of media pluralism within the EU competences, of course respecting subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission not only has a duty, but also a sincere interest, in facilitating the dialogue amongst stakeholders and policymakers at a European level. The changing structure of the media landscape in Europe causes concern for the future. It brings opportunities but also wider risks for media pluralism beyond the ownership use. It is quite clear that we need an approach to measuring media pluralism in a broad sense; one that will bring together legal, economic and social aspects, rather than treating them quite separately, as has often been the case up until now.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I intend to establish a multi-stakeholder group and ask them to address the challenges for the media at present and in the future, including the situation of media pluralism in Europe. Since you know that I value your input very much, the European Parliament will be represented in the group of experts, if you will accept that invitation. I will announce details quite soon. The group will be asked to advise me on the next steps to be taken concerning the media landscape and I am fully committed to taking concrete action within all the competences that I have. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We would not be in this situation if my fellow Members had listened to us when, on previous occasions – in committee meetings and discussions in this Chamber – we asked if it was possible to wait for a while, because the Hungarian Government had, after all, always proved willing to accommodate the European Commission’s views – and it would have been strange if it had been any other way, given that Hungary currently holds the Presidency of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet they resolved to go ahead anyway, perhaps – no, definitely – because of political and ideological elements, deciding that this debate should take place. Resolutions have been submitted that are due to be put to the vote tomorrow. More caution probably should have been exercised and more confidence shown in those governments elected democratically by their peoples, starting with the Hungarian Government, which was elected by such a large majority of its people that it certainly did not need to manipulate the media in order to achieve an internal consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally I think the most useful thing to do is to ask our fellow socialist and liberal MEPs, who submitted resolutions of a certain type, to withdraw them, thus stopping us from making fools of ourselves and letting Parliament get back to dealing with the real problems of European citizens. I am of course grateful to the Commissioner for her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, of course we welcome it. That was the text of our resolution; that was the pressure we were placing on you and the Hungarian authorities to deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I have to ask you about the timing. Was it purely coincidence, as you were waiting in the airport as you said, or was it the fact that pressure by this Parliament has brought forward four key amendments in the four key areas we asked for? Please let us know those concessions have been secured. Of course Parliament has still not been able to see the text of the negotiations between the Commission and the Hungarian authorities; therefore we require more time to fully state our position on the matter. However, it seems clear that negotiations have not fully addressed many other serious concerns of this Parliament and, of course, of our Socialist and Democrat Group.</p>
<p class="contents">Crucial issues still unanswered include the composition and time frame of the media authority and of the Media Council, which are politically homogenous and still exert pervasive and centralised governmental, judicial and political control on all media. We need answers on where we go on this crucial issue. Furthermore, it is regrettable that the Commission has not acted upon the recommendations of Parliament, the Council of Europe, the Commissioner, and the OSCE for example, on the violation of the principle of confidentiality of journalistic sources, extremely disproportionate sanctions, and abolishing the political and financial independence of public service broadcast media.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a list, Commissioner, which you know of, which still needs to be answered and we need these questions to be answered, preferably in this debate. Obviously we commend the Hungarian authority’s willingness to amend the legislation. We also encourage the implementation of amendments to address the outstanding areas of concern for all of us in this Parliament, whilst fully embracing the spirit of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and, in particular, Article 11, which protects the freedom of expression. We would like further answers on whether you believe Article 11 has been fulfilled. We must involve civil society and stakeholders to uphold principles of transparency and accountability and to ensure best practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we tabled a resolution for our group because we wanted the concessions that you have already announced, but we want more. Democracies are built upon the principle of a free and independent media. We make no apologies within our group for firmly defending this principle and we will do everything in our power to protect it, for Hungarians and all EU citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we, the Liberals and the Democrats, the ALDE Group in this Parliament, first raised our voice against this law, we were accused of being politically motivated. However, experience has shown that we were right and today even the Hungarian Government admits that something is very wrong with this law. Therefore several amendments are envisaged. We trust the Commission that this is indeed the Hungarian position, hoping to receive it in writing, and we will closely follow the changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the four areas requested by the Commission are only a part of a much bigger picture. Other aspects must be changed as well: the enormous control powers vested in the hands of a politically appointed person who has been heading two media control authorities for nine years, the lack of protection of journalists’ sources and the lack of effective judicial remedy, to name just a few. After all, not only our critics, but also the European Commission itself, will have to answer to the Hungarian and European civil society and journalists to say why the OSCE and the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe have also harshly criticised the aspects I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot all be politically motivated. Quite the opposite, we are motivated by a genuine interest to see that media freedom is a reality for the benefit of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Kroes, the Audiovisual Media Services Directive refers to an independent regulatory body. Yet, positions in the new Hungarian media authority and the Media Council, who have powers to impose heavy penalties on vague grounds, are being taken up exclusively by supporters of the ruling party. That is taking place in an already highly polarised political environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Why has the Commission not objected to this lack of independence? Why have you failed fully to assess the powers of the media authority and the Media Council, which, in my view, fall within the scope of European law, against the Charter of Fundamental Rights? You, Mrs Kroes, have said that the Hungarian Government has so far made four amendments. For the foreign press, for the audiovisual media, but not for domestic newspapers. You would also like to see Mr Orban and his people triumphantly waving the stamp of approval, your Brussels flag, and then continue, uninterrupted, preaching intolerance, slandering philosophers and banning gay pride. All of that, too, while Hungary is holding the presidency of the Council. You must be deeply unhappy about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving next to my fellow members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), who said in their resolution that there was nothing to be concerned about and who have accused critics of the media law of making manipulative and politically motivated comments. That is quite an accusation, and one which is also directed at the OSCE and the Human Rights Commission of the Council of Europe. It is quite an accusation, given that we know that even Mr Orban himself has, in the mean time, realised that a few amendments need to be made to his media law. This reminds me of the Stalinist days, where people were airbrushed out of photographs.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with us and the OSCE, you ought to be protecting European values, not becoming a mechanism for imposing your power at home.</p>

We all know this, which is why we should have a serious debate. Unfortunately, it seems that today’s debate cannot be described as such. It seems to be a pretext for the centre-left to attack the right-wing, conservative government of Prime Minister Orban.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that we could point to many European countries where freedom of speech is not respected. Just look at Poland’s experience. In Poland, where it could be said that the ruling party has an overall majority in every governing body, a monopoly of power, where it controls government, the Senate, the President, the National Broadcasting Authority, the body which oversees the media, and finally has control over public broadcasting and the support of the largest electronic media corporations, journalists are being thrown out of their jobs for the simple reason that they hold conservative, right-wing views. Right wing or conservative programmes have been withdrawn, such as the programme <span class="italic">Warto rozmawiać</span> directed by Mr Pospieszalski or <span class="italic">Misja specjalna</span> directed by Mr Gargas. It begs the question: where is Mr Schulz, where are you, ladies and gentlemen, when these violations are being perpetrated in Poland? Let us discuss actual violations, those that have already occurred.</p>

I wanted to draw attention to the fact that freedom of the media is a fundamental problem. If we are to address it, we should separate it from political sympathies, independently of whether we have socialist or right-wing and conservative views. In short, if journalists are dismissed only because they have left-wing views or only because they have conservative views, we should protest. For example, in Poland today, journalists are dismissed purely because they have conservative views. I would expect support and protests from Mr Schulz and from other socialist and left-wing members, because this would show that we are concerned with standards and not political point-scoring. We are concerned with protecting the freedom of the media. We protest against situations like this anywhere they may occur, even if they are taking place now, for instance, in Poland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Hungarian Government has decided to discuss concessions on some trivial details, but to make no fundamental changes to this law. The highly disproportionate and biased composition of the Media Council, the exceptionally steep fines for newspapers, and all the factors that led to censorship and self-censorship of the media are still in place. However, what is utterly disgraceful, as previous speakers have said, is that as soon as the Commission extracted the concession that foreign newspapers and publications would be exempt from the fines, everything else was forgotten about. It seems to me that the principles of post-1989 Europe, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, have been undermined.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Commission actually meant to say was that we would not abandon our fellow Europeans from any country to censorship and restrictions on freedom of expression. Apparently, the Commission has done this, but Parliament shall continue to keep an eye not only on the Hungarian Government but also on the Commission now, because it is our duty and our responsibility not to let this issue drop, as the Commission has disgracefully done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The criticisms and attacks rained down on the Hungarian Government, in conjunction with the EU Presidency, with regard to the Hungarian media law’s alleged total failure to comply with European legislation, have been reduced to what they really are: an instrumental and specious attempt that, apart from anything else, is based entirely on ideological bias, which is even more shameful when it is used against a country that today has the struggle for freedom encoded in its DNA – and this has indeed been the case throughout its history, which we all remember very well.</p>
<p class="contents">The political forces that have promoted this far from exhilarating debate are still heavily weighed down by the responsibility for what is certainly not a high level political manoeuvre.

<p class="contents">I believe that those who expressed genuine concern about the media law in Hungary were entitled to a response. What I find worrying is that this Chamber is increasingly engaging in crusades against individual Member States – that coincidentally happen to have EPP governments – before the Commission has fully investigated the matter, let alone reached its conclusions. Worse than that: in this case, this was done despite the fact that we had a clear undertaking from the Hungarian authorities at the highest level that, should the Commission raise any concerns about this law, they would be prepared to change it, as they did.</p>
<p class="contents">What exactly was the point of this debate? What is the point of the resolutions tomorrow, if not political instrumentalisation? The EPP stands firm in its commitment to respect for human rights and the rule of law, regardless of the Member State concerned. There is no question about that. However, it is not willing to single out individual Member States and condemn them summarily before the due process of law has been completed. Once it has been completed, we should respect it. When this issue first came up last month, I said that politicising this issue was not just attacking a Member State, but was also undermining the EU Presidency. Today, I feel that we have also undermined our own institution. That cannot be right.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely appeal to all groups to withdraw the resolutions that are up for vote tomorrow – not suspend them, not postpone them, but withdraw them – because there is no longer any basis for proceeding with this vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sometimes it is necessary to repeat the obvious: the free circulation of news and independent opinion is the most important safeguard of any democratic society.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason that brings us here today. The insistence with which the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, several Member States and an ample majority of the Members of this Parliament have voiced their concerns is justified by the fact that the most basic principles of our European project are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">When this law was hastily passed by Mr Orbán’s Government in Hungary, we considered that there had not been sufficient reflection during its preparation and that the law should be amended to ensure its consistency with European regulations and with the essential spirit embodied in the treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased and grateful to the Commissioner, who has stood here today and told us that the Hungarian Government is prepared to amend the law. However, the creation of an information monitoring authority, whose council would be politically controlled exclusively by members of the ruling party, runs the risk of exercising a biased, centralised political control that would inevitably lead to censorship and, even worse, self-censorship. So the question is, will this authority be reviewed?</p>
<p class="contents">We have shared with the Commission and with you, Commissioner, our concerns on the issue of information pluralism, the principle of proportionality and the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and information, enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Hungarian Government’s answers accepting the amendment of this law must be supervised to ensure that the changes implemented are sufficiently far-reaching to hold back the threat posed by these laws to our fundamental rights and values. For instance, by reviewing the monitoring authority, as I said before.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge the Commission to continue with its investigations, particularly into matters affecting fundamental rights. May I also stress, Commissioner and Council representatives, that this is not a political issue, as some people would have us believe. What is at issue here is the defence of the values of our European Union and respect for its laws.</p>

However, that is something that remains to be seen. This is not, in fact, about being left- or right-leaning; it is about freedom of the press. I cannot understand why my fellow Member from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is choosing to pursue the debate in this way. That is, I think, a touch pathetic. This is not about Hungary, either; it is about freedom of the press. I am pleased – and I will gladly acknowledge – that the Hungarian Government has answered the questions that have been put to it extremely well.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, problems still exist, and we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have also pointed that out all along. We still have the problem of a government-appointed Media Council that is to assess whether the coverage is balanced. We still have problems with regard to the fact that we have a Commission that is supposed to be the guardian of the Treaty and take a stand with regard to the problems with Hungary’s media law. Of course, I hope that the Commissioner will indeed do that. I will focus on what we are to do now and on the fact that the Commissioner has raised the question of an independent council. That is something I would like to welcome on our behalf, and I wonder if the Commissioner would perhaps give us a little more detail about what this council is to concern itself with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that changes have now been made to the Hungarian media law is primarily down to those who took action in this regard. Mr Orbán was not involved in this at the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make this very clear: the changes that have now been made are not enough. We still have a supervisory authority that for nine years has only been composed of members of Fidesz. That is not compatible with the legislation at EU level. There is still no source protection. Therefore, this really is not a democratic media law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kroes, you did not go far enough in my view. You were clearly more interested in a quiet life and in not disturbing the Hungarian Presidency than in a truly democratic media law. May I remind you that anti-communist liberal democratic intellectuals like György Konrad, Agnes Heller and Michael Woida called on the European institutions for support. We have not yet managed to provide this. I really do believe that this law really needs to be revised to make it democratic. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, immediately after the approval of the Hungarian media law, a campaign was waged by the left, which used the phrase ‘gagging law’.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, only those who have experienced communism, fascism and Nazism know what a gagging law is, while democratic states know that freedom and pluralism of information are part and parcel of democracy. However, they should be harmonised with all other powers of the rule of law and must not harm, in particular, the foundation of democracy, which is human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, Article 21 of the Italian Constitution does in fact guarantee freedom of information, but it also directly prohibits publications that are contrary to public morality. The 1948 law on the freedom of the press in Italy, which no one has ever challenged, lays down an obligation not for authorisation but for registration of any publication, as does the Hungarian law.</p>
<p class="contents">The reservations that the European Commission itself has rightly expressed do not devalue the stated aim of the Hungarian law, and that aim of ensuring respect for human dignity is demonstrated precisely by the attitude that the Hungarian Government has taken by opening itself up immediately to the acceptance of criticism and taking responsibility for changing the law according to the guidelines provided to it. The statement that the fundamental rights of the European Union will be written into the Hungarian Constitution is also proof of Hungary’s fundamental desire to be part of European culture.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I no longer understand the point of this discussion, except to ‘blame’ Hungary for having supported its government and parliament democratically by a two-thirds majority. Yet this gives Europe reason for hope, not reason for criticism. I am therefore grateful to the Commission and to the Hungarian Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a patriot, I am particularly saddened by the fact that it was the Hungarian media law that sparked heated debates in the European Parliament and other European institutions. It is not a pleasant feeling. The strong criticism voiced by the European Commission forced the Orbán government – which had, back in December, still adamantly refused to amend the law in any way – to give way. Now the Commission is forcing the Orbán government to amend the scandalous laws.</p>
<p class="contents">The main point is that, according to the Commission’s evaluation, Hungarian media legislation is in conflict with EU law. It is not only in violation of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, but also the EU Treaties and the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The EU’s criticism marks a political defeat for the Hungarian right wing. However, the majority of the objections made by four groups within the European Parliament continue to apply unchanged. Both the Commission and the European Parliament must intently monitor the effects the amended Hungarian laws will have on freedom of speech and the freedom of the press in Hungary.</p>
<p class="contents">A question to Mr Martonyi: what was the Orbán government’s justification for abolishing the parity-based composition of the media board, as stipulated by the previous media law, which consisted of a 50-50% ratio of members delegated by the government party and the opposition? What does Commissioner Neelie Kroes think about this? I firmly request the Hungarian Government to not create the nationalist impression that the criticism is directed against Hungary. I ask the Orbán government now, after the strong criticism received from the European Commission, to exercise introspection and cease the antidemocratic government practices it has been following up to now. ‘He who conceals trouble only makes it worse,’ warned the illustrious Hungarian poet Gyula Illyés. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with my colleagues, in that the debate we are witnessing here now, one motivated by political impulses, bias and, listening to the socialist and liberal Members, occasionally hatred, has become meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">One European socialist speaker referred to the protection of common European values, and elaborated on his position to that end. To quote a Hungarian socialist classic: ‘fiddlesticks!’ This is not at all the case here, my fellow Members. The case here is simply that the European socialists, liberals, communists and greens are once again using double standards. Mr Martin Schulz did not say a word when a minister of the socialist government in Hungary gave the order, through his direct political associates, to defame a journalist who had become a nuisance to him by having drugs placed in his car. Mr Martin Schulz did not say a word when one of the secretaries of state of the Hungarian Government filed a criminal report against a Hungarian journalist for writing an article exposing legislative fraud, which resulted in the imprisonment of that Hungarian journalist. Liberal Chair Guy Verhofstadt did not say a word when Hungarian journalists exposed electoral fraud at the leadership election congress of the Hungarian liberal party, which was followed by the party boycotting the TV station of those journalists for a long time. Since you did not mention or raise your voices for the protection of common European values at that time, there is no credibility to your statements today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I am greatly concerned that, one day before the resolution on the Hungarian media law is due to be adopted, we in this House have only very vague messages to rely upon and that we have not received any detailed assurances from the Hungarian authorities as to the actual amendments to be made. Therefore, I would like to know how it is that you were able to come up with those findings within a few hours and whether or not any external experts were involved in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the speed with which the amendments were announced seems to suggest that these will not be substantive revisions, but only cosmetic changes, and that is not acceptable by any standard. Why is it that we have been informed as late as today, on the day the debate is actually taking place, that the Hungarian Government will amend the law within a fortnight and that the Commission is happy with that. It appears that somebody is seriously bent on silencing the concerns of the European Parliament that the technical work announced by Hungary will not lead to democratic amendments of the law in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, we too have serious concerns about the composition and powers of the Media Council, as this is obviously a case of a major extension of state control over journalists. While I welcome the readiness for dialogue, I must reiterate that this is not an attack on Hungary. I used to be a journalist myself – and this is about protecting journalists throughout Europe. Moreover, I am disappointed that Commissioner Reding, who is responsible for fundamental rights, has not been involved in the issue of this controversial law.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I would like to know one more thing: what is the European Commission’s vision for the future of journalism in Europe? We need in the Union some minimum criteria which guarantee the freedom and independence of the media and media pluralism. I call on you to get to work on this as soon as possible because media freedom, and consequently the quality of media reporting, is already under serious threat in other parts of Europe, too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fortunately, with Hungary’s formal pledge to the European Commission that the new media law will be adjusted and explicitly brought in line with European fundamental rights, that ambiguity has been removed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, my only regret is that every debate on media pluralism always seems to get bogged down in national party political games. In my opinion, we definitely need to put a stop to that. Having said that, Commissioner, I think that your new initiative to start a working group on media pluralism is an excellent one and we, in Parliament, will obviously be extremely happy to discuss that initiative and work with you on it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an excellent opportunity to finally look into this in depth, to go to the heart of the matter, media pluralism, without the discussion being coloured by emotions generated at a national level. It is the perfect initiative for exploring the media landscape in the European Union in an objective way.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me to make one more thing clear: in my opinion, a European legislative initiative to regulate the media, which is what some of you in this House will be demanding tomorrow, is totally the wrong approach and I believe, Commissioner, that you agree with us on that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This law is a product of specific circumstances, which are not always well understood in Western Europe. In all transition countries, the media environment has been rather asymmetrical or unbalanced in terms of ownership and political affiliation. It was dominated by the left, which is why the call for greater balance in media reporting in transitional societies is perfectly normal.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept of balanced reporting has long been used in scientific and political discourse, and initially it was associated specifically with the media. In addition, the objection about the political bias of the composition of the Media Council under this law is totally unfair. Under this law, members are elected to the Council with a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament, while such a democratic mechanism is unknown to the vast majority of European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be brief, Commissioner. We will take you at your word that you will ensure the media landscape in the European Union is even more regulated. However, you will not be able to achieve that just by reviewing the laws of Member States. You need a more thorough analysis of the real situation, particularly in the new Member States, including Slovenia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, above all I would like to thank the Hungarian Government for keeping the promise it made in all of the hearings and prior discussions and at the start of the debate, namely that if there was a need for amendments to be made, it would also adequately implement these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of the press and media pluralism are important fundamental values in the European Union. The media also have a very special responsibility in our society. They are to respect personal rights, they must not practice discrimination and, above all, they are obliged to report the truth. They do not operate in a legal vacuum. That, too, is major progress in the new media law in Hungary.</p>
<p class="contents">The media enjoy very special protection, particularly through the current legal framework of the European Union. The Commission, as guardian of this legislation, has done its job very well in the past. The debate that we are having today would not have been necessary if there had been more trust in the work of the Commission as guardian of the legislation, because the fact that the system works can be seen by the results that we have been informed of today, namely that adjustments have been made in the areas in which the law was not completely in line with EU legislation. That is a major success.</p>
<p class="contents">Ideological debates that arise time and again, especially in this context, are in my view completely out of place. On the contrary, it is clear that the factual and cooperative debating of the contentious issues on the basis of current law in the context of the talks and negotiations that were held has helped to provide clarification and has led to positive results. I hope that the various political groups will also stop their political games and withdraw the resolutions in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, still you insist on continuing this now meaningless debate. To me, this indicates that the media law was only an excuse, a political attack against the two-thirds majority government of Hungary. While the draft decision submitted by you calls our law to account for the right to information, your text is based on misrepresentation and factual errors, just like all that has been said here this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">It is misleading. To me, ladies and gentlemen, the right to information means the right to unadulterated, real information, and this afternoon, too, you have been violating this. Interestingly, you only stand up for liberties when in doing so you can attack right-wing governments. However, the regrettable fact remains that no one from the ranks of the socialist and liberal groups was concerned about the protection of human rights when in October 2006, under the socialist government in Hungary, liberties were literally trampled to the ground in the streets of Budapest, or when the Slovak socialist government penalised minorities for the use of their mother tongue.</p>
<p class="contents">At that time you did everything to prevent these proven, serious infringements from even being debated in the European Parliament. To me, ladies and gentlemen, this represents an outrageous double standard. In the context of the law you are referring to dictatorship and the tyranny of the majority. To me, as someone who lived through Ceaușescu’s dictatorship as a child, this proves that you have a curious, one-sided idea of democracy and the rule of law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is meaningless for Parliament to take a position on an issue which could come to a positive conclusion in a matter of days.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware, however, that we are players in a hysteria-mongering left-liberal political campaign, and what form the law itself will eventually take is perhaps no longer of any significance. What is important is that our political opponents are attacking, with the disgraceful methods we are used to seeing from them, a country where last year centre-right political forces achieved a landslide victory after the eight-year depredations of the socialist government, and can finally complete the clear-out of the remaining ruins of the deplorable communist regime.</p>
<p class="contents">This includes a rearrangement of the framework of journalist ethics and media culture. I must ask; where were these critics, who fancy themselves progressive democrats, when the left-wing nationalist government of Robert Fico in Slovakia adopted a controversial media law, replete with sanctions, in 2008? Yes, they were here at that time, too, and ferociously protected the aforementioned law, which, thanks to them, is still in effect to this day. I deeply condemn and reject this double standard and call upon my colleagues not to let themselves be influenced by political instigation, and to entrust those in charge, the Commission and the Hungarian Government, with the professional evaluation and conclusion of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us please finally be aware that repeated attacks against the government of the country holding the presidency in an already crisis-laden period could represent a serious risk to the evaluation of the unity and international prestige of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">President-in-Office of the Council, I am one of those people who admire and feel affection for your country and for the Hungarian people. I fully understand that your government and some members of the public wanted information to be handled in a more balance way, and, objectively speaking, they were right. However, replacing one kind of propaganda with another kind of propaganda does not make it right. Consequently I am pleased this evening, but I am vigilant. I am pleased to see that your government has decided to return to several fundamental points and to change the December 2001 law on the media. This needed to be done and you did well to address this matter. I am also pleased that you are once more showing greater respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights, rights which your people have always craved in the course of recent history.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Kroes, and I support the composition of her group of monitoring experts. However, we will be vigilant, because we also feel that a number of points have not been dealt with, and we shall also pay attention to the details of the legislative amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to tell you, President-in-Office of the Council, that you are the heirs to the fatherland of Liszt, of Kossuth, of the 1940 hero, Joël Brand, of Sándor Kopácsi and Colonel Maléter of 1956. You are the heirs of Sándor Márai. You are the heirs of Imre Kertész. So do not let us down! It was a Hungarian who invented the magical game that is Rubik’s cube. Do not teach us, in Europe, to play with the media in the style of a ‘Jobbik’s Cube’ because that is a dreadful game. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well, sometimes, Mr President, you need a small angel at your shoulder.</p>
<p class="contents">For my own part, I prefer, when you invite me to come, to make clear what is at stake, to be able to come armed with facts and figures. Is what has happened today a coincidence? The answer I will give to that comes, in a way, straight from my heart.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about an entire procedure: it started at the end of December and we are now half way through February – so it has taken a bit more than seven weeks. Well, in the light of the six years I have been in office in the European institutions, that is quite speedy. My experience so far has been that things are rarely so speedy that I feel we can solve a problem within seven weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the background to today’s outcome is fascinating. We have a combination of factors. Firstly, we are not talking about this issue for the first time. You have invited me to discuss it before. You have been quite clear, so there has been no doubt about what is at stake – no doubt about what every party in this House thinks on this question.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are talking about a very important issue. I do not need to explain to you that the issue of freedom of expression and freedom of the press is what is at stake for the Commission; and that it would be ridiculous if we did not make that a top priority with regard to defending democracy. Was it a coincidence that the previous item on the agenda this afternoon was the situation in Egypt? You have been talking about creating democracy, so there is a clear thread here, and you can be absolutely certain that the Commission is aware of that and is, indeed, doing its utmost to defend democracy and to repair it where it may have been attacked.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue is, of course, the Hungarian Presidency. Let us not be naive. Of course our friends in this Member State within the family of Europe are aware that, for those in the chair, <span class="italic">noblesse oblige</span>. So from their side too there has been an approach of doing their utmost to solve the problem. The final point I would make in this explanation, in so far as I can offer one, is that the European Parliament has been crystal clear: you have been fighting and you have been keeping the outside world informed via the press – via a free press, I would add. So do not underestimate your own role.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, for me the whole combination of factors is, at the end of the day, the explanation of why we have this result at this point of time. Fundamental rights are the issue that has been at stake: there is no doubt about that. Anyone who thinks that I am interested only in peace and quiet does not know me in the least, because I am fighting for democracy. I do have a fair bit of experience and I have had a longer life in politics than most of you.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me touch, also, on a couple of the specific issues about which I was asked. What about the independence of the media regulator? Our preliminary analysis of the Hungarian law concludes that the procedures for nominating and electing the president and members of the media council are no different from those that are commonly accepted in Europe. We have to acknowledge – whether it furthers our case or not – that the governing party holds a two-thirds majority, and that, in a democracy, is a simple fact.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the application of Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, we are applying the directive – the AVMS Directive – and the Treaty, and that implies of course applying Article 11 of the Charter. So there is no doubt about that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Moraes said there was no judicial review of decisions by the media authority. A decision by the Media Council, passed in its capacity as an authority of the first instance, cannot be appealed via an administrative procedure. However, as provided for in Article 163, an official decision of the Media Council may be challenged in court in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. The lodging of the appeal does not have suspensory effect but the code may be invoked to suspend the execution of the decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Ms Weber said that the protection of sources under the Hungarian media law is insufficient. If we take press freedom as a basic European principle, that should be the starting point and the ultimate end in all our thinking on this subject. I have always defended press freedom at European level and I will continue – and I promise you the Commission will continue – to promote it untiringly. The right of journalists to protect their sources is one of the main principles guaranteeing the effective exercise of press freedom. Journalists should never be required to reveal their sources unless it is necessary for them to do so for the purposes of a criminal investigation, and that principle is valid whatever the political climate. In fact, it needs to be defended with more passion whenever the press and the media generally are in a weaker position, as is the case nowadays.</p>
<p class="contents">The Directive on privacy and electronic communications currently in force requires the Member States to ensure the confidentiality of communications. However, the directive does not apply to activities which fall outside the scope of the EU treaties. That is to say that EU law does not apply to matters relating to public security, defence, state security or the enforcement of criminal law and, moreover, under the principle of subsidiarity, Member States have the possibility of taking measures that could restrict an individual’s right to privacy, in accordance with their own rules and with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Any such restriction must be necessary, appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society, and a Commissioner is not in a position to judge or condemn such national doings, nor do I wish to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">On the matter of the absence of reference to Article 30 – and a number of Members have asked about that – I know that many of you have complained that the Commission has not taken Article 30 fully into account when assessing the media law. I should like to say loudly and clearly: that is simply not true. Although in its original proposal for the AVMS Directive the Commission had included an obligation on the Member States to guarantee the independence of the national regulatory authorities – and I know full well that your memory on such matters is excellent – that provision was not supported by the Council and, despite strong support from the European Parliament, it was changed into the current Article 30 of the AVMS Directive. The final wording of the AVMS Directive does not directly establish an obligation to create independent bodies. It is not what we would have wished but it is what was written down in the text and we have to accept it, albeit with regret.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hungarian authorities have agreed to delete the provision in question and add the following declaratory text to Article 10 of the Media Constitution, and I quote: ‘It is the task for the entirety of the media system to provide authentic, rapid and accurate information on such affairs and events’. So that will be the text after the changes.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to apologise that you did not receive the text, but I myself did not receive it or, at least, I had only the text that we were negotiating and I could not distribute that to you. However, as soon as it is possible, I will supply you with the text. Of course – while I hope you believe what I am saying and I would appreciate that – I imagine that, at the end of the day, you want to see it in writing and have the opportunity to read it.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues that will make sense for you when you are making up your minds is that of the balanced reporting requirements: as I said in my opening remarks, these will no longer apply to the written press or to on-demand audiovisual media services.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question, which Mr Løkkegaard asked, of whether I am ready to propose legislation on media pluralism, I said in my opening remarks that I am ready to take action in the matter of media pluralism within the existing EU competences. There is no one-size-fits-all approach: that is clear to me, and the Hungarian case has made it even clearer. I will set up the working group to which I referred, and I thank you for your willingness to join it, in order to discuss the challenges we are facing, to make sure we have a comprehensive overview of the situation in Europe and, of course, to act accordingly – including on the question of media independence. That should be one of the main priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the position of the OSCE on the Hungarian media legislation, in relation to our own analysis, there is a difference of legal bases, but the OSCE was quite clear and quite right in its conclusions. The main issues raised by the OSCE concern the new Media Authority, in particular the long duration of the term of office of its members and the regulation of the public service broadcaster. I have explained the Commission’s point of view here, and I think that the terms of office of members of other broadcasting councils, for example in other Member States, range in some cases from five to nine years. One example but it is not the only one, is the <span class="italic">Rundfunkräte</span> (public broadcasting boards).</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial thing – and this is my final remark – is the message from the Deputy Prime Minister that I received this morning when I touched down, and I am certain that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will repeat the message that the Hungarian Government wrote down for me, and for the Commission, stating what the position is.</p>
<p class="contents">During the seven weeks in which we closely cooperated, I had already been impressed by the input of my own staff who had been working like hell. But I can assure you that both sides worked like hell and that they did their jobs not just in the proper way but in a constructive way, in order to find a solution, because this is a very important matter, and we have to find a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A couple of brief points on behalf of Hungary: given the fact that Commissioner Kroes’ answer was extensive and exhaustive, and also concerned the composition of the media council, this was a specific question addressed to me which I think has been answered correctly, so I can limit myself to a couple of points.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, I would like to underline that Hungary is fully committed to the values, principles and the rules enshrined in the Treaty, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in all other instruments of international law, be they European or universal, on human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The first harsh criticism of the media law was made prior to the adoption of the law. I make particular reference to the comments made by the OSCE media representative. My simple wish was for the text to be read, studied and analysed, and then for us to be told what could be wrong, what kind of doubts or concerns might arise with respect to the text, or indeed with respect to the interpretation of the implementation of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">This was the reason why we immediately welcomed and supported the Commission, being the Guardian of the Treaty, in its analysis of the text, and invited it to express its doubts or concerns. Now that is exactly what happened. The Commission scrutinised carefully the law, made some proposals and all these proposals were adopted. I can only confirm that the day after tomorrow there will be a cabinet meeting. We will adopt the text and we will submit it immediately to the Hungarian Parliament and the amendments will be adopted as soon as is procedurally possible and will immediately enter into force.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the Commission for its hard work, help and assistance, but I would also like to thank all of you who made fair and reasonable comments and assisted us in this exercise, which I am convinced has been extremely important, not only for ourselves, but also for the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to offer our help and full support to the working group the Commission is about to establish. This is in the interests of Europe as a whole and we all want to participate in it and to help it as much as we can.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing I regret is the excessive language which appeared in some of the political statements. As I said already before, the law would have been adopted. Sometimes we had the feeling that we were being subjected to what the French call ‘<span class="italic">un procès d'intention</span>’, a kind of ‘<span class="italic">Schuldvermutung</span>.’ I had the feeling that it was the presumption of guilt which was being applied instead of the presumption of innocence which is, of course, a basic rule of any fair trial.</p>
<p class="contents">So sometimes these statements went beyond the limits of reasonable and fair political debate – a political debate which we otherwise fully support, both domestically and at a European or universal level.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, it was harmful to the interests of Europe as a whole – it was harmful to European integration. Now I believe that we are hopefully over that. I just would like to confirm again our full respect and to testify to this I would just like to let you know that it is our firm intention to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the new Hungarian Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Hungary will thus be the first country where the Charter of Fundamental Rights will be an integral part of the Hungarian legal system. It will be applicable not only in the areas covered by Union law, but it will be at the top of the hierarchy of the overall legal system and it will prevail over any other legislation or regulation, be it criminal law, be it about the media or be it about any other subject.</p>
<p class="contents">That should give an assurance to all of you that the basic rules, the basic values and the basic principles which we all share are, and will be, fully respected by my country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly, my fellow Members also request that the Commission initiate, still in this year, a European regulatory framework to ensure the assertion of the freedom of the media in the Member States. I am very pleased to note that increasing attention is being accorded to the provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and I therefore propose that the Commission also examine the application of the Charter, and in particular Articles 21 and 22 thereof, in the case of the Slovak language law. Furthermore, I welcome the fact that there is a demand for initiating a draft European directive to ensure the inviolability of the freedom of the media. I believe that the creation of a similar regulatory framework would definitely be justified with regard to the problems of indigenous national minorities. This is because there are countries within the European Union where it is not the requirement of balanced reporting that results in infringements of the rights of European citizens who have been living in the same areas for centuries, but penalties that are imposed on them for the use of their mother tongue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why I am overjoyed that the European Commission has reacted emphatically to information concerning the Hungarian media law and has taken real action. As someone who has worked in the media for many years, I will be watching with interest the work of the expert group announced by Commissioner Kroes which is to advise the Commission on further action. At the same time, I would like to point out that the legal analysis of the compliance of the Hungarian media law with European law carried out by the Commission has, unfortunately, illustrated the weakness of European law, specifically the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. Paradoxically, the Directive does not give the Commission much room for manoeuvre. So when the Hungarian law was being analysed, the Commission had to ‘stretch’ certain arguments and base them on the actual Treaty (freedom of enterprise) rather than the Directive. I realise that the European Union has limited jurisdiction in the field of audiovisual policy, but on the other hand I believe that the media, which is one of the fundamentals of democracy, must have certain minimum rights and must be subject to common standards. This is why I share the view of my political group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, on the need for a review of the EU legal framework in order to introduce minimum requirements for the freedom and pluralism of the media, and I trust we shall soon begin a substantive discussion on the subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

Global economy, instability and a stagnated mutlilateral system have strengthened the need and pursuit for increased bilateral relations. It is the first FTA in which Parliament will exercise its new enhanced powers given to it by the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">The FTA is designed to provide EU businesses, in a wide variety of economic sectors, with extensive and comprehensive access to the South Korean market through a series of unprecedented tariff liberalisations. It guarantees WTO-plus disciplines in the case of, for example, geographical indicators, government procurement, greater transparency of state aid and strong enforcement of intellectual property rights, and contains an all-important chapter on sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while the many advantages are both immediate and conspicuous, I welcome more than anything else the fact that the FTA has an effective bilateral safeguard mechanism – a safeguard that allows the EU to restore MFN duty rates, should it be that this particular FTA has led to or threatens to cause serious injury to EU domestic industry. It is a safeguard that specifically addresses the concerns of Europe’s sensitive sectors, including the auto industry, consumer electronics and textiles, and guarantees the protection they deserve. On this note I would like to thank Pablo Zalba Bidegain for the work that he did on this specific part of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The South Korea market offers significant new opportunities for EU goods and services. It is a market that until now has remained relatively closed off, due to high tariff levies and costly non-tariff barriers. The FTA will quickly remove EUR 1.6 billion worth of EU export duties levied annually. There will be benefits for EU exporters of industrial and agricultural products, immediate savings on chemicals – approximately EUR 175 million –pharmaceuticals, auto parts, industrial machinery, and the list goes on. It is also worth noting that these figures quoted will probably be even higher, because of the increased trade. Korea is currently among those more globally valuable export markets for EU farmers, with annual sales of over EUR 1 billion to Korea. The FTA fully liberalises nearly all the EU’s agricultural exports.</p>
<p class="contents">Exports are thus an important source of growth for the EU. They contribute to wealth and employment for European businesses and their employees and will act as one of the most important factors in stimulating the EU economic recovery. The Commission and the European Car Association have worked closely together to get this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The world is watching as Europe leads the way in improving trade and economic relations, with partners in every corner of the world looking at it. I have always said that trade is the real means of development. By removing barriers to trade and building new bridges we create new opportunities. This particular FTA offers a new approach. Complementary, of course, to Doha, it will drive Europe’s recovery and growth and the European Parliament will be instrumental in determining the future of global trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage I would like to thank Ignacio from the Commission. One of the economists said, Ignacio, that this is probably the best trade agreement that both parties could ever have agreed. I urge all groups to put aside protectionism and support this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karel De Gucht, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span><span class="bold">−</span> Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for all the efforts which Parliament in general, and the Committee on International Trade (INTA) in particular, has put into securing prompt assessment – and, I hope, ratification – of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA). This will permit its entry into force.</p>
<p class="contents">This complex task comprised two major processes: finalisation of negotiations on the Korea Safeguard Regulation, implementing the bilateral safeguard clause of the EU-Korea FTA, and the preparation of consent to this treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the first-reading agreement between the Council and Parliament on the Safeguard Regulation. The work that was done has not only secured legislation which will provide necessary protection for EU industry, but it has also confirmed the joint commitment of Parliament, the Council and the Commission to efficient law making. This was also the first trade dossier on which Parliament acted as co-legislator under the Treaty of Lisbon. The outcome of its involvement is indeed impressive.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not repeat the list of benefits which the EU-Korea FTA is expected to bring to the EU economy: we have thoroughly debated them here in the past, and Mr Sturdy has just summed them up. Let me instead open a brief parenthesis to place the agreement with Korea in the wider perspective of the future of EU trade policy, as sketched out by the Commission in its communication of 9 November 2010, and to recap the basic tenets of our policy line.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we continue to favour the multilateral channel of the WTO as the first-best way to liberalise trade and lay down the rules to govern global commerce. Despite the setbacks and the deadlock since mid-2008, we continue to push actively for the conclusion of the Doha development round, 10 years now after its inception. It is still well worth clinching a deal, both for the economic gains and in the interests of furthering the WTO. That is why I took the initiative of bringing together in Davos the trade ministers of the world’s seven most important trading countries to discuss, in concrete terms, how we can now proceed and enter the end-game, following the impetus given by the G20 in Seoul. I believe our meeting was a success, and senior officials are now working intensively in an attempt to stage a political breakthrough in the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as we said back in November, the bilateral and the multilateral are not enemies. Indeed, it may well be the case that liberalisation fuels liberalisation. We have pursued bilateral trade deals that generate genuine value added compared with what can be achieved through the WTO, and we will keep on doing so because the pace of multilateral progress is unavoidably slow. This has been, and is, our fundamental motivation for pursuing the FTA with Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">I will reiterate today the Commission’s commitments to the European Parliament, which it made in relation to the implementation of the Korea Safeguard Regulation and the EU-Korea FTA.</p>
<p class="contents">As provided for in the Safeguard Regulation, ‘the Commission will present a yearly report to the European Parliament and Council on the implementation of the EU-Korea FTA and will be ready to discuss with the INTA Committee any issues arising from the implementation of the Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">‘The Commission will closely monitor the implementation by Korea of its commitments on regulatory issues, including in particular the commitments relating to technical regulations in the car sector. The monitoring shall include all aspects of non-tariff barriers and its results shall be documented and reported to the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Particular importance will be attached to the effective implementation of commitments on labour and environment of Chapter 13: Trade and Sustainable Development of the FTA. In this connection, the Commission will seek the advice of the Domestic Advisory Group, which will include representatives of business organisations, trade unions and non-governmental organisations. The implementation of Chapter 13 of the FTA shall be duly documented and reported to the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">‘The Commission also agrees on the importance of providing effective protection in the case of sudden surges of imports in sensitive sectors, including small cars. Monitoring of sensitive sectors shall include cars, textiles and consumer electronics. In this connection, the Commission notes that the small-car sector can be considered a relevant market for the purpose of a safeguard investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">‘The Commission notes that the designation of outward processing zones in the Korean Peninsula, in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Protocol on Rules of Origin, would require an international agreement between the parties to which the European Parliament would have to give its consent. The Commission will keep Parliament fully informed of the deliberations by the Committee on Outward Processing Zones in the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p class="contents">‘The Commission also notes that if, due to exceptional circumstances, it decides to extend the duration of an investigation pursuant to Article 4(3) of the Korea Safeguard Regulation, it will ensure that such an extended timing does not go beyond the expiry date of any provisional measures introduced pursuant to Article 5.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Moreover, the Commission and the European Parliament agree on the importance of close cooperation in monitoring the implementation of the EU-Korea FTA and the Safeguard Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">‘To this end, in case the EP adopts a recommendation to initiate a safeguard investigation, the Commission will carefully examine whether the conditions under the regulation for ex-officio initiation are fulfilled. In case the Commission considers that the conditions are not fulfilled, it will present a report to the INTA Committee including an explanation of all factors relevant to the initiation of such an investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">‘Upon request by the INTA Committee, the Commission shall report to the committee on any specific concerns relating to the implementation by Korea of its commitments on non-tariff measures or on Chapter 13 of the FTA.’ That is the end of the quotation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me elaborate on two issues which are of interest to you: the Korean CO<span class="sub">2</span> legislation on car emissions, and the supplementary agreement on the draft Korea-US FTA (KORUS), which was finalised in December 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">On 24 January 2011, Korea confirmed that certain changes will be introduced to its previous draft CO<span class="sub">2</span> legislation, which satisfactorily address a number of concerns expressed by European car makers, while retaining Korea’s ambitious emission reduction objectives. The changes, which the Commission welcomes, will not alter overall emissions, but will provide for fairer burden sharing between Korean and EU car makers.</p>
<p class="contents">Rest assured that the EU position on the Korea CO<span class="sub">2</span> legislation was closely coordinated at all stages within the Commission and, in particular, with my colleague Connie Hedegaard and DG CLIMA, to avoid undermining Korea’s environmental protection efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the supplementary agreement to the draft Korea-US FTA reached in December 2010, the Commission has not identified elements therein that could have a negative impact on the EU. I will, however, contact my Korean counterpart to ensure that no competitive disadvantage arises in future for the EU automotive sector insofar as non-harmonised automotive safety standards will not be applied in a more restrictive manner than was the case at the time of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be closely monitoring the implementation of this provision. In particular, the Working Group on Motor Vehicles and Parts established by the FTA will examine practical aspects of implementation to ensure that market access problems are addressed in an effective and speedy manner.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish to emphasise that the EU-Korea FTA will not only provide important benefits for European exporters to the Korean market, but will also be a clear signal of our determination to pursue new opportunities in key Asian economies.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also addressing the concerns of some stakeholders by means of an efficient and effective safeguard regulation. As this is subject to the ordinary legislative procedure, both the Council and this House have been able to introduce mechanisms for responding to perceived risks should they materialise.</p>
<p class="contents">With this FTA and the Safeguard Regulation we have an excellent package that I hope you will support tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Free Trade Agreement that we are debating today will strengthen the competitiveness of the European Union and will provide our enterprises with significantly better access to a highly dynamic region of growth. Both the European and the Korean economy will benefit considerably. Our gross domestic product will increase. That could lead to the creation of new jobs. Our exports to Korea will double in the next few years according to all the forecasts because duties and non-tariff barriers to trade will be abolished; the relief in terms of duties alone will amount to EUR 1.6 billion per year. For the European Union there will be a substantial new trade in goods and services with a value of up to EUR 19 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that, in the negotiations, the Commission took full account of the negotiation recommendations expressed by the European Parliament in the Martin Report from 2008. I am also pleased that the European Commission took account both of the concerns expressed by Parliament and also of those coming from industry and it was also able to dispel some concerns just in the last few weeks. Something that I have never experienced before in the area of foreign trade is positive feedback even coming from the agricultural sector, which is usually more likely to be a problem for us in the area of trade negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of agriculture, the agreement will facilitate access to South Korea for European agricultural products from 1 July 2011. Up to now, only 2% of our agricultural products reach the South Korean market duty free. For pork, annual duties amounting to EUR 240 million are paid, and for milk and milk products the figure is around EUR 100 million. All of these barriers to market access for our domestic agriculture will now be removed. I would be pleased if, for this area in particular, the European Commission would consider how we could set up some kind of market access programme, not only for small and medium-sized enterprises, but also for agriculture in the countries that will profit from the Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, I would be pleased if we were also to ensure that our partners in South Korea now actually implement the trade facilitation measures promised in the agreement. I call for it to be clearly monitored whether new barriers to trade are introduced, and I would, in particular, like to congratulate the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Commission has achieved and what Parliament’s rapporteurs have achieved, particularly in the trialogue negotiations, is an example to us all. I hope that we will have a broad majority in favour of this agreement in this House tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certain sectors of European industry, especially the automotive industry, were unanimous in opposing this agreement. As a citizen of Navarre and Spain, where the automotive industry represents a substantial part of our economy, I felt the duty to become involved in order to improve, if not the agreement as this was no longer possible, the safeguard clause, which was where Parliament could introduce improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we set out to achieve two objectives. Firstly, to protect the industry and its jobs, and secondly, to make the agreement more attractive for the industries concerned, particularly the automotive industry. Our aim was not just to avoid outright rejection, but to gain their support for the agreement. I believe that here today, we can say ‘mission accomplished’. This is all thanks to Parliament’s hard work and expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my gratitude to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs of both reports for their outstanding work. Thank you Robert. And thank you also for your words.</p>
<p class="contents">Recognition is also due to the members of the Committee on International Trade, led by its Chair, Mr Moreira. <span class="italic">¡Muito obrigado!</span>, Vital.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the Belgian Presidency of the European Union for their excellent work. Their effort has had its reward in the form of the agreement we finally reached in December.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to highlight the work of the European Commission, and particularly Ignacio Bercero’s contribution, for which I am most grateful. Tomorrow we will vote in favour of a clause which will be more effective, easier to apply and will genuinely protect European industry. Today, concerns on the Free Trade Agreement with Korea have hugely diminished. Indeed, we might say that they have all but vanished. Today, the opportunities this agreement brings clearly outweigh the uncertainties. The European Parliament should be proud of a job well done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its purpose is, firstly, to strengthen jobs and industrial development in the European Union and, secondly, to improve conditions for people in other countries of the world. The aim of trade policy must be to achieve both of these goals. We therefore need to assess this agreement from this viewpoint. Overall, this is a step in the right direction towards fulfilling these two requirements. However, we certainly do have a few points of criticism, for example the question of duty drawback in South Korea, which will bring one-sided competitive advantages for certain sectors of industry in South Korea, particularly in sensitive areas such as the automotive industry. It was therefore right for us to have very intensive talks about a safeguard clause and also to have jointly implemented such a clause, which provides for the close monitoring of precisely these points, so that we can be certain that the possibilities provided by duty drawback in South Korea do not lead to a distortion of competition in Europe. Parliament has rightly established safeguards here.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this agreement also has the purpose of improving the situation in South Korea for our colleagues there. South Korea still has improvements to make with regard to Chapter 13, in particular the question of the core labour standards laid down by the ILO. Two absolutely crucial core labour standards – No 87 and No 98, relating to collective bargaining – have not be implemented or ratified. Section 314 of the penal code relates to the obstruction of business. Neither of these things is in line with the nature and the provisions of this agreement. Thus, Commissioner, I am relying on you, and on the statement that you have given in support of the safeguard clause, to change this situation in South Korea so that this agreement will represent a blueprint for the future to enable globalisation to proceed in a fair manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This makes an important area of policy – trade policy – more democratic. We, as Parliament, consider this to be important. The debate here in Parliament has also shown that, as regards safeguard clauses, we were able to include important concerns expressed to us by workers, companies and associations in an improved safeguard clause that is intended to protect the interests of industry and, above all, jobs in the future by creating a level playing field and fair conditions for competition and avoiding asymmetries. That is what we as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have concentrated on.</p>
<p class="contents">As shadow rapporteur for our group, I am pleased that we were able to be successful in this regard. The duty drawback mechanism, which caused us concern to start with, has now been explicitly included in the safeguard clause and there is the option for industry, and also for Parliament, to call on the Commission to carry out an investigation. A monitoring process is planned, which is intended to be established in a transparent way via an online platform, and there is greater scope for the investigation of the factors that will decide whether significant damage has been done to European industry. Mechanisms for monitoring to be carried out by the Commission, particularly for sensitive sectors in the event of increased imports, are also provided for. We can start with this and focus on the advantages associated with the South Korea agreement, such as the considerable reduction in duties – the Commission expects enterprises in Europe to be able to save EUR 1.6 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank Commissioner De Gucht, who has personally worked hard to enable us to reach a compromise, including with the Council. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, especially Mr Sturdy and Mr Zalba Bidegain, for their excellent work. We have achieved something really good here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is not a single country or area that escapes the European Commission’s ambitions where free trade agreements are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of this agreement, we have seen that there will only be winners, but I still wonder who the winners will be when I am told that they will be in the agricultural sector. As the elected representative of Brittany, I can tell you that in in that region which produces more than 60% of French pigmeat, the few benefits to be had by the agri-food product firms do not compensate for reductions in tourism, degradation of the environment and the health of workers, and farmers’ losses.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, indeed, also a great number of losers, and do we, here, have a vision of what economic and social Europe will be like after all these free trade agreements have been signed? No we do not, and nor do we know, at the end of the day, whether there will be any industrial or economic sector left to benefit from these free trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, and most importantly, Commissioner, try as you might to tell us that we are not questioning South Korea’s environmental and climate policy, that is not true. We are going to be able to export enormous saloon cars, those cars of which the manufacturers who make the least amount of effort to combat climate change are rewarded by this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time, the European Union is questioning the climate policy of one of its trading partners. Has the European Commission started to change, under pressure from Canada, its directive on fuel quality?</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that we are putting Europe’s ambitions in the wrong order: the environment and the climate must come before trade. That is why our group will vote against this agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The trade exchange between the EU and Korea is supposed to double in the medium term and that – so it is said – will speed up economic growth and the creation of jobs and prosperity. My group and I have justified doubts about this prediction.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from the mantra of the role of free trade as a kind of saviour of the global economy that is currently in a precarious state, which is also reflected in the Free Trade Agreement itself, it is not clear from this agreement whether it will, or will able to, help us deal with the global challenges arising as a result of climate change and the necessary fundamental economic restructuring. What are the efficiency criteria and what are the free trade criteria? At the same time, Commissioner, the Free Trade Agreement that has been concluded hardly contains any references to sustainability for the future, oriented change or international economic cooperation. An agreement is being concluded in which the fundamental standards of the International Labour Organisation are still being contravened.</p>

However, we must not ignore the fact that the agreement does not only bring advantages for European companies and Korean farmers. Some sectors will benefit from the agreement, whereas others will inevitably lose out. Thus, in future, EU citizens will be able to buy cheaper technology products and cars from Korea. In return, Korea will get badly needed food from Europe as well as medicines and luxury goods. The agreement may also lead to better environmental and working conditions in Korea – that is something worth mentioning and to be pleased about. I hope that the agreement can enter into force quickly, especially as the EU wants a first-mover advantage over the United States, which is also in negotiations with Korea in respect of a similar agreement.

Stassen  (NI)</span></span>  . <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, tomorrow we will be voting on the free-trade agreement with South Korea. I must say that it looks good at first glance. The delegation of the Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) is a strong supporter of free trade. Unfortunately, the European Union could not resist adding a safeguard clause to the trade agreement. This means that non-competitive companies will be protected when unable to hold their own when faced with competition from Korean products.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, should the European consumer choose to buy Korean products, rather than European ones, for the simple reason that the former may be better quality or cheaper, then trade barriers will once again be erected. Look how the vicious European reflex towards protectionism and market intervention is rearing its head again.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, free trade that does not entail any disadvantage for European industry is, of course, an illusion. Therefore, trying to overcome this by including a safeguard clause and offering compensation to disadvantaged industries is a totally misguided solution.</p>
<p class="contents">This will allow industries that are competing poorly to carry on doing what they have always done, instead of adapting to the competition. Worse still, who will ultimately be footing this bill? Exactly: our citizens, unfortunately. As consumers, they will be forced to pay over the odds for their purchases and, on top of that, as taxpayers, they will even have to cough up the required compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">How am I supposed to explain to my constituents that they will soon have to foot the bill if, for example, Fiat loses some of its market share to Kia? These rules have no place in a free trade agreement. In practice, this is nothing other than subsidising inefficient companies on the backs of European citizens. Free trade? What a great idea, but please let us drop this safeguard clause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would emphasise that we need it to be a win-win situation. There is a new generation coming up, which is a good thing. The agreement with South Korea contains a chapter on sustainable development, which covers labour standards, environmental policy and a monitoring mechanism that is to involve civil society. That is also good.</p>

I feel that we exercised our powers with a great sense of responsibility, and I believe that it is only right that I should thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, and also express my gratitude for the spirit of cooperation on the part of the Commission and the Council, under the Belgian Presidency, during the negotiations on the safeguard regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that in the vote that took place in the Committee on International Trade, there was an overwhelming majority in favour of recommending approval of the trade agreement and adopting the regulation on the safeguard mechanism.

It is unbelievable how much has been achieved in Korea in respect of democracy, self-determination and freedom, but also with regard to the economy and now increasingly also the environment. This makes Korea a good example for many other Asian countries, and it is also a country our ever closer cooperation with which I very much welcome, along with our work to break down customs barriers and to establish fairer trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we are rejecting this agreement today and there are a number of specific reasons for this, some of which have been mentioned by my colleague Mr Jadot. In addition to what has been said, I would also like to mention the regulation in the area of the financial sector, which we consider to be a step in the wrong direction. However, there are also fundamental reasons for this. We are concluding more and more free trade agreements, each one giving rise to another one. What we need is not a patchwork of more new individual agreements, but just and fair rules for world trade as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, regarding the question asked by the Earl of Dartmouth, in a case involving the infringement of intellectual property rights, including patents in third countries, it is appropriate that the operators concerned have recourse to the available enforcement means, including legal proceedings if necessary, as this is a case between two private firms.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of Avon Protection, it would be appropriate for your constituent first to seek redress for the alleged infringement of the patent via the existing legal framework in Korea. Should the available enforcement in Korea not be fair or expeditious enough, then the Commission could look into the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the remarks made by Mr Jadot, the initial draft of the Korean legislation would have forced EU car makers to reduce the CO<span class="sub">2 </span>emissions of their cars twice as much as Korean car makers. This was mainly because the proposed emission cuts were not proportional, but highly progressive, depending on the level of emissions of the respective cars. Consequently, despite being responsible for only a small share of car sales in Korea – 3% in 2009 – and therefore of total CO<span class="sub">2 </span>car emissions in Korea, EU car makers would have been asked to contribute disproportionately. Their average emissions reduction between 2009 and 2015 would have been 23%, compared with just 10% for their Korean counterparts, which account for 95% of total car sales in Korea. Such burden sharing would not have been fair, and that is why we discussed it with the Korean counterpart.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank everybody involved in this legislative process – the Committee on International Trade (INTA), the Commission rapporteurs, the Chair of the INTA Committee, the Council and my own staff at the Commission – for what, I would say, is a very good example of what the ratification procedure should be under the Treaty of Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been a number of issues raised today. I would just like to say to Mr Jadot: I think your pig producers in Brittany may well benefit significantly hopefully, Yannick, because pig producers across Europe are having a bad time. I only pick on that because I am involved in agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, the quality of the debate has been excellent. There always will be two views and Mr Susta is absolutely right: there is always a split between the protectionist and the free marketeer.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just say that we cannot stick our head in the sand and close the door and expect the world not to move on without us, because it will move on without us. We live in a global market, whether we like it or not. There are problems with that but it is a fact. I believe quite strongly that this offers huge opportunities for the European Union to move out of its problems with the financial crisis. We have set a standard for future agreements. However, they will not be as easy as this one. I am sure that we will move onto other far more difficult ones and we look forward to working with the Commission on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate tonight. It has been excellent and it shows how comprehensive this House can be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, it would help achieve customs duty savings estimated at EUR 1.6 billion a year. We would also see an increase in trade, especially in the services sector where the future growth in trade is estimated at 70%, and in the agricultural sector where, just at the moment, European Union exports to Korea have an annual value of EUR 1 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, this is an ambitious and innovative agreement. It is the first in a new generation of free trade agreements which contain both a chapter on sustainable development and compliance with labour standards and a monitoring mechanism in which civil society will be involved. The fears about the difficulties which Korean competition could cause the Union’s more sensitive industries, such as the car industry, are dispelled by the inclusion of the Safeguard Clause in the agreement. This will be used to impose measures for monitoring imports and exports and evaluating the impact of the agreement on the various sectors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title19"></a><a name="creitem19"></a>

In its conclusions, the Council also established that Serbia continues to achieve good results in the performance of its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. However, the country needs to make further efforts, particularly in the following areas: the reform of public administration, the rule of law, including the reform of the justice system, the fight against corruption and organised crime, and the improvement of its business environment.

The improvement of the framework conditions for their operation represents one of the special priorities of the Hungarian Presidency. Over the next months the focus of the Presidency will be on the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the flagship initiatives for innovation and industrial policy laid down therein, as well as the full establishment of the internal market, since at present only 8% of European SMEs are engaged in cross-border activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Based on the report by former Commissioner Mario Monti, this accomplishment must include the elimination of all barriers that still impede the operation of the internal market. We can achieve this by implementing and enforcing all directives, especially the Services Directive – this matter has also been addressed by Parliament in this part-session – precisely and in due time by providing consumer-friendly solutions within the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), by facilitating compliance with taxation rules for enterprises conducting cross-border business activities, and by promoting the adoption of an SME-friendly EU patent – and Parliament took a very important decision on this subject on Tuesday, after the Monday debate. The prerequisite for all this is what I have been talking about so far, that we must inspire SMEs to undertake as many innovative investments as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, the Hungarian Presidency will undertake the mid-term review of the European Small Business Act. This Act should be a veritable Magna Carta for SMEs. Furthermore, the Presidency intends to promote a comprehensive approach with regard to the new, integrated industrial policy, in the framework of which we endeavour to eliminate all informational, financial and technical support barriers that prevent SMEs from becoming the true backbone of the green economy.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we intend to reduce administrative burdens and the risk of state operation through a better and more intelligent regulatory framework, as well as institutional changes. We are convinced that it is vital to strengthen the innovative capacity of SMEs, and this requires a new approach to innovation, one that does not focus on the promotion of technological innovation. I would like to remind you that the European Council also took very important decisions with regard to innovation on 4 February.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the key issue of how SMEs can obtain financing, it can be said that we are committed to supporting healthy SMEs in obtaining credits and loans through guarantees, innovative financial instruments and banks offering favourable terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to add that the Hungarian Presidency will submit proposals to the Council with regard to the mid-term evaluation of high-budget, multi-year EU expenditure programmes in the field of research and development, which will also include important aid instruments targeted at SMEs, such as the Risk Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is really very important for the existence and working conditions of SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Applying the ‘Think Small First’ principle when preparing laws and policies is a cornerstone of the new framework we are trying to establish. This is important at all levels, not only at EU level, but <span class="bold">−</span> and I think you share my view <span class="bold">−</span> also at national, regional and municipality level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has revised its state aid rules to encourage Member States to direct more support for SMEs to key areas such as training, R&amp;D and environmental protection and to overcome the current focus on large businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement by Member States to allow for the application of reduced VAT rates for locally supplied services, including labour-intensive services such as hairdressing, catering and repair services, will further stimulate economic activity and create jobs, and the Commission warmly welcomes this decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of better regulation, the Commission has tabled important legislative initiatives already. It has adopted a proposal for revisiting the VAT directive to remove barriers to electronic invoicing, with cost-saving potential amounting to billions of euros in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also came forward in February with a proposal to allow Member States to adopt less burdensome accounting requirements for micro-businesses, thus fulfilling its commitment in the action plan for small businesses. It has the capacity to reduce the burden by up to EUR 6 billion. The Commission encourages Member States to reach an agreement as soon as possible to allow Member States who wish to take advantage of this opportunity to do so, so we in the Council definitely have to move along those lines.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also carefully assess the likely burden of any new legislative proposals, not only for SMEs. We have quite a number of good proposals on the table, and in the Competitiveness Council we are following this item and trying to address as many of these issues as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the second question, on improving access to finance, even in my introductory remark I tried to make a reference to that. To loosen the supply of much-needed credit, the EIB lent EUR 1 billion to SMEs in 2008, an increase of 60% compared to 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim is to lend more money on these issues later on. I remember very well that, when I was still an MEP, I was responsible for an opinion on the EIB. In my opinion for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I made an evaluation. I have to tell you that the EIB reacted very quickly to the changed circumstances and reorganised its priorities. So we welcomed those moves by the EIB.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with you that sometimes money does not get to the intended recipients, and there should be better organisation. My view on that is that we really have to pay attention to the counterparts of the EIB in the Member States, because in most cases they are the partners. We should not always blame the EIB for the implementation, which is not directly done by the EIB.</p>
<p class="contents">So I agree, on the second question, that it is extremely important that Community money and EIB loans get to the intended recipients, that is, the small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the Council cannot give opinions on written declarations, so if you do not mind, Mr President, I will not comment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This subject is of special significance to the presidency trio, of Spain, Belgium and Hungary. It was an important aspect of the common programme we developed more than two years ago, and each country added to it during its six-month presidency in order to contribute to the common programme being realised with regard to an integrated approach to water policy. We are therefore continuing the work started by Spain and Belgium, and would like to add our own contribution by submitting conclusions concerning water policy at the Council meeting in June 2011.</p>
<p class="contents">These conclusions will cover three main topics. The first is the integrated management of extreme water events, such as floods, water shortage, excess surface water and irregular distribution of rainfall. The second topic is the role of ecological services provided by water. This is a very exciting subject which I believe we do not talk about enough these days. We take it for granted that we have water and we are using the so-called ecological services provided to us by wetlands habitats, yet we should show much appreciation for these. The third topic will be the intensification of cooperation in the field of water management, both at international level and among EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council conclusions intend to contribute to the European Commission’s communication on the concept of European waters, which is foreseen to be adopted in 2012, and which will highlight the importance of the sustainable management of the water resources of EU Member States and of maintaining the security of water resources and water supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, there will also be conferences and events on the subject of water during the term of the Hungarian Presidency, such as the conference on the future of European freshwater resources, which will be held between 23 and 25 March in Budapest, in conjunction with the informal meeting of ministers for the environment. Please allow me one final comment. It is a priority objective for the Hungarian Presidency to ensure the creation of a Danube strategy for the EU and, in this context as well, water, the protection of our drinking water base and an integrated water policy will naturally have special significance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By the very act of submitting conclusions and directing attention to, for example, the water problems caused by extreme weather conditions, the Hungarian Presidency intends to pave the way for the European Commission to be able to submit the best possible proposals in this 2012 ‘water blueprint’ to the then presidency and to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Papanikolaou mentioned the problems of the islands in the Aegean Sea. I believe that this is very important to the people living there, and it is just as important in Southern Italy or Barcelona – we may all remember that there was such a shortage of drinking water in Barcelona that fresh water needed to be transported there by tankers –, and therefore, these all demonstrate that it is vital for us to address these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">By formulating Council conclusions we provide inspiration to the Commission, and I trust that when, for example, the debate about the multiannual financial framework begins, we will need to formulate them in such a way as to enable us to direct funds in the best way possible to the common problems of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ticau and Mr Rubiks both asked their questions about the Danube strategy. If you will allow me, I would like to answer them together. It was to our great satisfaction that Commissioner Hahn presented the action plans in early February in Hungary. There are 13 action plans, and as regards the questions you raised here concerning both the drinking water base and sewage treatment, there are so-called action plans for the issues of all kinds of floods and droughts, and each of these is led by two countries. I believe that this is a very good way to also strengthen regional cooperation along the Danube strategy. What is more, the participants include eight EU Member States and six third countries, and it is very inspiring that we have such a comprehensive strategy that allows us to take concrete steps in all these matters. True, there are no new funds allocated to this purpose, but I am convinced that, within this framework, existing projects can be reorganised, and through the reinforcement of cross-border cooperation we will be able to achieve a far more effective outcome than if all countries were making attempts on their own. It is impossible to engage in individual measures over a river that connects us all.</p>
<p class="contents">We may, of course, still have excellent plans, if we do not implement these, and I therefore very much hope that we can discuss these in Council configurations now, while still in the term of the Hungarian Presidency. We did give the process the initial push at the General Affairs Council on 31 June and are intently monitoring how the work is coming along. The work is progressing quite well, also at working group level, and towards the end of the Hungarian Presidency we will be able to adopt the strategy at the General Affairs Council; the European Council will be able to assure us of its support in this regard, and then it will be up to us to implement it as fully as possible, from sewage treatment to the preservation of our drinking water base. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Participation by disabled persons and their representative organisations in decision-making affecting disabled persons</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, published by the Commission, will affect the lives of 80 million disabled people in the EU. The Commission has identified eight key areas: accessibility, participation, equality, work and training, social protection, health and external action. The EU institutions and Member States are to implement this strategy together. In accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Member States which adopt decisions affecting disabled persons are required to closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities, through their representative organisations. Unfortunately, there is no provision for such consultation in the new disability strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Council taken any specific measures to ensure that the principle of 'no action on disability without the disabled' enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is observed? Furthermore, how does the Council view the proposal to establish a disability committee, answerable to the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) and chaired by the country holding the Presidency of the European Union? Does the Council agree that this would make for closer involvement by the Commission and Member States in the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is an appropriate and effective means of promoting and protecting the rights of persons with disabilities in the European Union, and is accorded great significance by both the Community and its Member States. The Council would like to remind the honourable Member that it has already affirmed on multiple occasions that, if we intend to meet the needs of persons with disabilities and wish to ensure their equal participation in society, it is important for us to involve them in forming the decisions and policies that apply to them.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolutions adopted in 2008 and 2010, the Council consistently urged that persons with disabilities and their organisations be involved in policy-making. We recall that the Council also adopted a directive which stipulates the prohibition of discrimination based on disability in employment and at work. The aforementioned directive also provides for membership and participation in employees’ and employers’ organisations, meaning that it is a specific measure adopted by the Council with a view to ensuring that persons with disabilities are actually able to participate in decision making.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also has a new disability strategy. To our great satisfaction, it was published in the autumn, and focuses primarily on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Hungarian Presidency intends to submit draft conclusions to the Council in connection with this strategy, with a view to adopting it in the final stage of the Hungarian Presidency in June. As regards the creation of a separate disability committee, to this date the Council has not received any proposals to be examined in this respect. In this context we recall that the Council can only act in its legislative capacity upon proposals submitted by the Commission, however, we of course always keep an eye on Parliament, but this is how legislation works in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the first question by Mrs Blinkevičiūtė, which concerns the developments related to the anti-discrimination directive, well, I could tell you things like ‘now we will solve it,’ because, for what it is worth, I could say that, but I will not say such things. We all know how painfully slow the progress of this draft legislation has been over the past three years. We, too, are planning to make progress, of course. In order to be able to do so and retain our credibility, we are trying to focus on the very part of this directive that concerns disabilities. We are therefore planning to discuss the disability aspects in two rounds and hope that we can convince the Member States to make progress at least in this respect. As such, we are not aiming in every direction, but instead wish to focus our attention on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that this is very difficult. Member States often refer to financial issues and financial difficulties. The former government of my home country was also forced to request an extension in order to be able to implement EU and domestic policies, for example in the field of removing barriers, and in times of crisis and austerity all this is difficult for the Member States. However, I believe, especially considering that we committed ourselves to making this a human-centred presidency, that we indeed have to make progress in this very important issue – because as Mr Kósa is always saying, this does not only concern persons with disabilities, but many others, from young mothers to the elderly, many more than those we call people with disabilities – that is to say, it is very much the responsibility of the Council to achieve progress in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Kósa asked how we can better involve Parliament, or how can we work together. I believe that Mr Kósa, as the President of the Disability Intergroup, is doing an excellent job and maintains very good relations, not only with the Council and the Presidency-in-Office, but also with the Commission. As we can see in several issues, if Parliament is playing a guiding role – and I am convinced that Parliament is playing a guiding role in disability matters – then the Commission and the Council can do nothing but follow its guidance. These can therefore indeed be incorporated into Commission proposals, which are then submitted to the Council. Thinking of the Roma strategy, the report by Mrs Lívia Járóka, which was adopted this Monday in the LIBE committee, has a good chance of being incorporated into the Commission’s proposal, and be then submitted to the Council. I would therefore recommend this route, and I would welcome it if this excellent cooperation could continue. </p>
