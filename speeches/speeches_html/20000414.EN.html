In fact, you have also received several e-mails and I have also written to the Conference of Presidents on the matter. The fact is that according to Members of various groups, the agenda on Fridays is too light, as a result of which many Members genuinely believe that their time can be spent more productively elsewhere. Consequently, there are few of us here today and we cannot guarantee that our electorate is adequately represented here. We therefore believe that a choice needs to be made: either we need to give more substance to Friday’s agenda or to abolish the Friday sitting.

We do have individual opinions within our Group. The delegates in the Socialist Group are not unanimous here. I would therefore like to speak as someone who is against this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Members who this morning requested that the vote be postponed in the absence of a quorum to consider the following: if you want to reform the Rules of Procedure, which are indispensable in this House, if you want to improve our working practice, you cannot achieve this through impulsive actions; instead you must initiate a full debate on reform of the House.</p>

<p class="contents">The delegates who are here this morning, who have done their work, who spent yesterday evening preparing for the work to be carried out today, are being punished here today, by a spontaneous action, for the fact that not everyone in Parliament has done their homework. I do not think this is fair to these delegates!</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would ask you to consider the following, and I am addressing this to my colleagues in the Greens and in the left-wing Groups of this House, who have the somewhat remarkable impression that through the Rules of Procedure you can change the free mandate into an imperative mandate with a duty to be present for all votes. That is nonsense! You will never be able to compel a freely elected delegate to take part in a parliamentary session or a vote if that delegate does not want to.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I consider this morning’s action to be impulsive, although it did perhaps serve a purpose, but, in terms of highlighting the key issue, it was quite unhelpful!</p>

This action, the quorum action, will continue, not only today, but every Friday in Strasbourg, until we have achieved our goal. One of the options is a full Chamber, because one thing that creates the bad image which Mr Bourlanges is talking about is people signing up here and leaving without doing their work. I have also done my homework and I do not want to mention any names, but we will be able to do this in future. We will challenge the quorum for each item on the agenda today.

If this Parliament is to be taken even a tiny bit seriously in Europe – and it is touch and go whether it will be, given that only 50% of citizens voted at the last European Parliament elections – then it must take itself seriously, and we are not taking ourselves seriously by sitting and discussing cases when there is nobody here. That is not a serious way of doing things. If Parliament has to work on Friday, then people must be here.

If the rules had been different, we would have acted differently. I would ask, rather, why it is that many Members voted in favour of working on Fridays in Strasbourg and yet are not in Strasbourg today. It might have been better and made more sense to vote not to work on Fridays: in fact, I put it to you that to vote in a certain way and then act differently is a display of blatant disregard for our institution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Enlargement to include the countries of Eastern and Central Europe is the biggest challenge in the Community’s history, and if we do not tackle the issue correctly now, we are putting a lot at risk. It is extremely important that we explain to the Union’s citizens, and the citizens of the candidate countries, what the Union stands for. An information and communication strategy must, therefore, be high on our agenda. I am looking forward with great interest to hearing your answer, Commissioner Reding, because I know that information is also of great interest to you: an interest which we share, moreover, because we are both journalists by profession. I believe that we also have the same interest in the Union’s communication and information activities being organised in as close proximity to the citizens as possible and in our applying the policy so that the various groups in society get the information which they most need.</p>
<p class="contents">The keywords are coordination – partly when it comes to sharing information between the Commission and the Parliament – decentralisation, targeting and optimum exploitation of the available information technology. I am curious as to how the Commission will go about the task. I imagine that the Commission’s offices in the major European cities will be involved and that they will be assigned tasks and responsibilities and given resources to contact and inform the public at large. The experts, the authorities and those who are genuinely interested in the EU should not have problems getting information, and I must admit that I am a little sceptical when I hear about an "interinstitutional" library in Brussels or similar central functions. I would much rather that the Commission’s office in Copenhagen was a little more accessible. It is the Commission’s local offices, in cooperation with Parliament’s local offices, which must meet the man on the street, the man who always thinks that Brussels is so extremely far away. He must understand that Brussels means all of us together, as Commission President Prodi put it. It is a very difficult task because, in my opinion, the gap between the citizens and the institutions is wide, and with the major challenges which the Union is facing the task will become no less great. Enlargement, the Commission’s ambitious 5-year plan, the Commission’s plans for reform, the Intergovernmental Conference: there is a lot to provide information about, and I think that this is an urgent matter. I believe that you share many of my views, Mrs Reding.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Andreasen for his question since it gives me the opportunity to express the extent to which I share his views, as, indeed, I emphasised during my hearing before this House last September. It is true that there is a gulf between the citizen and Europe. It is true that we have all, not just the Commission, but also Parliament and the Member States, made many mistakes in our information policy in the past. We must all, not just the Commission in isolation but the Commission in collaboration with the Member States and with Parliament, proceed to examine the matter in depth and develop a new information policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, let me tell you quite explicitly that I have taken careful note of the problems which exist. I must tell you, too, that there are some things which are working well; it is not all bad. For instance, we have just started up ‘Europe direct’, a new access facility for citizens looking for information about Europe. We have our Euro-info-points and information outlets in the Member States, which, generally speaking, are very successful. Along with the honourable Member, I admit that we might be able to improve the way they operate, and I shall indeed make every effort to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Member also mentioned modern technology. Obviously, the new information policy which we are going to be implementing will have to optimise the use of all the information and communication possibilities which this new technology makes available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, one of the major mistakes of the past, in our information policy, was the fact that this was often top-down information identified, wrongly, I must say, as propaganda. That must be taken into consideration. We must take the psychology of the public into consideration and we must ensure that dialogue is established. Moreover, I would draw your attention to the fact that my fellow Commissioner, Michel Barnier, and myself, have initiated dialogue on the Intergovernmental Conference which is to follow this new approach, i.e. making contact with the public, with young people and opinion formers, and discussing matters with them, and also approaching locally, regionally and nationally elected representatives on behalf of the Commission, not to make fine speeches, but to discuss things with them and to gain some idea of their general expectations. I am, of course, counting a great deal on Parliament to play its part in this citizen information campaign. Parliament is the body which is closest to the citizens, and if all the Members of the European Parliament fulfil their task of informing citizens – and I shall assist them as much as I possibly can to do so – this will enable us to change mindsets.</p>
<p class="contents">We have once again started to work within an interinstitutional working party on ‘information’, in which Parliament is represented, and as part of this work, which is a tripartite effort involving the national states, the European Parliament and the Commission, I plan to present a communication to you in the near future outlining a new approach which I shall first present to the Commission, some time before the summer, and which I shall then discuss with you. I cannot give you any details at this early stage of the actual proposal, as it is still being drawn up, but I can assure you that the main pillars of this new approach will be decentralisation, subsidiarity, closeness to the citizens, the coresponsibility of the European institutions and the national administrations and also the increased participation of civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think we must all clarify our respective roles. Obviously, the Parliament’s role is different to that of the Commission. I am deeply convinced that Parliament’s special role must continue. Any collaboration in the field of information must allow for the specific character of each institution. It is possible to cooperate without the parties involved losing their own identities, but we should nonetheless all work in the same direction and we must know that the closer we are to the citizens, the greater our chances of being comprehensible, credible and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do so, we must seriously examine the way we are organised, the instruments and procedures we select, what is being done at the various levels, at institutional, national and regional level, and how tasks are divided between the three institutions. We must also, openly and objectively, look at our own way of working and examine how we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, is what I wanted to say for the time being. Obviously, the discussion is only just being initiated and will not be completed today, because in the very near future we shall be presenting a communication on our new information policy which we are going to discuss in detail with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a very committed commissioner in Commissioner Reding. She has a really tough task on her hands but I am sure that she will get the full support that she recognises that she needs from the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I find myself totally supportive of this motion in addressing the information deficit of the EU. The information deficit is actually more serious than the democratic deficit that we often talk about. In a sense, the information deficit and the democratic deficit are part of the same problem.</p>
<p class="contents">In the recent past, we have had the Oostlander report in 1993 and the famous Pex report in 1998. They have analysed the problem, suggested improvements, but sadly little has been achieved. I wish Commissioner Reding well in getting on with this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">This week I had a visitors' group from the Winchester Probus Club, mainly retired people and, in general terms, well informed about world affairs. However, you could write what they knew about the aims of the EU on the back of a one euro note. Before anyone tells me that euro notes do not exist, it would not make any difference: they could not write anything.</p>
<p class="contents">When I speak to British groups, I often start with the question: do you want to be in the European Union? The immediate response I got this week was: "No". Five or six years ago, the response would have been: "Yes, but we do not want too much interference". This situation is getting worse. I know that it is a particular problem for the United Kingdom, but it is not exclusive to the United Kingdom. It is getting worse right across Europe. We only have to look at the turn-out in the European Parliamentary elections to see that.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is this so? Why this lack of enthusiasm for the EU? To begin with, we must remember that the best advertising in the world will not sell a poor product. Even if you have a first-class product, if you do not market it properly it will not sell. We must make sure that the product is good first and then make sure that we advertise it effectively. I fear we are doing neither.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no doubt that, when history is written, the greatest achievement of the 20th century will be seen to be the creation of the EU. It has delivered peace and prosperity for half the continent for half the century. Now the other half of the continent is queuing up to get in, yet my constituents want to get out.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not an expert in marketing; I know there are no simple solutions; I certainly know more propaganda leaflets are not the answer. Let me just suggest a few possibilities. What happened to President Prodi's idea of a rapid rebuttal unit? If it is in existence, it does not appear to be very effective. If they are giving answers, can I suggest that they e-mail their answers to the MEPs as well, so we can use the information, not just to the press, who often just spike it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner said quite rightly that new technology is good. We must make more and better use of it. We must make sure that our website address is known. we could maybe spend some of the Socrates money giving every student in Europe a computer mouse mat so that they can see the website address of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">With the plethora of new TV channels, with digital TV, have we got anywhere with a Parliamentary TV channel? I can watch the US Senate on television gavel-to-gavel. But not the European Parliament. We must emphasise the good-news stories of when we help the citizen. We have a Committee on Petitions that addresses a thousand petitions a year. When did the information departments of the Commission or Parliament last attend a meeting of that committee? When did they past publish any of the good news that comes from that committee?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to address the problem of Parliament in Strasbourg. I am not anti-Strasbourg. I am certainly not anti-France. I understand that Strasbourg was the symbol of peace and unity of our continent, but that was a symbol of the 20th century. In the 21st century, I am afraid it is a symbol of waste and inefficiency. I ask Parliament, Commission and the Council of Ministers to address that problem.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have known you for many years and we know of your commitment and dedication, not only to what we could call the European cause, but also to ensuring that the European cause really reaches the citizens. In your political activities you have always paid special attention to the most sensitive groups: young people, elderly people, the workplace, and you paid special attention to the media.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the general lines which you have put forward here and which will be specified in the document which you will present and which the European Commission must approve next June.</p>
<p class="contents">You have mentioned two aspects which I would like to stress: the regional dimension and efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the information policy is to reach the citizens. In order to do that properly it is necessary to take account of the regional dimension, because it is one of the fields which is a subject of great sensitivity in terms of society and its problems. Therefore, so that the citizens may understand and participate in European construction and not see it as a superstructure reserved for politicians and technocrats, it is essential that the work of providing information is done at the level of the regional institutions and in conjunction with them.</p>
<p class="contents">This goes hand in hand with efficiency. In your review of information policy, I would ask you to bear in mind the experience of certain Member States. For example, during the euro campaign, there was an agreement at the time between the European Commission and the government of a Member State. That government’s decision was to commission an information campaign on the euro from a very important advertising agency. That advertising agency made some very nice advertisements and hundreds of thousands of leaflets were distributed. However, that it is not the way to reach the public, nor is it efficient. It is perhaps very pleasing to the government, which gets to make fine speeches, and to the relevant Minister, who gets to appear on the television and in the newspapers, but that does not reach the public. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the maximum possible degree of decentralisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has long had an office there. The Commissioner has mentioned the importance of national regions, as well as the states, in its communication policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sorry to say that this week it has been announced that <span class="italic">The Scotsman </span>newspaper is closing down the office of its Brussels and European correspondent. It is rumoured that BBC Scotland is about to remove its special correspondent from Brussels. That would be a disaster. It is not just the Commission and Parliament which need to think about their role. Our own media also need to look seriously at the problem of adequately reporting to their citizens the issues of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">May I mention one other sad case, which is of importance in the area of information and communication. I want to draw attention, yet again, to the case of the Italian language lecturers. New developments in the case have shown that the quality of openness in information and communication by the Commission on this sort of issue leaves much to be desired. In these proceedings it is vital that the interested parties are fully informed by the Commission, but the practice fails to honour that ideal. There has been some evidence this week that the former Commission has actively misled parties in cases of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">During the current Parliament, I have had a number of assurances that the Commission is serious about upholding rights derived from Community law on behalf of lecturers in all issues involving non-discrimination. That really must be taken seriously. It is a point about openness, about being ready to communicate what is going on and about informing people how seriously we take rights arising from Community law and how seriously we take the need to demonstrate to our citizens and our public the importance of what is accomplished here.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the Commission and Parliament have helped to make information available in Scotland and I wish our own media would do likewise.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Prodi’s Commission has started off badly with regard to information. I have heard that last autumn it issued an instruction to the national Commission offices to focus on the reporting of political information in place of the former citizens’ information service. This means information and propaganda from above. Actually, this means the spread of propaganda, not information.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has started off badly in the most important area of information reporting, that of public accessibility. The Commission has issued a draft for a directive on public accessibility, which, by any common yardstick, is an untenable document, more conducive to secrecy than increased public accessibility. This is the Commission’s line on information policy insofar as it concerns public accessibility. Public accessibility is just as important as information. It offers our citizens and the media the opportunity to have hands-on access to documents themselves and draw their own conclusions, instead of being dependent on those of the Commission. There is a very obvious discrepancy between the official documents themselves and the conclusions being drawn. The documents state that the European Union’s crisis management troops are not a European Army, but the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, says that whatever you call it, it is one. In an information context such as this, it is important to have access to the documents and draw one’s own conclusions, as the documents do not always spell things out clearly either.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the way Parliament disseminates information must be criticised. Parliament has its own information offices, but the Finnish office apparently has no money to buy copies of the EU Treaty, which would allow Members to familiarise themselves with its contents in their office at Parliament. It has one Internet connection. To this extent, we could conclude that the officials working in Parliament’s own information office do not know what is going on in Parliament, although Parliament has excellent Internet connections. To all intents and purposes, it is a war of propaganda that is going on here. In many respects, it is also a civil war.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We thank you for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point out that we too must ask ourselves whether this morning’s initiative to prevent voting was a positive information and communication strategy for Parliament outwardly as well as inwardly? I do not think that it was! The homework which we have to do we must do ourselves and we must not confuse information and communication within the framework of our work with self-promotion. It is a matter of Community promotion and not self-promotion. In this regard we should all resolve to understand that one of the causes of the problems of the political parties and of the institutions is a problem of communication and information.</p>
<p class="contents">We, and I say that very clearly, the institutions of the European Union, the European Parliament and the delegates cannot bear sole responsibility for providing information on Europe. Without the support of the Member States, without the support of the public representatives at borough, county and national level, without the support of all the institutions, we will not get directly to the citizen, because either we are here doing our work or we are involved in communication and information processes with our citizens. We cannot do both at the same time within the meaning of Maastricht and Amsterdam!</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I am waiting for your master plan, your schedule, your specific measures for implementation. The public mandataries, all persons and institutions who receive money from the EU, should be involved in this implementation. We must increasingly involve the visitor groups and also two areas of activity which, in my opinion, are in your sphere of responsibility, i.e. schools and youth, and the staff in the offices of the Community institutions must be equipped accordingly.

If information were to be issued solely from Strasbourg or solely from Brussels, it would not reach the public. I am absolutely sure that, if we want to bring Europe closer to the citizens and the citizens closer to Europe, there must be a regional dimension to the information policy at all levels, including information relating to the euro. In practice, the euro cannot be introduced by means of a television programme. We must not forget the importance of television but, in addition and above all, we have to keep the people at grassroots informed – to approach the people and talk to them. And there are a great many information outlets available to us in our regions, towns and villages which can play a very significant role in this. It would be a mistake for a policy to be managed solely by an advertising agency and not implemented at grass roots level in consultation with the citizens directly concerned. I am in total agreement with Mr Gasòliba i Böhm when he says that we must integrate this regional dimension into our information policy and, when I discuss the issue with the competent national politicians, I will ensure that this is taken into account.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any case, the channel which I will announce in the written statement, which I am in the process of drawing up at the moment, is dialogue and direct contact with the citizen. I would like to make it quite clear, once again, that the provision of information to citizens is not the exclusive responsibility of the Commission.

<p class="contents">Mr Karas has quite rightly said that we need the Member States. That is also one of the focuses of the new information policy which I would like to introduce in the future. We need not only the Member States, but also the associations, regional and national politicians. Without them there is no way that we can get our information across. There must therefore be a concerted action between the institutions and between the people in our regions, in our States. I know that this is easy to say and difficult to implement. But unless we at least make a start, then nothing will happen. I hope, therefore, that on the basis of the new information policy, which I would like to introduce, this aspect of citizen participation and citizen responsibility for Europe will be strongly emphasised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Had we voted in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, we would no longer have been involved. That is how it was, Mr MacCormick – he is no longer here. I would like this to be recorded.

This is completely understandable if we consider that the majority of European citizens are exposed to uncomfortably high levels of noise. </p>
<p class="contents">Under these conditions, the European institutions’ delay in legislating is highly regrettable, particularly the Commission’s failure to propose practical measures to combat noise and to set limit values for noise exposure. A Green Paper was presented in 1996 and nothing else has happened since. </p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the noise problem is largely due to transport, particularly road transport, but air transport is a factor which is also giving increasing cause for concern. The peak levels of noise during take-off and landing are specific to air transport and, of course, this problem is exacerbated by the effect of the noise at night, for it must be admitted that night flights, or rather aircraft taking off and landing during the night, make sleep almost impossible in some areas near airports. </p>
<p class="contents">What has been done to regulate aircraft to date? Standards were last established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation in 1977. Therefore, there has been no progress in this area for 23 years, and it is clear that aircraft replacement policies are not in any way motivated by the introduction of more stringent standards, to the extent that our aircraft are extremely outdated.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent Commission communication on air transport and the environment defines a noise reduction strategy based both on economic factors, such as improving air traffic control and airport access, and on fostering progress in technology. This is a good strategy which will limit the increase in noise pollution, but in my opinion and, I would argue, the opinion of a good number of Members, it will not allow us, in the short term, to reach our objective which is that nobody is exposed to dangerously or uncomfortably high noise levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation, a number of countries and regions have taken steps to restrict access to airports at night. Unfortunately, they have not been very organised about it, with the result that some firms, particularly courier and freight companies, have reacted badly – to my mind, dangerously. They are threatening to relocate and this is creating economic insecurity in the regions concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that harmonisation at European level is imperative. Of course, this does not mean demanding uniformity, for regional differences must be taken into account, but there must be a common core in the approaches of the different Member States of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">I also feel that the organisation of night air transport activities, which are inevitably going to be noisy whatever the level of technology employed, is certainly something which must be restricted and coordinated. I therefore call upon the Commission to take action in this area. </p>
<p class="contents">I made no contribution to this morning’s debate and, with your permission, I would like to say a few words now regarding the vote. Personally, I would prefer a vote in which a large number of Members take part to a vote which takes place at noon on Friday in which only thirty or forty Members participate. Frankly, that distresses me, for a resolution voted in by only a small number of Members carries very little weight. I took part in this morning’s action and I did not appreciate criticism from Members who interpreted it as an anti-Strasbourg manoeuvre. I am not at all against Strasbourg: quite the opposite, and I have proved it many times, despite the fact that I am Belgian. I do not wish to see Strasbourg cease working normally from Monday to Friday. </p>

<p class="contents">One of the goals of the Commission communication ‘Air transport and the environment – towards sustainable development’ is precisely to launch the debate on the suitability of establishing a Community framework for decision-making procedures concerning the operational restrictions to be imposed on airports in the Union for environmental reasons. In the course of this debate, which will be held in the different institutions, the Council of Ministers and Parliament will have the chance to express their views on this communication, both in general terms and with regard to specific aspects such as night flights. </p>
<p class="contents">As pointed out in this communication, the Commission does not see how uniform and restrictive rules governing restrictions on use, which would apply to all Community airports, as would be the case, for example, for the general ban on night flights, could provide the most balanced solution to the issue of noise pollution attributable to certain airports. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is of the opinion that decisions should continue to be taken at local level. However, it also considers that a common framework is necessary to coordinate the procedures adopted in order to reach these decisions so that when a region decides to ban night flights, for example, it does so in the same way as a similar region somewhere else. And this framework could make it compulsory for all the interested parties to be consulted, stipulate an appropriate timeframe for adaptation to the new restrictions and establish a common basis for assessing the efficiency in environmental terms of the envisaged measures restricting operations. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to touch on the subject of hushkits. With regard to speeding up the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft, the Commission is committed to the work currently in progress within the International Civil Aviation Organisation on drafting a new standard on noise and rules for the withdrawal of the noisiest aircraft. If, as we hope, all goes according to plan, this work will result in the 33rd Assembly of the ICAO adopting new, binding international noise regulations in September 2001. Compared with the hushkits regulation, which is content to put a freeze on the current situation for aircraft whose certificate has been renewed, genuine international rules requiring the progressive withdrawal of these devices would have greater effect in terms of environmental protection. </p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, in view of the United States’ refusal to back down over the hushkits regulation, the provisions of this regulation on banning the attachment of these devices will enter into force on 4 May next. Given that the provisions governing the banning of aircraft registered in third countries will only come into force on 1 April 2002, the Commission’s interpretation of the conclusions of the 33rd assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation will provide all the elements necessary to decide whether it is appropriate to replace the hushkits regulation with rules for progressive withdrawal adopted at international level. All this is in the pipeline. The Commission is working on it and would like to thank Parliament for its cooperation on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talked about hushkits not so long ago. I understand from the observations made by the Commissioner that the regulation as it has been laid down will enter into force on 4 May next.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is not only hushkits which are causing us considerable concern. In broader terms too, we have to establish that, on account of the increase in air traffic, noise pollution is growing at an alarming rate, especially for citizens who live near busy airports. At night time, in particular, this level of pollution is out of all proportion. The number of night flights should therefore be significantly reduced. But what is meant by night? At Düsseldorf airport, night falls at 10 p.m., according to Mr Florenz. We in the Netherlands are far more flexible in this respect. Night does not set in until 1.00 a.m. and we do not actually term it night, we refer to it as the brink of night. Mr President, whatever time we are talking about, it means that we need a coherent approach to noise pollution caused by the transport of civilians and freight by air, as the individual Member States are applying very different rules. These lead to the direct and undesired effect that airports start to compete with each other. They reason that as long as they are flexible enough, they will get a lot of freight traffic. But, at the end of the day, it is the people living near airports who suffer. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, so what needs to happen? First of all, all noise pollution, including pollution generated by aircraft, must be tackled at source. This means thorough research into low-noise engines. This means bans and international standards. But it also means that we need European framework legislation which ensures that measurements are taken, standards set, zonal structures put in place in the same way for all European airports. What we are asking for – not for the first time, in fact, we did this two and a half years ago in connection with the report on noise pollution which was supported by the late Mrs Carmen Diez de Riviera – is this legislation. Commissioner and Mrs Reding – you are representing Mrs de Palacio at the moment – you are saying that this is extremely difficult, but I am not asking you for a ban, or even a night ban. What I do want is to keep the discussion around this issue going and to continue where Parliament left off before. It was our own amendment, tabled on behalf of the European People’s Party. Let us thus fight for a European directive which, thanks to Mrs Loyola de Palacio’s new impetus, ensures that we – at long last – can give our citizens what is theirs. That is peace and quiet at night, but this also implies a proper zonal structure, insulation and sound legislation in Europe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This undoubtedly brings many benefits, but there are also many drawbacks. I would like to make it clear straight away that, if Europe does not intervene, aspects such as quality of life, the economy and social factors will very much be in the balance. The key question is, do we want our citizens to enjoy a good night’s rest, and even day’s rest and, secondly, are we able to give them just that? If you will allow me, I will dwell for a moment on the problem of noise pollution suffered at my own country’s national airport, an airport which, by the way, many of you frequent very regularly. The noise pollution at Zaventem has exceeded the permitted levels for a long time. The quality of life – and sleep – of the people living in the vicinity is appalling by any standard. The solution to this problem has caused great uproar in Belgium and in my government. As you know, the Belgian Government embraces people from the blue, green and red sections of the political spectrum. Well, when the green Minister had the audacity to propose a complete night ban, all of a sudden, Belgium was not big enough for the fierce discussion which followed. </p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you may be red and green in your heart, and I can assure, this is what I am. I too want to continue to promote life and the quality of everyone’s existence as the supreme good. This is all well and good on paper, but this can be very difficult to implement in practice. What is worse? Having a very difficult or bad night’s sleep, day in day out, or suddenly losing your job and your income? Indeed, the parcel company at Zaventem had threatened hundreds, if not many more, redundancies. All of a sudden, the trade union and employers joined forces. Belgium has meanwhile come up with a solution: a combination of measures which involves a restriction of noise at source, strict supervisory measures and a number of infrastructural planning measures, such as offering insulation to the houses affected. </p>
<p class="contents">It is an improvement, but not a solution. Too many people continue to suffer from excessive noise in their bedrooms. Nonetheless, Belgium, in tandem with other Member States, has taken on a pioneering role in this discussion and the question is then, will that country, with its businesses and people who work and live there, suffer as a result? We can only avoid this if night flights and noise pollution are tackled at European level. This is, in fact, what we are asking for and I am delighted to see that people of all political persuasions in this Parliament are asking for the same thing. I therefore hope that the Commission will be receptive to this. Europe will need to resolve the false dilemma that exists of having to choose between the economy and social and environmental considerations. We would like a standardised method to measure noise pollution within the Union. In this connection, we would also like uniform standards and an effective costing rule. In addition, we would like criteria which determine when a night ban should be instituted within the Union. </p>
<p class="contents">In a recent communication from the Commission on air transport and the environment, an initial strategy has already been outlined. This is to be welcomed, but it is not enough. Firstly, this does not solve the current problem, as Mr Lannoye has already pointed out. Secondly, this is simply a communication, but we want hard legislation from the Commission, so that everyone knows where they stand. I regret that the Commissioner – the Commissioner who is standing in for Commissioner de Palacio that is – is of the opinion that it is very difficult to institute a night ban. I think that, with a little good will, this should be feasible. I am looking forward to her reply.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its communication on airports and the environment, the Commission mentioned a few things about noise, one being – and you also echoed this yourself – that the principle of subsidiarity applies to noise. In other words, it must be possible to implement at local level without the European Union having to regulate everything. I would, however, like the Commission’s guarantee that distortion of competition is ruled out. An interesting concept in the communication is the drafting of classification lists, not only for aircraft, but also for airports. This would mean that noise-sensitive airports would be distinguished from others and that certain activities could not take place at such airports but could possibly take place at less noise-sensitive airports. Mrs Van Brempt already pointed this out: we are faced with a dilemma. </p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that certain businesses and a certain economic sector totally rely on night flights. If we asked them what would happen if there were no night flights, they are bound to say that they would have to close down their businesses, their activities would become pointless and they would no longer be able to offer their services. Our question is, therefore: how can we marry the two together? The Commission should then legislate against distortion of competition between different airports in different Member States. Mrs Van Brempt clearly stated what the dilemma was for the Belgian Government. It is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. As it happens, the Belgian Government has taken a number of measures, but would it not be useful, for example, if the Commission were to compile some sort of list of good and bad airline companies in terms of noise, if it were to draw a distinction between those who do invest in combating noise, those who can present a good record in combating noise and those who cannot, those who do not try their best, and then combine this with measures. Because one thing is clear: noise must be penalised. Accordingly, it should be more expensive to fly certain aircraft and it should be impossible to fly certain aircraft at night for example. A total ban would be ideal, of course, but can we afford this and where could this be done? We would like to have these questions answered by the Commission. A European framework is lacking at the moment – and you say yourself that a framework should be in place, but when? When will this happen? We have a communication at the moment and shortly we will have the report by Mrs Lucas on aviation and the environment, but when are we getting legislation, when can we expect a framework which is sufficiently clear for each Member State, so that distortion of competition is ruled out? Would it not be useful, for example, to look at ‘best practices’ at this stage – to use a buzz word – so that we know what certain airports get up to? This would be some achievement. For example, at Schiphol, there is a kind of complaints desk for noise. Other airports do not have this but could possibly do with one. So why not exchange ideas between the different EU airports, where all of us are faced with the same problem? I would ask the Commission to speed up its process and not to wait for the legislative measure alone, but to set up other initiatives in order to bring people closer together.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now the company is trying to worm its way into the Nancy-Metz regional airport, which it has targeted because of its rural location where, due to the lower population density, there might appear to be less public opposition. But this is not the case at all. When it comes to noise pollution from aircraft and public health in general, it makes no difference whether an airport is situated in the town or the country: all citizens have the right to a peaceful night’s sleep. I could also mention the inhabitants of the areas surrounding Roissy, Satolas and Milan who are protesting. Milan has fallen into the clutches of Trans-European Networks which have failed to take into account the detrimental effect of their activities on local inhabitants’ standard of living. </p>
<p class="contents">With air traffic booming and the new economy expanding rapidly, I can foresee a fresh increase in freight in the future. The Union must react and the Commission must propose tangible measures in response to the legitimate concerns of our fellow citizens. The entire transport policy needs to be revised in order to curb, or even reduce, air transport and related noise pollution. No research has been carried out into noise pollution from airports. It is essential to transfer short-haul air freight transport to the railways. And personally, I am in favour of banning night flights in order to respect the local inhabitants’ need for a peaceful night’s sleep, for they already have to put up with excessive noise all day long. These three matters genuinely require urgent consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I imagine that other populations living near any airport in any large city will have the same problem. I know that in the last two months the Government of Madrid has proposed a reduction in night flights, after 11.00 p.m., but I also know that the measures that have been taken have not had any significant effect on the quality of life of the population. Let us hope that it will improve. Hence the opportunity for this debate, which we should thank Mr Lannoye for.</p>
<p class="contents">From the joint motion for a resolution, I would like to highlight some of the proposals – please excuse any repetition – which I believe the European Commission should take note of if it wants to reduce noise pollution: a global and integrated framework for reducing noise pollution which should lead to a framework directive with concrete and binding measures; the uniform application of those measures in all Member States so that there are no distortions; a Community framework for the classification of noise which will allow measures to be taken with the rigorous allocation of slots and a reduction in flights; and progress towards the establishment of a common air space, which is not in conflict with local and regional measures.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fifth framework programme for research it would be necessary to carry out an investigation into the design of aircraft, with a view to reducing its influence on noise pollution. We should also work towards the reduction and disappearance of night flights and the promotion of the railway.</p>
<p class="contents">In truth, Mr President, if everybody disliked aircraft as much as I do and travelled by rail as much as I do, perhaps we would have fewer problems.</p>
<p class="contents">All of this work should be done in conjunction with the populations and residents’ associations which are already pushing, throughout the whole of Europe, as in Spain, for a reduction in noise pollution, other types of pollution and a reduction in the enormous demand for air traffic. We should also cooperate in the creation of a noise map in local areas which would lead finally to a serious piece of work on the part of the European Community in favour of a reduction in noise pollution which is increasing as a result of demand.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I must say that many of the problems are the result of bad planning or no planning at all. The airports were built haphazardly and no practical assessment of the environmental impact was made as the towns, or certain parts of them, grew up around the airport structures. Regional planning is only a recent introduction, whereas airports have existed for a long time. The first flights to operate from Malpensa, for example, began as early as 1910. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are other structures which are public nuisances – landfill waste sites, for example, which are created from old quarries with no planning – but, in the case of airports, we see the consequences every day, or rather we hear them, for they fill our ears rather than offending our eyes.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, provision of information is poor. For example, many fingers are being pointed at cargo flights. Cargo flights generate neither more nor less noise than passenger flights. The amount of noise depends exclusively on the type of aircraft, not on what is being transported: a cargo Boeing 747 produces much less noise than a passenger Boeing 727. Consequently, a thorough knowledge of the facts is necessary even for debating purposes. </p>
<p class="contents">Then the legislative framework is also fairly complicated. Here, we have an example of the application of the principle of subsidiarity in its entirety, even extending beyond the European Union, for the standards are established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is a supranational body. I welcomed the Commission’s remarks regarding a European legislative framework. For example, as has already been said, we need to establish what is intended by the word “night”. Does night start at 10 p.m. or at midnight? Does it end at 5 a.m. or at 7 a.m.? This is something to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Another factor is the involvement of the local authorities, for every airport is different. The noise impact differs even within the same airport according to the runway used. For example, runway 25 of Fiumicino airport is next to the sea and hardly disturbs anybody at all, whereas if an aircraft were to take off from the right-hand section of runway 16 it would disturb half a million people or so from the Ostia and Fiumicino communities. Local authority involvement is therefore important, although, I must stress, it needs to be within a general European legislative framework. </p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, it would, on the whole, be feasible to eliminate night flights and ban them, although, I must stress, this must be done by taking specific local factors and also the type of aircraft used into consideration. It should not make much difference whether an aircraft has a built-in silencer or whether its silencer is fitted subsequently: the engine noise can be measured and an assessment made of whether the aeroplane is excessively noisy or not, irrespective of the date of manufacture or the type of silencer used. In any case, I would stress that we must not just concentrate on the individual factors in isolation but view the issue as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, in principle, a localised problem which should, as such, be solved by the competent authority of the relevant airport. Different airports are already working on this by issuing flight bans to the noisiest aircraft or by banning certain night flights. </p>
<p class="contents">This solution, however, is not sufficient, since aircraft are produced on a global market. Competition hinders such solutions, and creates the side-effect that more noise will be produced at other airports. In short, we are simply shifting the problem. Technically speaking, the problem is not that enormous. By using state-of-the-art technology, it is possible to produce aircraft which generate six times less noise than aircraft thirty years ago. Since the life-span of aircraft is about thirty years, the effect of these technical improvements are not felt for a long while. The question is whether this long wait is desirable. I do not think so. If we actually want to do something about aircraft noise, technical improvements will need to be implemented more quickly. The extra cost involved will obviously be passed on to the user, who will pay more for their airline tickets. The user should be fully aware of the actual costs of flying, including all environmental costs. For the sake of fair competition, this should be done on a global scale. </p>
<p class="contents">The proposal from the resolution, which, among other things, presses for making information on the level of noise pollution around different airports available in a readily understood format, is a step in the right direction. I also back the other proposals to reduce noise pollution. It should be clear that, ideally, the actual environmental costs should be brought into the equation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious that this will lead, in our densely populated States, to increasing noise pollution for citizens. I support all those who have stated here that solutions can only be found jointly. I come from the region around the Cologne-Bonn airport, an extremely densely populated region. We have tried to restrict the noise pollution for citizens. Every major attempt was simply answered by the companies with the announcement that they would switch to another airport. The airports of Liège and Maastricht are within a radius of almost 200 km. The companies are really not bothered about where they start and land their cargo planes, in particular. For this reason, I would like to urgently request that we find joint solutions which achieve both objectives: a competitive airline industry in Europe and adequate noise protection for our citizens in the vicinity of airports.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have surmised, Commissioner, from the Commission’s report that some basic conditions for this have still not been met. Firstly, it is obvious from the report that there is still no common method for calculating aircraft noise and, secondly, there is still no common method for monitoring basic data. I therefore come to my request: you have proposed specific measures to the Commission in your report. You have also set deadlines: the year 2001 for expiry of the old specification on noise emissions for old aircraft equipment. You have announced a strategy, which I welcome, for how the burden on particularly busy airports can be eased on the basis of objective data. However, you have not set any deadline for this.</p>
<p class="contents">My request to the Commission is that, together with the regions, you set deadlines, in the interests of both the companies and the citizens affected, which we can all work towards in a team effort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This sensitive issue takes us back to a recurring problem faced by all decision makers and politicians, whether they are local, national or, nowadays, European, and that is the problem of how to reconcile economic development with the need to safeguard the health and the standard of living of our fellow citizens. In effect, this embraces the three fields of technological, economic and regulatory considerations. </p>
<p class="contents">Although progress has unquestionably been made on the technological side, further progress is still essential in order to renew fleets of aircraft, particularly freight aircraft. The European Union must continue with its endeavours in the areas of research and technological development, equip itself with the means it needs to produce the standards envisaged, and give financial and technological support to all studies and programmes which make shared information available and which facilitate the modernisation of equipment with a view to limiting environmental disamenities. </p>
<p class="contents">However, at the same time, we have to take into account the economic aspect of the issue. Airport complexes are hives of intense economic activity and appeal; our intention to preserve jobs, reasserted in Lisbon, means that we do not have the right to avoid this issue. Any use of existing structures and the establishment of new infrastructures must conform to the legal instruments – the area-specific land use plans and national and regional development rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in terms of regulation, in the absence of standardised European rules, strict harmonisation of air traffic control and restrictions must be achieved in order to prevent dumping within the Union, a phenomenon familiar to us, which is governed by decisions taken simply at local level. We cannot allow this to continue. The citizens are waiting for decisions to be implemented within the relatively near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are discussing night flights, noise pollution and especially sleeping disorders. As a researcher who has examined the social effects of industrial labour, especially shift work, for years, I appreciate – and this has also been adequately proven scientifically – the seriousness of sleeping disorders and lack of sleep. Against this background, the entire discussion is relatively serious, bearing in mind Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s comments on “the brink of the night” and the way we are discussing noise pollution, and the lack of harmonisation. In the foreseeable future, we will discuss at great length the more general aspects of aviation and the environment within the committee, including the common noise classification schedules, how to provide economic incentives in connection with noise and how to achieve aircraft noise standards. However, one thing is still lacking from the discussion, namely that we will need the political courage to talk about restrictions, bans if necessary, for night flights during a certain period and reach common agreements on this.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem of night flights in a densely populated country such as Belgium is a very topical and extremely sensitive issue, especially since the Belgian Transport Minister issued a ban on night flights in Zaventem which, following a hefty row within the government, was withdrawn soon after. I believe that Mrs Van Brempt has outlined the dilemma very expertly. Tens of thousands of people live and sleep a stone’s throw away from the runway. 15% of the population are suffering as a result of the noise pollution generated by aircraft. Medical reports have shown that people living near airports are having to deal with health problems of an unacceptably serious nature, such as insomnia, high blood pressure, stress and depression. Needless to say, it makes no sense to ban night flights in one Member State alone. Businesses, such as DHL, will then simply move to airports in other Member States. As a result, we are at risk of finding ourselves in a downward spiral, where the citizens’ quality of life is pulled down with it. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sterckx has already pointed out, with good reason, that measures to reduce the effects for those living near airports should not promote distortion of competition. The increase in the number of noisy, obsolete and unlisted Russian aircraft, in particular, is the cause of unacceptable noise pollution, not to mention the risks for the environment and safety which such aircraft pose. In my town, Ostend, where the airport is situated in the centre of town, there have already been over 50 incidents, so far only leading to material damage. I therefore concur with Mrs Oomen, who advocates uniform framework legislation, which will reconcile the economic and employment interests with the care for public health, the environment and safety and which will apply to all airports within Europe. The much publicised and promised common framework for noise classification of aircraft could not be here soon enough, Commissioner, especially given the Russian situation. I also hope that the European Commission will not budge one inch from the position it has adopted with regard to hushkits and will not succumb to American pressure. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to ask that special attention be paid to the specific problems which smaller, regional airports have to contend with. They are fighting to remain profitable and are even unable to make the necessary investments to reduce noise pollution. This is why I would ask Europe, where possible, to help out in order to guarantee the viability of airports, but especially the quality of life of those living near them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament’s message was very clear, as might have been expected, for most of the Members who spoke represent the interests of citizens who live very close to airports. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it was pointed out, and very rightly so, that airports represent major economic factors and that, if we start to impose bans, there is a serious danger that this will have adverse implications for employment. </p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the question which arises is how to reconcile economics with preserving the standard of living. Clearly, the level of noise pollution from night flights varies from one airport to another, according to the topography of the areas and population density. This is why, for the time being, the Commission is not going to place a blanket ban on these flights. Moreover, very few airports in the Community impose a full curfew: Paris-Orly is the only one to impose a total ban on night flights. Munich and Berlin-Tegel limit night operations to mail freight. A general ban on night flights would therefore seriously disrupt air transport activities. Most large airports place restrictions on the use of the noisiest types of aircraft or employ economic instruments in order to limit their use. </p>
<p class="contents">There are, effectively, a number of alternatives to banning night flights used by various airports, all compatible with Community legislation on market access. A notable example is the use of a noise quota system such as that employed by the London airports, or a ban on using the noisiest runways during the night, which one very well-informed Member referred to. In addition, the use of flight paths which generate less noise pollution, avoiding sensitive districts during take-off and landing, and the application of differentiated airport tax, calculated according to the environmental characteristics of the aircraft, are some of the solutions currently employed. </p>
<p class="contents">The question now arises of how to proceed in the future, and, most importantly, when to act. Pages 34 and 35 of the communication on air transport and the environment contain an action plan setting forth a precise schedule. I will not bore you with the details. You have the documents in your possession. The Commission has absolutely no intention of postponing decisions on this matter indefinitely. It has committed itself to precise deadlines. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the regulatory framework, we aim to present it at the end of this year, or early next year at the very latest. This harmonised framework could include common reference points for measuring the operational noise levels to be limited or prohibited, a provision allowing operators sufficient time to come into line with the new operational restrictions and the establishment of a right for people living near airports to request consultation and negotiations on noise reduction objectives. The economic measures proposed also provide for differentiated treatment of airlines according to the characteristics of their aircraft. In addition, the Commission envisages the development of a code of conduct based on current best practice. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to reply to the question on the drafting of a new noise standard. The ICAO is currently working on drafting a new standard, and this is long overdue, for the present standards date from 1977 – ages ago. Given the long life of an aircraft – thirty years – clearly, the effects of a new standard will only be seen in the long term. This is why we are insisting on the fact that these new standards should be sufficiently ambitious to counteract the environmental effect of the fast-growing air industry. </p>
<p class="contents">In the short term, the Commission considers that rules stipulating the progressive, but rapid withdrawal of the oldest and noisiest aircraft are the best solution, especially for airports whose capacity is restricted by environmental constraints. And the best way to ensure the environmental efficiency of these rules is to act at a worldwide level within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, as the Commission is doing, in tandem with decision making at a purely European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for rules of procedure is that they guarantee democratic principles and obviously if, at some time, someone wishes to highlight a particular political problem, then they are perfectly within their rights to do so. If, however, a right is somehow abused, I am not sure if that abuse has anything to do with democratic ethics. I am speaking on a more general note here. In other words I am not sure if, in the final analysis, it has more to do with being obstructive than with proving that there is indeed a genuine problem.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Savary (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I welcome this point of order, for foresters and the forestry sector cannot wait for the outcome of these rather irregular debates which can only have one effect today, and that is to send out a message proclaiming that the European Parliament is made up of absentee Members, whereas most of our fellow Members, including those here today, are certainly not relaxing in front of their televisions but are working in the field. The issue is wider than that. In reality, this is nothing more than a feature of the anti-Strasbourg sniping which has developed. Let us be completely clear about this and not try to pretend it is otherwise or to evade the issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on the forestry sector. As it happens, we already expressed our sympathy, as we are wont to do, in a resolution of 20 January 2000, and requested that the Commission supply us with certain information and undertake to help those of our citizens – and they were numerous – who were in difficulties, for this disaster affected the whole of Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">Now, four months later, we are sufficiently removed from events to be able to learn both from what has been done and what has not, and we are expecting a tangible response from the Commission to this question. Did we actually intervene? Did we employ the means available to us? This time, we are not claiming appropriations for exceptional circumstances under the “natural disasters” heading. The sector is simply assessing the extent of its difficulties and the resulting risks – economic risks, security risks, that is to say fire risks, and also risks of non-reforestation, for if it is not possible to remove the wood in the coming weeks, many foresters would prefer to leave them where they are, and then the forestry sector will be in permanent difficulties, and with it the primary processing industry. </p>
<p class="contents">Four months on, the purpose of this oral question is therefore, Commissioners, to inform you, first and foremost, that the condition of the forestry sector is critical. In the space of two days, 193 million cubic metres of timber have flooded the market. The first question is that of price control and regulation of the market, since the cost of removing some low-quality species is now more than the market is willing to pay. We are familiar with the regulation of the market in the context of the common agricultural policy. We are not asking you to include timber in that policy, but it appears that Europe could have employed equivalent measures to assist the timber market during this exceptional crisis. It could have temporarily regulated the timber market for a period of several months. The question has been put to you. What action are you going to take? </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what have you done and what have you achieved with the means available? I refer to the means which allow us to grant exemptions from the competition laws to help exporters, for the cost of transportation of timber which has been exposed to fungal or parasite risk is totally unacceptable, provided that there is a buyer. If we want to support the market, we must support the transportation necessary for export to places further afield. Is the Commission prepared to take steps to do this? To what extent has it implemented Article 87(2) of the Treaty, which allows it to grant exemptions? To what extent, if at all, has it approached the WTO to request it to grant derogations? What has it done to set up means of remedying the natural disasters affecting the forestry sector? These are not virtual instruments. We have rules, such as Article 30 of Regulation 1257/1999. If it has not done so, what action does it intend to take in the forthcoming weeks? The matter is urgent. Finally, I call for the DOCUP development plans to give unequivocal consideration to the forestry sector and the timber industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I refer you to Mr Barnier’s speeches at the plenary sitting of 18 January 2000, when he stressed that the Commission would willingly employ every available means to assist the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, with regard to forest damage, I must also remind you that the European Parliament, notably in its resolution of 31 January 1997 on the forestry strategy of the European Union, and also the Council of the European Union, have repeatedly stressed that the Treaty does not lay down any specific competence for a Union forestry policy. Thus, the European Union does not have the necessary means to intervene in the way stipulated by the two resolutions. In effect, timber is not among the products listed in Annex I of the Treaty. There is no legal framework and timber cannot therefore be governed by a specific market policy, even temporarily. Although such actions are theoretically possible under WTO regulations, well-defined, solid legal, economic and commercial grounds would be necessary to persuade our trading partners to accept them. To date, the Commission has not received a detailed analysis justifying its taking such a step. I will come back to this point in a moment. </p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore, first and foremost, national aid to the timber industry which is the most appropriate means, at national, regional or local level, of supporting the worst affected forestry sites in the industry, and the Member States have to decide on the procedures for providing this aid. The Commission is therefore currently assessing the national aid systems notified to it by the national governments for alleviating the effects of hurricanes on the forestry sector according to the effects on competition at European level. The departments of the Commission are assessing these aid systems, particularly in the light of Article 87(2b) of the Treaty, which governs the compatibility of the aid envisaged by the Member States in the event of natural disasters. </p>
<p class="contents">The aid programmes notified by the French Government do, in fact, contain a general measure supporting the windfall transportation which may result in some of the timber being transported to countries outside the Union. The Commission stresses that Article 87, paragraph 2b of the Treaty does not constitute an exemption from GATT regulations as such, and we and our legal departments are assessing the compatibility of this measure with the Treaty on the basis of recent information. The French authorities may be requested to provide further information. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the joint financing of aid programmes proposed by Member States under Article 30 of Regulation EC/1257/99 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), I would further stress that the Commission is prepared to be extremely flexible. However, it is first of all up to the Member States to amend their initial programmes. In the meantime, two Member States, including France, have presented their adapted programmes, which now include a substantial section on bolstering the forestry industry following the storms at the end of 1999. In this context, actions are proposed for the removal, storage, transportation, protection and replenishment of the devastated forests in order to support the sector. These dossiers are currently under negotiation between the Commission and the Member States, but I can state here and now that the Commission’s attitude is favourable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Daul (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate you on the way you handled the debate this morning. You encountered a storm and weathered it without the help of the Commission. But Commissioner, I would also like, and I feel that this is essential, the institutions of the European Union to bear witness to the solidarity which unites the Member States, in particular in the event of exceptional disasters such as the storms of 26 December last which caused such unprecedented damage to a number of forest regions in France, Germany and Austria. </p>
<p class="contents">There is an urgent need for us to begin using the instruments available to the Union to assist the affected regions and support the individuals and companies concerned. The need for our support is all the more pressing given that transportation, storage and forest exploitation cannot be delayed without serious consequences in terms of both the quality of the products and the restoration and protection of forest ecosystems. Thus, in the Alsace region alone, more than 6.5 million cubic metres of woodland has been devastated, which is essentially equivalent to one to three years’ harvests. </p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the influx of timber onto the market will send prices plummeting and so further damage the industry’s economic operators. Once again, the way that the sector is structured may facilitate the search for joint solutions between the upstream operators which manage forestry resources and the downstream operators which exploit them. The inter-trade system introduced in France can certainly play a major part in the search for, and development of, these joint solutions. Indeed, since they are designed not to protect the interests of any one section of the industry, they facilitate the protection of the industry as a whole, promote the timber sector and ensure respect for the great internal balances which make it possible to consolidate the whole. Although regional in scale, inter-trade bodies also have a local impact and are immediately efficacious in critical situations such as that of our forestry companies and the timber industry. </p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore favour direct contacts with potential partners, even more so given that inter-trade bodies are also the consultative partners of local governments and national authorities with regard to defining forestry policies and hence with regard to the search for immediate solutions to crises. They are also able to identify bottlenecks in the implementation of safeguard programmes. This is why I ask you not to disregard direct consultation with the industry’s operators in your consultation mechanism. </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, regulations can be a constraint which varies according to the State in question, as is, notably, the case with regard to grain storage, in respect of the impermeability of the ground, the water sampling limits, which are set at 5% of the low water discharge in France and 30% in Germany and waste disposal monitoring. I therefore feel that exceptional measures should also be implemented. The scale of the disaster shows that the aid pledged by the State or confirmed at local level will not be sufficient to cover the damage reported. It is therefore essential to be able to draw on the Structural Funds to finance special measures for forests and the timber industry in the case of disasters in objective 2 or former objective 5b areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to rural development measures and other, more specific, economic or environmental programmes, in parallel with actions for using up workable timber, which represents about 50% of the windfall. It would also be desirable to promote incentive measures for using the poorer quality wood for energy production. However, the urgency of the situation calls for flexible, simplified procedures to financially supplement the provisions already introduced by the Member States</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon the Commission to seek consensus with the industry as a whole and the Member States concerned in order to find effective, immediate solutions, for the greater the consensus, the more effective the solutions will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Further south-west, in France, my parents spent many days in the dim light of the petroleum lamp which I had given to them once as a present. We do not know when and in what form the next disaster will strike.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me, therefore, to say something about the current problems and to expand on one aspect of the comments of my fellow MEP and friend, Gilles Savary. It concerns point 8 of the joint motion for a resolution in which we ask the Commission to create instruments which make it possible to take rapid and effective action within the European Union if we are faced with a crisis situation as a result of accidents or natural disasters. We presently have neither the money nor the infrastructure for this.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not in future rely on cross-border neighbourly aid as in the case of the storms at the end of the year. It was offered on a voluntary basis in an exemplary manner. It is also a healthy and important expression of solidarity. However, in itself it does not constitute a European solution. The European Union must take full responsibility for its citizens. The Commission must, therefore, quickly rack its brains to find instruments for rapid and effective emergency aid. We will expect proposals for solutions soon. We need have no qualms about making these proposals unconventional and bold. There will certainly be no lack of support from the European Parliament. The time has come to move on.</p>
<p class="contents">But first we must sort out the current consequences of the Christmas storms. This involves three things in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: we must not let the timber market collapse and must, therefore, directly intervene on behalf of the many small and medium-sized enterprises. Secondly: we must, as an exception, also support necessary transportation and exports of valuable timber to third countries. The Commission must urgently discuss the approval of export subsidies with the WTO. Thirdly: we must do everything we can to counter the risks of fungus, pest and fire so that the damage does not become even worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, when you say that national aid is the important thing now, then I would say to you that this also means that, in this instance, you do not want to organise the common European market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Barnier was very emphatic in his speech, assuring us that the European Union was, in effect, going to do something to help the victims. By victims I mean the small-scale foresters who have been ruined, but I am also referring to the small seaside businesses who now have to face the influx of tourists. Well, now we know that forests do not fall within the remit of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">So we are going to use part of the Structural Funds to finance emergency aid in the event of natural disasters. Yet we are well aware that this will take time. And, in this regard, may I say that the European Union’s policy consists of robbing Peter to pay Paul. We cannot support this policy, for it amounts to depriving some to provide for others, to the detriment of future projects. In my opinion, this is really not good enough, and we expect tangible measures from the Commission. The citizens are calling for immediate action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The resolutions deal mainly with the regulation of the timber market and export subsidies. </p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I would like to speak up on behalf of forestry workers, who receive no mention at all, even though it is their efforts which are keeping the timber sector going. The storms were more than just an environmental disaster for all of us and an economic problem for the profiteers of the timber sector. They have resulted in a sharp deterioration in the working conditions of foresters and lumberjacks, whose jobs are extremely dangerous at the best of times with the very highest accident rate which will continue to rise. The discomfort and danger involved in their profession is illustrated by the fact that there were over 100 casualties in the 1990 storms in Germany. The forestry workers’ salary is shamefully low – a mere 6900 francs. They are calling for a decent salary which offsets the risks involved in their job. They are demanding to be able to retire at 55 and calling for an improvement in their working conditions, which are still antiquated and result in the physical deterioration and sometimes death of a number of workers each year. We support these legitimate claims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has a duty to learn the lessons of the storm disaster, and strengthen the effectiveness of Community texts. Between the initial emergency period and the current challenges, with problems in the transportation, storage and sale of wood, there is a chronological gap corresponding to a gap in institutional support. This must be remedied and the States concerned must be awarded logistical support in the follow-up to the initial emergency period.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution last January, Parliament asked the Commission to submit practical proposals if it were found that the funds available for aid were insufficient. So what has become of these famous practical proposals? The Commission should use these proposals to prioritise its reaction to the slump in wood sales, for what we had feared is actually taking place, and it is becoming impossible to sell wood. And what measures has the Commission taken or planned to promote the immediate cultivation of damaged plots of land, without which the effective reconstruction of our forests cannot begin. Sadly, one merit of this ordeal is that it will have reminded us that wood is an industrial raw material, one that is, furthermore, essentially renewable.</p>
<p class="contents">The sustainable and efficient management of our forests requires an economically viable forest. Similarly, only sustainable forestry can provide a proper foundation for a competitive wood industry, while making a crucial contribution to the development of rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are, and must continue to be, the main operators in forestry policy in Europe. This must not, however, stop Europe pursuing the coordinated management of forestry issues. The sometimes extremely binding regulations governing the single market apply to forestry products. In return the Community must provide support for these products, especially at times of crisis. Community action in favour of the forestry sector is appropriate inasmuch as it creates added value for the national action which has been undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an ideal justification for the principle of subsidiarity, for instance in matters of protection against atmospheric pollution and forest fires, or forestry certification, and also in matters of support for the implementation of a world convention on forests.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Community initiatives in favour of the tropical forests, but I am astounded that there is not the same enthusiasm to come to the aid of our own devastated forests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Baden-Württemberg alone the accumulation of storm wood runs to about 25 million solid cubic metres. This equates to three times the average annual felling and this has already led to 30% lower timber prices. Just the cost of remedying the damage in Baden-Württemberg, the area for which I can speak as the delegate, runs to about DM 1.5 billion, of which DM 300 million are needed simply for reforestation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Hurricane Lothar is not a problem specific to Baden-Württemberg. France and other EU States have also been greatly affected. Nevertheless, the Commission has so far refused to make additional budgetary allocations available and prefers to cite, in this instance represented by Mrs Schreyer, the fact that final agreement has already been reached in the European Parliament on Budget 2000 and that the requirement for additional funds should be covered by the Member State in question from the funds already allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the redistribution of funds was made subject to approval and this approval has not yet been given. I consider the argumentation of Mrs Schreyer to be somewhat cynical when you consider that, only a few days later, she announced that the additional financial requirement of EUR 300 million for the EU Balkan commitment, which is undoubtedly important, would be covered by EUR 300 million from the agriculture budget without the farmers noticing it, and this includes forest owners.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress once again that we are dealing here with extremely long-term damage which may also have ecological implications. Tidying up, storage and reforestation all involve intense physical work. Commissioner, I know what I am talking about. I am a farmer. I have seen how the hurricane took the roof off our stable and I have seen the state our private woods are in. We were able to put things right ourselves but, by and large, this is not the case for all areas, all persons, all communities. You can see that. But that this is done quickly and efficiently and, above all, is sustained long term is an ecological necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">During his visit to the Black Forest on 16 February, the Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries, Dr Fischler, indicated broad flexibility within the existing financial framework for measures for rural development.

I am in complete agreement with the Members who have spoken on the matter and, believe me, the Commission would love to be able to do something about it. Yet neither the Treaties nor the budgetary regulations provide for this possibility. </p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, no Community framework exists which would allow the Commission to adopt initiatives to provide direct aid to the forestry sector. Moreover, the same applies within the framework of Regulation 1257/99. It is the Member State itself which has to adopt the necessary initiatives and provide for appropriate aid. According to the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission cannot direct resources from the rural development programme towards channels supporting the timber industry following storm damage. The Commission cannot apply competition regulations to authorise national aid or joint financing initiatives under the provisions of Regulation 1257/99. Moreover, negotiations are in progress with the Member States and I have made it quite clear that, within its institutional and legal capabilities, the Commission is doing everything in its power and more, and is being as flexible as it possibly can. </p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that the institutional authorities have decided that forestry policy is to be governed by subsidiarity, and that it does not fall within the competences of the Commission but is wholly the responsibility of the Member States. This is something which the Commission cannot change for the moment for that would mean amending the Treaty, although reform of the Treaties is currently being discussed. </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call upon all Members who are convinced that subsidiarity should not apply to forestry issues but should be the remit of the Community to make representations to their national governments to this effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Imagine if other citizens were to go about their work in the same way as those delegates who think that they have a four-day week here, even though the five-day week for the plenary meeting was agreed in Strasbourg. This Parliament has actually agreed, and I also say this to the delegates over there who want a democratic vote, that Friday will be a session day in Strasbourg. It is indeed a strange concept of democracy, and this also applies to the others who instigated this circus, if the opponents of Strasbourg are now using genuinely dirty tricks to sabotage Fridays.</p>
<p class="contents">I was a Member of this Parliament 35 years ago and in all my time I have never seen such abuse of the Rules. One really should expect delegates to respect a democratic decision reached by majority, such as that concerning our session calendar, even if it does not suit them. But they are bad losers and they really do not care that they have prevented important resolutions being taken for the citizens of the EU and, in particular, those who are starving in Ethiopia. This latter point is especially grave and reprehensible. I hope that those who instigated this procedural circus will be punished by the voters.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interest of forest owners, including in my own State where, to be fair, the last storm disaster was not as devastating as here, for example, in Alsace, I hope that measures will be taken by the EU, as proposed here, in order, above all, to prevent small and medium-sized enterprises going under ….</p>

I have noticed that some people say that there are people who are after a four-day week, but I am certainly not one of them. I am, however, of the opinion, that we need to work a proper five-day week, which is not happening at the moment, if the number of MEPs in attendance today is anything to go by. And this is why the problem has arisen. If Fridays were like Tuesdays or Wednesdays, then it would not have been necessary to have this debate and the counts here today.

Our position is that we have concerns about the Union’s courts having responsibility for forestry policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can I fail to mention the fact, which has already been referred to here, that the saboteurs of this morning’s sitting did not take part in the vote, and I am delighted that the PPE has suggested a nominal vote, which will clarify the matter. There is a French saying about the <span class="italic">arroseur arrosé </span>– the biter being bit. Here we have the <span class="italic">saboteur saboté</span> – the saboteur hoist with his own petard. It is deplorable that we have been involved in this circus. Those concerned could have made a point of order, since it is an important issue that the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents have to address. But they went too far. They showed no consideration for Ethiopia and sabotaged the votes. They then suggested a nominal vote so a count could be taken. As we can see, however, when we take a decision here on an issue related to storms, disasters or Europe’s interests, that is, serious matters, they are no longer present. Almost none of the 32 gladiators were present for the final vote, which is utterly deplorable and which clearly reveals the true intentions of those who destabilised this morning’s sitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I am of the opinion that those who wish to ensure that the work of Parliament continues to be carried out should also be present.

Commissioner, with regard to the forestry issue, I would like to say that, although your openness has sometimes made your words difficult to accept, you have, at least, been frank, in contrast with those declarations made at the time of the incidents, which may have been rather rash. I sincerely feel that your approach is far more beneficial to the credibility of the European Union than the tone of the declarations made when the issue first arose, which led us to believe that Europe was much more involved than it actually intended to be. </p>
<p class="contents">The subject of the forestry sector is now open to debate, and we must take up the issue of natural disasters as well, for we cannot endeavour to draw closer to our citizens and then explain to them that we are unable to help them when they are in trouble, while, at the same time, we are sending task forces abroad. This is a matter of genuine symbolic and political significance. So thank you. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my support for the comments of Mr Daul, who worked together with Evelyne Gebhardt to draft this resolution on the timber industry, and to express my regret and shock at the fact that we have exploited the plight of the people of Ethiopia to further our petty games. Petty games which are not acknowledged, moreover, for although, effectively, the right does exist to request that the quorum be tested and also to bring up the issue of Friday working, it is blatantly obvious that this morning’s events were an attack by the anti-Strasbourg faction. And, even more seriously, it appears that this incident may well be repeated every Friday. We do, however, have one small consolation in that it will not be long before their refusal to participate affects those who were conspicuous by their absence today and who managed to derail this morning’s sitting. </p>
<p class="contents">We simply need to return to the issue of the agenda again as soon as possible. It is a well-known fact, and I am publicly admitting it before all those here today, that the Chamber is never full because Parliament’s work is specialised. Nevertheless, we must stop trying to hide...</p>

I have been in this House for 21 years in all, although only 6 of those as a parliamentarian. I have taken part in every Friday session for 21 years, even when I had another job and was not a delegate. In this regard, I would also like to thank the staff who work so exceptionally on Fridays. However, irrespective of that, I would like to say that I have repeatedly seen such attempts over these 21 years. For this reason we introduced a quorum for determining the quorum because we wanted to rescue Fridays. That is how all this came about.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to say to Mr Meijer that at some point it was also decided that we would pass legislative resolutions from Tuesday to Thursday and not on Fridays, for which the quorum is not prescribed as compulsory, when we would deal with issues which are not controversial so that resolutions which are not controversial, but important nevertheless, can be passed. That was the consensus, and this consensus was reached here. Perhaps it is a healthy shock and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is perhaps right. But I would ask you to clearly understand that Friday was never intended for legislative resolutions. These resolutions are not legislative. They are, however, important and they are consensual. We should therefore be able to pass them peacefully and in a dignified manner, and that is why, at the end of the day, we have passed them peacefully and in a dignified manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>The French newspaper 'Le Monde' recently featured a report stating that Albanian 'white-slavers' had taken advantage of the war in Kosovo and the illegal immigration networks operating between Albania and Italy and were sexually exploiting some three hundred thousand women - mostly from Kosovo, but also from Moldavia, Romania and Bosnia - in France, Germany and Belgium. The women are forced into prostitution by threats and violence, and the Albanian pimps often pretend to be Kosovars in order to acquire refugee status. Will the Council say what measures it is taking and what policies it is promoting to combat this phenomenon, whether it has any data on the increased movement of women from Eastern European countries, what results have been achieved by various programmes and what is being done to promote the harmonisation of the penal legislation of the Member States and to coordinate efforts to combat the trade in women?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>1.	On 1 January, the Council and the European Parliament adopted a Community action programme on preventive measures for combating violence against women, known as the Daphne programme 2000-2003. This programme, based on Article 152 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, is another measure to be added to the series of measures that the Council has adopted since 1996 to combat the sexual exploitation of and the trafficking in human beings. Most notably, the Council has extended its definition of the crime of ‘trafficking in human beings’ in the Europol Convention, to include the exploitation of prostitution, other forms of sexual exploitation and the production, sale and distribution of child pornography.</p>
<p>2.	With regard to cooperation with third countries, I would draw the honourable Member’s attention to the 1950 United Nations Convention, designed to suppress trafficking in human beings and the exploitation of prostitution. I must also point out that the International Organisation for Migration, based in Geneva, is extremely active in the prevention of trafficking in women and of violence against women throughout the world, including Kosovo.</p>
<p>3.	The Council is fully aware of the problems the honourable Member has raised and of the need to take account of the extremely vulnerable position of victims and witnesses. Progress has been made in the Member States in reviewing current legislation and practices and in classifying these forms of behaviour as crimes, punishable by sentences which are specific, proportionate and which will act as a deterrent. It is hoped that the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which is due to be signed shortly, will be a factor in making further progress.</p>
<p>4.	The future stabilisation of the situation in the Balkans will contribute towards resolving problems connected to trafficking in women, to their sexual exploitation and to their illegal immigration.</p>
<p>5.	The Member States and the European Commission are playing an active role in the negotiations under way at the United Nations for a protocol on the prevention, suppression and punishment of trafficking in human beings, particularly of women and children, which will complement the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0290"></a>

<p>On 29 February, the Constitutional Court in Bulgaria declared a Macedonian-based political party, OMO 'Ilinden' – PIRIN – unconstitutional. This party was registered in 1999 and took part in the municipal elections in October last year, when it elected five local officials. This decision could lead to an effective ban of the party, deprivation of its juridical person status, confiscation of its property and the impossibility to take part in elections. This party has always declared that it would respect the constitutional and legal system of Bulgaria and carry out activities peacefully.</p>
<p>Is the Council of the opinion that this decision violates the right to freedom of association and constitutes a discrimination against a national minority? Has the Council asked for any explanation to the Bulgarian authorities? If not, is the Council going to intervene?</p>

<p>The Council has been informed of the decision of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court to declare the party OMO ‘Ilinden’, PIRIN, unconstitutional.

<p>At the present time, for its own part, the Council can only reiterate the need for candidate countries to comply with all the political and economic Copenhagen criteria for accession to the European Union, and repeat its intention to continually monitor the way in which candidate countries apply these criteria and to take appropriate action should it consider that the principles of democracy and respect for human rights and minority rights have been contravened.</p>
<p>In this context, it should also be pointed out that the Commission will take all the political events of the previous year into account when drawing up its next periodic report, which will be presented to the Council, on the progress which Bulgaria has made in the pre-accession process. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0296"></a>

<p>In respect of the coordination between the accession countries and Europol, may I draw the honourable Member's attention to the following activities undertaken within the framework of the Council:</p>
<p>Article 42 of the Europol Convention provides that in so far as it is relevant for the performance of its tasks, Europol shall establish and maintain relations with third countries. The Council has adopted a number of legal instruments in which the rules applicable to these relations are laid down. Those instruments are:</p>
<p>a) the Council Act of 3 November 1998 laying down rules concerning the receipt by Europol of information from third parties;</p>
<p>b) the Council Act of 3 November 1999 laying down rules governing Europol's external relations with third States and non-European Union related bodies; and</p>
<p>c) the Council Act of 12 March 1999 adopting the rules governing the transmission of personal data by Europol to third countries and third bodies.</p>
<p>On the basis of these instruments the Council, at its meeting of 27 March 2000, authorised the Director of Europol to start negotiations in order to establish formal relations with a number of third countries and bodies.</p>
<p>The accession countries are among those third countries listed in the aforementioned authorisation. In the annexed declaration the Council calls upon the Director of Europol to give top priority to negotiations with the accession countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0316"></a>

<p>I am glad to be able at last to give a very positive report to the honourable Member, who, as we all know, has followed developments in EU-Croatia relations very closely over the last few years. Let me just underline that the change of policy on the part of the Union towards Croatia has been triggered by the recent political change in Croatia following democratic elections, and the firm commitment of the new Croatian leadership to push ahead with political and economic reform, and to respect fully its international commitments. We think that Croatia can become a catalyst for the region, and the Union has already taken very concrete steps to show its support for the new approach in Zagreb.</p>
<p>Hence, following the positive outcome of the free and fair elections in early January 2000, the Council, on 26 January and 14 February, when the new Croatian Prime Minister, Mr Racan, met EU Ministers, decided:</p>
<p>1) to invite the Commission to prepare a study on the feasibility of opening negotiations with Croatia on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement;</p>
<p>2) to put in place rapidly a joint EU-Croatia Consultative Task Force which will provide Croatia with expertise and technical assistance in all areas of common interest;</p>
<p>3) to send the Ministerial Troika to Zagreb as a further sign of support for the new leadership - the Troika was in Zagreb on 29 March and came back with good news on plans for the reform of election laws, the media, the return of refugees and cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal.</p>
<p>In conclusion, EU-Croatia relations are presently being substantially upgraded, which is what both sides want. If the Commission's study, which is expected to be presented to the June GAC is positive, the Council will ask the Commission to prepare a mandate for negotiating a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0319"></a>

<p>At the recent summit in Lisbon, the Council committed itself to combating social exclusion. Given the large numbers of people, in both rural and urban areas, who are living close to poverty, perhaps because their skills are no longer required, what specific measures would the Council envisage to facilitate the full integration of the socially excluded into the workforce and to allow them to participate fully in the advantages of a knowledge-based society?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As the honourable Member pointed out, Heads of State or Government meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000 undertook to combat social exclusion. In the presidency conclusions various specific measures were cited, and, in particular, the following objectives were set:</p>
<p>-	a substantial annual increase in per capita investment and human resources;</p>
<p>-	the number of 18-24 year-olds within lower-secondary level education who are not in further education and training should be halved by 2010;</p>
<p>-	Internet access for all schools and training centres;</p>
<p>-	a European framework should define the new basic skills to be provided through life-long learning: IT skills, foreign languages, technological culture, entrepreneurship and social skills;</p>
<p>-	promoting digital literacy throughout the Union;</p>
<p>-	defining the means for fostering the mobility of students, teachers and training and research staff;</p>
<p>-	developing a common European format for curricula vitae.</p>
<p>With regard to fighting social exclusion, the European Council deemed ‘the number of people living below the poverty line and in social exclusion in the Union unacceptable’; for that reason, the Council provided for steps to be taken to make a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty by setting ‘adequate targets to be agreed by the Council by the end of the year’. The Council further observed that ‘the best safeguard against social exclusion is a job’, and highlighted the need to ‘improve skills, promote wider access to knowledge and opportunity and fight unemployment’. Finally, the European Council believed that ‘policies for combating social exclusion should be based on an open method of coordination combining national action plans and a Commission initiative for cooperation in this field to be presented by June 2000’.</p>
<p>In particular, the European Council invited the Council and the Commission to:</p>
<p>-	promote a better understanding of social exclusion through continued dialogue and exchanges of information and best practice, on the basis of commonly agreed indicators; </p>
<p>-	mainstream the promotion of inclusion in Member States’ employment, education and training, health and housing policies;</p>
<p>-	develop priority actions addressed to specific target groups (for example, minority groups, children, the elderly and the disabled).</p>
<p>Finally, the Council ‘will pursue its reflection on the future direction of social policy on the basis of the Commission communication, with a view to reaching agreement on a European social agenda at the Nice European Council in December, including the initiatives of the different partners involved’.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0326"></a>

<p>In May 1999, the Development Council adopted a resolution in which it confirmed its sustained interest in fulfilling the European Union’s commitments to make a contribution to combating the destabilising accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons, pointing out that a lack of control has fuelled interstate conflict and constituted an obstacle to peaceful economic and social development. Furthermore, the Council made several recommendations relating to development cooperation, such as the inclusion of the small arms issue in the political dialogue with the ACP and the need to reverse the ‘cultures of violence’.

<p>1. I can confirm to the honourable Member that the Council remains extremely concerned about the destabilising accumulation and proliferation of small arms and light weapons. As the future agreement with the ACP countries, on which negotiations have been completed, provides for enhanced dialogue with these countries, the issue of small arms and light weapons could be part of the political dialogue with the ACP. I can confirm that the Council intends to review the progress made in implementing the Development Council Resolution adopted on 21 May 1999, on the basis of the Commission's report on the issue of peace building and conflict prevention as soon as this report is available.</p>
<p>2. As the honourable Member is aware, the EU Code of Conduct on arms exports was adopted on 8 June 1998 with a view to setting high common standards to be regarded as the minimum for the management of, and restraint in, conventional arms transfers by all Member States, and strengthening the exchange of relevant information between them with a view to achieving greater transparency.</p>
<p>Control of the end-use of arms delivered is provided for in Criterion Seven of the Code. A number of points are set out which Member States are to consider when assessing the risk that exported goods might be diverted to an undesirable end-user. The implementation of arms export policies, and therefore of the Code, remain the responsibility of the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0328"></a>

<p>Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community opens up new possibilities with regard to combating discrimination of all kinds, and the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 invited the Commission to submit proposals for the application of this Article as soon as possible. The Portuguese Presidency made the fight against discrimination one of the priorities of the first half of 2000, a concern confirmed by the Employment and General Affairs Council of 13 March, which stated its desire to see the two directives and the programme adopted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Council welcomes the fact that Parliament has agreed to try to return its opinion on the directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin in May. The Council trusts that Parliament will adopt with all due dispatch its opinions on the directive concerning equal treatment in employment and occupation and the action programme which accompanies these proposals.</p>
<p>At the meeting of the parliamentary Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs of 21 March 2000, the Commission representative stated that the Commission would submit an amended proposal for a directive taking account of Parliament’s amendments. The Council, for its part, will be following Parliament’s work closely, even before the opinion is adopted, and before the Commission submits an amended proposal, and will, of course, closely scrutinise Parliament’s points of view, priorities and recommendations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0330"></a>

<p>In replying to the honourable Member's question, I would like to recall that the European Reconstruction Agency was set up by Council Regulation No 2454/1999 of 15 November 1999, the so-called ‘OBNOVA’ Regulation dealing with EC assistance to South-Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Article 17 of the Regulation sets up a Governing Board, which consists of one representative from each Member State and two from the Commission. The Governing Board is chaired by the Commission and takes decisions by two-thirds majority. The President does not vote.</p>
<p>As far as the language arrangements for the Agency are concerned, these are, however, according to Article 17, decided unanimously by the Board.</p>
<p>The Governing Board, meeting once a month, held its first meeting just before Christmas. It has adopted its rules of procedures, but not yet the language arrangements for the Agency. The President of the Governing Board has, in the meantime, at the meetings of the Board, introduced preliminary ad hoc solutions to the Board as far as language arrangements are concerned.</p>
<p>It is obviously necessary for the Governing Board to find a permanent solution to the language arrangements. At the same time, let us not forget, that the Agency has only just started its operations. The Council is confident that the President of the Governing Board will conduct business in a responsible manner and that a language arrangement acceptable to all will soon be agreed, which will allow the Agency to carry out its important task in a quick and flexible way, bearing in mind the urgent reconstruction needs in the region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0340"></a>

<p>The Council is of the view that considerable efforts will be required by the Central and Eastern European States in order for them to be able to meet the requirements of environmental legislation and implement it effectively, particularly through the establishment of the necessary administrative structures.</p>
<p>For this reason, environmental protection has been identified as high priority in the Accession Partnerships with these countries.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to help them to implement environmental legislation, the Union provides a financial contribution through the Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession, established by a Council Regulation in June 1999.</p>
<p>The EU has Association agreements with all candidate countries. Among other features these agreements provide for the gradual removal of obstacles to trade in goods and the provision of services, including the right of establishment, competition rules and public procurement. Thus, EU companies have a favourable legal environment that affords them the same treatment as local companies.</p>
<p>It is up to EU industries specialising in environmental protection to look for business opportunities in this context.

<p>In October 1998, the European Parliament urged all Member States to grant visa-free access to holders of HKSAR passports.</p>
<p>However, thus far, a European Union’s visa policy has been subject to partial harmonisation only. The current regulation (No 574/99 of 12 March 1999) restricts itself to establishing a list of those third countries whose nationals must hold a visa in order to cross the Member States’ external borders and to stipulating, pursuant to the provisions of its Article 2, that it is up to the Member States to decide whether nationals of third countries which do not appear on this list are subject to the visa obligation or not.</p>
<p>With regard to the holders of HKSAR passports, Council Regulation No 574/99 provides in a footnote to the aforementioned list that ‘in respect of China, this does not include the Hong-Kong Special Administrative Region. Article 2 applies: ‘Member States may decide whether to maintain their visa requirements in respect of such persons’. Under these circumstances, by excluding HKSAR passport holders from the common list, and taking account of the limits inherent in any partial harmonisation, the Council may be deemed to have followed up Parliament’s request.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on 26 January 2000, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission presented a proposal for a Council regulation on the basis of Article 62(2)(b)(i) of the EC Treaty, establishing the list of third countries whose nationals are subject to visa obligations before crossing external borders, and the list of those third countries whose nationals are exempt. Amongst the territorial bodies and authorities for whose nationals the Commission proposes visa exemption are both the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions. This proposal is currently under discussion in Council, and the European Parliament was consulted by letter of 16 March 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0348"></a>

The problem with MTBE and closely related ETBE is that they take longer to break down in water than the corresponding alcohols, methanol and ethanol. MTBE and ETBE, like ethanol and methanol, have been proposed as low-level petrol additives as a first step towards introducing renewable fuels into our petrol tanks without the need to change engines.</p>

<p>The Commission has decided that the Internal Audit Service (IAS) should report to the Vice-President for Reform in order to enable the President to maintain his impartiality. This is entirely in line with footnote 98 of the Committee's Second Report which acknowledges that the President may wish to delegate his competence vis-à-vis the Internal Audit Service to a Vice-President.</p>
<p>In addition, the fact that the IAS will be set up under the authority of the Vice-President for Reform does not mean that its own level of independence will not be assured. As stated in action 68 of the White Paper ‘Reforming the Commission’, ‘the Head of IAS will need to have the same independence as is currently guaranteed by the Financial Reform to the Financial Controller, thereby enjoying autonomy in the conduct of internal audits, the maintenance of professional standards and the contents of reports’. The Head of IAS will be independent of other services and will have access to the President of the Commission and the College whenever necessary (action 69 of the White Paper).</p>
<p>The role of the Internal Audit Service will be primarily to review the internal control systems within the Commission. It represents a key element in the Commission's new framework for resource management and internal auditing and will have to meet the highest standards in terms of management, competence and capacity.</p>
<p>As stated in the White Paper ‘Reforming the Commission’, each Directorate-General (DG) will set up a specialised audit capability, reporting directly to the Director-General, to carry out reviews of the internal control system of the DG as well as reviews of the management and use of Commission funds paid to external beneficiaries.</p>

<p>The consistent policy of the Commission has been in favour of merit and against discrimination between candidates on account of their national origin. That policy will continue.</p>

<p>The Article also specifies that ‘no posts shall be reserved for nationals of any specific Member State’.</p>
<p>The Commission fully observes those provisions, not only because they have legal force but also because it considers that high ability is essential for officials and, in a multinational public administration, it is sensible and necessary to seek to sustain reasonable geographical balance between the national origins of its staff.</p>
<p>As outlined in action 26 of the Reform Strategy White Papers, the issues of sustaining necessary geographical balance and ensuring proven merit amongst candidates for recruitment will be addressed by wide publication of the notices announcing competitions, and by ensuring that recruitment tests take account of the multicultural character of the European Union.

The Commission has not taken any new or recent decisions concerning public access to the annual declarations of the members of the scientific committees. The situation continues to be as explained in some detail in my response to written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-5-1999-2148_EN.html">E-2148/99</a> from the honourable Member, in December 1999. The situation is essentially as follows and applies to all of the nine scientific committees that fall within my competence:</p>
<p>Members are obliged by Article 6 of Commission Decision 97/759/EC:</p>
<p>to act independently of all external interests;</p>
<p>to inform the Commission each year of interests which may be considered prejudicial to their independence;</p>
<p>to declare any specific interest at each meeting.</p>
<p>When establishing their own internal rules of procedure, all nine of the Committees agreed that annual declarations could be made public with the agreement of the individual member. This is consistent with Parliament and Council Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data.</p>
<p>As to the specific questions raised by the honourable Member, the Commission would make the following observations:</p>
<p>The declarations themselves are provided on a standard form for each committee. The form requires Members to explicitly state that they either:</p>
<p>have no declarations to make concerning potential conflicts arising from direct or indirect interests,</p>
<p>or,</p>
<p>to declare any interests as appropriate.</p>
<p>It has not been considered necessary to request information on the level of commercial involvement or the size of any remuneration associated with such interests.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken the view that the requirement for independence and transparency in the workings of the scientific committees are served by knowledge of the existence of a potential conflict of interest, not by its size.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0292"></a>

<p>The Commission would like to thank the honourable Member for asking its intentions as regards the reduction and, in the long run, the prohibition of antibiotics in animal feed in the Community, as well as the timetable foreseen.</p>
<p>The Commission has indeed announced in its White Paper on Food Safety that it will pursue the prohibition or phasing-out of antibiotics used as growth promoters, as part of its broad policy to control and contain antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>The Commission submitted to the Council in December 1998 a proposal for a Regulation suspending the use of four antibiotics in feedingstuffs. As a result of this, only four antibiotics remain authorised as additives in feedingstuffs.</p>
<p>On 28 May 1999, the Scientific Steering Committee of the Commission adopted an opinion on antimicrobial resistance and gave recommendations to contain antibiotic resistance, which the Commission intends to follow.</p>
<p>As regards antibiotic feed additives, it recommends that the use of agents even from classes which may be used in human or veterinary medicine should be phased out as soon as possible and ultimately abolished.</p>
<p>The Committee recommends that the phasing-out must be progressive, in order to allow changes in animal husbandry practices to be put in place.</p>
<p>As announced in the White Paper, in order to follow the Steering Committee recommendations, medium-term action is needed from the Commission.</p>
<p>The honourable Member will understand that a careful analysis of the implications for third countries, in particular in the context of the World Trade Organisation, Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement (WTO)-SPS, has to be done.</p>
<p>It is the intention of the Commission to adopt, by July 2001 at the latest, a proposal for amending Directive 70/524/EEC on additives in feedingstuffs.</p>
<p>Besides other modifications, a change in the policy of additives in feedingstuffs, like a general ban on antibiotics, could be introduced, with provisions allowing a smooth phasing-out.</p>
<p>The problem of antibiotic resistance and its control remains a very important priority for the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0311"></a>

<p>The Commission is very aware of the complaints about the treatment of the animals during this event. The inadequate slaughterhouse capacities in certain urban areas of France is one of the reasons for the observations made with regard to treatment of animals during the festival.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the French authorities must find practical solutions for the problem concerning slaughterhouse capacity. Treatment of animals which causes suffering during restraint and slaughter is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Member States are responsible for the enforcement of Community legislation concerning the slaughter and killing of animals in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 93/119/EC on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing.</p>
<p>The Commission has been in contact with the French authorities concerning the need to improve arrangements. It had received, prior to the festival, reassurances that the French authorities were taking a wide range of measures including close contacts with the different Islamic cultural groups to involve them more widely in discussions on this issue in order to improve the situation with a view to achieving better animal welfare and hygiene conditions.</p>

<p>The Commission would refer the honourable Member to its answer already given to the earlier similar written question no 381/1999 by Mr Alavanos.</p>
<p>The Scientific Committee for Food expressed an opinion<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> in January 1999 on caffeine, taurine and glucuronolactone as constituents of so-called energy drinks.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded for caffeine ‘that the contribution of energy drinks to the total caffeine intake does not appear to be a matter of concern for adults. For children however, who do not normally consume much tea or coffee, and who might substitute ‘energy’ drinks for cola and other soft drinks, consumption of ‘energy’ drinks might represent an increase in daily caffeine exposure compared with their previous intake. Such intake could result in behavioural changes, such as increased arousal, irritability, nervousness or anxiety. For pregnant women the Committee advised moderation of intake from whatever source of caffeine’.</p>
<p>Given the above the Commission, following discussions on the matter with the Member States, intends to put forward proposals for labelling provisions regarding the caffeine content of products.</p>
<p>As regards the other constituents evaluated (taurine and glucuronolactone), the Scientific Committee for Food was unable to conclude that the safety in use of these substances in the concentrations contained in certain so called ‘energy drinks’ has been adequately established.</p>
<p>Further research is clearly required in this area. Research projects on the subject would be eligible to be submitted to Key Action 1 (Food, Nutrition and Health) of the Quality of Life of the Research and technological development (RTD) Programme.</p>
<p>The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it will give its strong support to any such projects if they meet the scientific quality and other criteria required by that programme.</p>

One is Council Directive 92/52/EEC on infant formula intended for export to third countries and the other is Council Resolution 92/C 172/01 on the marketing of breast-milk substitutes in third countries by Community-based manufactures.</p>
<p>Directive 92/52/EEC is exceptional in that it renders Community rules on composition and labelling of infant formulae applicable to products manufactured in the Community and exported to third countries unless, of course, the third countries require otherwise.</p>
<p>Resolution 92/C 172/01 states that although the Community cannot legislate for third countries it will contribute to the application of appropriate marketing practices for breast-milk substitutes in third countries by Community-based manufactures. For this reason, and as required by the resolution, the Commission has instructed its delegations in third countries to serve as contact points for the competent authorities of the third countries to notify any complaints with respect to the marketing practices in their territory by a manufacturer based in the Community.

<p>Under the third and fourth framework programmes for R&amp;D, the Commission has financed a number of projects to identify the effects of electromagnetic radiation (radiofrequencies – RF) on health. The first was a COST action (COST 244 in 1992, followed by COST 244b in 1998) on the biomedical effects of electromagnetic radiation. This action is still underway. The BIOMED 2 programme also provided funding for two studies on the links between electromagnetic radiation and cancer.</p>
<p>The ‘Measurement and Testing’ programme funded a project to measure the electromagnetic radiation emitted by mobile telephones and relay stations, as well as to quantify human exposure. The results of this project will be useful in establishing standards for the measurement and evaluation of risks from mobile telephones and relay stations.</p>
<p>The total budget the Commission allocated to these studies was in the order of EUR 2 million. None of these studies (covering thermal effects and possible cellular metabolic disturbance due to the various types of electromagnetic field) has produced results demonstrating adverse health effects, but research must continue in order to allay public concerns.</p>
<p>Research into the effects of electromagnetic radiation are conducted under the fifth framework programme, and more specifically under the work programme for Key Action 4 (Environment and Health) of thematic programme 1, (Quality of life and management of living resources). Following the call for research proposals in 1999, five proposals were adopted, with total funding of approximately EUR 9 million. These projects have just been started, and the results will be available in 3 to 4 years’ time.</p>
<p>These projects include a large-scale epidemiological study (Interphone), coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), to investigate whether the electromagnetic radiation emitted by mobile telephones may be carcinogenic. This study will include a breakdown of results according to the emission levels of each type of mobile telephone. The other projects are aimed at improving our understanding of the biological mechanisms by which electromagnetic radiation may have an influence on human health.</p>
<p>The Council recommendation of 12 July 1999 – (1999/519/EC) limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields from 0 Hz to 300 GHz, including radiofrequencies – advocates basic restrictions and reference levels making it possible to protect the public from the scientifically proven effects of non-ionising radiation. This recommendation is based on the scientific data submitted by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) to the Commission and confirmed by the Commission’s scientific steering committee.</p>
<p>At present, we do not have reliable information to prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship between the level of radiation emitted by mobile telephones and any possible health effects. In the absence of standards describing the methods of measurement, the Commission has drafted a mandate to the European Standardisation organisations asking for general measurement method standards, generic standards as well as product standards for certain types of products. The generic standards will contain limits for emissions of electromagnetic fields (EMF) from apparatus, based upon a ‘backward calculation’ from the exposure limits given in the Council Recommendation of 12 July 1999. In the absence of accredited standards, it would be premature to label telephones with radiation emission levels.</p>
<p>The text of the Council recommendation calls for it to be revised within a maximum period of 5 years. The Commission, which is monitoring the situation closely, shall, if necessary, make use of its right to make proposals prior to this date if the results of scientific research in progress under its auspices should show that there is any risk.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0256"></a>

<p>The Commission has no intention to raise the question of reciprocal refund of sales taxes to tourists with the United States.</p>
<p>In fact, the Community VAT legislation does not provide any government mechanism for refunding VAT to tourists leaving the Community. Such a tax relief only exists for exports by traders or producers ensuring in this way competitiveness of Community-products outside the Community (– depending on the value of the goods purchased – they may be subject to customs duties and consumption taxes in the country of arrival).</p>
<p>However, tourists resident outside the Community, including tourists resident in the United States, may – indirectly – benefit from that general VAT exemption available to traders as the trader is allowed also to exempt goods that are physically taken out of the Community by such a tourist. In that case, the tourist will have to send back to the trader a proof of exportation – a customs confirmation – so that the tax exemption can be justified to the fiscal authority. This legislative framework leaves it for the trader to decide whether he wants to make use of this facility and, in the affirmative, by which of the legally possible mechanisms. In conclusion, the relief is not designed as a specific right for a tourist.</p>
<p>To be on the safe side, many traders prefer that their customers pay VAT inclusive at the time of purchase. To make use of the export relief they then offer to their customer the possibility to obtain partial cash refund on the presentation of the relevant export documentation at a private VAT refund agency that is located in the airport of departure.</p>
<p>As the Community based trader is the beneficiary of the VAT exemption there is no policy reason to introduce at this level any sort of reciprocity approach comparing the tax relief available in the United States – or other countries – and the Community.</p>
<p>In addition, we should bear in mind the very diverse situation within the United States where the application of sales and use taxes currently falls within the competence of the states. Five States, for example, do not apply sales and use taxes; most states provide the possibility to exempt transactions where the goods will be transported to a destination outside the source state, although the conditions attached to this facility are usually more restrictive than those applied in the Community.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0261"></a>

<p>However, the article has been carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions in order to ensure that it would not regulate intelligence activities and that only criminal investigations would be covered.

<p>The Commission is of the opinion that Article 191 of the Treaty, in its present form, does not constitute a legal basis for financing European political parties. That article recalls the importance of political parties at the European level. It does not, however, confer any powers on any institution to commit expenditure to support European political parties nor does it set out a procedure for the adoption of a measure which would provide for such expenditure to be made.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Commission considers that the inclusion in the Treaty of a proper legal basis for such expenditure to be made would offer the best legal security for the future.</p>
<p>The Intergovernmental Conference should be seized of this request.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0270"></a>

<p>If the Morrazo Peninsula is located within a zone eligible under Objective 1, then any of the Structural Funds may be applicable. As this is a region highly dependent on fisheries, it is the FIFG (financial instrument for fisheries guidance) which particularly comes to mind.</p>
<p>The FIFG may, in particular, cofinance individual premiums for fishermen wishing to convert to activities other than fishing off the coast (Article 12.3.c of EC Regulation No 2792/1999) and also programmes for the conversion of fishing fleets which have suffered from the failure to renew the fisheries agreement (Article 16.1.b of the same regulation).</p>
<p>Among the Community initiatives adopted for the period 2000-2006, there are two, which may be applicable to the area, in question. These are the Interreg programme, targeting development of the European territory, and the Leader programme, targeting rural development.</p>
<p>The region of Galicia is, in any case, involved in the Interreg ‘Atlantic area’ programme under current programming. This programme has funded studies on the subject of fishing. The region of Galicia should also be involved in the schemes of the forthcoming Interreg 3B cooperation programme for 2000-2006.</p>
<p>If it proves eligible, the plan drawn up by the mayors of the Morrazo district may, in principle, belong to the category of actions cofinanced by the Structural Funds. To ensure that this is done, the local authorities are responsible for outlining practical projects which integrate and satisfy the guidelines and requirements of the Community support framework Objective 1, and must submit them to the State and/or region.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0273"></a>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The Commission's decision to halt the Volvo-Scania merger has raised a great many questions. Why is Sweden regarded as the only relevant market for Swedish-manufactured lorries and not the EU's internal market as a whole? Why is the EU's internal market as a whole regarded as relevant in the case of alcohol sales but not in the case of lorries? How can a small country ever be the base for a big, internationally competitive company? What is the significance of the Commissioner responsible having been a member of the Board of Directors of Fiat, a company which announced on the same day as the Commission's decision was made public that it was interested in buying Volvo if the Volvo-Scania merger was halted? Has the Commission considered whether the Commissioner responsible has acted impartially in this matter?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="middle"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Sweden was one of several markets where the operation would have led to the creation of a dominant position.</p>
<p>The question concerning restrictions on the quantities of alcoholic drinks that travellers can bring into Sweden coming from other Member States without having to pay excise duties there is a matter relating to the free movement of goods and a fiscal matter. It is not related to the question as to what is the 'relevant market' for sales of alcohol. Travellers entering Sweden are allowed to bring along any alcoholic drinks for their own use but, as long as the derogation lasts (until the end of June 2000, but a request for an extension until the end of 2003 was made) they have to pay excise duties on the quantities exceeding certain limits.</p>
<p>The harmonisation of technical requirements (trucks and buses) has been largely (although not yet totally) achieved. This has resulted in significant economies of scale and scope being achieved in the production of vehicles to meet regulatory requirements. However, even though it is, of course, important to look at the supply side, the definition of a relevant geographic market under the competition rules takes the viewpoint of the customer.</p>
<p>The relevant geographic market comprises the area in which the undertakings concerned are involved in the supply and demand of products or services, in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous and which can be distinguished from neighbouring areas because the conditions of competition are appreciably different in those area. In other words, the relevant market is the smallest area in which a monopolist could profitably increase prices by 5-10%, without losing sales to neighbouring areas. The question is therefore to what extent it is realistic that, for instance, a truck customer would consider buying a truck outside its country if prices there were raised by 5-10%. The investigation has shown that this is not very realistic, for reasons of pre-existing price differences, national technical requirements and, not least, the fact that the ability to provide first-class after-sales service is an integral part of any sale of a heavy truck.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the role of the Merger Regulation is to ascertain that dominant positions are not created through industrial consolidation. In the Volvo/Scania case, it was found that a dominant position would have been created in several national markets (not only in Sweden, as suggested by the question, but also in other Nordic countries and Ireland) for the supply of heavy trucks (not of Swedish built trucks, as suggested by the question). The operation would also have created a dominant position in some countries for the supply of coaches, city- and inter-city buses. Given the gravity of these competition concerns, and the fact that Volvo was unable to propose undertakings that would have removed all competition concerns, the Commission had no other choice but to prohibit the merger.</p>
<p>Both Volvo and Scania are, individually, large internationally competitive companies, and achieve more than 80% of their sales outside the Nordic region. Their success has, to a significant extent, been due to the competition between them. If their merger had not caused competition concerns, they could have obviously merged regardless of whether or not they are located in a small Member State.</p>
<p>Firms based in smaller countries and which have high market shares in their home markets, such as Volvo and Scania, are certainly not precluded from expanding through mergers. Any such merger must, however, be arranged so as to avoid competition concerns, such as those that arose in the case of Volvo/Scania.</p>
<p>During his academic career prior to his nomination as Commissioner in 1995, Mr Monti had been a member on the boards of several companies (including FIAT from 1988 to 1993), as indicated publicly upon joining the Commission. Positions held in the past obviously played no role whatsoever in this or other decisions. It should be added that the decision on Volvo/Scania, proposed by Mr Monti as the competent Commissioner, was adopted unanimously by the College (and had been endorsed unanimously by the Advisory Committee on Concentrations). The issues on which the decision is based are objectively verifiable.</p>
<p>As additional information, it may be noted that, since Mr Monti took office as Competition Commissioner, several decisions concerning FIAT have been taken, upon his proposal. On 28 October 1999, the merger between Fiat's subsidiary New Holland and a US company, Case Corporation, was approved only after the parties had committed to very substantial divestments of production facilities for agricultural machinery, combined with transfers of brand names and other intellectual property rights. With regard to State Aids, the Commission recently adopted three decisions concerning FIAT. Regional aids planned by Italy in favour of the Mirafiori Meccanica and Rivalta plants, near Torino, were prohibited because it was considered that the envisaged aids were not necessary in order to achieve regional development purposes. In total, the payment of EUR 40 million was prohibited. Furthermore, the Commission decided to open the formal inquiry procedure against regional aid for the Melfi plant in Basilicata. In this opening of procedure, strong doubts were expressed about compatibility of the aid. The Commission is thoroughly investigating the case.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0278"></a>

<p>According to the information available to the Commission, the National Park mentioned by the honourable Member includes the wetlands of the Nestos delta as well as Lakes Vistonis and Idmaris. The Greek authorities classified these areas as special protection areas (SPAs) under the ‘birds’ directive 79/409/EEC<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and also proposed them as sites of Community importance (SIC) under the ‘habitats’ directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, for inclusion in the NATURA 2000 network.</p>
<p>There is no 'Community priority action framework' for this park. However, under the 1994-1999 CSF ‘Environment’ operational programme (3.2 ‘Biotopes’), projects for the ‘management of the Nestos Delta biotope’ and ‘management of the Lake Vistonis biotope’ are currently underway, with budgets of Drs 216 million and Drs 255 million respectively. Among other things, these projects include preparing management plans, in the form of ‘specific environmental studies’, as required by Greek Law No 1650/86, and schemes to protect and enhance the biotopes. Moreover, the above-mentioned wetlands, along with other sites, have received attention under schemes cofinanced by LIFE Nature, intended for the conservation of specific wild bird species.</p>
<p>There are at present 52 sites classified by Greece as SPAs under directive 79/409/EEC, which will form part of the NATURA 2000 network, in accordance with Article 3.1 of directive 92/43/EEC. A complete list of these sites is available on the Commission’s Internet website at the following address: http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/nature/home.htm</p>
<p>As regards the SICs which have been proposed under Directive 92/43/EEC, these are the exclusive responsibility of the national authority, as the Community list of sites, required under Article 4.2 of the directive, has not yet been drawn up.

<p>The Commission takes a great interest in matters of safety, including fire safety. The Commission is aware that effective fire safety requires that national or local authorities take measures targeting the whole range of factors likely to influence the development of fires, such as building regulations, requirements for fire reaction and resistance, evacuation conditions, the availability of fire protection equipment (sprinklers) and public information. A consistent policy can therefore only be implemented at an appropriate national level.</p>
<p>Criteria for flammable furniture are only one aspect of fire safety. As far as these products are concerned, in the absence of Community-wide harmonisation, it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure the health protection and safety of property and of human beings on the basis of the national regulations adopted to this end. Moreover, with reference to the terms of the EC Treaty (Articles 28 to 30), the principle of the mutual recognition of products, tests and certificates makes it possible to avoid any unjustified obstacles to trade.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the CEN (European Standardisation Body) has developed methods for testing the flammability of furniture. We must be able to use these standards as a reference in the above-mentioned mutual recognition procedures. Finally, in its proposed amendment to the directive on general product safety, of 29 March 2000 (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2000&amp;nu_doc=0139">COM(2000)139</a>), the Commission proposed introducing the concept of the ‘presumption of conformity’ in order to ensure a consistently high level of consumer protection. So products which comply with the European standards issued by the European standardisation institutes authorised by the Commission shall be deemed to comply with the safety criteria required by the directive.</p>
<p>Taking into account the new provisions in the text of the proposed amendment of the directive on general product safety, the Commission intends to check whether it is necessary to produce new standards or to amend the existing standards, in various sectors of interest to consumer safety. The various aspects related to fire safety will also be considered. If it is shown that the subject raised by the honourable Member warrants a mandate, and if there is sufficient agreement on the subject among the interested parties, the Commission may consider proceeding to draw up a mandate of this type.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0305"></a>

<p>The question of the honourable Member refers to the work of the British Government’s Genetics and Insurance Committee, concerning the use of genetic test results for insurance purposes. This work is expected to be finalised by the end of this month. Additional time will be needed in order to enable the Commission to assess the impact of the use of any relevant genetic information on Community provisions in this field. In view of fact that no final decision has yet been made, only the following preliminary remarks can be made.</p>
<p>The main question concerns the consequences of an eventual general application to all Member States and the compatibility with single market rules with regard to insurance and data protection.</p>
<p>Concerning the application to other Member States, the Commission is not aware of the work of groups like this in other Member States.</p>
<p>In the current state of Community insurance law, there is no specific provision regarding the use of genetic data for insurance purposes. This is a question for Member States to decide whether or not they authorise their use, taking into account the ‘general good’ requirements.</p>
<p>However, Article 8 of Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data requires consent of the data subject for the processing of genetic data concerning health unless a specific exception applies.</p>
<p>The matter needs to be further examined before launching any action in this regard.</p>

<p>The basic principle underlying the measures taken under Council Regulation (EC) No 1256/1999<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> referred to by the honourable Member is to ensure as far as possible that the milk quotas benefit active producers. It has frequently been established in several Member States that, over the years, a significant proportion of those quotas have come into the possession of non­producers who then lease them out every year. That results in a degree of speculation which makes it even more difficult for young farmers to gain access to milk production or jeopardises the profitability of their farms. That conclusion is supported by the corroborative findings of a large number of studies.</p>
<p>The new scheme merely constitutes a strengthening of measures previously put into effect. In particular, it enables the Member States to recover gradually and to return to the national reserve, for subsequent reallocation, quotas which their non-active holders have not assigned definitively, in accordance with the national rules currently in force and within a deadline and a percentage still to be laid down.</p>
<p>The measure corresponds not only with the objectives which the rules governing quotas have sought to attain ever since they were laid down but also with the wishes of most of the Member States. It is they who are responsible for its implementation. The scheme should be implemented, both in terms of its general principles and of the specific arrangements for it, in conformity with the general principles of Community law, balanced account being taken of the legitimate interests of producers who are still farming and those who are giving up farming.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Russians then hope to be able to attract countries such as Germany, Spain, Japan and Switzerland also.</p>
<p>According to Bellona, the plan has already been approved by six federal ministries and the government environment committee in Russia. The proposal must still be approved by the Duma since current legislation prohibits all imports of radioactive material.</p>
<p>Part of the plan is to expand the existing plants at Zelenogorsk and Mayak in Siberia, which have already been accused of discharging large quantities of liquid radioactive waste in the southern Urals. According to the plans, Russia will not require suppliers of the spent nuclear fuel to take back the treated fuel. Siberia would thus become a nuclear waste dump.</p>

<p>The Commission attaches the utmost importance to the inclusiveness of the Information Society.</p>
<p>The current legal scope of universal service includes the possibility of Internet access in terms of dial-up access over the telephone line. At the moment, this is the most common access method for individuals and households. In addition to the cost of the telephone call, this involves using an Internet Service Provider (in most Member States free Services are offered).</p>
<p>This guarantee is in all regions as universal service covers the whole of the national territory. In most Member States (all except Finland) the telephone tariffs are common within a country.</p>
<p>Prices for using the Internet are continuing to decrease, irrespective of the type of user group and geographic location, due to liberalisation of telecommunications markets. Although there may be more choice of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in urban and denser populated areas, the bigger operators and Internet Service Providers offer nationwide service. Fierce competition in urban areas puts pressure on incumbent operators and leads to lower prices nationwide.</p>
<p>In January 2000, the Commission launched a public consultation (based on <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=99&amp;nu_doc=0539">COM (99) 539</a>) on all aspects of telecommunications regulations including universal service. The consultation has revealed that there is a broad support for the Commission’s proposal not to extend for the moment the current scope of universal service to broadband Internet access. This extension would, at the present point of market development, risk constituting a cross-subsidy from ordinary telephone users to the early adopters of broadband technologies, who usually tend to be wealthier.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to monitor and review this scope of universal service so that the concept keeps pace with market and technological developments. The Commission intends to include a specific review clause in the new legal framework.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0321"></a>

<p>Senator SERRI was appointed the Union Presidency Special Representative in January 2000 to assist the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in its efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. All parties involved have expressed their satisfaction with this appointment. In this respect it has to be mentioned that Senator SERRI has an intimate knowledge of the Horn of Africa and its problems. Senator SERRI has, since his appointment, been in close and constant contact with the Algerian Presidency of the OAU in order to contribute to the success of the mediation initiative. The OAU has expressed its strong appreciation for the Union decision to support the peace process as this will allow, amongst others, to put together information, perceptions and evaluations of the underlying reasons behind the conflict as well as developing scenarios for a peaceful solution of the conflict. In his capacity as the Union Presidency Special Representative, Senator SERRI carried out his first mission to Asmara and Addis in February 2000. He met with the President of Eritrea, Mr Isaias Afewerki, and the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia, Messrs Meles Zenawi and Seyoum Mesfin. They all expressed their appreciation for the European contribution through the special representative. In the meantime, the permanent contact between Mr SERRI and the OAU Presidency has continued unabated.</p>
<p>Mr SERRI embodies not only the Union support to the peace process led by the OAU, he is also providing both the Member States and the Commission with very valuable up to date information on the peace process and its constraints. This allows the Union to better appreciate the underlying issues of the conflict as well as enabling the Union to better assist in resolving the conflict.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0331"></a>

<p>Tourism is a complex sector inter-related to many other sectorial policies, such as those on transportation, regional policy, regional planning, etc.</p>
<p>The application of the principle of integration is therefore a relatively complex matter, insofar as it affects many sectors and addresses several independent policies. In other terms, it is not simply a matter of promoting the integration of environmental considerations in one sector of activity but also of including a number of other sectors in order to ensure that their actions are consistent and well coordinated.</p>
<p>The way in which current regulations for Community policies relating to tourism (water, noise, waste, etc.) are implemented must enhance this integration.</p>
<p>The Commission’s current projects particularly target:</p>
<p>- the promotion of environmental protection and sustainable development in tourism, including the application of good practice, closer cooperation with Member States and improved consultation with experts from the tourist sector;</p>
<p>- the development of guidelines for good practice in tourism in protected natural sites, particularly NATURA 2000 sites;</p>
<p>- the extension of the Eco-label to tourist services;</p>
<p>- support for operator information and awareness campaigns in order to promote environmentally friendly tourism.</p>
<p>In the context of the follow up to the Council conclusions of 21 June 1999 ‘Tourism and Employment’, one of the working parties set up jointly by the Commission and the Member States is particularly concerned with sustainable development in tourism.

<p>Last December, the Commission adopted a new initiative: ‘eEurope - An information society for all’. The aim of eEurope was to accelerate Europe's transition to the information society. The ultimate goal is to promote economic growth, create new jobs and strengthen social cohesion. To achieve this, eEurope proposed 10 actions. One of them tackled the educational dimension with the aim of bringing on-line every European classroom and creating a digitally-literate Europe.</p>
<p>On 23-24 March 2000, in Lisbon, European Heads of State and Governments endorsed most of eEurope's goals and actions, including in the field of education. They asked the Commission to prepare an eEurope Action Plan by next June.</p>
<p>Work on the eEurope Action Plan has already started. But no decision has been reached at this stage on budgetary allocations. Financial aspects, as well as the details of the actions to be undertaken, will be addressed in the framework of the eEurope Action Plan.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2000-0349"></a>

<p>A debate is taking place in the USA on MTBE, a substance which is added to petrol and which has polluted groundwater, in particular in California. It is added to petrol everywhere and began to be used as an octane booster when lead-free petrol was introduced. Under Swedish rules, petrol may contain 15% MTBE, but on average it contains 2-3%. The problem with MTBE and closely related ETBE is that they take longer to break down in water than the corresponding alcohols, methanol and ethanol. MTBE and ETBE, like ethanol and methanol, have been proposed as low-level petrol additives as a first step towards introducing renewable fuels into our petrol tanks without the need to change engines.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of the increasing use of MTBE and ETBE and their relatively little known impact on the environment? Does it intend to regulate the quantity of these substances permitted in petrol?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is well aware of the political and public concern about the contamination of water supplies in the United States and recent statements by the US EPA and will keep abreast of developments.</p>
<p>MTBE is on the Third Priority List, published in 1997, of priority substances for assessment, as foreseen under Council Regulation 793/93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span> (Commission Regulation (EC) 143/97)<a href="#defann_65_2" name="refann_65_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup">2</span>. Finland is the Member State ‘Rapporteur’ responsible for the assessment of the substance, but all Member States are represented in the competent Group of Experts which discusses and finalises the risk assessment report for MTBE. The Community risk assessment will address the possible environmental and human health concerns in the Community, taking into account the US findings. When the risk assessment report is finalised, it will be presented to the Scientific Committee for Toxicity, Eco-toxicity and the Environment for independent peer-review. Risk reduction measures will be recommended in those areas where concerns have been indicated and legislative measures taken, if appropriate.</p>
<p>In August 1999, the Commission asked Member States for information on whether they have encountered any problems with (water) pollution due to MTBE. Once such information is available from a number of Member States, the Commission will provide complementary information to the MEP.</p>
<p>MTBE is a blending component (oxygenate) used in petrol to varying degrees by the Member States. In this context, it should be pointed out that there is a fundamental difference between American and Community legislation. EU Directive 98/70 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel<a href="#defann_65_3" name="refann_65_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 3</span> allows a maximum oxygen content in petrol of 2.7% by volume (which equates to a maximum MTBE content of 15%), whilst not setting a minimum content. The American legislation, on the other hand, requires a minimum oxygen content of 2% - which equates to a minimum MTBE content of 11% - in certain geographic areas. This minimum oxygen content has given rise to a much higher MTBE percentage in petrol in some parts of the United States, as in California, than is generally the case in the Community.</p>
<p>MTBE is the most commonly used ether. By contrast, ETBE has found limited use.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
