In addition, I should like to recall Parliament’s considerable institutional support to the nuts and locust beans sector. This is evidenced in a number of resolutions testifying to the significance of this sector within the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Council of Agriculture Ministers in July 2001, Commissioner Fischler announced that a detailed study of the Community nuts sector would be undertaken. The Commissioner also stated that if appropriate, specific proposals to benefit the sector would be made, to follow on from the improvement plans expiring in 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this situation, the Commission has proposed an additional one-year extension of the improvement plans. I have certainly welcomed this. Nonetheless, I would like to make it clear that I trust it will be the last transitional instrument, to be followed by a permanent proposal. Such a proposal must ensure the survival of the sector and put an end to the difficulties and uncertainty European Union producers are experiencing.</p>
<p class="contents">The main aim of our report was to settle the issue of permanent support measures once and for all. The nuts sector is very important to the Union from a social, economic and environmental point of view. Over a million hectares are devoted to these crops. They extend across the Mediterranean countries, and the land is mostly located in very disadvantaged areas where agriculture is difficult. Much of the soil is hillside or arid.</p>
<p class="contents">These products therefore have to overcome many difficulties to remain on the market and be economically viable without direct support from public institutions. The difficulties are exacerbated by strong outside competition. For instance, there are hazelnuts from Turkey and almonds from the United States. In both cases the conditions of production bear no comparison to those in Europe. In addition, the outside products benefit from tariff concessions under international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The nuts sector is an example of multifunctional production and is essential to the socio-economic survival of many families in rural areas of the Union. This is because of its role in regional planning, since no alternative crops exist, and also because of its part in environmental conservation. It helps prevent erosion and is important in combating fires. It also preserves indigenous genetic material, which is of great organolectic value.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this difficult situation and lack of competitiveness in 1989, the Commission adopted a package of specific measures. These were aimed mainly at raising the quality and competitiveness of the products. The ten-year improvement plans were due to expire in 2000 but were extended until 15 July 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the plans proved positive. There were notable improvements in production and marketing. Unfortunately the same was not true of competitiveness, due to the difficult structural conditions at the outset. The Commission’s present proposal would allow these last plans to be extended to 15 June 2002 with the Community contribution decreasing from 82 to 75%.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the specific case of hazelnuts, the payment per kilo is retained for the 2001-2002 harvest. Payments will only be made, however, to members of producer organisations not eligible for the extension. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has attempted to introduce considerable improvements to the executive committee’s proposal through its amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the restrictions on support for hazelnut production, we believe that it is not acceptable to withhold it from those producer organisations wishing to benefit from the extension of improvement schemes. This would amount to discrimination between producers’ organisations, giving some of them an unfair advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the level of national cofinancing, the increase on the current commitment proposed for the extended plans cannot be justified. In this connection, the percentage relating to nuts is minimal and does not justify the proposal. As for the areas covered by the plans and entitled to aid, the percentage should be retained on the basis of the area certified in the last year’s plans and not the area for which aid has been requested.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture is of the opinion that in order to improve awareness and production monitoring, provision must be made to set up a geographical information system. The committee is also on record as advocating the need to establish a permanent framework for aid to the sector. Further, the committee has argued for ongoing support in the form of aid per hectare to guarantee maintenance of the producers’ income in a situation of sustainable exploitation. Hence the advisability of linking this latest extension to permanent aid, the ultimate aim being to consolidate a system of ongoing aid channelled through the producer organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I must not conclude without mentioning the Committee on Agriculture’s specific request that chestnuts be included in the nuts sector. The protection of this tree and fruit associated with forested areas and ancient culinary traditions is crucial to preserving a very important ecosystem that is obviously being encroached upon. It also has a bearing on the related environmental issues. Finally, I should like to point out that two identical amendments have been put to plenary. They both aim at increasing support to hazelnuts by means of an additional marketing season.</p>
<p class="contents">I am unable to support these amendments although I appreciate and share concerns over the difficulties currently experienced in marketing hazelnuts. The request for a permanent regime implies that support to hazelnuts would be covered by that regime. It is therefore not appropriate to extend still further a temporary arrangement with a set expiry date that has merely generated uncertainty.</p>

The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should also be thanked for its almost unanimous support for this sector. The rapporteur has already described the importance of the fruit and vegetable sector for the countries of southern Europe, so there is no need for me to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost two years ago, the Council requested the Commission to undertake a specific assessment of the situation of the nuts sector in the framework of the report on the operation of the COM in fruit and vegetables. This problem has yet to be finally resolved. We are still trying to provide a remedy in extending the improvement plans. What is actually required is a final and immediately applicable definition, along with the implementation of support mechanisms to replace the present improvement programmes as they expire.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is adamant on resolving the extensions through this draft Regulation. A reduction in Community cofinancing is involved, however. In addition, aid to hazelnuts is proposed, but only for farmers not eligible for the extension.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission’s proposal to extend the improvement plans for a second year is positive. Nonetheless, it does not allay all of the producers’ concerns. As I stated, the latter are calling for a permanent solution, so they can continue to resist the strong competition by almonds from the United States and hazelnuts from Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development deals with the gaps in the Commission’s plan. The amendments adopted call for specific aid to hazelnuts for all organisations requesting it, not just for those participating in improvement plans, as the Commission suggests. The amendments also call for the retention of current cofinancing levels for these improvement plans, whereas the Commission wishes to increase the Member States’ cofinancing from 18 to 25%. The deletion of a reference to gradual transferral of financial responsibility to the producers in recital 2 is also requested. Finally, there is the call to introduce a permanent regime based on the award of aid per hectare, subject to the implementation of good agricultural and environmentally friendly practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, these are the main requests from the Committee on Agriculture. The Committee also calls for this aid to be extended to chestnuts, a product not currently covered by the improvement plans.</p>
<p class="contents">The key factor is that the European Parliament is in favour of a permanent solution for this sector in the framework of the COM in fruit and vegetables. Parliament calls on the Commission to put forward a proposal for the implementation of a definitive support regime for the sector before 1 June 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts to find a solution to the situation of the nuts sector in the European Union within the framework of the COM in fruit and vegetables must therefore be intensified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You will be aware, Commissioner, that on numerous occasions the European Parliament has expressed its institutional support for the nuts sector in the European Union. It has done so conscious of the fact that they are essentially a multifunctional crop which contributes to environmental conservation and helps combat erosion. It also has a part to play in regional planning, as it is one of the few activities keeping people on the land in places where other forms of agriculture are not viable. As most of the producer regions in the European Union are disadvantaged, it has economic and social significance too.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not in a position to oppose the Commission’s proposal to extend these plans for improving aid to the sector. We certainly support the rapporteur’s view that it is not acceptable for the Commission to propose excluding producer organisations wishing to benefit from the improvement plans from eligibility for the specific hazelnut aid. We cannot either go along with the Commission’s intention of reducing Community cofinancing from 82 to 75% in these extended plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we are bound to say that we would like our request for permanent support to this sector to go on record. Such a solution would provide stability and make it possible to produce the crop in Europe. This can only happen if we succeed in setting up permanent support targeted at producer organisations and within a stable framework, namely the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should pursue this objective and approach during the extra year for which the plans will be extended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular, I am grateful to him for showing such sensitivity to the needs of the sector. The latter is obviously very important in Catalonia. I would also like to thank Mr Bautista Ojeda for being so receptive to the suggestions made by the Catalan regional government.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is worth recalling that clearly we are not dealing with one of the major agricultural or livestock sectors central to the common agricultural policy (CAP). Nonetheless, this sector extends over a million hectares and makes a specific and significant contribution in the immediate vicinity. It has considerable social impact too.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view therefore, the request for maintaining support during 2001 and 2002 must lead, as previous speakers stated, to a permanent support regime per hectare. Consequently we are against Amendment No 10 tabled by Mr Fiori, because requesting support for 2002 and 2003 at this stage would essentially invalidate the report’s main objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that as outlined previously and in terms of hectare as in Mrs Ayuso’s amendment adopted in committee, namely certified areas, this report presents an approach the Commission should certainly consider. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It would be hard to name an issue preceded by more Parliamentary initiatives during the last twelve years. The House has witnessed the same debate time and again during this period. The principles are unchanged, but the situation on the ground has worsened. Turkish economic policy recently caused an artificial fall in the price of hazelnuts and other agricultural products in response to internal pressures.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not a new problem, but it escalated because the Commission failed to tackle it in its proposals. I do not believe the Commission’s suggestion, namely transferring the nuts problem to rural development, is realistic. This might have been said in the Committee on Agriculture. A problem related to the market should be dealt with using the appropriate tools. It is unwise to keep resorting to the second pillar to solve all our difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">For the last twelve years, the House has been advocating an honourable solution for this sector of production which is experiencing very specific problems. The Commission’s response has been simply to grant extensions to a regime that does not deal with the problems the sector needs to overcome. The permanent solution put forward by the House on a number of occasions has been ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">One might well wonder whether sometimes the nub of the problem is not in fact the Commission’s lack of resolve when it comes to proposing effective measures to deal with the difficulties facing the nuts sector, rather than the difficulties themselves. For my part, Commissioner, I hope that is not so on this occasion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Before I comment on these proposed amendments, I should like to say a few words about the proposal itself. As you probably know, improvement plans have been implemented for some 600 000 hectares sown with nuts since 1989. The European Union spent a total of EUR 900 million on these plans up to 2001. The purpose of the improvement plans was to enhance the economic basis for nut growing by pooling supplies, improving quality and building up a production and marketing infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">These plans were limited to ten years, after which financial responsibility would revert solely to producers. However, when the first plans ran out, a one-off extension was granted in Council Regulation No 558/2001. The eleventh year of these plans ran out last year, as did the 10-year deadline for a further series of plans and the plans for the remaining 35% of land sown with nuts will run out by 2006/2007.</p>
<p class="contents">On 23 July last year, the Council asked the Commission to launch an in-depth study into all aspects of this sector and called on it to submit the conclusions of the study and any proposals as quickly as possible. The study is well under way and will be presented in May of this year. The Commission was conscious of the fact that something needed to be done in the meantime and that this interim period needed to be bridged, which is why it suggested that the Council and Parliament approve the proposal for a regulation extending the improvement plans by a further year. This draft also makes provision for special aid for hazelnuts.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the 16 proposed amendments. The first group of amendments deals with general issues. Amendment No 1 refers to Regulation No 1035/1972, the proposed amendment to the Commission report to the Council on the common organisation of the market. Of course we can no longer change the wording of a regulation which has been abolished, but Amendment No 2 is acceptable in principle. I also agree with Amendment No 3 highlighting the ecological importance of the nut sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The second group of proposed amendments contains proposals for fundamental changes to the existing proposal. All these proposals impact on the budget, some considerably, which is why the Commission cannot agree to them. This applies to Amendments Nos 4 to 6, 10 to 12 and 15 and 16. The third group relates to the future of the sector. Amendments Nos 9 and 13 highlight the need for a permanent support regime for nuts, while Amendment No 8 calls for the benefits achieved with the improvement plans to be preserved, mainly by channelling supplies through producer organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment Nos 7 and 14 call for knowledge on production and control to be improved using the Geographical Information System. All these proposed amendments have repercussions which go beyond the framework of the proposal submitted, which merely recommends a year's extension, which is why I cannot accept these amendments within the context of this proposal. However, I can assure you that we have taken good note of your proposals and shall take proper account of them.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already explained on previous occasions, we are all agreed that there is a chronic lack of competition in this sector and that it does not therefore make economic sense to hang on to the belief that EU producers can hold out against free competition with Turkish hazelnuts or American almonds in the long term. In my opinion, therefore, we need an answer to the following questions. First, does the European Union need to produce its own nuts? Secondly, do nuts fulfil a multifunctional role? Thirdly, should the EU continue to invest in maintaining nut production? And fourthly, if so, in what form?</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that support measures should also help to promote the sustainability of rural areas and protect the environment and should not just be geared to making the sector economically competitive. Finally, I should like to thank you once again for your contributions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On this basis, one might assume that the Commission proposal is of a fundamentally technical nature and is confined to adapting the main instruments of support for tobacco production, in accordance with changes in supply and demand in the market. Furthermore, this adjustment is made necessary by the current arrangements, since producers must be notified about quotas before 15 April and the relevant contracts be drawn up before 30 May.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, with the excuse that Regulation (EEC) 2075/92 needs technical updating, the proposal goes much farther. In fact, it indirectly introduces a reform of a much broader political scope and goes so far as to set the phasing out of tobacco subsidies as the ultimate objective (see recital 5). In doing this, the Commission is in actual fact determining the scope of the decisions which have been proposed and which, in due course and subject to the relevant proposals, will have to be taken by the Community institutions. There are two reasons for this: first of all, the Commission launched an evaluation study of the COM in raw tobacco, which should enable an assessment to be made of the effects of current Community policy on the sector, and its conclusions will only be available at the end of 2002; secondly, it was the Commission itself that undertook to submit proposals on the new tobacco policy at the beginning of next year, but only on the basis of the studies that are now being carried out. Of course, this proposal will have to be consistent with society's growing demands for sustainable development and high-quality products and, in the same context, must provide an adequate response to the official statements issued hitherto concerning the sector’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">Your rapporteur is of the view that the European Parliament cannot allow the Commission to pre-empt and make assumptions about the decisions that both the European Parliament and the Council will be taking in the coming months, on the basis of the evaluation studies and the latest data recorded in this sector, which I have already mentioned. In this context, the rapporteur's amendments are confined to improving the Commission's proposals in an essentially technical way and explicitly rule out the possibility of entering into a far-reaching political debate on the future support arrangements for tobacco, which can only be tackled rigorously during 2003, taking into account the studies and reports mentioned above.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be considered, however, that this position of the rapporteur does not simply mean accepting the <span class="italic">status quo</span>, which, furthermore, he feels is unsustainable. To this end, the rapporteur tabled Amendment No 23, in order to regain the original spirit of commitment towards the Community Tobacco Fund. This amendment has two implications: firstly, not only accepting financing by the Fund of actions to prevent nicotine addiction and of experimental action to encourage tobacco producers to switch to other crops and economic activities, but also maintaining the financing of agronomic research into varieties of tobacco that are less damaging to the environment and to health; and, secondly, increasing the levy on producers’ premiums from 2% to 3%, thereby rejecting both the present figure of 2%, and the Commission’s proposal of 5%. And, in order to ensure consistency with this vision of commitment, the rapporteur proposes that we also reject Amendments Nos 9 and 13. The around 130 thousand tobacco producers in the European Union, most of whom live in the least-favoured regions of southern Europe, deserve to have the competent Community institutions concern themselves, in a responsible way, with their future. Hence, also, the importance of having sufficient evaluation and impact studies of the current situation so that we can make responsible and realistic proposals for the future, but only once we know exactly what the effects of the current policy are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Production of this crop is hardly mechanised, so it has considerable social significance and an impact on employment. Tobacco is grown on small family plots in regions classed amongst the poorest in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall give you an example affecting my country directly. Tobacco represents 25% of final agricultural production in the region of Extremadura. The argument linking the end of aid to tobacco and consequently the end of its production with health considerations is quite mistaken, unfair and regrettably also hypocritical. Nobody would dream of suggesting stopping the cultivation of plants used to produce alcohol through distillation because of the health problems caused by alcohol. Nobody has suggested closing down the factories manufacturing cigars and cigarettes either, or banning the sale of these products.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly the case that the withdrawal of aid would put an end to tobacco production in Europe. This would not, however, improve the health of European consumers because the gap left by Community production would be filled by imports from third countries. Anyone wishing to continue smoking could do so. What is at issue is simply commercial interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The only way of tackling the health issue is to pursue the approach launched some time ago by the European Union. This involves developing methods of cultivation and introducing less harmful varieties whilst also boosting information campaigns designed to reduce consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion of the Committee on Budgets is that agronomic research financed by the Tobacco Fund should be intensified. The European Commission, on the other hand, wishes to stop research and promote conversion, though no viable alternative is suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is exceeding its competence on this issue. Its role should be to extend the aid regime, in a spirit of continuity.

These are two separate issues and I think that the Commission should realise that, as should many of the honourable Members.</p>
<p class="contents">We are against smoking and we must do all we can to stop it from spreading and reduce it. I have no objection to that. But if we abolish tobacco growing, all we shall do is condemn a number of European citizens to financial ruin and give a fillip to tobacco farmers in third countries. All we shall do is reduce our exports and increase our imports. All we shall do is increase the dole queues in the European Union. Is that what we are trying to do? Is that our objective? In other words, do all those who maintain that, if we grub up tobacco farms in Europe, we shall help reduce smoking, mean to tell us that we need to grub up vineyards in order to fight alcoholism? Do they mean to tell us we should close our car factories in order to reduce the number of fatal road traffic accidents?</p>
<p class="contents">It is time we stopped being two-faced, faced the facts and dealt with things in the proper manner. It is time we sat down together, with an open mind and our eyes wide open, called a spade a spade and worked out a strategy to drastically reduce smoking and its harmful effects and a strategy to develop the economy of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For the rest, however, as he himself has said, the subject of tobacco as dealt with in this specific proposal for a Council regulation is a purely technical matter concerning the 2002, 2003 and 2004 crops. The Commission was wrong to try and introduce political criteria into the debate; apart from the fact that they have nothing to do with the aspects of the issue at debate here, they are also completely groundless, premature and even, I would say, provocative as regards the more general working of and prospects for the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that tobacco is a prime example of a very labour-intensive crop grown on family-run farms and poor, barren soil, meaning that, apart from anything else, it allows man to live and work in areas which, if deserted physically and ecologically, would have incalculable social and environmental repercussions. The Commission knows all this and it was the Commission which used to take every opportunity to reiterate it. Lately, however, motivated perhaps by the expediency of supporting its misguided intervention in Gothenburg, it has omitted to repeat its earlier references and is in danger of putting the debate on this issue on the wrong footing. The right footing is exactly as suggested by Mr Cunha in his report with the support of the Committee on Agriculture, which plenary is called on to endorse and which the Commission is called on to respect in any future action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The statistics show that approximately 130 000 farmers and around 400 000 seasonal workers are involved in tobacco growing, in addition to all those involved in the production chain. This is therefore a serious matter which we feel requires greater analysis on the part of the Commission, not least in the light of Communication No 264 of 15 May 2001, which contains a clear statement to the effect that, should the Commission decide on a political proposal for action, all the repercussions and implications of this strategy for tobacco growing and the reduction of aid to growers would, indeed, be assessed.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason and also for the reasons expounded by other Members regarding the limited actual effect the measure would have on cigarette consumption, as regards the issue of smoking, it is therefore important, moreover, to preserve the research fund, particularly for agronomic research on broad-leaf tobacco, for that represents our only hope if we are to reduce the harmful effects of smoking and contribute to the right of all consumers to health too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It raises the key question as to whether we should continue to subsidise the cultivation of a plant, the main use of which is in the manufacture of a product recognised as being extremely harmful to human health. Tobacco, I am sorry to say, is a hard drug, and we must have the courage to say this.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem dates back a long way and the Commission is using this proposal for updating the regulation to clearly say that we must move away from the system of tobacco subsidies. However, as we must give farmers the time to change activity, the debate initially focuses on the time they are given to do this. And Mr Cunha’s proposal was, from that point of view, very reasonable. It is natural to allow them time – but not too much time – for the planned assessment. The Greens believe that the current situation must be tackled now, whether or not we are continually told that these are poor farmers. As far as I know, Alsace and Andalucia are, in terms of farming, fairly prosperous regions. The question is to determine whether, at this point, we must subsidise, in other countries, growing dangerous products such as cannabis, for example. And we must, at this point, have the courage to say so.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two points to the second question which is that of the Community Tobacco Fund. The first point is the level of the deduction to be introduced as of 2004; the second is the tasks given to researchers who are funded in this way. We believe that an increase from 3% to 5% for this Fund is a positive step; in this area, the Commission’s proposal has very wisely used the carrot and stick approach in order to refocus these tasks over the long term and to replace agronomic research into making tobacco slightly less harmful with measures to support specific initiatives that encourage tobacco growers to switch from tobacco into other crops.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget, however, that products other than the cigarette can be produced from tobacco. It can be an aid to medical research, for example. It is also an excellent natural insecticide. But these are specialist niches, and there is a great deal too much cultivated tobacco for these uses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens will not, therefore, vote in favour of the amendments which have undermined Mr Cunha’s patient work. Instead, we will support the Commission in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a considerable achievement, if we take into account that he has had to cope with a scenario created by the Commission, which, as stated by a previous speaker, is plainly hypocritical.</p>
<p class="contents">We might agree that tobacco is a danger to health. Taking this argument to the extreme, one could suggest banning the import of tobacco. I suspect, however, that few Members of this House would be prepared to vote in favour of closing our borders to tobacco from the United States. Treasury Ministers are delighted with the income generated by tobacco, whilst Health Ministers rail against it.</p>
<p class="contents">Just now, for the first time, charges of smuggling have been brought against multinational companies bringing tobacco into the European Union and attempting to avoid paying the duty due.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of lessons to be drawn from that and from the prohibitionist experiments conducted in Europe and elsewhere. In the first place, ceasing cultivation without stopping imports has no impact on the availability of a harmful substance. What it does is make the Community market more attractive to goods from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, prohibition does not stop consumption. Instead it boosts smuggling, to the detriment of health checks and of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, tobacco production generates more employment and stimulates more economic activity than many other agricultural practices such as meat production. Yet the Commission often displays undue leniency towards these other practices.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I also believe that the confusion the Commission may create between the documents submitted to the European Council at Göteborg and the conclusions of the Council is totally unacceptable, and drastically alters the institutional balance. In my view therefore, the Commission’s assessment of the Göteborg European Council destabilises the principles and operation of the Community institutional relationship. I trust the European Parliament will reject it, taking account of the Council’s Legal Services’ contribution to the work of the COMIT. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This change involves paving the way to phase out tobacco production without providing an alternative. However, tobacco production is valued by disadvantaged areas and by many small- and medium-sized growers. The workforce employed underpins the economic activity of rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union produces 5% of the world’s tobacco and imports 70% of its requirements. By ceasing this production, Europe will be dependent on imports and consumption will not be affected in any way. Tobacco has serious implications for public health and our approach to this subject must take this into account. Our priority must be to educate young people to deter them from smoking. Manufacturers also play a part in prevention by financing the Community Fund, which should have been used to inform consumers and also to make progress in research into the harmful effects of products. Unfortunately, no calls for tenders have been issued since 1997. By maintaining production in Europe, we are giving ourselves the means to control the quality of tobacco production and processing. We are also giving ourselves the means to develop less harmful varieties. Producers will not agree to increases in levies on the premiums to finance something that will lead to them being put out of business.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group can do nothing other than to reject recital 5 of the Commission’s proposal, which spells disaster for small- and medium-sized growers that help to maintain an agricultural activity throughout the Union’s territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, given the European Union’s tobacco deficit, our action must, of course, be based on demand and not on supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us bear in mind two figures: we consume 800 000 tonnes of raw tobacco and produce 250 000 tonnes in the European Union. Europe imports 70% of the raw tobacco it needs, and so the European Union is far from being the world’s biggest importer. It is therefore obvious that any action that seeks to reduce production would only increase our dependence on imports.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, the social effects of such measures that give me cause for concern. Need we point out that tobacco growing is very labour intensive and involves 130 000 growers and 400 000 seasonal workers, which amounts to more than 500 000 jobs? Need we point out that the first processing stage provides 18 000 permanent and 40 000 seasonal jobs in rural areas? Need we point out that tobacco growing is carried out on small family-run farms of between one and two hectares of tobacco, and, on average, tobacco production makes up 60% of the family’s income? Need we point out that most of these farms are situated in disadvantaged regions which many people have left to go to live in towns, which have experienced rural depopulation and problems farming the countryside in rural villages? Need we point out that tobacco growing, which brings in a steady income, greatly assists in maintaining the farming population and therefore trade and public services?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must take an extremely careful approach to changing the set-up of the COM in tobacco. When the reform of the COM in tobacco was approved in 1998, Parliament and the Council planned to carry out an assessment of this reform at the end of 2002. This assessment alone will provide a basis for an appropriate consideration of the future of tobacco growing in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore share the view of the rapporteur that no decision should be taken on the future of the existing tobacco regime until we have the results of the studies that are currently being carried out. And I would point out that the Commission must submit a new proposal on the tobacco sector in 2003. For these reasons, I am pleased that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has refused the planned quota and premium reductions which would have severely affected farmers’ income, would have hampered the restructuring of plantations and would not have encouraged farmers to switch to other crops.</p>
<p class="contents">We also oppose the plan to increase farmers’ contribution to the Community Tobacco Fund, given that this Fund – which has an annual budget of EUR 20 million – has been substantially under-utilised. Lastly, we also rejected the Commission’s plan to refocus where support from this fund is directed.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Madam President, the Commission has put before us a flawed reform, one that, let it be said, also has a tinge of shallow populist rhetoric and hypocrisy, and could have serious social consequences for this sector. The Committee on Agriculture supported the wise recommendations of our rapporteur who has drafted suitable and solid proposals which do not confuse tobacco and nicotine addiction, and I hope that the House will follow suit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is always difficult to talk about tobacco, for we always end up falling into the trap of populism. We know that today’s report is only one of the stages in the discussion, for the real debate on tobacco will start with the Commission’s proposal next year. However, there are three fundamental points to note. Firstly, apart from some rare exceptions, tobacco is produced in the poorest and most depressed areas of Europe. The populism we talk about is also a characteristic of conversion plans: in those areas – and I am referring to the situation of my own country, Italy, but the same applies to parts of Spain or Greece – it is not possible to convert production. And this populism continues to confuse production with consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">As a great French writer said, although it is certainly possible to kick a habit, it is very difficult, for superhuman willpower and, above all, a great deal of time are needed. Well then, when it comes to smoking, it may well be that we should invest heavily – and this could be part of the Committee on Agriculture’s proposal – in an educational process which starts with schools. As regards this sector of agriculture, we must endeavour to realise that entire family networks are dependent on tobacco for a living and that sudden decisions such as those contained in the Commission’s proposal would lead to social and economic collapse that we cannot afford. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As an aside, it was stated that Andalusia is a very rich agricultural area. I have to say that I would be delighted with an income from agriculture as high as that enjoyed by the citizens represented by Mrs Auroi, and so would my Andalusian constituents.</p>
<p class="contents">I side with those in favour of retaining aid to farmers, although I do not smoke myself and advise everyone not to take it up or to stop. I believe it would be a mistake to reduce the cultivation of tobacco or do away with it altogether. My reasons are that this would entail a high social cost and that no suitable alternative crops have been identified. It should also be remembered that those who advocate cutting off aid to the sector on the grounds of health protection fail to take into account that subsidising European production would have no impact on consumption. This is because the European Union imports 70% of its raw tobacco. Nonetheless, we have already been presented with a proposal providing for gradual elimination of tobacco without the relevant studies to ensure alternative sources of income following replacement of this crop.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no such alternative sources of income at present. Discussion of reform can only begin when the results of assessment of the COM in tobacco are available, not in any event before 2003. The Commission aims to replace agricultural research with action to support the development of specific initiatives encouraging tobacco producers to change to other crops and engage in alternative economic activities generating employment. Deductions from the producers’ premiums are to be implemented progressively starting in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community Fund financed by deductions from the subsidies has been underused. This was due to serious mismanagement by the Commission. If the latter handled the existing budget so badly, I have grave misgivings as to whether it would do better with a significantly larger sum. It should be recalled that there have hardly been any calls to tender so far.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fund must of course continue to serve its purpose and pursue research into varieties more suited to demand and causing as little harm as possible. Obviously it must also investigate alternative uses for raw tobacco and its environmental impact. Increased deductions should not be an excuse for covert reductions of the producers’ premiums.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by emphasising the important social and economic role played by tobacco cultivation. It calls for a sizeable workforce on family plots. The debate on tobacco and public health should not therefore be restricted to the agricultural context, targeting the weakest link in the chain of tobacco production. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know full well that tobacco is grown in disadvantaged areas in the south, mainly barren mountainous areas, and that it is a crop traditionally grown on holdings on which nothing else will grow. It is the sole source of income and means of survival for people living in these areas, for whom there are no alternative forms of employment. It is infuriating that proposals such as this are being made at a time when smoking is on the increase and 70% of the tobacco used is imported. Consequently, any reduction in tobacco growing in the Community will wipe out thousands of small and medium-sized holdings and increase imports and merely serves the predatory interests of the huge tobacco industry and distribution monopolies, at the expense of producers and consumers alike. The only thing we should be reducing are imports, not the income of European farmers, and every suitable measure should be taken in order to do so. Any other proposal is anything from hypocritical to highly suspicious and a smoke-screen for unlawful interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Cunha report is concerned, it contains a number of good points, but it too accepts the objective, albeit with reservations, of reducing tobacco growing in the Community, perhaps over a longer period of time. This is clearly illustrated, for example, in Amendments Nos 7 and 12, calling for tobacco growers to be encouraged to switch into other crops, which is why we shall be voting against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I make no apology for that. I support the Commission very much on what they are trying to do in phasing out tobacco subsidies and I would encourage them to continue at a faster pace, rather than a slower one. We cannot justify European taxpayers' money being spent on tobacco production. One of the key objectives of the common agricultural policy is to produce good, wholesome food for the consumers of Europe. I cannot quite see how tobacco fits into this scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a great deal of respect for Mr Cunha, the rapporteur, but on this occasion he has got it wrong. He is a little like King Canute, who wanted to stop the tide coming in but was unsuccessful. The Committee on Agriculture did not face up to the realities. Over the past ten years we in Europe have spent GBP 6.5 billion or EUR 10 billion – GBP 2 for every citizen in Europe – to subsidise tobacco. One third of this tobacco is of very low quality and is seldom smoked at all. Another third is dumped on Developing World markets which then destroys their markets for tobacco. Is this a role of the common agricultural policy? It is a role we have tried to avoid. Only one third of this tobacco is smoked in Europe. We cannot, therefore, justify the support that we are giving. We all accept the need to support farming in rural communities, but we have to find different crops and different ways of supporting them in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point I wish to make is that, of all the areas of this support that I dislike, the continuation in Amendment No 17 of the support for very low-quality tobacco is the most wrong. If anything should be corrected it is this. I urge the Commission to phase out the growing of this very low-quality tobacco immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This proposal fixes the premiums and guarantee thresholds for the next three years, changes the scope of the Tobacco Fund and slightly simplifies the common organisation of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as premiums are concerned, the Commission proposal is that the current amounts should remain unchanged, with the exception of variety group 5, which Mr Parish referred to earlier, where we propose a 10% reduction. This being the case, we cannot accept Amendment No 17; the reduction in premiums for this variety group has only been proposed because the market situation is now totally untenable, with prices in free fall and very high stock levels which will affect future developments on this market.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as guarantee thresholds are concerned, the Commission proposal is that they should gradually be reduced by 2.6% to 334 000 tonnes by 2004. This figure more or less corresponds to quantities produced in the 1999 and 2000 financial years. Amendments Nos 18 and 19 are not acceptable to the Commission because the suggested guarantee thresholds and the way in which they are broken down bears no relation to current production demands and efforts to encourage varieties for which there is greater demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Recital 5, which the honourable Member referred to earlier, reflects the political framework underlying the proposal as regards the Tobacco Fund. This proposal is a twofold proposal. First it amends the scope of the Fund, by dispensing with funding for agronomic research in order to support producers switching to other crops and, secondly, it gradually increases the amount retained to 5%.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has created a new political framework in its communication on a strategy for sustainable development. We are working towards phasing out aid for the tobacco sector because we are required under Article 152 of the Treaty to guarantee a high level of human health protection in all Community policies. We too are aware of the fact that there is no direct relation between tobacco production and smoking levels, that is, people will not stop smoking because we provide less support for tobacco growing.</p>
<p class="contents">The political question lies in Article 152, which quite clearly states that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in all Community policies, that is, including all aid policies. Which means that the other question no longer applies. The deletion of this recital suggested in Amendment No 2 is therefore unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is the suggested reference to the European Parliament's resolution in Amendment No 3 acceptable because it has nothing to do with the proposed regulation. Amendments Nos 4 to 6, calling for an assessment of the social and economic impact have already been overtaken by events. We are already carrying out a comprehensive assessment which also deals with these aspects. The Commission cannot therefore decide on a timetable for abolishing aid here and now, as called for in Amendments Nos 25 and 26.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the potential impact of phasing out aid to tobacco growing, especially in various production areas such as Greece, Spain and Italy, where the social and economic structure is particularly fragile. The Commission communication therefore makes provision for measures designed to create alternative jobs and profitable economic activity under rural development plans to support producers switching to other crops.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7 and 11 calling for continuing aid for agronomic research are unacceptable because promoting measures to switch into other crops is now a strategic priority and we must move decisively in this direction. The Commission takes the view that tobacco producers must be offered new ways of diversifying into other crops or other sectors. Funding can be provided for research under the Community research policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Information campaigns on the harmful effects of tobacco consumption need to be extended and new information campaigns need to contain more comprehensive information on the harmful effects of smoking. That is why we propose gradually increasing the amount retained to 5% by 2004 and why we cannot accept Amendments Nos 7 or 9. Amendments Nos 22 and 23 calling for an additional 5% to be retained are unacceptable because they will overstretch a great many enterprises financially.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7 and 16 are unacceptable; they are superfluous because the assessment due for completion by 2002 also deals with these aspects. The same applies to Amendments Nos 10 and 24. Amendments Nos 1 and 8 are unacceptable because the derogation for cooperative undertakings is difficult to justify. However, may I remind you that the auction procedure is optional for producer Member States and they are free to decide whether or not they consider it advisable to introduce this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that the individual components of this proposal, by which I mean maintaining premiums at current levels, adjusting thresholds to current production levels, the three-year period of validity and promoting diversification, form a balanced entity which is tailored to producers' requirements and takes account of new prospects. In the first quarter of 2003, the Commission will present new proposals to the European Parliament and the Council for the future of the sector thereafter, based on the results of the assessment, which should be available by the end of this year.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Langenhagen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity to extol the virtues of fish as a healthy food. With food scandals left, right and centre, there is surely nothing wrong with highlighting the benefits of healthy eating. Which is where fish come in. It is an established fact that an ever increasing proportion of the pro capita consumption of fish is in the form of processed products. That includes not just canned fish but the whole range of fish on offer, from smoked to frozen fish.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of turnover, the fish processing industry in the European Union is almost twice as large as the fisheries sector. Given the financial clout of this industry, with turnover in excess of EUR 10 billion, and its vital contribution to the food supply in the EU, I am surprised – with all due respect, Mr Fischler – that the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy pays such scant attention to this sector, especially when the statistics are as follows.</p>
<p class="contents">First, it provides almost 100 000 jobs throughout Europe. Secondly, it involves thousands of enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, often located in structurally-challenged regions with few alternative forms of employment. Thirdly, it has a long tradition of added-value processing in its many and varied forms.</p>
<p class="contents">All this clearly illustrates that the few sentences on the fish processing industry in the Green Paper are far too little and fail to take proper account of this sector, which is why I proposed this own initiative report, to draw attention to this neglected sector and, more importantly, to test out the room for political manoeuvre here in the run up to the reform of the common fisheries policy. A hearing on the subject in the Committee on Fisheries gave us an interesting insight into the many and varied working conditions, production methods and problems in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a few problem areas which I should like to highlight. First and foremost, the supply of raw materials. The fish-processing industry depends on imports for over 50% of its supplies. Admittedly, these are raw materials which the EU fleet cannot supply, which is why we need to improve conditions and guarantee security of supply. That includes reducing customs tariffs.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, environmental measures. The profitability of the processing industry, with its piecemeal structure, has been drastically reduced in certain cases by the environmental measures taken by the EU. Environmental protection is important, whether it concerns waste water, packaging or emissions. But we need to avoid unnecessary distortions as the result of specifications coming too thick and fast. What good is the cleanest water to us, if there are no jobs left in coastal regions?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, food safety. One thing is clear; the fish-processing industry does not cause pollution and toxins. Rather, it is the victim of these, which is why it should not be left to shoulder the burden alone. Surely the purpose of consumer protection is not to set limit values on the basis of the principle: ‘Value XY might be dangerous, so let us stick a 150% safety margin on top of it’. Reliable, toxicologically proven limit values make sense, rush jobs and thrashing about in the dark do not. I should like the Member States in particular to take good note of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, enlargement. The candidate countries are knocking at our door. Some countries have done exemplary work on hygiene and health protection. But there are still massive problems to be resolved before adequate standards can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, fundamentals. We need more information on this sector, which is why we have called for an analysis from the Commission. The impact of aid from the FIFG must also be examined carefully, because we do not want a sector which is drip-fed by the EU, we want an industry which is vital and can hold its own in the twenty-first century. Waiving aid in favour of self-help should relate at most to areas which are highly dependent on fisheries in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The moral of the story is that the fish-processing industry needs a higher profile in Europe. This was the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, with just one vote against. I therefore trust that I can count on your full support for this report when we vote on it at 12 noon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And, in light of the magnificent report that has been produced, I also welcome the fact that it was drafted by our rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, whom I wish to congratulate once again on her work.</p>
<p class="contents">As our rapporteur said, we feel that the Commission is not addressing the issue of this industry with the appropriate seriousness. The Green Paper is a clear example of this. This is why we expect more from the Commission in terms of its proposals, and I would say that this report is apt for that very reason.</p>
<p class="contents">The Langenhagen report addresses the problem as a whole. In 1998, we drew up a specific report on the canning industry – for which I had the honour of being rapporteur – but this report provides an update and, furthermore, encompasses the entire industry, including frozen products and the marketing aspects, as well as the products of aquaculture.</p>
<p class="contents">From Mrs Langenhagen’s report I should like to highlight her observations on both the global and European frameworks, taking account of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first case, she considers the liberalisation of imports of raw materials, which is very important, and makes specific exceptions for sensitive products such as tuna loins. She also refers to quality, to the environmental and health and hygiene standards of European products compared to imports, in order to protect European consumers from labelling fraud, which has occurred in the cases of sardines and tuna.</p>
<p class="contents">At European level, as has been said, plans are being made to deal with the consequences of the candidate countries’ accession, but in a way that does not damage the industry in regions which are behind in economic terms, and which are currently experiencing difficulties.</p>

Yet, I would still like to make a few observations. In the original recital G, it is stated that the import of fish and fisheries products from outside the EU by the processing industry could lead to conflicting interests. This is not always the case. Such imports often provide good incentives for the processing industry and can thus help maintain a good price level for European fishermen. Such a misconception is indicative of a general problem which, in my view, we are facing in our committee. There are many areas where we – to a greater or lesser extent – lack sufficient insight into how matters stand. Unfortunately, we frequently have to make new policy without having all the relevant information on which to base it. We must therefore try to obtain more insight into how things are. I am of the opinion that, with regard to research, the emphasis must be on reliability and speed. I would ask the Commission to ensure that we can have concrete, up-to-date information at our disposal, so that we can take the right decisions in all these areas at the right times. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fish processing industry employs 18 140 people in the UK, that is, 20% of the EU jobs in this sector. The majority of these jobs are in Scotland, and in some of the most peripheral areas of Scotland. These jobs provide a lifeline to so many people living in rural areas. Much more than that, they provide us with the finished fish product. Without the workers in this industry we would not enjoy the fish we take for granted.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Committee on Fisheries held a hearing and saw that the priorities for the industry were supply, continued employment, the environment, food safety, imports and also the consequences of enlargement. We know that some of our stocks are at seriously low levels, and therefore when there is a ban on cod fishing, it is not just the fishermen, but the processors that lose out too.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to work towards availability of supply, but balance this with high hygiene levels and sustainability of that supply. The processing industry is an important one, which we should never lose sight of in any fishing debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the European Parliament, the Commission also sees the European fish-processing industry as an important sector of the economy. This sector of the economy supplies quality fish products and creates jobs, especially in regions which depend on fisheries, and we are well aware of the challenges which it has to cope with.</p>
<p class="contents">There are four main problem areas. First, the inadequate supply of raw materials from EU waters, secondly, import restrictions on raw materials, thirdly, strict health, hygiene and environmental standards in the EU compared with third countries and, fourthly, increasing international competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the individual points in your report. You complain that we have forgotten this industry in our Green Paper. May I remind you that it is addressed in our structural policy, especially in items 4 to 7, 14 and 22 and have already supported measures to modernise the European fish-processing industry. The structural fund for fisheries has earmarked EUR 637 million for this purpose for the period from 2000 to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I wholeheartedly agree, however, that we need the results of the study into the impact of structural funds on the sector as quickly as possible. This study will be available in time for the interim review of the structural fund period in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the supply situation. I fully agree that we need to develop our supply policy. In the final analysis, it is the competitiveness of our own processing industry which is at stake. We shall submit a proposal along these lines before the end of this year. I expressly welcome your call for the liberalisation of port services in the EU to be harmonised to promote fair competition in the processing industry. The Commission submitted a proposal for a directive on this in May last year.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of health, hygiene and consumer protection inside and outside the Community, I should like to remind you that the relevant provisions of Community law obviously also apply to imports from third countries and we have a comprehensive inspection programme in place in the Member States and third countries in order to ensure that this is the case. We want to improve these controls still further and the relevant provisions are being revised as we speak. In addition, the European Food Safety Agency will provide us with substantiated scientific opinions on food and animal food safety in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question closely related to that of consumer protection is labelling, which was set on a new legal basis in last year's new regulation and which also applies to a whole range of processed products, including smoked, dried and frozen fish.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as preparations for enlargement are concerned, the SAPARD and PHARE programmes include measures to ensure that candidate countries quickly come up to our standards in fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that the new common organisation of the market makes greater provision for cross-sectoral producer organisations which allow the various industries in the fisheries sector, from fishing to processing and sales, to make use of their common synergy potential, for example, by adapting products to market requirements, improving product quality, developing quality labels or environmentally-friendly production methods and so on. So you see, we have already addressed certain aspects of your initiative, although much still remains to be done and you may be sure that we shall put your proposals into practice as best we can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, pursuant to Article 6 of the same Regulation, the Commission should, by 1 June 2001 at the latest, have presented the European Parliament and the Council with the evaluation report on the measures adopted in the fisheries sector for the outermost regions, which, as we all know, should receive special aid, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam, which granted them a special status. The Commission failed to fulfil that objective by not meeting the deadline set and by using as an excuse for this omission the need for a more detailed analysis using external consultants, against the backdrop of the global revision of the common fisheries policy on the basis of the Green Paper, which has already been opened to public debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of these studies determine when this report is to be presented, with the Commission proposing to delay its presentation until 1 June 2002, and, as a logical consequence, to extend the scheme in force by one year, until 31 December 2002, thereby guaranteeing the continuity and stability of the current scheme of compensation for additional costs. In short, there is nothing to worry about. This is just a pause for thought. I therefore proposed that the Committee on Fisheries deliver a favourable opinion together with some appropriate amendments to the regulation. First of all, the scheme of compensation for additional costs must clearly be permanent, with an end to time limits, because the disadvantages faced by the outermost regions as a consequence of their distance from consumer centres are not factors that time and progress will alleviate, being of a structural nature, unless we wish to see the total disappearance of the fisheries sector in these outermost regions one day.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, in order to make these debates a little less formal, to use the powerful metaphor that José Saramago, winner of the Nobel prize for literature, worked into his novel ‘The Stone Raft’, in which he imagines a split occurring between the Iberian Peninsula and the European continent and the peninsula consequently drifting away from the continent. I do not think that anyone would dare, even ironically, to imagine that the outermost islands could, even at some point in the distant future, become close once again to the European continent, thereby rendering the current concept of remoteness redundant.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now, therefore, proposed that we maintain indefinitely the scheme of aid for the additional costs of marketing certain fishery products, maybe allowing them to be gradually adapted. The future regulation must, therefore, take account of this requirement. As far as I am concerned, there is no reason why it should not change at some point in the future to become a model of income support for the fishermen in the outermost regions based on the model that is being adopted and developed to support farmers. Whatever the case, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fishing activity in the Azores, which employs around 8 000 people and has a huge socio-economic impact on the Archipelago, the 1 500 fishermen of Madeira, the fisheries sector in the Canary Islands, which employs around 13 000 people, as well as the thousands of fishermen from French Guyana and Réunion, cannot be subjected to uncertainties or to the whims of fate. They need security and stability, all the more so because they have faced some tough challenges recently, with the failure of the agreement with Morocco, which dealt a cruel blow to fisheries in the Canary Islands. I therefore think it is crucial that we increase aid for fishing activities in the outermost regions and are even more generous than we are at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, which meets the expectations of the representatives of the European Union’s outermost regions. However, as shadow rapporteur, I would like to make two additional comments. In the comprehensive list of disadvantages facing the outermost regions, the rapporteur has failed to mention a difficulty which, in my opinion, is of utmost importance, namely the problems of reaching these areas as a result of the transport links between the regions and the continent and the prices charged for this travel. And for us in the far-flung regions, this problem can increase prices by around 30%.</p>
<p class="contents">I also note that the rapporteur bases his report – and this is obviously something that I welcome – on Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which recommends that the special characteristics of outermost regions be taken into account in each of the European Union’s policies, especially in the case of fisheries. I think, however, that it would have been more logical to refer in full to Article 37 of the Treaty, which represents the very foundation of the fisheries and agricultural policies, had this Article not proved lacking as regards the EU’s outermost regions. It turns out that it is totally inappropriate in its current form since it takes into account continental fishing conditions only and fails to consider situations related to remoteness.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I fully support the rapporteur’s proposal which calls on the Commission to forward to the European Parliament a copy of the report carried out for the Commission by external consultants on the impact of all Community measures adopted to date in the fisheries sector for the outermost regions. If we were familiar with the content of this document, it would certainly give us more accurate information to consider when taking into account the specific problems of the outermost regions of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When Spain and Portugal joined the Union in 1986, the Act of Accession of these two countries included special provisions and what Article 299(2) does is to acknowledge a situation that already had a legislative identity, by means of all the special provisions of the various programmes and specific options dealing with the outermost regions, known for short as COP 6.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community Treaties and legislation, therefore, recognise the reality of the enormous distance of these regions from the continent, making it impossible for them to be competitive, which is what we are always calling for in the European Union. One only has to visit these territories, which on the face of it seem to be paradises, but which have a host of economic and social problems, to realise what this means. And Commissioner Fischler is one of the few people to have made the effort to go there. And I repeat; it is an effort to visit, because although these territories are beautiful, the lack of time and space and our knowledge of their situation make it clear that they are far from being a paradise.</p>
<p class="contents">This report by the Committee on Fisheries is an acceptable proposal; the rapporteur has done a good job and has tabled some very reasonable amendments and, in my view, Parliament can approve the report.

<p class="contents">I hope that, once the report is approved, we can find a permanent way to address the structural costs of remoteness in the marketing of some fisheries products from these regions which, as you know, are by and large far off, remote and fragmented, where natural energy is scarce and where there is a high dependence on the outside world.</p>

I am therefore grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Lage, to the Committee on Fisheries and to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for understanding and accepting my amendment, which was, in fact, intended to consolidate the unique legal code that applies to these outermost regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that fisheries play a very important role in the economic and social development of remote regions and a system of aid for marketing specific fishery products from these regions was introduced back in 1992. This aid helped producers to offset the additional costs of transporting their products to mainland Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are now proposing is to extend the present scheme by a year, that is, until the end of 2002. Why a year? The Commission will be submitting a report to the European Parliament and the Council in June of this year on the implementation and efficiency of the measures which currently apply, together with a detailed appraisal of these measures. We can then make any adjustments needed on the basis of this appraisal when the common fisheries policy is revised.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the proposed amendments: Amendments Nos 1 and 3 concern the legal basis. We have suggested Article 37 of the Treaty because these measures are no different from the provisions of the Treaty on Community policy or general principles. However, we cannot agree to extend the scheme indefinitely. The whole point of the extension, as I have said, is to give us time for a detailed appraisal of the measures taken so far. I must therefore reject Amendments Nos 1 and 3. Nor can I accept Amendment No 2, because the Commission report will not just reflect the results of the study; the report which we present will also need to take account of the impact of the measures and their application by the Member States. Amendment No 6 is problematic because, as I have said, the study is just one of numerous documents which we may need to take into account in a proposal for a new regulation. It would not therefore be appropriate to mention it separately in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I can accept Amendments Nos 4 and 5. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maat (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> First of all, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on the fact that he has succeeded in reaching an agreement within the framework of Gabon at a time when it is increasingly difficult to conclude fisheries agreements. This illustrates the fact that fisheries agreements and the European Union are a matter of particular concern. They are partly based on historic schemes, and they now offer not only financial compensation to the countries involved, but simultaneously provide very specific development aid in a large number of African countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Gabon agreement, the European Union has earmarked EUR 5 million for a four-year period; 30% of this is financial compensation and 70% is spent on education and structural aid for the coastal region. For the sake of clarity, this therefore shows that these agreements contribute greatly towards development cooperation with African countries. Incidentally, the amount in annual terms is 70% higher than the current agreement or the agreement that has just lapsed. This increase is partly due to the acquisition of additional fishing options in the 6 to 12-mile zone. And indeed, the question then arises – and this is also addressed to the Commissioner – to what extent the relevant fisheries organisations in Gabon are actually involved in this agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Gabon is required annually to submit a written justification for 70% of the amount. Fisheries account for 1.4% of Gabon’s gross national product. However, if we realise that two thirds of Gabon’s GNP originates from oil revenues, this means that the fishing industry is indeed an important industry for the country. Interestingly, only 70% of the catch capacity was used between 1998 and 2001. The Commissioner might be able to account for this. It is also striking that, with regard to coastal fishing in the true sense of the word, in other words, fishing within the 12-mile zone, only the capacity of ships has been laid down in the agreement, and not the tonnage quota. This is remarkable because, in the EU’s internal policy, we always talk about actual catch quotas and not about the capacity of the ships. Perhaps the Commissioner can also indicate that the extension of the agreement from a 6 to a 12-mile zone has no implications for Gabonese coastal fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, it is insufficiently clear what the actual costs and benefits of the agreement with Gabon will be, also for European fishermen. Although the European Commission tries hard to describe the previous agreement in its evaluation report, information about the cost-benefit ratio, the state of the fish stocks and the impact of the agreements on the regions in the EU merit further elucidation, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have already indicated that I congratulate the Commissioner on this agreement and that fisheries agreements are of paramount importance to a number of coastal regions in the European Union. In that sense, this agreement buttresses the economy in those regions and also gives a structural impulse to the European fisheries industry, which is already under strain. This does not detract from the fact – and we cannot turn a blind eye to this – that these agreements meet with increasing criticism, <span class="italic">inter alia</span> from the World Wildlife Fund and other non-governmental organisations. In future discussions about fisheries agreements, we must underline more emphatically the importance of the social support base of these agreements, both in Africa and in Europe. It would be good if the Commission too were to stress that these agreements definitely boost development cooperation with a large number of African countries, for this has not yet struck home where many people are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the report itself, I have indicated in a number of recommendations the points that require extra attention. Among the aspects to which I request that more attention be given are control measures, since the Gabonese Government is not sufficiently able to carry out the control tasks adequately, and information about how the money is actually spent and to what extent the coastal regions are actually strengthened. Regarding the implementation of this agreement, I would appreciate it if the evaluation of development measures were to be submitted to the Council and the European Parliament every two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments as adopted by the Committee on Fisheries receive my unqualified support. In fruitful cooperation with my own coordinator, Mr Farela, I have once again explained our true intentions in Amendment No 2. For that reason, I much prefer this amendment to Amendment No 9 tabled by the Liberal Group. This means that I would warmly recommend Amendment No 2, while I consider Amendment No 9 by the Liberal Group to be redundant.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the draftsmen of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation for the report and the information, and I would thank them for their input, since this too contributes to a broader support base for agreements of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today’s report could serve to cast doubt upon this stereotype, because Gabon is a country with enormous resources, mainly oil, which is extracted by Western oil companies, and has a very similar per capita income to Poland’s, as well as an enviable annual inflation rate of 2%. It goes without saying that the Community boats of four Member States, which will be fishing under this agreement, will of course do so in compliance with the principles of responsible fishing and under the strict conditions imposed by the CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us, however, are bound to wonder, as we do with regard to other agreements, whether this is a fisheries agreement or a development cooperation programme financed from the CFP, since, out of the total sum, 70% is earmarked for activities designed to develop the local fishing sector. This is why we are asking the Commission to direct some of this money to support measures to control and preserve stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Maat, the Socialist Group will be voting against Amendment No 2 and I hope the Commission will do the same, because the fees that should be paid by shipowners whose boats fish under this agreement cannot be different to those paid under other agreements unless we take Greenland as an example, where the shipowners pay not a penny of fees.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by saying that those who are attempting to prevent Gabon from being able, like any other country, to sell part of its fishing rights at more than three times its market value are doing it no favours. By the same token, they should be against Gabon exporting its oil and its minerals to places such as the Netherlands, the United States, China or France, for example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is particularly striking today is the sheer impotence of this Parliament, together with the contempt with which it is treated by the Council and the Commission. Today we are being consulted on an agreement which came into force in December 2001 – nearly three months ago. If this House had any dignity whatsoever it would protest against such cavalier treatment, but of course it is mute. This supposed watchdog has been very effectively muzzled. But even if the whole House rose up and voted to censure this proposal, it would not make a blind bit of difference. As ever, to its eternal shame, the Committee on Fisheries approved this agreement. But even if it had objected to it unanimously, once again that would not have made any difference whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">So as we move to a vote I am sure that this House will do what it always does and rubber-stamp the decision already made by the committee. As a democratic institution one has to say that it is nothing more than a sham.</p>

This is a new protocol, in which we have been able to use the excellent results from the previous agreement to increase fishing opportunities for tuna to 10 500 tonnes per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">There is now a new segment with fishing opportunities for shrimps and cephalopods, in return for which Gabon will receive financial compensation of EUR 1.2 million a year, a good 70% of which will be used to develop local fisheries in Gabon, that is, as development aid. We have also made several changes to the technical measures, in order to help guarantee the sustainable use of fish resources. They include, for example, a system of catch declarations and observers' reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the individual proposed amendments. As far as Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 5 are concerned, we agree materially. We already meet these requirements under the current interinstitutional agreements, especially the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission of 5 July 2000, which is why these proposed amendments are redundant.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must reject Amendments Nos 2 and 9. Joint financing of catch opportunities negotiated is a fundamental aspect of Community foreign fisheries policy. What happens with agreements with third countries is that the financial compensation comes out of the Community budget and the shipowners pay the licences.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say, with respect to Amendments Nos 3 and 7, that the Commission obviously considers the sustainability of fisheries and the needs of local fisheries when it negotiates fisheries protocols. I therefore have nothing against these proposed amendments but I think that they are self-evident and do not therefore necessarily warrant separate mention.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Amendment No 8 is concerned, fish stocks are evaluated before any protocol is renewed and both contracting parties can demand that the joint committee be convened at any given time in order to adjust the current protocol if problems with fish stocks should arise. I therefore feel that Amendments Nos 3, 7 and 8 are unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot accept Amendment No 6. According to standard practice, no new mandate is required for periodic protocols renewing fisheries agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The oral amendment is part of compromise amendment AC53. AC53 contains aspects of Amendments Nos 46 and 32. The adoption of Mr Radwan’s oral amendment, which I approve, does not in any way imply that we are rejecting those aspects of Amendments Nos 46 and 32. I therefore support the proposal – a logical one at that – for the compromise amendment, which includes all the proposals by various Members, to be voted on first. I think it is totally unacceptable that, in the previous vote, the amendment of one of the points rendered other points null and void which had nothing to do with what was a global compromise amendment, whose aim was to make the House vote on this relatively technical problem as quickly as possible. Therefore, if we do not agree to start with the compromise amendment, we will first have to vote on Mr Radwan’s amendment, then Amendments Nos 46 and 32, which have not lapsed in spite of Mr Radwan’s amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think, however, that the compromise amendment submitted to Mr Radwan at 5 p.m., which he approved without hesitation, should certainly be taken before Amendment No 48. I could play the imbecile and say that since Mr Radwan is using tactics that discredit the House, I shall call upon my friends to join forces to reject his oral amendment. As for myself, in the interests of the stability of the financial markets in Europe, I think his amendment is fine. Therefore, I approve it and I ask you to agree to vote on it, and then to adopt it. But I would point out to you that Mr Radwan’s thoroughly devious tactics have also caused amendments approved by the Council and the Commission, as well as many Members, to lapse and I think that devious tactics of this type are a discredit to Parliament.</p>

Following on from the Lisbon Summit in the spring of 2000, which wanted to turn Europe into the world’s most competitive economy, Mr Lipietz wants to make the EU the safest haven for financial activities. This is why he would like legislation which offers the financial markets opportunities to develop. In his view, it is not the Member States that decide which of the three methods are used for the calculation of the supplementary capital adequacy. Instead, the financial conglomerates can make that choice themselves, provided that they make their decision public.</p>
<p class="contents">I find little concern for people and the environment in his vision and too much understanding of the requirements of companies involved in capital management. However, I am aware that it is preferable to regulate these markets than to leave them to their own devices on a world scale, whereby those with the greatest spirit of adventure are given free rein and the most immoral companies elbow the others out of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider his proposal as a first step which will make it easier to draft rules later on in the interests of the financing of public services, the fight against poverty, democratic control and care for the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also believe that we can no longer have a situation where Member States adopt and publish a directive on this issue before ascertaining whether the same measures will be applied in dependent or associated territories, and before having concluded negotiations with third countries on the application of equivalent measures, on the understanding that withholding tax is not the same as the exchange of information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are some who support a withholding tax, implemented as a tax levied at source which settles the tax position of the person concerned.

The EU has been unable to solve this cross-border problem for the past 13 years. All proposals to make the existence of foreign capital visible to national tax offices have, further to opposition, subsequently been withdrawn. Precisely in this area, each Member State in the Council has the capacity to thwart a regulation. If a scheme is not put in place in time for the expected accession of ten new Member States in 2004, it will probably not enter into force in the foreseeable future. For me, this is a reason to approve the compromise whereby Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria can continue to levy tax at source for another seven years while the other Member States adopt a scheme for the cross-border exchange of information. Despite this, the problem is not completely solved by a long chalk, as long as wealthy people can transfer their capital to a separate legal entity which falls outside the scope of such an exchange of information.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted that a majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wish to exempt this latter group, which contravenes the proposal of the rapporteur. In addition, the condition agreed among the ministers only to apply the scheme if, for example, Switzerland adopts the same scheme can, once again, lead to inertia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This regime of specific measures applied over a ten-year period has been unable to deal with the serious problems facing the sector, which is important to nut-growing countries on several counts. The main reason it has been unable to do so is because the specific measures fall well short of actual requirements and, more importantly, of the Community's preferential customs regime for third countries such as the USA and Turkey. As a result, any efforts to improve the nut sector are undermined by a glut of very cheap imports of similar products from the USA and Turkey.</p>

I was appointed rapporteur by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which examined the proposal over the course of nine meetings, adopted my report in April 1969 and debated it in Strasbourg in May 1969.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I recalling this? Because, at that time, we proposed a new type of market organisation based on a contract system, providing, within the framework of the Community preference, a fair income for producers, as well as social measures and assistance for changing activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear that I do not believe that, on the pretext of combating nicotine addiction, we must phase out raw tobacco cultivation in the Community. There are regions where tobacco growing is a major source of income for small farmers and where changing activity, either to undertake growing other crops or to carry out other economic activities, is extremely difficult, if not impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1969, we had already written that social measures and assistance for changing activity could be justified much more easily than financing excess production of varieties which do not find a buyer on the market. We pointed out that measures for changing activity as well as those aimed at enhancing tobacco growing in a quantitative and qualitative manner should be integrated in the regional policy and the policy for improving agricultural structures. We even warned that selling surpluses on the global market could only harm associated countries and the interests of the Community’s external trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As it is never too late to make amends, it is justified that we support our rapporteur today in order to restrict ourselves to changing the Commission’s proposals solely from a technical perspective and to postpone the in-depth political debate on the future regime on raw tobacco until 2003.</p>

Fortunately, there are now plans afoot to phase these subsidies out, but the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is still opposed to these plans. This committee draws attention to the socio-economic importance of the production of tobacco, which is located in the poorest regions of the EU, and to the difficulty of switching over to other crops.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way, this committee could refer to the importance of the production of the raw materials for cocaine by the farmers in the poorest regions of Columbia. The difference is that, in one case, we provide subsidies and, in the other, we tolerate a situation in which, under American influence, armed action is taken against these farmers and foreign aircraft take off from Dutch colonial territory to carry out reconnoitring exercises with a view to spraying toxins.</p>
<p class="contents">Applying double standards lacks all credibility. The money used for the tobacco subsidies could be better spent on informing the public about the harmful effects of tobacco consumption and on supporting regions that switch to other crops.

About 130 000 landowners and 400 000 seasonal workers are involved in tobacco production and processing in the European Union. These figures alone are enough to justify and provoke a study on the social and economic costs of suppressing aid to tobacco, even before we get to the political debate on this crop’s future in the European Union. In any case, restrictions on tobacco growing in Europe would have no effect on consumption except to turn European consumers towards tobaccos from outside the European Union, which are of much poorer quality and certainly more harmful to health.</p>
<p class="contents">Added to this is the fact that Commission document <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2001&amp;nu_doc=0264">COM (2001) 264</a> of 15 May 2001 on sustainable development stresses that ‘political leaders should determine the pros and cons for other political contexts and take them into account. A thorough evaluation of all the effects of a proposed political action must include estimates of its environmental and social impact both inside and outside the EU.’</p>
<p class="contents">As European Republicans, we therefore believe that the Commission should make a concerted effort to promote studies and research into possible alternative crops that would maintain the rural fabric in a sustainable manner. We agree with the draftsman, Mrs Redondo Jiménez, that the political debate on tobacco should be held over until Parliament has received an evaluation report on the management of the fund, with any proposed amendments and improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">For the reasons given above, we say ‘no’ to the under-cover gradual elimination of subsidies for tobacco growing; we call for the current contribution levels for the research fund activities to be maintained for 2002/2003/2004, since agronomic research is today one of the most important ways of making tobacco consumption less harmful to health; and we support the amended report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is reportedly due to enlargement and the fear that, soon, a huge contribution will have to be made to the EU budget. As we all know, the Dutch watch their pennies. I support the call for a policy review. However, my reason for doing so is not enlargement, but the fact that agricultural policy includes schemes that are completely unrelated to healthy agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The common organisation of the market in the raw tobacco industry is, for a variety of reasons, unhealthy. Although I recognise that agricultural policy must address the social dimension, as well as the economic dimension, of operational management, this common organisation of the market has swung completely towards social policy. An industry is being maintained which is both harmful to public health and unprofitable. The premiums remove all incentive from the farmer to adapt his agricultural plan. In this way, he stands to lose out all round.</p>
<p class="contents">Tobacco is a product which damages public health. I should like to invite MEPs who wish to challenge this notion to initiate proceedings against the warning on cigarette packets. The argument that the market demands tobacco and that current European production must thus be maintained is a specious argument quoted by various Members of this House. After all, market demand does not mean that production must be subsidised. If this is set to become a commonly held notion in agricultural policy, the net payers in the Union are in for a rough ride.</p>
<p class="contents">Adjustments to the common organisation of the market in the rough tobacco industry must encourage growers to look for alternative crops. The Commission proposal is promising. Reference is made in no uncertain terms to the gradual abolition of subsidies, while measures are introduced to develop alternative sources of income. The rapporteur, Mr Cunha does not do Europe any favours by wishing to delete this Commission comment. This is why, together with 31 other Members of this Parliament, I have tabled an amendment whereby this report would expressly call for tobacco production subsidies to be phased out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The world population has risen enormously, previously virgin territory has been bisected by traffic connections, and large areas have been seized for the production of food, the growing of industrial crops and urbanisation. Tropical forests are being cut down or burnt down on a massive scale, animal species become extinct due to economic exploitation, oceans are emptied of fish stocks, indigenous peoples are driven out of their territories, and plants and animals are being patented.</p>
<p class="contents">What until recently was still considered progress is nowadays increasingly seen as a threat to the future. This is why it is so important to do more to protect what is left of natural plant and animal life and to promote the survival of people who, since time immemorial, have lived in sparsely populated areas surrounded by rich fauna and flora.</p>
<p class="contents">This group of people are becoming significantly impoverished and are therefore forced to move to the cities or destroy their natural surroundings to allow for more industry and intensive agriculture. Appropriate measures include support for non-governmental organisations, adapting development plans for the Developing World and changing the EU’s agricultural policy.

<p class="contents">The European Union, and the European Parliament in particular, consider the protection of citizens, their environment, their daily lives and their health to be of great importance. Balanced texts on these subjects are very often approved at Community level. It is apparent to us, however, that the transposition of a number of directives by the Member States is being unjustifiably delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on urban waste water treatment is an example of a directive that has been poorly applied. It was adopted in 1991 with the aim of protecting the environment against the effects of urban waste water and biodegradable waste water discharge from the food industry. When it was applied, the directive brought about a measured improvement in water quality. The Member States’ main duty is to put in place systems for collecting and processing waste water and to respect a pre-established timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, not only are some Member States delaying in passing on all the information required to carry out an objective assessment of this directive but, even worse, others are not communicating any information on this subject. This is absolutely unacceptable!</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore demand that the time the Member States take to do this should not increase, that all the information is passed onto the Commission, as stipulated in the directive which was adopted in a timely manner by the Council. I came out in favour of the Commission’s launch of infringement procedures in cases where the criteria for identification of sensitive areas have not been respected or taken into account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of the 527 agglomerations comprising more than 150 000 inhabitants, 94 discharge their effluent unprocessed into the environment and 134 others provide insufficient information. More than 43% are therefore in default. The data for the reference date in 1998 is not yet available, and it is even unknown how many infringement procedures are pending at the European Court of Justice. All of this confirms that the EU is mainly an economic community which sets large multinational companies free from national rules that hinder their operations. Other matters receive far less attention, and useful rules remain hollow phrases. In this case, it is not irresponsible companies that are to blame but failing government. It is important, however, to identify the cause of this failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Large cities have many problems and receive far too little funding from their national governments, which economise with a view to reducing taxes and enhancing the profitability of industry and the stability of the euro.

To tackle this potentially harmful situation, the Council and Parliament reacted by adopting the so-called ‘urban waste water treatment’ directive in 1991.</p>
<p class="contents">Like most of my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I condemn the fact that 11 years after its adoption and four years after the deadline for cities with a population equivalent of above 10 000 to be provided with collecting systems and waste water treatment plants, there are many Member States who still do not conform to this directive’s legally binding timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regret the fact that the Committee on the Environment has not adopted one of the amendments that I tabled, namely a common sense amendment which explained the reasons why so many Member States have not yet applied this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is probably because the very short deadlines imposed by Directive 91/271/EEC (six and a half years for water treatment in sensitive areas) did not take into account the situation of several large Member States’ cities. These cities still did not have an urban waste water treatment plant in 1991 and also had to conform to other common European standards in the areas of the award of public contracts and studies into environmental effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Need we point out that the average time limit for awarding public contracts in the sector is three years, need we also stress that a water treatment plant with a connection system for collecting sewage costs an average of EUR 400 million?</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, a good piece of Community legislation is one which chooses between what is desirable and what is feasible. We must note that the drafting of the ‘urban waste water treatment’ directive has failed to adhere to this essential rule. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It demonstrates yet again that the capitalist system is in too deep a state of crisis to respond to any measures to manage it, even the World Trade Organisation's ‘rules of good conduct’ for free trade and free competition. The United States has no hesitation in violating any agreements made in order to defend their interests.</p>
<p class="contents">This crisis has once again brought the antagonism within the international imperialist system and the more general conflict between the centres of imperialism vying for hegemony to the surface. The American imperialist system has no hesitation in taking measures which hit the economy of the European imperialist system and the European imperialist system has no hesitation in hitting back, despite its amazing willingness to tread the same path and vie for its share of the spoils of military opportunism. The demands of the American trades union have clearly been used as a pretext for the decision by the Bush administration to impose customs tariffs, a decision taken on the back of the more general crisis to hit the capitalist economy after the worst year's international trading for 25 years and after a fall of 38% in American steel imports over the last three years.</p>
<p class="contents">The workers stand to gain nothing from this wrangling. In the end, American workers will not escape restructuring and unemployment and European workers will not ward off the spectre of redundancies by running to the WTO. What the USA and the ΕU are doing their best to save are the profits of the steel industries. But even if they manage to limit the fallout from the present crisis, another one will be along shortly. This is typical of social systems which have long run out of anything to offer society, and capitalism is one such system. The only way out is to overturn it, however difficult that may seem under present circumstances. Crises like the steel crisis bring new opportunities for action by the working classes; they can be used to rally the workers and they lay bare the ugly face of capitalism.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament resolution only skims the surface of the problem and tries to deal with it within liberalist parameters. It is interesting that the European Parliament resolution accuses the United States of failing to restructure the steel industry promptly, as the European Union did. In other words, it accuses it of failing to close enough companies and make enough workers redundant unlike, for example, the Greek steel industry. That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Europe voted against the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, we were also alarmed by the assured and clear conscience displayed by Commissioner Lamy yesterday in the House, when he gave us a lecture on American free-market morale. We must point out a few realities that have been forgotten, and which should lead to greater discretion being shown.</p>
<p class="contents">1- First of all, the tax introduced by the US, which is likely to be of up to 30%, closely corresponds to the depreciation of the euro since its introduction, which certainly imposes monetary dumping on our trade partners. Naturally, no one in Europe mentions this because, however unexpected it may be, this depreciation favours us commercially. The fact remains that it is the source of serious prejudice to our partners. Admittedly, the United States hoped for the ‘strong dollar’, but equally, they did not want an overly powerful dollar, which seriously punishes their own industries.</p>
<p class="contents">2- In the steel dispute, the United States has cited the need for safeguard measures to avoid domestic problems. In this case, they may well be disregarding the WTO rules that they themselves adopted, and by which they find themselves trapped. The fact remains, however, that they pose a real problem. Instead of trying to triumph over them, should they not instead jump at the opportunity, and propose to consider the legitimate exceptions to a free trade doctrine, for the developed countries, and even more so for the under-developed countries? Europe, in particular, would do well to consider this issue if it wants, in future, to save its agricultural model.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, one might also wonder whether Commissioner Lamy’s thundering declarations, attacking the ‘unilateralism’ of the American measures, will, in future, end up reinforcing (or are actually designed to reinforce) the multilateral approach of a simplistic free trade doctrine, as adopted at the end of the Uruguay Round through the manipulation of public opinion. And we will in future realise that these reinforced approaches are, as an indirect consequence, holding us prisoner on other subjects that are vital for us, such as agriculture. The manipulation goes on.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a continuous threat of trade wars if American products are subjected to requirements in terms of the environment and consumer protection. The EU has largely adopted this free trade ideology. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that this free trade too is subordinate to American self-interest and is only supported if it leads to the favouring of American companies. The leading group in America considers its own country to be the best in the world. Like the Soviet Union and China in the past, the US derive from this pretension the right to do everything they do not allow others to do. Accordingly, international impunity is demanded for American war criminals, unilateral threats are made to use nuclear weapons and European steel is banned from the American market by means of an import levy.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the lessons the EU should draw from this is that free-trade ideology leads to accidents. Europe should focus more on economic self-sufficiency, in other words autarchy, rather than on promoting imports, exports, globalisation and growing mutual dependence on the US and Japan. This is the best way to steer clear of any trade wars and economic instability imported from outside Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This recommendation is based on a realistic and modern vision of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The economic slowdown in the United States is having repercussions within the European Union. However, this fact alone cannot explain the weak results posted by a number of Member States. There are, in fact, domestic problems that must be resolved, and structural reforms are expected.</p>
<p class="contents">All European consumers must be able to freely choose their service provider. Furthermore, an innovative competition policy, resisting all the dominant positions, is emerging within the European Union. This approach must be encouraged, particularly by involving all the parties concerned so that we can be more effective, both personally and collectively. This does not mean reforming against the actors, but to make these sectors develop in conjunction with them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also essential to take specific measures in the areas of education, training and research development if we wish to retain highly competent employees and ensure that our businesses are as competitive as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">This report also proposes to increase the retirement age for workers who wish to remain active. Today’s widespread practice of compulsory retirement is an enormous waste of skills, talent and experience. These experienced people can still fulfil worthwhile tasks in our businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, analysts show that the current economic slowdown could have been much more serious were it not for Monetary Union. Therefore, those who are now driven by concerns regarding their domestic policy and are advocating a return to the past, have got the wrong century, and are confusing personal interest with general interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Due to a lack of understanding of the reasons behind the economic recovery of 1997-2001 and the recent economic downturn, the report proposes solutions, such as the strict application of the inapplicable Stability and Growth Pact, which can do nothing more than to aggravate the current recession.</p>
<p class="contents">The report stresses efforts to promote training and R&amp;D, as if, in the area of employment, spending on these could replace demands for salary increases and an overall reduction in working time. It dares to mention ‘social cohesion’ whilst the lower taxes and social security contributions that it recommends can lead to nothing more than the formation of inequalities.

<p class="contents">It is disconcerting, therefore, that the Della Vedova report begins by making a sort of semi-sincere confession that tax policy must remain within the exclusive competence of the Member States whilst the rest of the text goes on to advise how the Union can go about acquiring the same prerogative.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we have had a close shave. The text that was voted for in committee was a vast improvement on the proposal of the rapporteur, who perceived a European tax to be an opportunity to reaffirm the federal principle of European integration. The majority of Members of this House thought it was more prudent to delete this excess candour and replace it with a text which, in the end, hides behind a certain type of liberalism, recommending lower taxes before eventually demanding moving to the use of taxation policy instruments that are controlled by Community authorities, the Commission and Parliament itself.</p>
<p class="contents">By inching its way along as usual, the House is making progress, admittedly, but in much the same way as a crab. And we have still only made half as much progress as we intended. The proposals regarding VAT are not bold enough. We should have, on the one hand, reaffirmed that each nation is sovereign in this area and, on the other hand, made broader proposals than those which aim to make NGOs exempt from paying VAT and to include, for example, all the cultural events staged by non profit-making associations.</p>

Without taxes, there would be no universally available education, no health care, public transport or safety on the streets, and anyone suffering from long-term illness or unemployment would be condemned to a life of begging on the streets.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the European Commission has other priorities, and the Italian radical Della Vedova is a faithful supporter. He complains about the tax burden which, since 1970, has risen, on average, from 35% to 45% and hopes that tax competition between the Member States will lead to a tax cut for companies. Although he refers to the tax level as a domestic problem for every Member State, at the same time he pushes for companies to be able to choose their registered offices in a state where the tax burden is lowest. He then goes on to focus on indirect taxes, such as VAT, and deems direct taxes, such as income tax, to be an unfair barrier to income from labour.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with him that a tax on environmental pollution can be a viable alternative, but this will no longer be effective once the environment has become truly clean. The emphasis on VAT, on the other hand, means that everyone pays the same amount for inevitable basic expenses and, as such, it widens the income gap between the rich and the poor.

<p class="contents">It is clear, therefore, that the aim of granting a legal personality to the European Union, as well as the Communities, is to create a competent new actor on the international stage, which will use all the opportunities provided by Article 24 of the TEU (particularly since its revision after the Nice Summit) to gradually remove from Member States the autonomy of their foreign policy. Europe would then have entered the era of the super-state, before the citizens have decided whether this is what they actually want.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe, on the contrary, as we explained in the minority opinion attached to the report, that the European Union must remain a unique organisation of major and responsible States – in other words, major and responsible national democracies – which are organised in a network. It will be the work of the Convention coming together over the coming months to find the combination that best encourages voluntary synergy, without abolishing the freedom of choice of the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very much in favour of facilitating the development of the fish products processing industry in Europe, as this report advocates. The fish will not like the idea, as we know, but if it means that more jobs will be created then I feel that it is a good thing for Europe.

<p class="contents">I must confess, Mr President, that having taken part, together with other Members of this House, in a meeting in Los Pozos with ‘Tirofijo’ and the leadership of FARC, this decision comes as no surprise to me. On that occasion we begged for the release of the European Union citizens kidnapped by FARC and also, at the request of his wife and daughter, of a Colombian senator who was ill. Needless to say, we achieved nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Mr President, this Parliament must raise its voice once again to condemn all the murders, including the recent murder of senator Marta Catalina Daniels, all the violations of human rights in Colombia and to demand that FARC releases all the people it has kidnapped, including the Presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Parliament has always demonstrated its commitment to the way of peace and of dialogue to solve the conflict, but in the knowledge that dialogue must be sought by both parties and that a society cannot remain forever deaf, dumb and blind to violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Sunday, Colombian society demonstrated civil courage and democratic maturity. This is why, Mr President, today more than ever and on the eve of the forthcoming Presidential elections, the international community and this Parliament and the European Union in general must continue to show solidarity and their support for Colombia’s legitimate government, for the entire spectrum of democratic forces and of civil society, with the demand, as always, that in order to overcome the serious problems affecting the country we must insist on the way of peace, harmony, reconciliation, justice and dialogue, and insist that the problems cannot be overcome by violence, because Colombian society is crying out for peace. To conclude, Mr President, I feel that this Parliament should stand side by side with Colombia in this crucial exercise of the Presidential elections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Various political groups tabled motions for resolutions and then we agreed on a joint motion for a resolution, that should now – I believe – have the support of most of the House. As previous speakers have said, the situation in Colombia is a painful issue for all of us, because we had great hopes for the successful conclusion of the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">President Pastrana has dedicated his mandate almost entirely to these efforts, with a series of very generous concessions to the guerrilla organisations: he has opened negotiations, both with FARC and the ELN and yet has achieved little.</p>
<p class="contents">In specific terms, he has given FARC a territory the size of Switzerland, an entire enclave in which they can travel with absolute freedom, and lastly, when it still looked as though negotiations might break down, President Pastrana even extended the agreements or negotiations, in an attempt to conclude an agreement. During this extension phase, FARC launched a campaign of kidnappings and murders, which culminated in the murder of Senator Daniels and the kidnapping of a presidential candidate, Mrs Ingrid Betancourt. At the same time, FARC is continuing its extortion activities, claiming a supposed right to impose taxes on drug-trafficking organisations, which I believe has completely stripped it of any legitimacy, because an organisation that takes part in acts of gratuitous violence and which, furthermore, tries to make money out of drugs trafficking, ultimately loses any basis for legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, therefore, we are rather disillusioned and feel a degree of despair, although this does not mean that we are going to give up on the possibility that an agreement can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the first aspect is to state that FARC has failed to meet its commitments and has all but abandoned the peace process; it has made it impossible for the government to negotiate, because you cannot negotiate with killers and kidnappers. On the other hand, it is necessary to try to restart the peace process and to leave the door open for negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union have always supported this process of negotiation, including practical proposals, designed to alleviate some of the specific social problems. It has become clear that the definitive solution to the problem of Colombia does not simply involve an end to the violence, but that we must get to the root of the social and economic problems that are causing this. In order to reach that point, however, peace must first be achieved on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know at the moment whether it is possible to add a little trust and calm to the situation, but I would say that the European Union has – where the problem of Colombia is concerned – the advantage of distance and, furthermore, the willingness it has always shown to help Colombia with its exports, for example, in a range of key sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution aims, therefore, on the one hand, to illustrate the responsibility of those who have caused the breakdown of the peace process and, on the other, to leave the door to negotiation open and to call on the European institutions to patiently continue with this lengthy and complicated task, by providing the aid necessary to make this process easier and, of course, by not giving in to despair, and instead by trusting that, ultimately, there will be a return to reason and to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European institutions can work together in this aspect, and we hope that the Commission can indeed help to resolve this deadly and longstanding conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The interventions I have heard so far strike me as somewhat lacking in balance.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall read the words of the non-governmental human rights organisation ‘Human Rights Watch’: “The human rights situation clearly deteriorated in the course of last year. In the first ten months of the year, the office of the Public Advocate recorded 92 massacres, which they defined as the killing of three or more people at the same place and at the same time. Most were linked to paramilitary groups, followed by guerrillas. The national epidemic of kidnappings, half of which were committed by guerrillas, gave no signs of abating.”</p>
<p class="contents">The report also states that two million Colombians have been displaced and that this year, more people than ever before – 300 000 – have been displaced. It also states that human rights workers, trade unionists, journalists, government investigators and community leaders continue to be murdered because of their work.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we will be voting on a resolution today. I prefer the resolution we voted for last year, which I felt was more balanced, because it noted and clearly condemned the ongoing fumigation of crops and the fact that alternative crops were not being promoted to prevent human disease and the constant attacks on biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year’s resolution also stated that the European Union should adopt a different, non-militaristic position, which supports the defence of human rights, dialogue and peace. We repeat this demand today and I agree with my fellow Members that this should be done. This resolution also condemned the fact that, since 60% of Colombians live on less than one dollar per day, it is very hard to achieve dialogue, agreements, or peace. This is why, Mr President, I felt that some balance needed to be added to the previous interventions, although I agree with what most of my fellow Members have to say. But it was necessary to mention other parties involved in the war in Colombia, who exert an enormous influence in the absence of peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My fellow Members have reiterated how much the Colombian people need peace and tranquillity, rather than this type of action.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we still do not have any news regarding Mrs Bétancour’s situation which could put our minds at rest. The governments involved and the Commission must therefore try to obtain some information and assist in Mrs Bétancour’s release. But apart from this, as other speakers have said, we must welcome the statement by President Pastrana, who stated that he wanted to step up his fight against this type of action and provide effective guarantees for the security of the civil society in Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perfectly clear that, if President Pastrana leaves the door to negotiations open, then these negotiations must relate to the respect of human rights and restoring order in Colombia so that genuine democracy can finally be established in this country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must therefore provide greater support for cooperation efforts, which will improve the human rights situation, and it must ensure that the European aid achieves its objective, in other words to assist civil society in Colombia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This resulted in over 400 massacres in 1999. Sadly, for those 400 massacres committed by the government, paramilitary groups and guerrilla groups, not one person was brought to trial. The ordinary people of Colombia live and suffer in an environment of oppression caused not only by these paramilitary and guerrilla groups, but often at the hands of a government which is either unwilling or unable to protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">As a body that has consistently upheld fundamental human rights and social justice, we need to do what we can to contribute towards bringing peace to a country that has been living under the horrors of civil war for over four decades. In our individual Member States, and collectively as the European Union, we must exert whatever pressure we can to bring the government and FARC back to the negotiating table, under a real ceasefire agreement genuinely observed by all parties to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also support those groups working for peace within Colombia, which have provided a safe haven for civilians but have recently been under attack from the AUC and FARC. Additionally we must persuade the United States to fund peace initiatives rather than simply giving more money to the Colombian Government for military and drug eradication purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Colombia are tired of the fighting. We, as a democratically elected forum, must use our moral authority to help the people of Colombia in their struggle to bring to an end the conflict in their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Taiwan is a country with a very ambitious public health programme, and its people are among those with the longest average life span in Asia. Infant mortality is low, and many of the diseases that a large number of countries in the world are still combating, such as cholera, chickenpox and malaria, have been eradicated.</p>
<p class="contents">A delegation from the Taiwanese health ministry visited us here in Strasbourg during the last part-session, and we had the opportunity then to hear a little about Taiwan’s experience. Many valuable lessons have been learned in Taiwan, and there is a great willingness to be of help, both economically and in terms of sharing knowledge. We know that the WHO is in great need of financial aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to say something about Taiwan as a political entity. My political group, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, supports democratic developments in Taiwan. We view what has been happening there with a very great deal of sympathy and support the Taiwanese people’s right to decide their own future.</p>
<p class="contents">A few months ago, we invited President Chen Shui-bian here to award him the Liberal International Freedom Prize, but the French authorities would not give him a visa. We then tried to invite him to Belgium, and the Belgium authorities would not give him a visa either. Instead, they referred to an EU agreement not to invite the President of Taiwan, because to do so would threaten relations with China. Last week, we invited him to Sweden under a private arrangement, and he was not given a visa for my country either.</p>
<p class="contents">When I recently investigated what rules apply, I learned that there is no such agreement at EU level. It would be illuminating to be told what really applies.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is disgusting to grovel in this way to the Chinese dictatorship. It should go without saying that a democratically elected leader should be given a visa when, for example, he receives an invitation from his Liberal colleagues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not a country which is first and foremost an aid beneficiary; it is a country which actively supports international organisations. Taiwan has been actively involved in the WHO. It would be a mistake if this country were unable to join the international community, which is why we could make a start by giving it observer status and letting it work with other international organisations in the future.

A good, healthy constitution is important to everyone here on earth, but it is only through access to information and medical care that public health can be improved. And there is much that can only be done jointly and in synergy. I am thinking, for example, of infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and others. The World Health Organisation and its current complement of 199 members have nailed their colours to the mast and are committed to improving health throughout the world. Health is a valuable commodity which everyone has the right to enjoy, which is why I take the view that, in an area which affects everyone, no one who wants to help improve the welfare of people in their own and other countries should be excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Taiwan has expressed a desire to help the WHO, both financially and technically, which is why I think there is not just good cause, it is imperative that Taiwan be granted observer status at the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly. I have first hand experience of the political problems and tensions affecting Taiwan and, as in most cases, it is not just one side which is to blame. But I am firmly convinced that we should not be led by political differences to stop a country joining international efforts in the health sector and I therefore call on the House to support this joint resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was to be expected. No effort has been spared to achieve this result, although the majority was smaller than anticipated. Nevertheless, I see this as a moral victory for the opposition, which itself uses the term ‘stolen elections’.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the stolen elections in Chad and the rigged elections in Zambia, this is the third round of elections which, with the best will in the world, cannot be considered free and fair according to international standards, no matter how moderate a view some other African countries, for reasons probably known only to themselves, still take. After all, the writing was on the wall: 4.5 million voters expected and 7.5 million ballots printed so as to be prepared for every eventuality; too few polling stations to enable everyone to vote properly; and the inevitable confusion about who had to vote where, since different elections needed to be held for different levels on the same day but at different locations.</p>
<p class="contents">These are only the technicalities which typify Mr Mugabe’s craftiness. More important was the terror which preceded this, the obstructions put in place by the ruling elite in order to prevent the opposition from meeting, the monopoly of the state channels, the prevention of journalists from doing their job, the obstacles placed in the way of observers, the incidents of torture and the abductions, including even the abduction of important union leaders. The list goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the ploy involving the distribution of corn, far away from the polling stations, was predicted by the opposition. The performance about re-opening the polling stations was the icing on the cake, and yet we need to ask ourselves: what now?</p>
<p class="contents">The elections were not conducted freely and fairly, but do we need to condemn them altogether? The elections in Zambia and Chad were not free and fair either. However, we do need to maintain the sanctions. I am not in favour of extending these, but they do need to be applied and monitored. I do call for negotiations between the members of the majority and the opposition, for the country is anxious about a civil war.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that a government of national unity, involving the opposition, will be set up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The elections in Zimbabwe were an incredible farce, even by African standards. Mr Mugabe made every effort to stay in power, using extremely brutal means. Nothing was too extreme for the purpose of eliminating his opponents: violence, intimidation, murder, large-scale arrests and accusations of high treason. Election laws were changed at the last minute. There were selectively too few ballot stations, identity cards were seized, the media was not allowed to do its job and the observation of the elections was a joke. Politically blind South African observers made absolute fools of themselves by declaring that the elections had been conducted fairly and freely.</p>
<p class="contents">Mugabe wants – by hook or by crook – to pursue his ill-fated policy which has led Zimbabwe to the brink of starvation, where 80% of the population live beneath the poverty line and 60% are unemployed. Tougher sanctions must be used in order even further to isolate Mugabe internationally. We should not punish the population for the wrong-doings of its leader. What is the scope for tougher sanctions, according to the Commissioner? What will the Commission propose to the European Council in Barcelona?</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, democracy in Africa often leaves a great deal to be desired. African solidarity with the dictator Mugabe is sadly a very bad omen. This is why we must focus our political efforts not only on Zimbabwe, but also on the other countries in that region. South Africa receives a great deal of aid from Europe but is unconcerned about the justified criticism levelled at its neighbour. I pity Africa, I pity the population that has to suffer so much at the hands of incompetent, power-crazed and corrupt leaders. When will we finally have a generation of democratic leaders in Africa? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can still remember electoral victories claimed by presidents who were very soon overtaken, and were very soon presidents no more. I do not wish to draw any direct parallels, but it seems to me that he should not be too quick to celebrate his victory over his opponents. Especially as the elections were held under the worst possible conditions, with intimidation, police action against members and supporters of the opposition and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">What saddens me is not just the situation in Zimbabwe itself, but the fact that numerous African Heads of State and Government and President Mugabe are indirectly providing a shield, even as they acknowledge his election victory. Perhaps this hides the fear of more neo-colonialism on the part of Europe or the United States of America and other countries. That certain parties may be entertaining such thoughts is, of course, no concern of ours. It may be the case, but it is not the policy of the European Union. What concerns us is the people who are starving there, who are suffering repression there. A few days ago, I was on a jury which awarded a prize to the Nobel prize-winner Amartya Sen. This man has stated time and again that democracy and development go hand in glove and cannot be separated. Which is why I think that the European Union should do everything it can to create democracy and the conditions for economic development here too.</p>
<p class="contents">We, by which I mean everyone from the European Union due to attend the session of the ACP/EU joint parliamentary assembly in Cape Town, shall no doubt be addressing these concerns. Most importantly, we must call on South Africa to do proper justice to its hugely important role in southern Africa. Unfortunately, we shall also have to step up sanctions, despite the economic difficulties. But, and I say it again, if his African neighbours were to work with the European Union in taking against this dictatorship, success would come quickly and we could really help the people in this sorely afflicted country.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Orden (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in this seriously flawed presidential election, we have good grounds for believing that Mugabe in reality lost the vote, but merely contrived to win the count. He will now be able to have his foot on the neck of the Zimbabwean people for another six years. It represents a new low for democracy in Zimbabwe and a disaster not just for Zimbabwe, but for the whole of Southern Africa. Mugabe personifies all the most negative strains in African development: corrupt and authoritarian power with state leaders lining their pockets at the expense of the people, racial division, the exploitation of envy, political violence and economic backwardness.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe is a beautiful and once prosperous country with the potential to be the bread basket for the region. Instead, the economy is in chaos, with rampant inflation and unemployment and half a million of its people living on the edge of starvation, sustained only by world food aid. Mugabe's re-election will seriously exacerbate all of these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that Mugabe realised that his game might be up some two years ago, ZANU-PF came close to losing the general election; and that is why for the past two years – not just the past two weeks – he has been trying to fix the political system in his favour by a systematic campaign of terror and intimidation against anyone who opposed him. This Parliament should pay tribute to Morgan Tsvangirai, the MDC activists and all those who have had the courage to stand up to Mugabe for all this time.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say it is a pity that the international community took so long to wake up to the situation in Zimbabwe and that the European Union waited until the eleventh hour before imposing targeted sanctions. At least we in this Parliament can hold our heads up. We have been active throughout the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude of African countries has been particularly disappointing. We always felt that South Africa, in particular, held the key to restoring genuine democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. However, South Africa's leaders were found wanting. They could not find it in their consciences to condemn what they perhaps saw as one of their liberation brothers. What a pity for the people of Zimbabwe – all the people of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">At least the Southern African Development Community election observer mission has felt able to recognise in its announcement yesterday that: 'the electoral process could not be said to adequately comply with the norms and standards for elections in the SADC region'. What they mean, I think, Mr President, is that the election was clearly rigged. Certainly, that is the opinion of the few other international observers that remained. How else do we explain, for instance, the bizarre declaration that turnout in the city areas loyal to Tsvangirai was low, while in the ZANU-PF rural strongholds, it was remarkably high? How else do we explain the missing ballot boxes which suddenly turn up stuffed up with Mugabe votes?</p>
<p class="contents">The international community must maintain its resolve. It must not recognise the legitimacy of this election result. There must be an intensification of the hunt for looted assets held overseas by Mugabe and his cronies. There should be an extension of the EU blacklist, and we need to take further tough measures. South Africa must begin to show leadership and demonstrate that it is committed to democratic principles in the region. Our aim must be to help restore democracy, human rights and the rule of law to Zimbabwe and assist in the process of economic progress there. Our tough resolution today is a contribution to this, and I hope the Council and the Commission will listen to us.</p>

The opposition’s election workers have been threatened, persecuted, imprisoned and killed. Freedom of expression is non-existent. Many Zimbabweans queued for hours and were still not allowed to vote. Mr Mugabe has broken promise after promise and driven his country into the ground. Under his leadership, Zimbabwe, a country with fantastic potential, has headed straight for the abyss.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worrying that so many African leaders have tried to explain away what has been happening in Zimbabwe and maintained that the elections were fair. I assume that the Foreign Ministers and the Commission will discuss Zimbabwe in Barcelona and decide upon suitable, wider sanctions and a strategy to involve the whole region. A lot of pressure must be exerted upon South Africa. In no way can we recognise these elections as fair.</p>
<p class="contents">We waited far too long before taking action against Zimbabwe. We hoped and believed.

In my country, the Netherlands, 1 April is often associated with jokes. If only that applied to the people of Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, the extension of Mugabe’s term of office is a bitter reality. It is based on the official result of last weekend’s extended presidential elections, which was published yesterday. The run-up to, as well as the course of, these elections is captured neatly in Zimbabwe as ‘flee and fear elections’.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, these Zimbabwean presidential elections were neither free nor fair. The mere fact that many ballot stations are used as torture centres at night, where Mugabe’s uninhibited militia torture and humiliate political opponents, speaks volumes. This abhorrent fact marks out the sinister context of Mugabe’s ruthless campaign to stay in power.</p>
<p class="contents">It is completely understandable why Mugabe’s main rival, opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, has rejected the election result as nothing but voter deception. In this extremely difficult situation, what Tsvangirai’s party, <span class="italic">the Movement for Democratic Change</span>, needs most of all is level-headedness and wisdom. He is reportedly looking for legal means to fight and revoke the official election result. Tsvangirai and his men are certainly not seeking confrontation, according to their own sources. Given the desolate political and socio-economic situation to which Mugabe’s thirst for power has led Zimbabwe, this attitude on the part of the Zimbabwean opposition deserves the support of the Council and the Commission. For an escalation into civil war will suck the country deeper into the quagmire.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, I would urge the Council and the Commission to join forces with the US administration in order to give Mugabe’s regime an even stronger international warning. At the same time, we must consider how we can continue to bolster the constructive forces in Zimbabwe. Those Western reactions to Mugabe’s disputable re-election which I have noted to date elicit this expectation. This is so unlike some African opinions which claim the elections to be ‘free and fair on the whole’. If this is truly the regional, political benchmark, then southern Africa is directly on course for instability. Consequently, a European appeal to the South African authorities, in particular, is just as much called for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has been observing events in Zimbabwe with growing concern. Misgivings about the electoral process which the European Union voiced when Article 96 still applied have proven to be wholly justified. I expect the Heads of Government will discuss this issue in Barcelona and that the European Union will be quick to make a statement on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the election observers have come to the conclusion that the elections did not reflect the will of people of Zimbabwe and list a whole range of shortcomings in the election process. However, we can emphasise that, however disappointing the outcome of these elections, the main point is that the international community has turned its attention to Zimbabwe and is doing everything it can to contain the crisis there.</p>
<p class="contents">A broad show of force would have serious, mainly regional repercussions. In the short term, South Africa would face a refugee crisis and, in the long term, any such crisis might jeopardise regional prospects for economic growth and sustainable development, all against a backdrop of a serious food shortage.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, together with other partners, will be giving humanitarian requirements a high priority. It is also extremely important for us to work with the SADC governments and the ACP countries in order to find a common basis for overcoming the crisis in Zimbabwe. The European Union is planning to send a high-level troika in the near future, to discuss our misgivings about Zimbabwe with our SADC partners on the basis of our common commitment to the rule of law and democracy. I trust that the European Parliament will be able to play an important role here.</p>

We have long hoped that, even with a Communist regime, this country would stick to economic development and the road towards the European Union. That hope has now been dashed and the Communist government knew that it was playing with fire when it introduced the Russian language and made it compulsory to teach a Stalinist slant on history. Language and culture have already sparked one military conflict in this country, which was only quelled within a few days thanks to a broad social compromise, with stability being established in the country through long-term action by the OSCE. The government has now destroyed all that, and in one of the poorest countries in Europe. I think it is wrong that the government is now trying to keep dragging out excuses. We have seen this over the last few days, with the government maintaining that others are responsible for the political crisis. It is responsible because it has tried to revoke this compromise, in one of the poorest countries in Europe. If this country now falls into political crisis, just when it is on the verge of becoming a neighbouring country, it will also affect us, which is why I think the government urgently needs to give in, reverse these decisions and do something about creating economic and political stability in this country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am satisfied that we are finally taking the initiative and discussing Moldova. The Liberal Group tried to do this back in January.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything that Mrs Schröder said is true. We have before us a very difficult situation which could lead to developments similar to those in Belarus. We must be clear-sighted and see that it is Vladimir Voranin who has stopped economic reforms. These events have led to a suspension of funding from the international institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We know the means used to turn Moldova eastwards and to create problems with Romania. For instance the Moldovan Government refused to allow the people to set up an Orthodox community attached to the Romanian Orthodox Church. This has been condemned as contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. Transdniestria does not need mentioning further; we know about it and the present attitude of the government is not helping to solve the problem there.</p>
<p class="contents">The Christian Democrat party has been mentioned. What has been said over the last few days in the Russian Duma, which has accused Romania of interference, is worrying. What has been said in the Russian Duma is not accurate. We now have a situation where a Romanian diplomat has been declared persona non grata. This is creating a good deal of tension.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Commission need to focus much more on Moldova for the reasons mentioned by Mrs Schröder. We must avoid being confronted with a new Belarus. We need intelligent sanctions, intelligent measures, because it is such a poor country. Those of you who have been to that country know that the children in Moldova are the worst off in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is time that the European Parliament took an active interest in Europe’s poorest country.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of Moldavia have, for a long time, suffered not only poverty but also exploitation. For example, tens of thousands of women have suffered degradation within the so-called sex industry in Western Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am personally acquainted with Iurie Rosca, Party Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, the largest opposition party in Moldavia, as well as with the deputy chairman, Vlad Cubreacov. In common with the party’s general secretary, Stefan Secareanu, who is mentioned in our resolution today, they are exposed to attacks whereby the Communist government headed by President Veronin is attempting to revoke their political immunity.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to protest against the fact that, not long ago, the Justice Minister, who is also from the dominant Communist Party in Moldavia, suspended the political and financial activities of the Christian Democrats, who at present are in practice the only real opposition party in the country. Those who are standing up for a multiparty system and for democracy in Moldavia deserve our esteem and encouragement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Christian Democrats have taken fundamental issues as their basic themes, including language, culture, schooling and the country’s Western democratic leanings, something which has aroused the anger of the Communists.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to protest against the fact that the Bessarabian Orthodox Church in Moldavia is not allowed to operate freely. Moldavia is a poor country in material terms. We do not want it also to become poor in terms of democracy. We have a big responsibility for Moldavia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>When, after the elections a year ago, a Communist government took up office in Moldavia, it was, of course, only a matter of time before that country was the subject of discussion in this Parliament, and that day has now come. I would have preferred us to use our direct contacts with the parliament in order to raise a few issues which would possibly be the topics of debate at a later date, but I understand that some groups want to discuss this today. It seems like a good idea to me. It is important for the European Union to devote more attention to what is already considered Europe’s poorest country. A country riddled with problems, not only political problems, but also major social problems including those involving poverty, health care and the care of seriously disadvantaged children. Precisely in a situation of this kind, it is, of course, very frustrating that it is the government that should be encouraging these contradictions in a country that is, in fact, disoriented, that is unable to choose between the East and the West, a country that is rather divided.</p>
<p class="contents">What struck me was that the recent protests were not only against the government but also mainly in favour of Europe, and this shows how the contradictions are evolving in that country. In my view, the government has made a huge mistake by presenting controversial proposals which, precisely in the areas of language and the teaching of history, have caused a great stir. Fortunately, the government has since realised that things are not that simple and has retracted a number of these measures, partly under pressure from the loud protest from outside Moldavia.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, too, we must stress that the government should realise that it should stop interfering with, and sabotaging, the opposition. A warning has been issued about lifting the immunity of certain politicians. This is not acceptable, in my view. The opposition must be left alone, reflecting the dignified manner in which the opposition protested against the government measures. What should be avoided at all costs in that country is a situation in which one group tries to force the other in a certain direction, either the direction of Russia or that of Europe. This is something on which the people themselves must be able to decide in their own time and in a democratic climate.</p>
<p class="contents">I already mentioned that this debate is also an opportunity to say that the European Union should do more. I have understood that the Commission is looking into the possibility of granting more direct aid to the people in the country itself. By aid, I mean health care, social development and such like. In my view, we can, above all, ask the government and all the people in Moldavia to create a situation in that country in which the international community can operate more effectively, for we are often very hampered in what we want to do there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important in my opinion to urge the countries in that region to contribute to Moldova’s stability and to help find a solution to the problem involving Transdniestria, for that is also a heavy burden resting on Moldova. It is an issue on which Romania and Russia should exercise restraint, in my view, but to which the European Union in particular, together with the OSCE, should look to find a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That alone shows just how important this tiny country is for us in the European Union, quite apart from the fact, as Mrs Schroedter rightly pointed out, that it will border on the European Union once Romania accedes and, hopefully, will itself one day become part of the European Union. Nor should we forget why Moldavia went down the terrible road which it has had to endure over the last few decades.</p>
<p class="contents">Moldavia was the victim of the Hitler/Stalin pact and, for decades afterwards, it was plundered as a European outpost of the Soviet Union. With such a history, Moldavia does not have the strength to get back on its own feet and, as one speaker rightly said, what we have here is a very dangerous crisis waiting to happen. On one side, Russia is directly involved via Transdniestria or the so-called Dniester Republic which, from Russia's point of view, is a sort of advance guard of nationalistic and militaristic circles in Europe while, on the other side, it has cultural and historic links with Romania, and it will become a dangerous bone of contention between an EU candidate country on one side and the European Union's most powerful neighbour on the other, unless we do everything we can to stabilise this country, by which I mean we must stand up for human rights, for the rights of our Christian democrat and other counterparts in the Moldavian Parliament who are under attack, we must stand up against neo-colonialist efforts to bring this country under control through language and by rewriting history and we must stand up for democracy and the rule of law. I also think, Commissioner, that we should be more active than we have been in the past in helping with institution building, with establishing democratic institutions in this country. It is in our interest to exert a stabilising influence here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We therefore welcome this resolution by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Moldavia is the poorest country in Europe and is still no closer to resolving its conflict with the rebel region of Transdnistria. The Moldavian Government has refused to meet representatives of Transdnistria since last summer and a bitter fight is waging over border controls in which Ukraine has also been caught up. An uneasy air of confrontation has recently arisen between the Communist Government of the Republic of Moldavia and the Romanian-speaking nationalists. The reform process is suffering from constant setbacks and the IMF has refused to grant any more loans. In the meantime, there are also worrying indications that the government is looking to Russia to resolve its problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The main reasons for the country's poverty are of a political nature. The failure to resolve the Transdnistrian conflict is having a particularly serious impact. The European Union is currently examining how it can support OSCE efforts to improve the situation. We have set up a relatively generous aid programme. A provisional sum of around EUR 40 million has been set aside to support this country over the next two years with technical assistance, food aid and special macro-economic financial aid. However, we need a guarantee that Moldavia will also make an effort to put its finances on a more viable basis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that ECHO has pulled out of Moldavia because ECHO's job is to provide emergency aid, not resolve structural problems. But even if ECHO's work can be continued using other instruments, such as TACIS, we must not forget that aid alone will not resolve political problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the Commission is willing and able to see what measures can be taken with the means available to help resolve the Transdnistrian conflict.</p>

That is certainly true today.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been to Kyrgyzstan several times in recent years, as it emerged from those dark days of the Soviet empire and set the pace for the region in terms of political, economic and health reforms. I paid tribute then, as I have done since, to those periods of progress. But in the last couple of years we have become worried about progress in that country. President Akayev, who came from a background of the Academy of Sciences, was elected in a free vote in 1991 and re-elected in 1995, has subsequently become more of an oppressive president than a democratic one. Both parliamentary and presidential elections in 2000 sadly highlighted the flawed nature of the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">We were concerned about candidates being banned on technicalities not least because of their knowledge of the Kyrgyz language; about the press being suppressed and repressed; about community groups being prevented from playing their part in the process. Symbolic of all this has been the arrest of Azimbek Beknazarov, chairman of the parliamentary committee on judicial and legal reforms. He was arrested in January and brought to trial in February. The trial was then postponed until this month.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a country with many problems within its borders, including a lack of natural resources, racial tensions and incursions from abroad. Eighty-eight per cent of its population lives on an income of under USD 4 a day. It does not need the opprobrium that will come from world opinion if it makes a mess of its democratic processes, its independent judiciary and its freedom of speech.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we move this motion today, asking them to listen. We will be watching for results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Time is short, so I shall address what seem to me to be two particularly important points. First, when I visited the region, I saw clearly for myself that the people were raring to go and move towards our values. Unlike all the countries which have since joined and will soon join the EU, the countries of central Asia are basically making their own way towards democracy, without the huge amounts in aid being received by other countries. The only aid is TACIS. The European Union is providing Kyrgyzstan with financial and technical assistance in setting up ministries in the agricultural and social sectors. If you just stop to consider the different mentality, the cultural differences, religious differences and their completely different historical development, then you will begin to understand the huge difference between our and the central Asian understanding of democracy. What I mean to say here is that we must be careful not to be too harsh on other countries in our demands for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as partners and friends of central Asia, it is our duty to point out serious scandals in due and proper form, especially as Kyrgyzstan is in receipt of a certain amount of aid from us under the TACIS programme. This European Parliament resolution takes account of the dilemma to which I referred. As I said, on the one hand, a recognition of what are surely difficult circumstances and, on the other, the difficulty in establishing a working democracy which guarantees the involvement of all sections and groups of the population. I should like to make a point of acknowledging what has been achieved so far. However, when it comes to human rights, as Mr Bowis very impressively pointed out, there appears to be more retrogression than progression and I must express my very serious concern here. Human rights and human dignity are the basis of a modern society and a stable democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, the Commission does not want to interfere in the legal affairs of a sovereign state, but the overkill on the part of the Kyrgyz authorities in the Beknazarov case is particularly worrying. It includes isolation and possibly maltreatment of Mr Beknazarov on grounds which appear to boil down to professional misjudgment on his part or perhaps to professional misconduct seven years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the proceedings against Mr Beknazarov have unleashed general disapproval among the people and could seriously undermine the credibility of the government and, in the end, the stability of the country. The Commission is also alarmed by the fact that the Beknazarov case appears to be just one in an increasingly long line of judicial proceedings against the government's political opponents.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with Parliament that Kyrgyzstan has put its good reputation on the line over the last two years. The Commission has never failed, nor will it fail this time to stress just how much importance it attaches to Article 2 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement requiring contracting parties to promise to respect democracy, the principles of international law and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sometimes the infringements appear to pass unnoticed. The opposition is persecuted, there are at least a thousand political prisoners in jail, freedom of expression is minimal and freedom of assembly is restricted. Journalists and workers for democracy are harassed, and lawyers are not permitted to work.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Tunisian human rights campaigners have been nominated for the Sacharov Prize, and we have criticised Tunisia on several occasions in this House. Now, there is cause to do so again.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is very concerned about the proceedings against Hamma Hammami and his colleagues in the banned Communist Party. Their trial is a farce, and the way it is being conducted completely unacceptable. There have been protests from all around the world. Even in my own country, where Tunisia is rarely mentioned, there have been a number of indignant press articles in the last few days about the way in which the members of the Tunisian Communist Party are being treated.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hammami, Mr Madouri and Mr Taamallah decided of their own accord to come forward and stand trial. Subsequent developments have been alarming and very far from being in accordance with the principles of a constitutional state. The three have been maltreated, they are not allowed to see their lawyers, and the trial itself is one big legal farce.</p>
<p class="contents">We are agreed that they are prisoners of conscience who must be treated decently and in a manner appropriate to a constitutional state. The trial is to begin again on 30 March and, until then, they should be set free. Because they themselves have given themselves up, that is only right. We must send a message to Tunisia to the effect that we are keeping an eye on the country and watching the trial, which we shall be following extremely closely.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must address the issues of Tunisia and of human rights in the Association Agreements and in the context of cooperation. We have been silent for too long about these issues. We make tough demands on ourselves and on the candidate countries, but almost no such demands upon Tunisia.</p>
<p class="contents">That must not continue. Human rights issues must be highlighted in our continued contacts with Tunisia. We must stop grovelling to Ben Ali. Above all, attention must be given to this case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We now believe, however, that these undertakings, which were reiterated at the Association Council session of 29 January, have been flouted by the way in which Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants are being treated by the Tunisian Government.</p>
<p class="contents">The defendants, who voluntarily came out of hiding, a state in which they were forced to live following their infamous trials in 1997 and 1998, were again convicted on 2 February before the Court of First Instance and their sentence was confirmed in a farcical judicial hearing which, unfortunately, confirms the serious defects in the rule of law that has been in force in Tunisia for several years.</p>
<p class="contents">Two hundred lawyers gathered in support of the defence. They were set upon by the police and the prisoners were violently assaulted. Hamma Hammami began a hunger strike on 26 February to protest against the conditions in which he is being detained. He was moved to the area in Tunis prison that is reserved for those sentenced to death, despite the fact that he is a political prisoner. This situation is in breach of the Treaties, particularly Article 2 of the Association Agreement with the European Union on the respect of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now crucial that, a few weeks before the start of the Conference on Foreign Affairs (Barcelona V), which is being held in Valencia on 22 and 23 April, we, as Members of the European Parliament, call upon the Tunisian authorities to release Hamma Hammami and his co-defendants. This is a first step which is essential for the respect of the rule of law in Tunisia.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the Commission to demand that the Tunis authorities comply with international law and to instruct its parliamentary delegation to raise this subject more firmly with the Tunisian Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last month, after the defendants surrendered to the authorities, those sentences were confirmed in less than one minute without a presentation of evidence by the prosecution or defence or an examination of the witnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also accusations of widespread abuses by the government against other dissident groups. Democracy and the rule of law are attributes enjoyed until recently by few countries even in Europe. They take time to evolve and can appear fragile in the face of threats.</p>
<p class="contents">In states such as Tunisia, it may seem an achievement merely to resist the kind of radical socialism or Islamicism that has blighted the lives of so many in the Arab world in recent decades. We ourselves have to be careful, when we urge greater pluralism and respect for democratic norms around the world, that we do not undermine governments which, however imperfect, are moving in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that the EU has an important role to play in helping to provide an example for countries which want to move away from a spiral of poverty, extremism and repression. Nor can we entirely isolate ourselves from the problems experienced by neighbouring countries such as Tunisia. By encouraging economic and political reform together with foreign direct investment, and with respect for good government, democracy and human rights, we help others and we also help ourselves, by reducing not only the resentment often felt against the West in the Arab world, but also the migratory pressures that are generating serious problems in our own societies and which themselves require urgent solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, it is right for the French Government to highlight the importance of giving aid to the Maghreb countries, many of whose citizens are settled in London, which I represent, as migrants or refugees. It is also right to begin to open EU markets, including our agricultural markets, to poorer countries that wish to trade with us, in ways that benefit them more directly and prevent future migratory pressures by the long-term stabilisation of their own economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the end of an eventful trial punctuated with incidents, the Court of First Instance in Tunis confirmed the original verdict and ordered the accused Hamma Hammami to be imprisoned. The appeal trial began on Saturday 9 March before a number of foreign observers, including journalists, Western diplomats posted to Tunis, barristers from France, Switzerland and Belgium, as well as delegates from human rights organisations. A dozen lawyers appealed, one after the other, to the bar to request to be given time to read through the dossier that they had been unable to access and to deplore the fact that they had been prevented from visiting their client as under normal circumstances. After some deliberation, the Court of Appeal postponed the trial until 30 March and refused the request to release the accused men. These are the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has expressed to the Tunisian authorities its concern regarding the human rights violations, but has merely hinted at the fact that these violations may compromise its Association Agreement with Tunisia, which was the first bilateral pact between the European Union and a Mediterranean country and which was signed three years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Last January, Mr Romano Prodi, the President of the European Commission, met with the Tunisian authorities in Tunis whilst on an official visit to North Africa. In a speech that he gave on that occasion, Mr Prodi stated that the negotiations related to trade and cooperation. Instead of taking this opportunity, whilst speaking publicly, to raise the issue of human rights, Mr Prodi welcomed the economic reforms undertaken in Tunisia. He stressed that the European Union respects the political sovereignty of Tunisia and does not wish to interfere in Tunisia’s internal affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at a meeting held in June in Tunis with President Ben Ali and the Prime Minister, Mohammed Ganouch, the European Commissioner, Mr Chris Patten, paid more attention to the issue of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">On 14 December 2000, the European Parliament adopted a resolution engaging the European institutions to use all the means provided for by the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement to secure respect for democratic freedoms and human rights and, whereas the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement lays down the promotion of human rights as a key element, it regrets the fact that this frank and open dialogue had not sufficed to encourage the Tunisian authorities to advance along the path of democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I ask you to ensure that this resolution be forwarded to the Council and to the Commission and to the Tunisian Government and parliament for its information, and that we stress that we will follow events closely in the run-up to 30 March. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After four years of living in hiding, the three activists decided to appear freely before the court in order to challenge their sentence in a court of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The trial of 2 February, as other Members have said, was a sham. The defendants were seized from their seats, taken away by the police during the court proceedings, and swiftly condemned to harsh prison sentences – Hamma Hammami was sentenced to nine years and three months. These men were not given the chance to defend themselves and were not given access to their lawyers. All this happened before a number of Tunisian and foreign observers and protesters. They are being detained in a civilian prison in disgraceful conditions. This trial is a real parody of justice. In response to this situation, the Tunisian Lawyers Council declared a strike. Hamma Hammami and Abdel Jabarmadouri decided to go on hunger strike in protest at their conditions of detention and to demand that their lawyers be given the right of visit.</p>
<p class="contents">These events are part of a continuing campaign of intimidation and repression, which targets political opponents, human rights protesters, journalists, trade unionists, students, lawyers and magistrates. We note that the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement, stipulating that relations between the two parties are based on the respect of democratic principles and human rights, has once again been flouted.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask for an exceptional meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Council to be organised as soon as possible to tackle the issue of human rights.

Nonetheless, we cannot overlook and we are deeply saddened by the repeated violation of human rights in Tunisia, the most recent case being the sentence passed on Hamma Hammami and his colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">These human rights violations were really not necessary, not in a country like Tunisia. The type of trial, the procedures surrounding the trial and the argument which Tunisia keeps on using, that democracy is being established, that slow progress is being made is, more is the pity, just not true. Or the steps, the progress being made, is so small as to be indiscernible. I therefore take the view that the current agreement should also be used for dialogue on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not see this sort of agreement as a futile endeavour; on the contrary, agreements such as these with countries such as Tunisia give us the opportunity to ensure that the human rights issue is a subject of serious dialogue. I also take the view that human rights organisations, non-governmental organisations, should be more closely involved in the European Union's support instruments, especially as far as the MEDA Democracy programme is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said before both on several occasions in this House and in conversation with Tunisian colleagues, and I shall say it again: the important and legitimate fight against fundamentalism and, more importantly, against potential terrorism, cannot be fought, let alone won if it is paid for by violating human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights violations will not give the country greater security; on the contrary, all they will do is jeopardise the security of the country in the long term, and that is something which neither we nor Tunisia wants. I therefore call once again on Tunisia to start practising its professed faith in human rights at long last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The motion calls for justice and reparations for the Muslim and Tamil communities being persecuted in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p class="contents">If 60 000 people were killed in the developed world – that is the magnitude of the atrocities we are looking at now in Sri Lanka – then every possible means would be deployed to address the matter and bring those responsible before the courts and establish the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">There is serious and flagrant discrimination and economic underdevelopment in the areas of the country where the majority of the Tamil population lives. This is an area where the European Union could play a meaningful role, through funding programmes to address the imbalance and further the cause of peace and reconciliation. We must act concertedly here or more innocent Sri Lankans will join the half a million people who have already fled the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The use of child soldiers and sexual assaults on Sri Lankan women is endemic. To turn our backs on this matter would deliver a serious blow to the important causes we often champion here of democracy, freedom and social justice. Our attendance at the donors' meeting in Sri Lanka, scheduled for May, is vital. I also call on the presidency to ensure forthwith that this resolution is conveyed to the Council, the Commission and the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was therefore particularly pleased to be there on the historic occasion of the signing of the ceasefire agreement, which hopefully will herald a new dawn of peace and prosperity underpinned by the strengthening of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I acknowledge the courage shown by those who are signatories to this agreement and the role that the Norwegian Government and its Ambassador to Sri Lanka played in bringing it about. I also recognise that the silencing of guns, though welcome, is not peace, but merely the first tentative step on the road to peace. It is only realistic to expect that many problems will lie ahead – some will be minor, others more serious. However, if good-will and determination exist on all sides, and the LTTE recognises that the only way forward is exclusively through peaceful dialogue, nothing will be allowed to derail the peace process. It is much better to be guarantors of a peaceful future than prisoners of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">The prime minister and the leader of the Tamil Tigers, together with their supporters, have indeed taken huge risks for peace. Their efforts deserve to be rewarded by the international community, including the European Union. As well as providing important political and moral support the international community should provide substantial funding to underwrite the peace process. If the people of Sri Lanka, especially the doubters, were able to see that there is a peace dividend, this would underpin the agreement and encourage support for it.</p>
<p class="contents">It is much better for the international community to invest in peace now rather than having to spend money later picking up the pieces caused by continued conflict and violence. I wish Sri Lanka well and I would urge all the political leaders on the island and its citizens to support this peace process and cherish the hope that it will bring permanent peace to their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Will the armistice hold at long last? When will the government and the Tamil Tigers realise that there are no winners in this civil war, and when will long-term peace be established?</p>
<p class="contents">Now that there is a new government, we should strike while the iron is hot. It is of the utmost importance for all parties to agree on the basic principle of lasting peace. The President and Prime Minister must at long last sing from the same hymn sheet; otherwise, they will be playing into the hands of the Tigers. In the past, the Tamil Tigers have repeatedly violated armistices. Seven years ago, the last peace negotiations were unexpectedly broken off by attacks by the Tigers. And they continue to recruit soldiers, including children, even to this day.</p>
<p class="contents">The politicians should remain vigilant, at an international level too. The monitoring by 30 observers seems very meagre indeed. Are they capable of doing a proper job? And what, I ask, can the European Union do to ensure that the weapons are put under lock and key for good and that the violent storm on this paradise-like island at long last subsides? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was there in my capacity as vice-president and was able to visit both the north and the south of the island. In the vicinity of Jaffna, the army had just managed to reclaim large tracts of land formerly occupied by the Tamil Tigers. We saw villages razed to the ground, land laid waste and a demonstration by fishermen and farmers wanting to return home but prevented from doing so for security reasons. Back in Colombo, foreign observers and the local non-governmental organisations told us the war in Sri Lanka had become an institution.</p>
<p class="contents">At all the talks we backed the Norwegian intermediaries who have been trying to set up bilateral negotiations for years now. Only a few of us believed then in an end to a civil war which had lasted nearly twenty years and claimed over 60 000 lives. Since the elections, which were won by the United National Front on a manifesto which included a peaceful resolution to the conflict, the situation has changed. Economic sanctions have been lifted, fishing restrictions reduced, the transport embargo relaxed and sea and air links established. Following the ceasefire, which hopefully will hold up, prisoners of war have been exchanged and Norway has again asked for assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler, I am pleased to say that the European Union has not been sitting on its hands. Our main help has been humanitarian. Since 1993, some EUR 13 million have been collected through ECHO. EUR 1 million was recently provided to improve the food and health situation, for medical care and medication and to pave the way for better hygiene and cleaner water. The European Union should not only take financial action at the donor conference in Sri Lanka in May. More importantly, it should exercise political pressure so that the ceasefire and the initial peace talks, which are just tender shoots, are not just a flash in the pan, as has been the case so often in previous years, and actually come to something this time round. We must hope for a lasting peace process for this country and its people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This would give momentum to the reconciliation process and pave the way for reconstruction measures. I should like here to express my recognition of the Norwegian Government, which has worked tirelessly in the wings brokering the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has assured the Government of Sri Lanka that it is prepared to join in international efforts to support a reconstruction programme if the peace process shows real progress. In the meantime, the Commission has taken a whole host of measures. EUR 2.7 million will be provided for humanitarian aid programmes this year in order to help displaced people, following on from the EUR 3.3 million provided for this purpose last year.</p>
<p class="contents">EUR 4 million are to be provided for this programme next year and again in 2004. Experts from ECHO are already on site assessing the emergency humanitarian aid requirement for this year. In April, missions will be sent to Sri Lanka to work out proposals for programmes and projects, for which development aid of EUR 10 million and economic aid of up to EUR 5 million will be provided in the years 2002 to 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC/Sri Lanka development aid working party is due to meet in Colombo next week to discuss how the Commission's rapid reaction mechanism can be used to boost confidence building and conflict prevention. The working party is also due to meet in June, following the World Bank's development forum, in order to discuss development aid and economic cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has deliberately built a great deal of flexibility into its programming of humanitarian aid, so that, if the ceasefire is successful, measures can be taken to move and resettle people, to promote education and economic recovery, and to restore incomes. A comprehensive peace agreement would allow us to launch a broad reconstruction programme together with other partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the border closure that the United States is unilaterally imposing on our clementines sector is an unjustifiable trade action, which this Parliament must condemn.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate we are holding today must result in a resolution that urges the Commission, the Council and the Spanish Government to do their job and to do it well. Our objective is simply to protect something that we have been working on for the Community agricultural sector. The Commission must, therefore, act rapidly to put an end to this trade ban whose only purpose is to serve the interests of the United States’ own production.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask the Commission, in contrast to what the current Spanish Government has been doing, to set aside the philosophy of contentedly pursuing bilateral dialogue. We cannot enter into dialogue as if nothing had happened, with a party that is doing so much harm to the Community citrus fruit sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must deal with the conflict without losing sight of the fact that the United States has acted unilaterally, reneging on the agreement on health and plant-health measures and on the provisions of the World Trade Organisation in general. To put it another way, the Commission must take over the half-hearted action of the Spanish Government which has, to date, only obtained one proposal from the Americans, made with veiled threats and which consists of making changes to the protocol regulating our citrus fruit exports.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is crucial that the President-in-Office of the Council plays an active role in this dispute. The President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers must, without fail, appear before this House to explain the initiatives he proposes to achieve this return to normality of citrus fruit exports and how he intends to compensate producers, since they have already been seriously affected by this situation.</p>

First of all, there has been a range of considerations and requests in relation to the unilateral decision of the United States to suspend imports of Spanish clementines into the US. For this reason, the resolution states that the unilateral decision of the United States is in breach of World Trade Organisation agreements because, as stated in the resolution, restrictions to trade must be proportional to the risks, non-discriminatory, and must not be imposed without scientific proof.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything suggests, therefore, that the United States’ ban on Community clementines is simply an excuse for a trade barrier to prevent Community clementines from entering the United States’ market and, therefore, to prevent the introduction of non-Community citrus fruits into the United States. This is unacceptable and I wish to point out that, in the resolution, parallels are made with the issue of steel products, because the United States is breaching WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a series of problems or consequences that the resolution analyses in relation to the major losses suffered by producers and exporters in the current citrus fruit season and, as stated in the text of the resolution, an indication is also given of the delay that occurred in the Community’s taking action.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to quote some dates given in the resolution: on 30 November, the United States suspended imports of clementines and definitively ratified this decision on 5 December and, on 14 February 2002, the Spanish Government asked the Commission for its help in this dispute and to use its power to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, there is a range of actions that the Commission has been asked to undertake: to rapidly put forward proposals to compensate those affected; secondly, to seek to resolve the dispute with the United States as quickly as possible, because we cannot start the next season with this problem unsolved since that would have extremely serious consequences; and, thirdly, in the event that a solution is not found, the United States must be called to account before the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by thanking the Commission for the way in which it has acted to date, because it attended very promptly when the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development asked it to. The Commission gave a commitment to inform us rapidly and, since they have done so, I think it is only fair that we thank the Commission for everything it has done so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, as you know, it is not a plant health problem but a trade barrier that the United States has now established.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, as Mr Jové Peres stressed, that the Spanish Government lost time by failing to inform the Commission immediately and instead waited until 14 February to do so, despite the fact that the problem came to light in November 2001. But the problem exists and Morocco is also currently experiencing the same problem for the same reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The fly that bit the American Government, if I can put it like that, is more of an electioneering insect rather than a citrus fruit parasite from the Mediterranean. The attitude of the United States towards clementines is the same as it is towards steel products, as my fellow Members have already said. It marks a return to protectionist ways and to unilateralism with complete disregard for WTO obligations. The United States cannot carry on closing their borders when faced with the urgency of the elections or ignore the WTO agreements when the European Union poses them problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as recommended by the resolution, I call on the Commission to instigate proceedings at the WTO against the United States if an immediate solution to the situation is not found. Next, the Commission must present proposals to compensate the people affected, until the conflict is resolved. Lastly, the Council should inform us, through its President-in-Office of the Council, of the latest initiatives that it is taking to resolve this conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The issue of clementines is not an isolated incident, but is one link in a chain of tensions that exists in trade relations between the United States and the European Union. I shall not waste time listing them all, but I shall refer – as I did yesterday, in the debate on transatlantic dialogue – to the problem of hormone-treated meat, to the banana war, to aid for North American airlines, which has led to our own airlines becoming less competitive, and to massive export subsidies, which have been deemed illegal.</p>
<p class="contents">The most serious aspect is not that this should have happened but that, apparently, we are entering a new era of protectionism, which has become evident on the steel issue, which we discussed yesterday, and also on the issue of clementines.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to emphasise that the issue of clementines is, if possible, more serious than the issue of steel. Steel will have entry conditions imposed on it that will make imports more expensive; on the issue of the clementines, the borders have simply been closed. This is why I said yesterday that I shall be demanding the same rigour and the same energy on the issue of clementines as on the issue of steel, if we wish to maintain credibility and be able to hold our heads high in the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to correct Mr Jové Peres, who has fallen into the temptation, in passing, of making the Spanish Government out to be the villain of the piece. The Commission has long been aware of this issue and, if it had followed proceedings more closely, it would have seen an answer from Mr Lamy in which he told me that, as early as December, the United States trade representative, Mr Zoellick, had a meeting with the representative of the Commission, who was fully informed of the situation, through the Government and because I had tabled a question on 12 December. But, when all is said and done, this is a piece of cheek that I can tolerate and understand, since you are a member of the opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the request that has been made, I agree with what the speakers have said. What needs to be done, first of all, is to compensate those who have suffered losses; secondly, to pursue dialogue with the United States because, as we know, a poor deal is better than no deal at all, especially when a good deal could take years to conclude and ruin our production and, thirdly, to initiate, as soon as possible, proceedings in the 133 Committee. I must emphasise that this is more as a means of exerting pressure and imposing negotiation in order to bring the United States to the dialogue table than in order to initiate proceedings that could drag on forever.</p>
<p class="contents">I would emphasise that the Spanish Government – whether Mr Jové Peres likes it or not – started this issue in December, as Mr Lamy has shown.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, look elsewhere for the villain and let us all work together to protect Spanish clementines, which is my only objective at the moment, as I am sure is true for the President, who – in his enthusiasm - has generously given me more speaking time than I was due. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true, as Mrs Martinez said, that I am responsible for clementines, but the primary issue here is the Mediterranean fruit fly, and that is my colleague David Byrne's area. And if a WTO problem arises as a result, that will be Pascal Lamy's responsibility. That is all, just to clarify matters. But one thing is right and that is, whichever way you look at it, the Commission is responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">For over 15 years, Spain has exported clementines to the USA under the terms of a bilateral protocol agreed with the USA on the risk of introducing the Mediterranean fruit fly. Problems have already cropped up here and there in the meantime, but have always been very quickly resolved. Now a few fruit fry larvae have been found under somewhat questionable circumstances and the USA's unreasonable reaction has been to issue a complete ban on imports of clementines.</p>
<p class="contents">Spain takes the view that the best and quickest solution would be to conduct bilateral talks with the USA and change the protocol, with the new protocol to be accepted by the USA in time for the next season's deliveries starting in October. That may sound optimistic, but we shall know by next month, by April at the latest, if this will work. As things stand, it would be the best solution.</p>
<p class="contents">On 14 February, Spain also officially asked the Commission to check if the import ban was compatible with the WTO agreement and, if necessary, to file an objection in Geneva. The Commission has started to check this and its first step will be to raise the matter at the SPS committee meeting in Geneva on 20 and 21 March. At the moment, the Commission has serious doubts as to whether the US measures, which appear to infringe several basic principles governing the introduction and application of trade measures, are compatible with WTO rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the Commission takes the view that a negotiated solution which takes proper account of both sides' interests would be best. However, if insufficient account is taken of Spain's concerns, the Commission is prepared to take the necessary measures, including further steps at the WTO in Geneva, if our initial impression that WTO rules are being infringed is confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that citrus fruit producers have applied to the US courts for the ban to be lifted temporarily. At a legal or judicial level, that would appear to be the best way forward at the moment. As far as compensation is concerned, EU rules do not make provision for direct compensation in such cases. However, the Commission will do all it can to minimise the adverse impact of the US measures on the Community sector affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>Is the Council aware of the urgent need to maintain sensitive treatment of elderly tourist passengers at passport control points inside the European Union, for example between the UK and Spain?</p>
<p>A constituent of mine, aged 92 years, had her bag which contained her passport stolen after departing from the UK and before arrival at Palma de Mallorca on 6 May 2001.

<p>The Council would remind you that it does not have the competence to intervene directly in the arrest of suspected war criminals. At its sitting on 11 June 2001, the Council nonetheless approved the report on the review of the Stabilisation and Association Process which assessed the progress towards European integration made by the countries of the region. It thought then that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s cooperation with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia had been insignificant, particularly where the Republika Srpska was concerned, while the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia now appears more ready to cooperate. Since then, progress has been made, but without its having led to the arrest of Messrs Karadzic and Mladic and their extradition to the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>When it proceeds to the subsequent annual reviews under the Stabilisation and Association Process, the Council will again study the degree to which the countries in the region have cooperated with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia. This ‘review mechanism’ will enable the European Union periodically to assess whether each country’s compliance with the criteria defined under the Stabilisation and Association Process justifies the level of relations established with the particular country. It will also provide a tool for taking decisions on the future development of bilateral relations, as well as enabling practical recommendations to be made. The Council therefore has available to it a means of putting pressure, albeit indirectly, upon the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p>The Spanish Presidency intends to be consistent in continuing on the path marked out by the previous presidencies, designed to remind all the countries in the region of the need to cooperate fully and totally with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia. The need for such cooperation is one of the conditions laid down by the EU in the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process. The countries in the region, including the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of which the Republika Srpska is a part, signed up to this process at, specifically, the Zagreb Summit of November 2000.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0110"></a>

<p>As regards research on human embryos, the Council, in its common position:</p>
<p>–	has agreed with the opinion of the European Parliament to include references to a number of relevant international instruments on which to base the ethical evaluation of Framework Programme activities, including those relating to the issue of research using human embryos;</p>
<p>–	as to the interpretation of these principles, in view of the recent and rapid developments, in particular in the field of biotechnology, as well as ongoing discussions, including those taking place in the European Parliament and at the national level, the Council found it inappropriate to establish in its Common Position on the Framework Programme an exhaustive list of research topics to be excluded from Community funding.</p>
<p>3.	The Council adopted its common position by unanimity, with no abstentions. At the time of the adoption of the Council’s common position on 10 December 2001, certain delegations, including those referred to by the Honourable Member and the Commission, made known their views concerning Community-funded research involving the use of human embryos. The Council has committed itself to re-examine this issue, in particular during its discussions on the relevant specific programme proposals.

The European Council, in Amsterdam, (16-17 June 1997) welcomed and fully endorsed the choice for the design of the euro coins. Accordingly, a competition was organised at European level for the design of the common face.

<p>There is no clear mandate in the Treaty with respect to ageing and other demographic developments, but a coordinated EU participation in the Assembly is a logical consequence of the increasing and repeated attention paid by the European Council to the challenges posed by an ageing population, and of the increasingly structured activities in the Union which aim to modernise and improve social protection while at the same time ensure economic and financial sustainability.</p>

<p>The European Union has consistently accorded the highest priority to the question of human rights and the protection of minorities in its dealings with those countries that are candidates for membership. This issue is a critical element of the pre-accession strategy for each of these countries following the political criteria for membership agreed by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993.</p>
<p>In the revised Accession Partnership for Slovakia that was adopted by the Council on 28 January 2002, the priorities and intermediate objectives include the stipulation that Slovakia should "Continue improving the situation of the Roma through strengthened implementation of the relevant strategy, including the provision of the necessary financial support at national and local levels; measures aimed at fighting against discrimination (including within the public administration), fostering employment opportunities, increasing access to education, improving housing conditions; provide adequate financial support".</p>
<p>The Council has not been informed of the allegations that Roma women were sterilised during the 1990s in any candidate country of Central and Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, the Union will continue to monitor closely the situation of the Roma in all candidate countries. Should any such violations of human rights be verified, the Union will raise the issue with the candidate country concerned, particularly in the context of the bodies created within the framework of the Europe Agreements, such as the EU-Slovakia Association Council and Committee.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0136"></a>

<p>1.	The Council considers the elimination of discrimination between men and women to be an important part of a community wide approach to achieving gender equality. In that context the Honourable Parliamentarian is reminded of the proposal for a Directive amending Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions, which is currently subject to the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p>Clearly, any possible amendment of Directive 75/117/CEE on the principle of equal pay for men and women would depend on the Commission's right of initiative in respect of legislative acts.</p>
<p>2.	In accordance with the Employment Guidelines for 2002, Member States will pursue positive steps to promote equal pay for equal work of equal value and to diminish differentials in incomes between women and men. The Council considers that action to address gender pay gaps is necessary in both the public and private sectors, and that the impact of the implementation of the Guidelines on gender pay gaps should be assessed.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Council would like to draw attention to the fact that the Member States are currently developing indicators to measure progress in gender equality in relation to each Guideline.</p>
<p>3.	Regarding the question of a study into the factors which influence pay, it is recalled that, in the context of the follow-up of the Beijing process, the Belgian Presidency submitted a report to the Council on the subject of gender pay equality which proposed 9 quantitative and qualitative indicators on the subject of pay differentials.</p>
<p>On the basis of this report, the Council (Employment and Social Policy) of 3 December 2001 adopted conclusions which, inter alia, invited the Commission and the Members States to review and improve their existing data collection and processing systems, invited the Employment Committee to pursue its work on indicators in this field and invited the Commission also to set up a mechanism for the exchange of best practices in the context of the Beijing follow-up.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>What action is the EU Presidency taking to insist on the full implementation of repeated UN recommendations on human rights in Colombia, including protecting the human rights of threatened groups, dismantling paramilitary groups and ending impunity in cases of human rights violations?</p>
<p>Following the breakdown in peace talks, what action will the EU take to ensure close international monitoring of the human rights situation in the former demilitarised zone and to enable international delegations access to this zone and to other areas of conflict in Colombia including the Caguan/Caqueta and Meta?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>Please allow me to give a joint reply to the four questions concerning Colombia which have been tabled by the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The Council has always supported President Andrés Pastrana and the efforts which, with indefatigable determination, he has been making over the last few years in order to bring peace to Colombia. The same cannot, unfortunately, be said about the FARC-EP.</p>
<p>The Council understands and fully abides by the decision which the Colombian President felt obliged to take on 20 February 2002, thereby bringing to an end the process (begun in 1998) involving dialogue, negotiation and the signing of agreements with the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces – People’s Army (FARC-EP). It also signalled the demise of the demilitarised zone.</p>
<p>Since the agreement with the Colombian Government on a timetable for the future of the peace process was signed on 20 January 2002, the FARC-EP has demonstrated its unwillingness to make any serious headway in the process, thereby failing to honour its commitments vis-à-vis the government. Serious acts of provocation by the FARC-EP, such as seizing an aircraft and kidnapping some of its passengers, including the chairman of the Senate’s Peace Committee, Mr Jorge Eduardo Genshen Turbay, have led to the breakdown of a negotiating process in which the Colombian people had invested its hopes for peace.</p>
<p>More recently, the 23 February kidnapping by the FARC-EP of Ingrid Betancourt, a candidate standing in Colombia’s presidential elections, and the murder on 3 March of Senator Martha Catalinas Daniels merely demonstrate the FARC-EP’s true intentions.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly rejected and condemned the kidnappings, blackmailings and other crimes committed by armed groups in Colombia and has called for international humanitarian law to be upheld and for the civilian population to be protected.</p>
<p>The Council has decided that the EU Member States will not issue new visas or residence permits to representatives of the FARC-EP, unless a failure to do so would hamper the efforts of those States which are involved in the dialogue between the various parties in Colombia. The Council reserves the right, where appropriate, to revise its policy vis-à-vis the armed groups in Colombia, depending on the progress made in upholding human rights, international humanitarian law and diplomatic immunity.</p>
<p>The Council has always expressed its deepest concern at the acts of violence perpetrated by paramilitary groups, in which connection the Council has urged the Colombian Government to continue and step up its efforts to disarm those groups and to bring the full weight of the law to bear on those responsible for the crimes committed, whoever they may be.</p>
<p>The Council has expressed its support for, and its solidarity with, both the entire Colombian people and President Pastrana and his government, and it hopes that, on the basis of sound constitutional government and full observance of human rights and basic freedoms, Colombian democracy will enable every Colombian’s yearnings for peace and prosperity to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The Council has also assured the Colombian people of its support for any initiative designed to establish a proper dialogue with a view to ending the conflict which is tearing Colombia apart.</p>
<p>The Council will endeavour to secure fulfilment of the commitments laid down in the European programme to support the peace process in Colombia, provided that implementation of the programme is not hindered by security problems.</p>
<p>On the basis of the principle of shared responsibility, the Council considers that the efforts which are already being made to stamp out the cultivation of illegal crops and the production of, and trafficking in, drugs at both local and regional level must continue, with due respect for biodiversity and the environment.</p>
<p>With a view to tackling socio-economic inequalities in Colombia, the Council has also called for a programme of decisive socio-economic reforms to be drawn up and implemented as a matter of urgency, irrespective of any developments in the peace process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs meeting in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, on 15 February 2002 decided in favour of EU-US judicial cooperation. After strong pressure from the USA, that decision has now cemented the process of cooperation between the two sides' judicial authorities, facilitating the flow of information, extradition of suspects and the freezing of bank accounts etc. At the same time, and under the same umbrella, electronic surveillance and monitoring of individuals is intensifying, evidently by virtue of the notorious 'Echelon' network.</p>
<p>Given that in the USA, inter alia, the death penalty applies - about which, supposedly, the EU was greatly concerned in the past - and exceptional judicial proceedings, including special military tribunals, are operating by presidential decision (the Patriot Act), will the Council say on the basis of which criteria it overcame its reservations and objections concerning fundamental principles of law and why, on the pretext of combating terrorism, it legitimises and promotes the violation of citizens' fundamental human and democratic rights?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council would, first, like to underline that it has not been subject to "strong pressure" from the USA in favour of EU-US judicial cooperation. All member States have agreements with the US on extradition and most also on mutual assistance in criminal matters. However, room for providing added value to these agreements through an agreement to be concluded with the US on the basis of Article 24 TEU and the extent to which this would be the case are currently being explored. At this stage, formal negotiations still have to be conducted and no agreements have as yet been concluded with the US.</p>
<p>The Presidency has presented to the Council a Draft Mandate for negotiation, currently under discussion in the appropriate for a of the Council, in which all guaranties for the preservation of the basic principles and values of the European Judicial System are preserved, according to the views expressed by the members of the Council, in particular during its meeting of 28.02.2002.</p>
<p>This being said, as the Honourable Member of Parliament knows, there is a fundamental difference of opinion between the US and all EU Member States on the issue of the death penalty. The policy of the EU has not changed on that issue. Moreover, it is clear that any agreement between the US and the EU on the basis of article 24 and 38 TEU must ensure that all guarantees of due process and fair trials are upheld. The Council is convinced that it would be possible in a future agreement to ensure that this is guaranteed. The Council will not conclude any agreement with the US that does not unreservedly fulfil this aim.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0146"></a>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>Although in the past there were some instances of compliance by Greece with Community legislation (the Kouroupitos and Maliakos Bay), in other cases Community environment law is not implemented. Pursuant to Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Greek authorities have proposed an incomplete list of special areas of conservation for inclusion in the NATURE 2000 network, when the areas proposed are not even protected in accordance with the provisions of that directive. For example, in many areas no protection system has been set up and no administrative body is in operation, while at the same time serious infringements are being revealed, such as inadequate protection of the Caretta-Caretta turtle in Laganas Bay (Court of Justice ruling against Greece in case C-103/00), the continuous pollution and degradation of the Axios Delta, a wetland protected under the Ramsar Convention, etc.</p>
<p>What measures will the Commission take to ensure that all the areas of Community importance, e.g. Marathon-Skhinia in Attica, are incorporated and the administrative bodies set up? In what practical way will it ensure that the areas already proposed for inclusion in the NATURE 2000 network, such as Laganas Bay, Zakynthos, Lake Vistonida and the Nestos Delta (district of Almyra Velonis), are protected? Is it possible to finance projects or measures from Community funds in areas in which infringements of Community environment law have been identified while Community rules or even the judgments of the Court of Justice (see case C-103/00 concerning Zakynthos) are not observed?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As required by Article 4 of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_20_2" name="refann_20_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, Greece supplied a list of 236 sites of Community importance proposed for the Natura 2000 network. These sites cover an area equivalent to approximately 18% of the national land area. Assessments carried out to date in the Mediterranean biogeographical region show that this list may, as a whole, be considered to be substantial and the few small gaps that have shown up should be filled by the forthcoming meeting on biogeography in July 2002.</p>
<p>The setting-up of the conservation measures needed for Natura 2000 sites in accordance with Article 6 of the Habitats Directive, including the drawing up of management plans and the establishment of management bodies, falls within the competence of the Member States. In Greece's case, nonetheless, important co-financing was arranged through the LIFE programme and the Structural Funds to draw up management plans (‘Specific Environmental Studies’) covering a large number of Natura 2000 sites. Current national legislation (framework law 1650/86) states that the implementation of these management plans requires prior approval by the competent authorities, after which Presidential decrees have to be adopted and management bodies set up. Having noted that little progress has to date been made with the procedures referred to above, and being concerned to ensure that Community funds are used in a proper manner, the Commission has already challenged the Greek authorities on the need to forge ahead in providing the Natura 2000 sites in question, especially those of international significance (Ramsar zones), with an effective system of protection and management, which they still lack. The Commission sees definite progress towards this goal as a precondition for other Community financing for the conservation of Natura 2000 sites. In particular, this is specified by a clause in the relevant measure (8.1) of the operational programme on the environment in the third Community support framework for Greece.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the Commission may act to protect Natura 2000 sites by way of an infringement procedure under Article 226 of the Treaty on the European Communities, which would be commenced either on it’s the Commission’s own initiative or on the basis of a complaint. If projects or actions give rise to infringement of Community law on the environment, any Community co-financing from which they benefit may be suspended.</p>
<p>With particular reference to the protection of the physical habitat at Marathon-Schinias, the Greek authorities, in response to the Commission's intervention in the context of a complaint, have declared their intention of adding the site to the national Natura 2000 list and have given firm guarantees on the implementation of the restoration and management programme for this zone, especially including the forthcoming establishment of a management body for it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With regard to the Protocols to the Alpine Convention, the Commission wants to focus to the maximum its resources on those areas which can contribute the most to its own policies. Therefore, on 16 January 2001 the Commission adopted a Proposal on the signature of the Transport Protocol, which is currently being considered by the Council Working Party on Land Transport.</p>
<p>The fact that, as to the signature or ratification of other Protocols, the Commission does not intend to make further Proposals, should however not be seen as a lack of interest in the promotion of sustainable development in the Alpine region.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Commission stresses the interest it attaches to mountain regions. This interest is exemplified by the fact that the Commission, in its second Report on Cohesion, recognised that mountain regions are already at a disadvantage and have, as such, been included as one of ten priorities in the Community's cohesion policy. Other Community policies including environment policy are also contributing to the sustainable development of mountain regions including the Alpine region, and to the conservation of mountain eco-systems and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The position of the Commission with regard to the Protocols to the Alpine Convention, other than the Transport Protocol, is determined by the lack of resources to ensure appropriate follow-up to all activities undertaken under the Alpine Convention. This also explains the lack of involvement of the Commission in the discussions within the Alpine Convention on a possible Protocol on Population and Culture.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0116"></a>

<p>In order to assist Member States with the implementation of Council Directive 1999/22/EC of 29 March 1999 relating to the keeping of wild animals in zoos, the Commission organised a seminar in March 2000, in collaboration with the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), with representatives from Member States, Member State zoos and non- governmental organisations (NGOs).</p>
<p>The Commission is co-operating with the Candidate Countries in the framework of the screening exercise to ensure that when these countries enter the Union above directive will be implemented. Zoos will be required to participate in:</p>
<p>research from which conservation benefits will accrue to the species and through which in situ and ex situ conservation can be linked; for example through re-education projects;</p>
<p>public education and awareness in relation to the conservation of biodiversity, particularly by providing information about the species exhibited and their natural habitats;</p>
<p>accommodating their animals under conditions satisfying the biological and conservation requirements of the individual species.</p>
<p>The Commission has also participated in workshops organised by the Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office (TAIEX) for candidate countries, which covered amongst other things the provisions of the Zoos Directive.</p>
<p>The Commission has to emphasise however the specific objective of the directive, which is contribution to the conservation of biodiversity. Matters relating to the welfare of animals of non-endangered species remain mainly within the responsibility of the individual countries.</p>
<p>In the negotiations on the accession of new Member States the Commission has always insisted on the full implementation of the “acquis communautaire” in the Candidate Countries. This will also be the case for this directive as well as for animal welfare legislation applicable to those species, as Directive 91/628/EC of 19 November 1991 on the protection of animals during transport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has received no complaint to the effect that there was a lack of impartiality in the recently-held selection procedure for local action groups (LAGs) in the Community initiative Leader+ in the Aragon autonomous community. It has, however, noticed that the local press brought up the possibility of discrimination on the grounds of the political allegiances of the different candidates. Another problem has been brought to the Commission's attention by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture in connection with a question raised by the regional selection committee as to the demarcation of the local action groups' areas. The Commission will reply to the Ministry in the usual manner and within the customary timescale.</p>
<p>As regards the selection procedure itself, the Commission's communication on Leader+ dated 14 April 2000 has already set out the requirement that Member States guarantee that selection procedures are transparent and that competition takes place under satisfactory conditions. As a result, when the EU's 73 Leader+ programmes were approved, including the Aragon region's, the Commission insisted that the whole of the procedure for the selection of LAGs should be precisely laid down, especially the selection criteria and the weighting involved, the composition of the selection committee, the use of a suitably-publicised invitation to tender, etc.</p>
<p>As is the rule in Community programmes implemented by Member States under the joint management system, the national authorities – the Spanish authorities in this instance – have sole competence in matters concerning the proper application of developed standards. Controls are, in the first place, the responsibility of the Member States, whilst the Commission audits the systems set up and, where fraud is suspected, can call in the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to carry out investigations as and when required. As far as the Commission is at present aware, no such course of action was justified in respect of Leader+ in Aragon, any more than a revision of the selection procedure employed.</p>
<p>As regards the more technical problem relating to the territorial definition of the LAGs, it appears from the programme and from the communication already referred to that it is the groups themselves that must mark out the territory in which they will function. Adherence to a boundary already set up by an autonomous community cannot of itself alone constitute sufficient grounds for excluding a local action group from the selection procedure. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0104"></a>

<p>In an enlarged EU, the Union’s forestry resources will be considerably increased. It is in the interest of the whole Union that forestry should be managed in a sustainable way in the candidate countries too.</p>

<p>In the candidate countries the legislation on private forestry, and the institutions and structures to implement and monitor it, are having to be recreated. At the same time, the new private forest owners lack experience and know-how in forestry management and the timber trade. There is a need for training and research institutions.</p>
<p>How will the EU and the Commission be taking into account in the pre-enlargement activities – e.g. the SAPARD programme and the enlargement negotiations themselves – the development, training and motivation of the candidate countries’ forestry administration?

<p>The possibility of Community intervention in forestry policies is defined by the following:</p>
<p>- The Community Forestry Strategy stipulates that the sectoral forestry policies fall to the Member States in line with the principle of subsidiarity;</p>
<p>- This Forestry Strategy also states that the Community can contribute positively towards the achievement of its objectives by different actions taken under several Community policies namely rural development, sustainable development and research.</p>
<p>Under these conditions the Commission is dealing with forestry matters under the accession negotiations in a similar way as for the present Member States.</p>
<p>Three support instruments are used to meet the difficulties described in the Honourable Member's question:</p>
<p>PHARE: Support for institution building projects or twinning projects is being provided in the following areas: sustainable management of forests, forestry inventories, development of private forestry or preparation of extension services namely in Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia and Poland. The amount involved since the beginning of these actions exceeds €20 million.</p>
<p>SAPARD: The forestry measure generally allows for the same activities as for Member States under the rural development rules. Seven countries have this measure in their programme: Bulgaria, the Baltic States, Poland, Romania and the Slovak Republic. The Community contribution will be €167 million, representing 5% of the total Community contribution for SAPARD. The main areas are afforestation of agricultural lands, improvement of existing forest areas, investments to improve and rationalise the harvesting, processing, and marketing of forestry products and support to forest infrastructure. The training measure also provides assistance to forest owners to acquire the necessary skills to manage their forests in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>RESEARCH: A considerable increase in participation of institutes from Candidate Countries is being experienced during the course of the Fifth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (1998 - 2002). In total 21 institutes from 9 Candidate Countries have been participating in 12 Quality of Life-programme forestry-related research projects under this framework programme, whereas only 9 institutes from 5 candidate countries participated in the similar previous framework research programme. To allow research institutes from Candidate Countries to join ongoing projects, the Commission has also launched, under this Fifth framework programme, a dedicated call to the Newly Associated States. Nine proposals were submitted on forestry related subjects and will be evaluated soon.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0128"></a>

<p>Transport subsidies are an important element in the European Union's efforts to develop and support its peripheral regions. To avoid duplication of EU subsidies, agricultural produce is excluded from transport subsidies, which are granted only where the goods concerned have undergone significant processing. In the sparsely populated areas of northern Sweden, products are manufactured that contain wild berries such as lingonberries and cloudberries, which grow at such latitudes. These products, e.g. glögg (a Swedish wine-based drink), sweets and jam, do not qualify for transport subsidies, as they are considered to be agricultural produce. This is odd, because the berries grow wild and are not cultivated, and the products made from them undergo substantial processing.</p>

<p>The Honourable Member has drawn the Commission’s attention to the prohibitive cost of tests to detect tumours in female patients with a genetic predisposition to breast cancer, which are covered by several patents issued by the European Patent Office.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the issuing of a patent cannot be used to prevent the use of tests that were already discovered and in use before the aforementioned patent was issued. In other words, if a test already existed in Belgium when the patents were issued to the company Myriad Genetics, its holder could continue to use this test. This exception is known as personal possession which allows those already using the invention within the Union before a patent was issued<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> to continue using it. Therefore, the test used in Belgium to detect breast cancer should not be called into question.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a patent on the test to detect breast cancer was issued on Belgian territory, patients have a right to have access to technological advances contained in this patent.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member implies that the company, Myriad Genetics, intends to use its tests exclusively within the United States and that the cost of the test would be considerably increased.</p>
<p>However, in the legislation of the various Member States, there are provisions on compulsory licences which fully comply with the provisions laid down in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs).</p>
<p>Compulsory licensing permits, in exceptional cases, any third party with an interest in the invention, to use it in cases where the right holder has not used it or has used it but not extensively on the territory of the country in which the patent is valid. A licence may be issued by the competent authority of the relevant State to the interested third party, who, having applied to use the patent in question, has received a refusal from or was proposed unreasonable commercial terms by the right holder.</p>

<p>This matter was discussed at the General Affairs Council (GAC) of 28 January 2002.

Moreover, it does little to improve Israeli security in the area.</p>
<p>This assessment is ongoing and the Commission shall continue to monitor the situation on the ground in close coordination with the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0068"></a>

<p>What does the Commission understand by the term 'full national status' for a country or region within the European Union? Does it exist in a formal, constitutional manner? How does this differ from having status as a Member State? Does the Commission believe it realistic in the context of enlargement to expect more regions or countries which are already a part of an EU Member State to gain full national status? Does the Commission agree that, for an area to gain full national status within the EU, there would be a need for unanimity in Council? Does the Commission agree that it would be highly unlikely for the Council to agree unanimously to allow for example, full national status to Wales because of the possibility that this might set a precedent for other regions (e.g. Basque country, Catalonia) in the EU?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Treaties do not recognise the notion of "full national status". The only Members of the Union are the States which have signed and ratified the Treaties. That situation has prevailed at all previous enlargements of the Community and will continue in the forthcoming enlargements.</p>
<p>Clearly the Treaties do take into account the existence of regional and local bodies within Member States to a certain extent - notably through the Committee of the Regions as the Institution which is their consultative body - or through Article 203 of the EC Treaty which makes the provision that a Member State may be represented in the Council by a regional Minister if this conforms with internal constitutional rules.</p>
<p>Since the term "full national status" does not exist in the Treaties, and since such a concept could only apply to independent countries that - in the context of the Union - would have to be separate Member States, the Treaties do not allow for regions that are formally recognised as such in Member States and under the terms of the Treaties to be given a status equivalent to that of a Member State.</p>
<p>That situation could only be changed, of course, if the provisions of the Treaty were explicitly altered. As the Honourable Member will know, the Treaties can only be amended by a new Treaty which has to be established by common unanimous accord between the Member States in an Intergovernmental Conference, and which enters into force only after ratification by all Member States.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member may care to note that the notion of Member State in the Treaties - in accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice - does not only refer to national (central or, as appropriate, federal) authorities, but to all public authorities, irrespective of their level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0069"></a>

<p>The Commission’s communication of 6 April 2001 on the training and recruitment of seafarers<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> has already addressed the problem of abandoned mariners. Ships are increasingly being abandoned in European ports and their crews remain on board without being paid. Apart from the unacceptable human consequences of this type of situation, the abandoned ships also create difficulties in terms of the daily business of ports, due to the space that they take up. The Commission will investigate the possibility of proposing an instrument to authorise ports to sell these ships.</p>
<p>Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee issued their opinion on the Commission communication, but the question of abandoned mariners was not retained by these two bodies as a priority. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation of abandoned mariners in Europe and it also intends to raise this issue with the Member States when the communication is discussed within the Council.</p>
<p>In view of the international nature of this problem, the Commission is also convinced that action taken at international level could have considerable added value. The Commission therefore intends to closely monitor the revision of the international maritime conventions launched by the International Labour Office to ensure that the issue of abandoned mariners is addressed in the appropriate manner as part of this revision.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that greater transparency is needed in order to clearly identify, at port entrances, the identity of operators that are financially liable for ships and their cargo. This transparency, coupled with international legislation, should enable port authorities to take immediate action against operators who go missing.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>European agricultural policy is suffering from a system fault that leaves animals with defective immune defence, which creates a need for large quantities of antibiotics and other pharmacological substances for therapeutic use. Obviously, this situation constitutes both a direct and indirect threat to public health, particularly through the development of multiresistant strains of bacteria. According to the WHO, resistance to antibiotics is set to become one of our major public health problems.</p>
<p>In October 1999, I asked the Commission whether it was prepared to take steps to bring animal welfare into the public health sphere. Today - in the light of the white paper on food safety - it seems even more absurd that the Union's work on public health should cover all the links in the food chain (feed, slaughter, preparation etc.) except for the actual breeding of animals.</p>
<p>Is the Commission therefore prepared to take steps, by way of the co-decision procedure and Article 152 of the EC Treaty, to close this 'gap' in the food chain?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Community is sensitive to the requests of European consumers for safe food produced in accordance with good farming practices, with greater respect for the environment and for the welfare of food producing animals.</p>
<p>To give concrete answers to these demands the Commission published the White Paper on Food Safety. The White Paper integrates the way animals are farmed, including their health and welfare status as factors which may contribute to achieving a high quality and safety of food.</p>
<p>Based on the White Paper, the recently adopted Regulation of the Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety,<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 1</span> includes all issues having a direct or indirect impact on the safety of the food and feed supply chains, animal health and welfare, and plant health.</p>
<p>The farming of animals for the production of food is by definition and also historically an agricultural activity and as consequence Article 37 of the EC Treaty constitutes the legal base to undertake legislative initiatives at the level of the Community. According to Article 152 (4) (b) of the EC Treaty this Article could only be regarded as an appropriate legal base if the measures have, as their direct objective, the protection of public health, which is not the case for animal welfare legislation. In any case it should be noted that the Parliament is always consulted and has expressed its opinion on every occasion that the Commission has adopted proposals for new legislation on animal health and welfare.</p>
<p>As stated above, this approach does not exempt the Community from undertaking a sufficiently comprehensive and integrated approach to food safety considering all aspects of the food chain as a continuum, including the ways in which animals are kept.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the evolution of the agricultural policy, in particular a shift towards rural development and away from aids to production, should provide a more favourable framework for the production of food of animal origin, obtained in less intensive productions systems, that are more respectful of their natural behaviour.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 30 January 2002, the Commission communicated its strategy for the successful integration of the new Member States into the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

<p>The Commission considers that it has outlined a balanced and fair package. Its approach to the gradual introduction of direct payments will mean that after a transitional period there will not be a two-tier CAP, but will also ensure that the process of agricultural restructuring in these countries is not jeopardised.

<p>The question raised by the Honourable Member relates to the collective management of copyright and related rights in Europe, and in particular, how copyright societies operate.</p>
<p>The way in which these societies operates is currently regulated by the various national provisions. The extent of the monitoring undertaken by the state authorities and, more generally, the relations between these societies and their members vary from State to State. The same applies to relations with commercial users. Within the Union, therefore, transparency, financial accountability and external and internal monitoring of copyright are carried out in various ways and thus may be more effective in one State than in another.</p>
<p>For its part, the Commission has been examining the question of rights’ management, including collective management since 1994. The question was addressed in 1996 by the communication on copyright and related rights in the information society. Several meetings, consultations and studies have been carried out and a hearing was organised more recently in November 2000 by the ‘Internal Market’ Directorate-General, which brought together all the players and institutions involved in collective management.</p>

<p>The average European enterprise employs only 6 people<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the overwhelming majority of European enterprises - over 18 million - employ fewer than 10 people<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. That is why the Commission’s approach is to “think small first”. By doing so, the Commission can contribute to the creation of a favourable environment for small and micro enterprises. This principle is embodied in the European Charter for Small Enterprises.</p>
<p>The Commission is reviewing its definition of SMEs. Its aim is to make sure that it is as operational as possible. In the process, the existing definition of micro-enterprises has been completed by the inclusion of a financial threshold. This should be a help if, in appropriate cases, national and Community measures are targeted at this important category.</p>
<p>The Commission's action in favour of micro-enterprises is inspired by the European Charter for Small Enterprises.</p>
<p>Thus, the Commission is committed to Better Regulation, and will present an Action Plan on simplifying the regulatory environment to the Seville European Council.</p>
<p>Further, most of the regulations affecting businesses are national. In the end, these can only be made simpler by the Member States. The Commission is helping Member States improve their performance through, for example, benchmarking projects. In particular, these have aimed to help the start up and early stages of new businesses. As a result, it is now easier and cheaper to start up a company in most Member States. Further, Member States are working at simplifying legislation. In some of them it is now possible to settle some tax and social security issues on line. Micro-enterprises will be the first to benefit from this progress.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Another serious problem for micro-enterprises is access to finance. Under the Multi-annual Programme for Enterprise and Entrepreneurship the Commission has provided a specific window offering guarantees for micro-loans. The Commission is also about to launch an initiative on best practices in micro-finance for SMEs. This should help access to micro-loans.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member on the importance of the participation of civil society in the debate on ageing, and more specifically in connection with the Second World Assembly on Ageing.</p>
<p>As far as the possibilities of Community funding for the event are concerned: while the Non Governmental Organisation (NGO) Forum is linked to a world assembly, the Commission wishes to underline that the possibilities for funding under external assistance and development budget lines are determined by the overall objectives of Community development policy, or in the case of certain specific thematic budget lines (such as those relating to human rights or migration), by the specific objectives agreed for the line in question by the budgetary authority. The Commission was approached by the organisers of the event with a view to obtaining Community funding, but the Commission regrets that it is not in a position to provide funding in the context of its external assistance programmes and budget lines, as the event does not unfortunately correspond to the criteria referred to above. Moreover, the relevant programming documents do not provide for funding such an event on ageing.</p>
<p>Under very specific conditions it might be feasible to consider the possibility of support from budget lines related to Community internal policies on ageing, on the understanding that these budget lines cannot cover any costs of participation of NGOs from the developing countries.</p>
<p>In relation to the possibility of funding from budget lines related to internal Community policy measures, a delegation from the organising committee met with the Commission services in mid-January of this year. At this meeting the delegation was informed that there might be some small possibility for financial support for this event from the "Community action programme to combat discrimination<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a><span class="sup">1</span>", if several conditions were met. First, there would need to be a clear anti-discrimination component to the Forum, which was not the case in its draft programme. Second, the Commission would have to receive a formal application from the authorities responsible for the Anti-discrimination Programme in Spain. The delegation was advised to take immediate contact with the appropriate Spanish authorities to process the application as soon as possible, given the short timeframe. However, the Spanish authorities have not contacted the relevant Commission services on the matter and unfortunately it is now too late to process an application to secure support in time for the event.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission sent a reasoned opinion to the Portuguese authorities on 23 October 2001 concerning the construction of the Odelouca dam mentioned by the Honourable Member. In the light of the reply received from them the Commission is currently considering what further action to take in the infringement proceedings, including referral to the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty.</p>
<p>No Community funding has been granted, up to now, to fund directly the construction of the Odelouca dam. A request for Cohesion Fund financing of the Odelouca dam project was received from the Portuguese authorities on 22 February 2002. The appraisal procedure has therefore just started. The Commission will take into account the infringement procedure as mentioned under point 1, when assessing the request.</p>
<p>The Commission can also confirm that it has approved funding for projects under the Cohesion Fund which are subsidiary to the Barlavento water supply system in Algarve. This system was given high priority in the reference framework for the Cohesion Fund in Portugal, in view of an urgent need to improve the drinking water quality and to protect the water beds which were being depleted due to excessive demand. For all projects co-financed up to the present, the Portuguese authorities have provided the necessary environmental assessment information, which was subject to prior analysis and approval by the Commission in relation to compatibility with existing Community legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0119"></a>

<p>A report from DG SANCO's Food and Veterinary Office has recently been published concerning a series of missions to the Member States regarding control of staging points.

<p>Council Regulation (EC) N° 1255/97<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> concerning Community criteria for staging points and amending the route plan referred to in the annex to Directive 91/628/EEC<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, as amended by Directive 95/29/EC<a href="#defann_47_3" name="refann_47_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> had to be applied by Member States from 1 January 1999.</p>
<p>The general report of the Food and Veterinary Office, to which the Honourable Member refers, is based on the individual missions carried out within the Member States quite shortly after the Regulation had to be applied.</p>
<p>Staging points were a new concept in Community law and were set up, where needed, by private trade interests subject to inspection and control by the competent Member State authorities. For this reason it was, perhaps, not surprising that some difficulties occurred in relation to securing compliance with the requirements of the Regulation.</p>
<p>The Commission was, of course, disappointed that the first FVO inspection reports on staging points found some serious breaches of the requirements of the Regulation.</p>
<p>The FVO always carries out a follow-up to these reports, and the Honourable Member’s attention is drawn to the statement in the report indicating that “in all Member States, the competent authority responded to the mission team’s findings by either initiating corrective action or withdrawing the approval of the staging point”.</p>
<p>Given the degree of co-operation, the Commission would not normally seek to open infringement proceedings following a first inspection mission. It will, however, continue to monitor the situation and take further appropriate action if necessary.</p>
<p>Under present Community legislation there is already a maximum journey limit of 8 hours for all journeys over 50 kms in basic vehicles.</p>
<p>Existing Community legislation aims to achieve a satisfactory level of welfare for journeys over 8 hours by imposing additional welfare requirements notably in relation to the facilities available on the vehicle and the particular needs of the species of animal being transported<a href="#defann_47_4" name="refann_47_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the Parliament’s concerns relating to journey times and is currently examining this aspect in the context of the drafting of its proposals for new animal transport legislation.</p>
<p>In redefining travelling limits, it is necessary to take into account both scientific and socio-economic evaluation.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Commission requested an opinion of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on different aspects of animal transport and in particular to define the most appropriate time limits. This opinion is expected very shortly.</p>
<p>However, it should be pointed out that a wide range of other measures need to be addressed to improve the welfare of the transported animals in combination with appropriate travelling time limits. The Commission has, therefore, consistently argued for a wider approach.</p>
<p>In this context long distance transportation of live animals has to be examined against its contribution to a sustainable agriculture which should be not only capable of maintaining an active rural community but which is also environmentally and ethically sound.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission recognises that the repatriation of mortal remains of a person who has died in another Member State than his/her own is a sensitive and difficult issue which can cause great suffering for the family involved.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of some individual cases, in particular, through the recent written parliamentary questions, where the repatriation of a deceased person from one Member State to another has raised difficulties. However, the Commission does not have any information or statistics which would provide an overview of a possible problem and its scope.</p>
<p>These issues potentially raise a number of questions, some of them in relation to different Community policies, for instance, transport, health, free movement, etc. However, it does not appear that there would be a clear Community competence to cover all these various aspects. Moreover, the regulations governing the transfer of remains of dead persons are laid down in the International Agreement of Berlin (1937, N° 4391 League of Nations Treaty Series) and by the Agreement on the transfer of corpses of the Council of Europe concluded in September 1973.

<p>The first outbreaks of the Pepino mosaic virus in the Community were detected in late 1999 and early 2000, and a preliminary pest risk analysis carried out by several Member States based on available scientific information demonstrated that Pepino mosaic virus and its damaging effects could be of significant plant health concern to the Community, in particular for protected tomato production. However, fruits of tomato were not found to present a particular risk of spreading this disease.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Commission, by Decision 2000/325/EC<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and subsequently by Decision 2001/536/EC<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, introduced measures against the introduction into and the spread within the Community of Pepino mosaic virus. Those measures apply to the inspection of tomato plants intended for planting, originating in third countries or produced in the Community, and the movement of tomato plants, intended for planting, within the Community. They also include more general monitoring for the presence of Pepino mosaic virus in the Community.</p>
<p>The Commission has asked the relevant services in the Member States to continue scientific work and to deliver an opinion on the risk of Pepino mosaic virus to out-door production of tomatoes and of other Solanaceae crops. At this stage, the scientific work performed on the Pepino mosaic virus has not provided sufficient clarification to revise the preliminary pest risk analysis.</p>
<p>Accordingly to Article 5 of Decision 2001/536/EC, the Commission will, by 30 October 2002, consider possible subsequent measures in the light of information and scientific opinion delivered by the relevant services of the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In June 2001, the Gothenburg European Council invited the Commission to present a Communication on "how the Union is contributing and should further contribute to global sustainable development". In February 2002, the Commission responded to this request by adopting the Communication « Towards a Global Partnership for Sustainable Development ». This document is intended to provide building blocks for the development of the Union's position in the framework of the work at international level preparing the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Contributions from all stakeholders, including Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), the Parliament and the Council will of course feed the debate in the run-up to the Summit as well.</p>
<p>In April 2001, the United Nations (UN) Commission on Sustainable Development decided to develop the agenda for the Summit following a "bottom-up" approach, including: the identification of regional priorities via preparatory conferences in each UN region ; the review of the implementation of Agenda 21 ; and the consultation with stakeholders at national, regional and international level. The Commission, which has been actively participating in this preparatory work, attaches great importance to consultation of stakeholders. In fact, although, due to time constraints, it was not possible to consult civil society on the Communication as such, the Commission has publicly addressed sustainable development related issues, including meetings on sustainable development and trade policy, where the preparations for the World Trade Organization (WTO) Doha Ministerial, its outcome, and preparations for Johannesburg have been discussed. It also participated in public events, such as the High Level Seminar on globalisation, sustainable development and the Union’s external policies, co-organised by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) at the end of October 2001.</p>
<p>Over the next few months the Commission intends to intensify consultation with stakeholders. For example, it has set up a European Civil Society and Private Sector Steering Group, with the participation of representatives from environment and development NGOs, trade unions, business, women and youth organisations, consumers and regional and local authorities. The Steering Group, which will convene several times during 2002, aims at ensuring stakeholders involvement in the international preparation of the Summit and its follow up. Most notably, the outcome of the work of the Steering Group will provide input for defining the Union position for Johannesburg. In addition, the Commission will hold a public event on the Summit in Brussels on 18 April 2002, within the framework of the Green Week.</p>
<p>Finally, sustainable development will be addressed at the stakeholder forum, which the Commission and the Economic and Social Committee will organise on 12/13 September 2002.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0139"></a>

<p>According to Clause 2(4) of the framework Agreement on Parental Leave, "Member States and/or management and labour must take the necessary measures to protect workers against dismissal on the grounds of an application, or the taking, of parental leave in accordance with national law, collective agreements or practices".</p>
<p>This Community provision therefore prohibits dismissal on the grounds of either the application for or the taking of parental leave. However, it does not grant any protection if the dismissals in question are based on other grounds, provided that the reason is not directly or indirectly discriminatory on the ground of sex. This should be examined taking into account all the circumstances of the case in question.</p>
<p>According to information sent to the Commission, Sweden has taken appropriate measures<a href="#defann_55_2" name="refann_55_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> for the implementation of the above-mentioned Community legislation, providing notably that dismissal only because the employee has requested or used the right to parental leave is invalid.<a href="#defann_55_3" name="refann_55_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>

<p>The Commission's proposals to amend the staff regulations of European Union officials have caused deep concern. According to their trade unions, the proposals change the very nature of the civil service, call into question fundamental democratic principles governing the recruitment, career development and independence of civil servants, will cause chaos in the institutions by recategorising some 40 000 officials and jeopardise the interests of the general public.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that the rules which apply to private enterprise can and should also apply to public service? What are its reasons for amending the staff regulations of officials and, in particular, their career scales? What is its response to the criticism that its proposals will result in the privatisation of a significant part of the civil service and create a network of patronage and favouritism? Finally, why does it not take seriously into account the counter-proposals of a large section of the trade unions with whom there is no real dialogue?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In his question the Honourable Member is ignoring the fact that, following the initial presentation of its package of personnel policy proposals adopted on 28 February 2001, the Commission entered into a phase of intensive consultation and negotiation discussions with Staff Representatives which lasted from March until October 2001. Discussions were conducted under an independent Chairmanship within the “Ersboell Group” – a joint high-level negotiating body of Staff Representatives and members of the administration. The establishment and composition was agreed by the Commission and the trade unions.</p>
<p>The Commission endorsed the basic Reform principles that were elaborated and approved by this Group on 18 July 2001 and, in the period after that, the Commission and the trade unions further discussed and negotiated about detail, particularly detail relating to the career structure.</p>
<p>In this setting and at all other times the Commission has strongly confirmed its view that maintaining and strengthening the competence, independence and permanence of the European public service is the principle objective of the proposals for amendments to the Staff Regulations and other rules. The Commission embraces the aim of safeguarding and improving the system of careers, remuneration, pensions and working conditions contained in the Staff Regulations. It has emphasised its conviction that working conditions and rewards need to remain among the most effective and competitive in the Union in order to permit sustained recruitment of the best qualified staff.</p>
<p>The objectives and rules of the Union’s Institutions reflect the fact that they are of public service organisations. The objectives and rules therefore differ, and will continue to differ, from several conventions in the private sector. An unbiased examination of all of the Commission’s proposals would further prove to the Honourable Member that the Reform does not aim to “privatise a significant part of the European public service”. Meanwhile, the Commission’s “response to the criticism” that the proposed changes will “create a network of patronage and favouritism” is that such a claim is completely unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member’s question gives the impression that he has not been informed that, whilst it was possible in the negotiations with Staff Representatives to get unanimous agreement on basic reform principles, differences of opinion with some trade unions on specific reform proposals could not be overcome. It must be stressed, however, that these differences have nothing to do with a lack of dialogue or serious consideration of counter-proposals. On the contrary, meetings were held between the administration and trade unions on an unprecedented scale. The reality is that differences were mainly caused by differing perceptions of the possibility of the Council being willing to approve the essential parts of the proposed package of modifications to the Staff Regulations. Where counter proposals were put, it would not be accurate to say that they came from “a large section of trade unions”. Indeed, the Commission regrets that unions that were opposing some of the Commission’s proposals generally failed to attend the final rounds of negotiation.</p>
<p>Despite this disagreement with some trade unions, the Commission points out that Staff Representatives representing, in electoral terms, 59% of the Commission’s staff have agreed to the Commission’s proposals. These proposals are currently under discussion with the Administrations of the European Institutions and representatives of their Staff Committees. Following those discussions in the Inter-institutional Staff Regulations Committee the legislative proposals of the Commission for revision of parts of the existing Staff Regulations will be given final consideration by the Commission and then laid before Council and Parliament.</p>
<p>The Commission notes the declarations made by the Honourable Member in the first paragraph of his Question and invites him to examine all proposals so that he can see that, regrettably, he has been badly misinformed on all of the points that he makes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0145"></a>

<p>For two decades, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs has endeavoured to build the new Acropolis museum on an inappropriate site, as competent scientific bodies have repeatedly pointed out.

<p>Since the EU provides part of the funding for the project, what measures will the Commission take to prevent the construction of a cultural edifice over other archaeological remains, ensure that another site is selected which is able to accommodate and enhance a modern museum worthy of the international appeal of its exhibits, and to protect and develop the archaeological site at Makriyannis?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In relation to the question raised the Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that:</p>
<p>1. The traineeships office of the Commission recruits 1.200 trainees (stagiaires) each year, following a pre-selection and selection procedure between more than 12.000 applications. All these trainees are the official "administrative trainees" in the Commission.</p>
<p>2. Since 1997, following an agreement between the Commission and the Budgetary authority, (relevant letter of Mr Liikanen of 29/10/1997), the annual budget of the Traineeships program of the Commission has progressively increased, in order that all trainees recruited (1.200 /year) be remunerated. From 1 March 2002 all trainees recruited in the Commission will receive a monthly grant of € 695 and they will be entitled to the reimbursement of their travel expenses and participation of all activities organised for them by the traineeships office (visits, conferences etc.).</p>
<p>3. As far as concerns “non remunerated trainees”, these are trainees selected and recruited directly by the different Directorates General (DGs) and services of the Commission, on a bilateral basis and outside the official administrative program of the Commission. They are known as “atypical traineeships”. The duration of their traineeship and their nature differ in each DG (i.e. from four weeks to 12 months, PhD researchers, students in their final year required to have a short specific traineeship, specialist for a specific project or action, etc.). Each DG recruits according to its needs, requirements and availability for their reception.</p>
<p>4. None of these "atypical trainees" receives any form of grant or remuneration by the Commission. Some of them receive research grants from other institutions or organisations during their traineeship in the Commission.</p>
<p>5. Since atypical trainees are not part of the official "administrative trainees", thus they are not entitled to join in activities organised by the Traineeships office for the "administrative trainees".</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0151"></a>

Sweden informed the Standing Committee on Plant Health of the presence of the disease in certain areas at very low level.</p>

<p>The Commission is also sure that the Honourable Member’s parliamentary experience and professional background as a journalist will enable him to appreciate one other relevant and vital consideration: it is that public divulgence of allegations can be regarded to unjustifiably compromise the rights of individuals and put at risk the proper conduct of any investigations that might potentially be undertaken.</p>
<p>Those are the very considerations which make it impossible for the Commission to publish the statement of allegations. OLAF has, however, provided material to the Budgetary Control Committee of this Parliament under the terms of Annex III of the Framework Agreement, and the Commission has reported to that Committee in ways that seek to impart the maximum possible information without compromising individuals or potential proceedings.</p>
<p>The initial, and separate, examinations of the statement and its annexes were finalised by OLAF and by the Investigation and Disciplinary Office of the Commission at the end of February 2002. The press was informed on 1 March 2002 after the President of the Parliament and the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
