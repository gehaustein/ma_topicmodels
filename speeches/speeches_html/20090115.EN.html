<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Neil Parish, </span></span>  <span class="italic">author. </span>− Mr President, I rise here today to ask this oral question on behalf not only of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development but also of the Animal Welfare Intergroup, because I believe that we have a very strong agriculture in the European Union. However, in order to have a strong agriculture, we must also have a strong welfare policy, because I believe the future of European agriculture is very much of a high-quality product and one that has very good welfare standards. We can use this to promote our products in a positive way, and this is why transport of animals is not only a motive but it is essential to have the right legislation in place.</p>
<p class="contents">In many ways, I want to concentrate this morning on the fact that we have legislation in place. We can argue whether this is sufficient or not, but the main thing at the moment is to check this legislation and be absolutely sure that Member States are complying with it, because we know, for instance, that there are problems in some Member States between national governments putting the legislation in place and the regional governments having to implement it. Then there are problems. At the end of the day, it is the animals that suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">I could highlight many things, but one particular thing we have problems with in Europe is horse transport. A lot of horses at the end of their careers land up in salami in Italy and they do not travel under the best conditions in any respect. We have had many of these vehicles followed through our own Member States of the European Union where the rules have not been complied with, the lorries have not stopped at the right times, the vehicles have not been of the right type and they have not had proper air conditioning or proper water, and these things cannot be allowed to go on.</p>
<p class="contents">I often stand up and tell the Commission not to add costs, but in many ways, when animals are going to slaughter, if the cost of transport is greater because they have to do a good job, they have to have the right vehicles and they must not overcrowd those vehicles, then I say, well, so be it! Because many times, instead of the animals for slaughter travelling long distances, they should be killed in the Member State and travel as chilled meat. Therefore, we have much to do on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I also would say to you that Mr Kyprianou, the previous Commissioner for DG SANCO, also gave us the reassurance when he was Commissioner that not only would he implement the present legislation properly but also he would revisit the situation at the end of the term. We are moving very fast now towards the end of this parliamentary session and the end of this present Commission and I would call on Ms Vassiliou, who has been a very good replacement for Mr Kyprianou, to honour that commitment, because animal transport is one of those things that we have to take incredibly seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made these points many times before, but we are a civilised society and in many ways a civilised society is judged very much in the way it treats not only its people but also its animals. Therefore, I cannot, as I have said, emphasise this enough.</p>
<p class="contents">My final points are on the oral question itself and that the Animal Transport Regulation has been in force since 2007. The Commission should, therefore, have received the first annual reports from the Member States on the enforcement of the regulation. Can the Commission give an account of which Member States have forwarded their reports? Has the Commission already carried out a preliminary analysis of the reports which would allow some statements to be made on the shortcomings and difficulties, but also on the major achievements, in the enforcement of legislation? Will the Commission consequently prepare a report on enforcement processes of the regulation in the Member States? Such an analysis would be essential in the context of planning a revision of the Animal Transport Regulation. Therefore, Commissioner, I would like answers to these questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is aware that the transportation of animals for commercial purposes may cause serious suffering to animals. Such suffering is inflicted particularly on so-called low-value animals such as animals for slaughter. The enforcement of laws on long distance transport is not satisfactory. In recent months the Commission has obtained reports on cases of cruelty to animals. The Commission continues to support the best available options for improving the situation. The ultimate aim is a better enforcement of EU laws and thus, healthier animals and decent living conditions for the relevant animals. A study carried out by the joint research centre concluded that new and more effective control systems, such as monitoring transport with the help of satellite positioning systems, would help to improve the situation and enable a more transparent implementation of the rules. The use of these new technologies would also help to reduce the administrative burden on intra-state authorities and organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Before this mandate expires, the Commission is also considering proposing new standards based on the results of scientific research relating to transportation times, numbers of loaded animals and numbers of loaded animals in vehicles. The Commission is assessing the implementation of EU law based on reports provided by the Member States under existing EU regulations. The information contained in these reports is combined with the results of on-the-spot checks performed by veterinary experts in the Member States. The results of these checks performed by Commission experts are published on the Commission’s website. An assessment is also under way in respect of data from reports published by international non-governmental organisations active in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Most Member States have already submitted reports on animal transportation in 2007 to the Commission. At the end of 2008, reports were still outstanding from Cyprus, Lithuania, Malta, Bulgaria and Luxembourg. They were reminded by the Commission of their obligation and the situation will be monitored closely. However, Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 does not require the Commission to produce a report on progress with enforcing the regulation in the Member States. The Commission agrees that enforceability is a key aspect of any proposed law. The Commission is consequently paying close attention to an analysis of the Member State reports and a possible future amendment of the Community’s regulations in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The eight-hour mandatory time limit for animals in transport was agreed in December 2004 and entered into force in January 2007 across all 27 Member States, with special derogations applying to longer journeys where it could be demonstrated that vehicle standards had been upgraded, providing animals with access to water, temperature control, adequate ventilation, and where frequent rest periods were incorporated into the journey time.</p>
<p class="contents">Special derogations were also permitted for remote rural areas and islands, like Orkney and Shetland in my own constituency, for instance, where longer journey times are unavoidable. In these cases, however, special bedded units with access to water have been designed so that the animals can be transported in relative comfort. In addition, a complete transport ban was introduced on certain animals such as calves under 10 days old and lambs less than one week old.</p>
<p class="contents">I report with some satisfaction that these transport rules have been strictly observed, particularly in countries like Scotland, where we continue to maintain some of the highest levels of best practice in the whole of the EU. But I am concerned at reports that, as Neil Parish has told us, these rules are not being similarly observed in other parts of the EU, particularly in some of the southern Mediterranean Member States and in some of the new East European accession states and particularly, again as Neil Parish stressed, where the transport of horses for slaughter is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Animal welfare NGOs are still producing evidence of horrific abuse, with horses and sometimes other livestock being transported over vast distances in searing heat, with no access to water or proper ventilation, with no rest periods, packed into overcrowded trucks. As their journeys progress, these animals become increasingly exhausted and dehydrated, some succumb to heat stress and can be seen desperately panting and gasping for air and, in the worst cases, many die. This practice has to be stopped and strict adherence to the regulation must be observed in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the terms of Neil Parish’s oral question today, which seeks to check on the level of compliance with these measures. I hope that the Commission can now provide us with this information and reassure us that steps are being taken to ensure the rigorous implementation of the eight-hour transportation limit for animals, with the appropriate derogations that I mentioned, and to stop the cruel breach of the existing EU regulations that still goes on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to refer to two specific issues. Firstly, it still seems clear to me that the Commission encounters difficulties in conducting an analysis of the situation throughout Community territory. Although, by virtue of the current regulation, Member States should – as we have seen – produce a report each year of the inspections conducted in the previous year, the regulation does not lay down a minimum number of inspections and neither does there appear to be uniformity in relation to the statistical basis. This prevents a comparison of the data reported by the various countries. Commissioner, I think that for the benefit of all concerned, this situation should be rectified as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a second matter also concerns me. In your speech, you described animals being transported for slaughter as of low value. Commissioner, I absolutely disagree with you. Personally, I consider them to be of high economic value and I am sure that the industry agrees with me. As this is the case, and this meat has a high economic value, correct transport conditions are essential whatever the final destination – even if it is the slaughterhouse – and whatever the distance travelled. In other words, it is a significant – in fact the major – concern that these animals are transported under favourable conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you, therefore, to take these considerations into account in the proposed changes to the regulation upon which the Commission is working. We know that, as well as new technologies, the reform will address changes in respect of the maximum transport time – as has been said here – and the maximum and minimum temperatures for transporting animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you again Commissioner, and I ask the Commission, that, before amending such fundamental features, a solid scientific basis for the changes proposed should be sought and found. Furthermore, I would ask you that, as long as we do not have this solid scientific basis, which is currently lacking for some of the issues, we should refrain from surreptitiously introducing the proposed amendments to the prevailing regulations in reports that have nothing to do with transport – I am talking about the protection of animals at the time of slaughter, a report upon which we are now working. I think that in matters of such importance and significance, we should all – Commission and Parliament – put our cards on the table. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Jensen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the ALDE Group.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say that I am a little disappointed that after four years, we still have not seen a proposal from the Commission as to how we can tighten up the legislation on animal transport. There have been good intentions and constructive cooperation between Mr Kyprianou, and now also Mrs Vassiliou, and Parliament. However, when will we have a proposal? This is something I would very much like to know. It is also important that we achieve proper enforcement of the legislation. It is important to ensure that we actually restrict the transport time for slaughter animals to eight hours. However, we should go further still. We should not simply talk about a time limit. Research has shown that one hour can be too much if the animal is not strong enough to be transported, and longer journeys can be fine if the animal is strong and healthy and is transported under good conditions. We will probably continue to transport breeding animals over long distances and, in this connection, Parliament has, of course, proposed a pilot project for rest stations, where the animals have to rest after 24 hours. I would like to know how this rest station project is progressing. The intention is, of course, to bring together operators of control stations, veterinary authorities, researchers and animal welfare organisations to allow them jointly to define good practice in this area. It is difficult to get such a project off the ground but it is worth the attempt because it is important for our knowledge and research on animal welfare during transport to also be reflected in legislation and in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a lot of cruelty to animals during transport. Certain improvements have been made, by introducing higher standards for transporting animals, but these measures still fall short of the mark.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the appropriate solution, and one which was first proposed a long time ago, would be to limit to the travel time for animals to eight hours, and the total time that animals spend in transit and at the slaughterhouse to twelve hours. We aim to put forward this proposal within the framework of the current work on the Regulation on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable ladies and gentlemen! Arguing for humane measures is one thing, but there is also another argument, namely a financial one (which is more appealing to certain people). The point is that these long-distance transports increase costs which are, ultimately, passed on to the consumer. We should estimate these costs and use them as an argument to finally, after years of debate, place restrictions on animal transports and alleviate the suffering of animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet the conditions for the animals did not improve and we were instead told, at that point, that the monitoring would work <span class="italic">from now on</span>, that GPS systems would be introduced <span class="italic">from now on</span>, that the drivers would be trained <span class="italic">from now on</span> and that the lorries would work better <span class="italic">from now on</span>. Five countries have not even bothered to submit a report. I demand that the Commission fines these countries immediately. As regards the other 22 countries, how many checks have they carried out? How have they complied with the rules? Is it working? The answer in many cases is unfortunately not.</p>
<p class="contents">Then Mr Kyprianou promised us that he would come back here before the end of his mandate if it was necessary – it is necessary – and if there is public opinion – and there <span class="italic">is</span> public opinion! Many of the new Member States are, in fact, small and there is perhaps no need for a 24-hour journey followed by another 24-hour journey. We will have a new slaughter directive which allows mobile slaughterhouses and which will reduce the need for travelling.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to revisit the conditions for animals during transport. How many of us would appreciate having four cows or ten sheep in their double bed for 24 hours? That is how densely packed the animals are at present. Or imagine, the chickens on the top level in the lorry are not, in fact, totally prohibited from letting their faeces drop down onto those below. Who would want to be transported under such conditions? I invite all of the EU’s agricultural ministers to come with me on a journey from Stockholm to Brussels under the same conditions as the animals. I wonder how many will accept that invitation. Perhaps they would rather amend the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We talk about costs. The highest cost in this regard is the cost to the environment as a result of the long journeys. There is also a cost in terms of the animals’ suffering in connection with the long journeys. However, these long journeys also result in poorer quality meat. They result in a very real reduction in value. An animal that is stressed will produce a much poorer quality meat, and the suffering thus works its way right down the whole chain. Think of the farmer who has put a lot of effort and money into producing a good animal that is then spoilt in the last part of its life.</p>
<p class="contents">No, we need a new proposal before the elections. I do not understand how we are to be able to conduct an election campaign if we do not at least have a proposal from the Commission that demonstrates that we will now – finally – improve conditions for animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Animals have the ability to feel pain, stress and suffering in precisely the same way as we do. We must take account of this when we lay down legislation. This is not currently being done.</p>
<p class="contents">More and more animals are being transported within the EU. This is a direct consequence of the internal market. The internal market leads to specialisation. Animals are reared in one place, they are slaughtered in another place and the meat is transported to a third place. Member States are not even permitted to prohibit animal transport for the sake of animal welfare. That really is unacceptable. A Swedish study established just how many animals in total were transported across the borders within the EU. For the EU-15, it was determined that 22 million quadrupedal animals, such as pigs, horses and cows, as well as 500 billion poultry, were transported each year in all directions between the Member States of the EU. This was when the EU comprised 15 Member States. You can only imagine what the figures will be with 27 Member States. They will, of course, be very much higher.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commission when we will have the new Animal Transport Directive. Mr Kyprianou did, of course, promise that we would have a new directive during this parliamentary term. Is the Commission able to give us the promise that we in the European Parliament are after, namely a maximum limit of eight hours for animal transport? I would also like to ask Mr Špidla a couple of questions. You say that five Member States have not submitted reports, a state of affairs which is, of course, quite shocking. What do you in the Commission do with these reports from the Member States? Do you analyse them in any way? We in Parliament would like an analysis, a report from the Commission, in which you summarise everything and clearly indicate measures that will enable the conditions under which animals are transported to be changed. So, when will we have the new directive with an eight-hour limit, and can we have an analysis of the reports from the Member States? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No sense of irony again in this Chamber. One of the biggest problems that we have, particularly in the United Kingdom, is the monstrously stupid avalanche of rules and regulations that came to slaughterhouses 10 years ago which managed to close over 1 000 abattoirs in the United Kingdom and gave rise to much longer journey times for animals.</p>
<p class="contents">My brother-in-law is a butcher. He owns an abattoir in Yorkshire and at one stage – and this got into the <span class="italic">Private Eye</span> magazine – there was a visiting vet supervising a vet supervising a meat inspector supervising two slaughtermen! That is the sort of nonsense that you get when you are dealing with this organisation’s rules and regulations. The problem is journey times. Now from Bridlington in my constituency, pigs, sheep and cattle are being transported right the way across England to Manchester because of all these closures of slaughterhouses. That is what we need to address.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also talking about the transportation of horses. My colleague, Nigel Farage, tells me that there are countries in the European Union which actually regard horses as food! As an Englishman, I find it absolutely incredible that people would eat their horses. An Englishman would no more eat his horse than he would his dog or his children, but then I suppose that just shows the enormous cultural divide that there is between us and the other countries of this Union.</p>

Let me say that I have no difficulty whatsoever with efficient and proper rules governing animal welfare, but I am becoming concerned that we are getting ourselves onto a treadmill, where we are going to so tighten the noose around our agricultural industry that its practical functioning will be rendered impossible. I do see signs of such a development emerging from the Commission consultation on reviewing the maximum travelling times and stock densities in transporting animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, let us recall, failed to get its way in the 2005 Regulation. However, less than two years after it came into effect, it is trying again with an attempt to remove the repeatability of the eight-hour limit. I must say that, for my constituency of Northern Ireland, it would be ruinous, because to export animals – which we do – we are required to undertake a sea journey and if only one period of eight hours is allowed, that would be utterly inadequate and utterly unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind the House that such onerous conditions would not compare at all with the huge distances that animals are transported in South America, from whence we happily import! So, yet again, we would be in the business of punishing our own farmers, while caring nothing about what affects the imports we receive.</p>

I should like to express my particular thanks to the Chairman of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Parish, for this question. It is an important one – not in order to convey emotions, but to ask the Commission the following quite specific questions. What has happened? How can these developments be verified? Do you have any proof, and if so, what? What figures do you have?</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned a couple of figures, Commissioner, but I firmly believe that discrepancies exist between Member States that go way beyond the fact that some Member States have submitted reports and others have not. What is the situation with regard to implementation? How are the long journeys monitored? How are they monitored in the individual Member States?</p>
<p class="contents">Another major problem area requiring urgent discussion is the problems that have arisen as a result of our defining agriculture as merely an economic field and equating things we should possibly be regarding as different. For example, what additional professional training in transport matters should trained farmers be undergoing? How should this be organised, and who would provide such training? Where must farmers show this in order to obtain their qualifications?</p>
<p class="contents">To reiterate: farmers are trained to deal with animals, whereas hauliers employ drivers who have possibly never dealt with animals in their whole lives. These are two things that cannot be equated, but to an extent we have been doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">The second circumstance that causes major problems is the following. When farmers transport their own calves, they can do so for up to 50 km. Permit me to say at this point that we must indeed give further consideration, as a matter of urgency, to how we can help smaller abattoirs operate economically and thus reduce the need for further journeys.</p>
<p class="contents">So, then, farmers are permitted to transport their own animals for 50 km but face problems if they take a neighbour’s animal along. That, too, requires some thought. Is the limit set correctly at 50 km, or should we perhaps be seeking the cause of these developments in the abattoirs, too? If farmers transport a horse for leisure purposes, there is no problem, and this Regulation does not apply, but if they transport it to market, the Regulation does apply, and they must meet the requirements. These questions should be discussed and answered in further debates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Limiting animal suffering as far as possible is an ethical imperative that forms part of our cultural heritage, in spite of the apparent paradox that we are seeking to protect their welfare at a time that, for many, will be their last journey.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it must not be forgotten that the price to pay for the implementation of the demanding and financially costly rules in force are problems that distort competition and have a strong impact on the rural development of some regions of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Regions and Member States that do not have the capacity to supply certain species from their own markets and are more distant from the centres of production, as is the case with my own country, now have greater difficulties of competitiveness in their industries linked to slaughter and processing, whereas regions and Member States with surpluses are experiencing increased advantages because it has become easier for them to sell products that are already processed, with the inherent advantages in terms of employment and added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Once this legislation has been in force for two years, it is fully justifiable that the Commission should supply an assessment that is as extensive as possible, not only on the specific issues of the strict implementation of the regulations concerning transport, but also on the economic and social consequences for the regions and Member States with a low production capacity for some animal species that are important for human consumption.</p>

In the experience of our veterinary authorities, the applicable European legislation is fairly comprehensive, but somewhat unwieldy and complicated to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest problem in Slovenia concerns inspections, because, now that internal European borders have been abolished, it is difficult to check whether or not lorry drivers are actually stopping at the pre-determined staging posts. I should point out that, because of the size of its territory, Slovenia is not required to have its own staging posts and that it has put arrangements in place with Hungary and Italy instead. We urgently need a uniform solution and one which is uniformly implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the disastrous situation as regards the transportation of animals over long distances on European roads, the review of the 2005 Regulation should be used as an opportunity to raise standards in animal welfare. Transport is closely linked to the treatment of animals before slaughter, and I agree with those of my fellow members who have taken the view that there are no grounds for permitting transports of a duration in excess of eight hours.</p>

I use this term because animals, as a rule, find any motorised transport frightening. It is important to minimise that where possible.</p>
<p class="contents">When regulating for this safety and prevention of suffering, we tend to look at time and distance. This is natural, but it is simplistic in the case of Ireland, which, I remind you, is an island and also a major animal exporter. Time limits and distance when crossing the waters that separate us from the continent and from our markets cannot be the absolute. We heard a recommendation of eight hours, but it takes more than eight hours to get an animal boarded and across water. There is no possibility of taking an animal out to graze in the middle of the Channel.</p>

A comprehensive analysis is therefore problematic since a large amount of the necessary information with regard to the resources allocated for the undertaking of inspections is missing. As a member of animal welfare associations and the Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals, I am particularly interested in this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Associations fought relentlessly for decades up until 2007 when directives were finally established in this area in which Member States can now be seen to be displaying a certain degree of laxity. I would even go so far as to say unwillingness because in short, as we know, carrying out checks and inspections is not all that difficult. We know where the abattoirs are, we know where the animals are reared, and we know the routes along which the animals are transported, so where is the problem?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is important, in this day and age when the public are quite rightly taking a growing interest in animal welfare on the farm, at the slaughterhouse and during transport, that Member States respect these views.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I have been given the opportunity to speak, I should like to add that, with regard to transport, irrespective of the length of journeys made, it is essential that local climate conditions are taken into consideration. A journey lasting several hours made in the Netherlands in spring is very different from a journey of the same length made in the middle of summer in a country such as Greece. Should we not make night-time transport obligatory in the latter case?</p>
<p class="contents">I should be grateful if you would consider this proposal in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While I think we would all hope that everybody was compliant from day one with the many demands of this regulation, it would be quite miraculous were that the case, because it is very detailed and makes huge demands – and rightly so – on Member States and operators.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome today’s oral question by Neil Parish, Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, because we want to see whether this regulation works. However, we need, first of all, to know that it is being implemented, because we care about how animals are moved around the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For countries like Ireland with a huge livestock sector, there has been an enormous amount of work done to implement this from day one, both within the sector itself and on the part of those who monitor – the Department of Agriculture and other authorities. Licensed operators have invested large amounts of money to upgrade their transporters and to meet the training and competence requirements of this regulation. In fact, I note that, just this month in Ireland, a number of training courses are under way for drivers of vehicles transporting cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses and poultry – a point raised by Ms Jeggle – and perhaps other Member States need to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting that the regulation applies only to the transport of animals undertaken in connection with an economic activity. I have a concern that we ignore the welfare of domestic pets, because I have seen examples of people who think that they know how to look after animals doing very badly on that front and yet, very often, these are the same people who insist on particular rules for farming and for economic activity. That is an area we need to look at.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in general, established transporters of animals are licensed and authorised and comply with best welfare standards – because it is in their vital interests to do so: they need to transport animals to arrive in good condition so that they meet the needs of those who are purchasing. The problem is with the unregulated sector, where some people are untouched by these rules, and that is what we need to focus on. Who are the people who are outside the box, and how can we catch them and put them out of business?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say in relation to time limits and the eight-hour rule that the reason why Europe had a real problem in getting this regulation into place was because many Member States, including Ireland, know that we need to transport our animals for longer durations, but we also know how to look after them in so doing. So I would disagree with those who want to reduce the time duration, but I agree that we need to make sure that welfare is a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">On horses, I often say to myself that I wish I were a thoroughbred, because they travel first class. Obviously, people look after animals with a high economic value, and in the economic downturn we are going through, I worry about the welfare of horses, full stop. I would say: no more rules. We have perhaps too many already that are choking the sector that is complying with them. But let us apply the rules to everybody, and let us get those who are not meeting the rules out of the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite our political differences, and notwithstanding his very obvious deficiencies as a human being, I think he is actually very sound on this and I support him. We need this regulation to be a success and we need it to be universally in force, but I have a number of reservations and I disagree with some colleagues who spoke this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Stevenson said that longer journeys were unavoidable – I say: not so. Mrs Jensen spoke of 24-hours transport – not necessarily. Mr Allister, the agricultural industry has to ask questions itself. As a civilised society, we need to look at the whole question, the whole purpose, the whole idea of transporting animals long distances and then killing them. If I were a meat eater, I would be asking how can the suffering en route which we know about, the dehydration, the stress and – to our Irish colleagues North and South – the sea journeys, possibly improve the quality of the product at the end?</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, it makes no economic sense. It does not make humanitarian sense. This is why I favour a complete ban on the transport of animals, which, I believe, would support rural economies. It would encourage local producers, yes, small- and medium-sized enterprises as someone spoke of, and it would enable consumption of food as near the point of production as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of that, and I know it is not going to happen in the near future, I think we need proper realistic enforcement of what we have at the moment, the regulation, and I urge the Commission to use all the agencies across Europe – police forces on motorways if necessary – to stop and check lorries to see whether they are carrying out the full requirements of this legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Transport, especially transport over long distances with a lack of space, produces stress, and stress means more susceptibility to disease. This is particularly true for horses, where scientific studies show that transport makes horses become shedders. That means they excrete a lot more than they would normally, which greatly increases the likelihood of the spread of disease. Many transported animals are going to slaughter – 320 million of them in the EU each year – so that means there is a greatly increased risk of diseases like salmonella entering the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the very poor level of implementation of current rules and the stress involved in long journeys, even with proper rest stops, especially for horses, does the Commission plan to come forward, where necessary and on the basis of scientific evidence, with a finite absolute journey time limit? That would be in the interests of animal welfare and of human health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what is less positive is the fact we are failing to implement the regulation effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that, during the course of our debates today, we are continuing to focus on the transport of horses. This is welcome news not only because I breed horses, but also because standards are definitely not being upheld in this area. I would like to take this opportunity to say that horses can understand humans. However, although horses always understand us, we cannot always understand them. Horses, like people, feel apprehension, fear, and are able to trust humans. I remember an incident where a seriously ill horse in a clinic would not let the vets do anything to him in my daughter’s absence. As soon as my daughter arrived, they were able do what they wanted to him. He quite simply trusted her. Just as we human beings do not always trust doctors, that horse did not trust the vets, but he did trust a familiar person. I therefore think that humans also fail to understand horses when they are scared, or when they try to defend themselves. Instead, people treat this behaviour as disobedience. The owner beats the horse. The horse, for his part, knows why his owner is upset and knows how to yield to him. That is why I am obliged to all the MEPs who are also able to approach this problem from the point of view of what is good, to view it as an issue involving a living creature, and to view it with a certain amount of humanity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, current legislation is lagging far behind Parliament’s ambitions as set out in the report of my predecessor Albert Jan Maat, who, to my mind, was right to draw a distinction between animals intended for slaughter and other cattle. Indeed, steps have been taken in the area of training drivers, better transport conditions and the use of GPS, but these are certainly not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, monitoring remains the Achilles’ heel of this legislation. Monitoring by Europe leaves something to be desired and is still very much organised at national level. There is an urgent need, therefore, for agreements on handling complaints and gathering evidence across borders. I should also like to see the Food and Veterinary Office step up its monitoring efforts. My amendment to make more funds available for this in the budgetary procedure has been rejected by, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, the European Commission. Even now, the European Commission refers to national reports which it will be assessing on paper. Would the European Commission prefer to wash its hands of this matter than to guarantee actual European-wide monitoring, <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> inspections by European inspectors and European supervision?</p>
<p class="contents">Other improvements that need to be made to current legislation are: more and better-equipped resting places within the European Union and beyond, more specific climate conditions for the different animal species and, finally, we have to start working on the compulsory use of satellite systems, with access by authorised personnel to a central database.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite an incomplete European overview of the actual implementation of this legislation, we do, of course, pick up certain rumours, from Austria for example, where a local inspector reportedly sees many empty lorries drive in the direction of Poland and the Czech Republic, for example, but he does not see the full vehicles returning, heading towards southern Europe. Does this mean that, once these lorries are full, they decide to make a detour around Austria, perhaps to avoid the stricter monitoring rules that are in place there in comparison with the surrounding countries? For me, that is an indication that the legislation is being applied very differently by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is the role of the vets who need to sign for transport. Commissioner, in some cases, these vets have become nothing but stamp machines. Surely nobody in their right mind could sign off a transport schedule for horses from Romania to southern Italy that was due to last 24 hours? The last 500 km of this transport would, according to the transport schedule, take 2.5 hours. This makes you wonder whether these animals were to be transported in a Ferrari.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, young animals, particularly puppies, for example, are now being ferried across the whole of Europe without there being any legislation in place. I would therefore like to urge the European Commission to look into this.</p>
<p class="contents">We have done our homework in this House; we are now looking forward to the Commission proposals that we expect before the forthcoming elections for this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In some cases, horses are packed like sardines into steel lorries, where temperatures can be over 40 °C. In some cases, those horses are transported for thousands of miles without food or water, causing injury or even death.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission have any information as to how many transgressions of Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 have been taken to court by Member States since it came into effect on 5 January 2007 and whether the EU regulations on harmonised GPS monitoring of vehicles will be enforced? Is there any way individuals can get access to data extracted from traces on movement of animals within Member States? I know the Commission can access that, but individuals cannot.

As the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture said, we would much rather have these animals slaughtered and then transported after they have died for processing away from the base if the movement of the meat is needed; but in the North West, we have a lot of horses, a lot of sheep and a lot of cattle – lots of movements of animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I was a national Member of Parliament for 18 years. This was a continuous problem, raised time and again with me by my constituents. I submit that things have not really improved over the last 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that this question has been tabled. The first year was 2007 and reports had to be in by June 2008, but I submit that we are behind programme. I have listened to what the Commissioner has said – that he will have a look at the advantage of satellite monitoring. That is a good idea. But I put it to the Commissioner that there are many detailed checks engrained in the Regulation, quite rightly – things like the fitness for transport of the animals, transport practices, means of transport, sea containers, integral journey times, resting periods, space allowances – which are all matters that cannot be viewed by satellite. They need detailed inspections, and lessons need to be learned.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have hoped that in his final remarks, there would be a date by which he hopes to wind up and submit his proposals and conclusions at this early time in the implementation of the Regulation because, the sooner something is done to improve the situation, the better.</p>
<p class="contents">It is appalling that these long journey times have to be faced by animals in their last few days of life. Consumers want to see, as they want to with free-range hens and eggs, that we are being humane in our treatment, and they will pay an added price for the meat because they want to see us caring for these animals that are so precious and necessary for our food needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Guaranteeing the welfare of animals is something that is very important. The Commission needs to ensure that the Animal Transport Regulation is implemented and monitored consistently throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">EU legislation on the transport of animals is strict. Recurrent serious problems with animal transport are due to gross breaches of the law. The current regulations on the time limit for animals in transport and their derogations are adequate if they are properly monitored and if, at the same time, top quality transport fleets are maintained. These need to have proper ventilation, temperature control, a drinking water system and a satellite navigation system. In addition, drivers have to be trained, and there need to be guidelines drawn up on the proper conditions for animal transport, as is now being done in many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important that the present Animal Transport Regulation is properly implemented everywhere in the EU and that the experiences gained from it are taken account of prior to any drafting of new regulations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recall a military regulation which stipulated that a single wagon could carry 8 horses or 48 men. This indicates that during the course of civilisation, it has begun to be understood that there is a greater affinity between human beings and animals than between human beings and objects. In my opinion, the development of civilisation has led us to understand that animals are not objects, that they are living beings which have intrinsic rights and we have expressed this view in our laws. I think it can be said that European regulations have now been formulated and that they undoubtedly represent progress for civilisation. On the other hand, the debate has clearly shown that they are not applied consistently and that reasons could be found for further improvements in their structure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with these general statements and in its activities will also seek to improve the system for implementing checks and monitoring the situation. We are thus now in the process of drawing up new regulations that will try to take into account the latest scientific findings from a broad range of areas because, as this debate has also shown clearly, this is a complex problem. It is not a simple matter, it is not enough to say ‘good, let us take one or two measures, and the matter will be resolved’. In my opinion, the debate also showed clearly that the idea of protecting livestock and animals generally constitutes an idea which is not based just on practical considerations relating to consumer protection. We are inclined to take certain protective measures even though they have no real significance for consumers and bring no real benefit, simply because this is a very significant ethical matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to try and answer some specific questions. A whole series of questions have been asked and we are, of course, ready to respond to individual MEPs in more detail over the questions I do not touch on now. One of the questions concerned the countries which have not submitted reports and I have mentioned these in my introductory speech. As this is such an important matter, however, I will mention that these countries were Cyprus, Lithuania, Malta, Bulgaria and Luxembourg. This question therefore did not apply to Ireland, which has fulfilled its obligations. Other questions related to access to information. I would like to mention that it is theoretically possible to publish the various national reports but the regulation allows Member States to refuse on the grounds of confidentiality. However, no Member State has done so. In the event of a request to publish a report, the Commission will then ask the Member States whether they wish to apply the confidentiality rule. As I do not expect this to happen, the report can then be published in full and, in my opinion, this would stimulate further debate. The annual reports are studied by the Commission’s own experts and, at the same time, they are supplemented with the findings obtained by Commission officials on the ground, thus creating a basis for further comments on compliance with the terms of the regulation and for further ideas on the development of the EU’s legal and organisational system in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the question of a further draft directive for the amendment of the legal system, I have already stated that the Commission is working on such drafts and is attempting to apply the most up-to-date scientific knowledge. A question was put forward as to how many infraction proceedings are currently under way. Currently, there are two infraction proceedings under way and two or three claims have been made against Andalusia or rather Spain. A total of six Member States were inspected in detail in 2008. These are some more specific facts relating to the questions that have been raised. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like once more to thank you for a debate which has been comprehensive and which has shown clearly that the positions of the Commission and of the Parliament are very close. In my opinion, this is a promising sign for further progress in this exceptionally sensitive area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Animal Transport Regulation has been in force for 2 years now, yet there are still massive breaches of animal rights, particularly in the transportation and slaughter of horses. I would ask the Commission what they are doing to ensure that horses are slaughtered in their countries of origin, without having to undergo long and distressing journeys to consuming countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A major concern for me and the people I represent is that these animals travel in inhumane, crowded, filthy conditions, with limited food and water. This is unnecessary. While we cannot stop the meat being consumed, if animals are to be slaughtered, they must be slaughtered in their countries of origin and transported to other countries as carcasses. Furthermore, consumers must be told if the meat they are eating is not local but comes from hundreds of miles away.</p>

<p class="contents">What this morning has shown me here, as the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, is that we have a very varied range of subjects to talk about. One minute we are talking about animal transport – a very important subject – and now we are talking about another very important subject: the Mediterranean diet.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the jobs that has come to me, as Chair of the Committee on Agriculture, and which we are particularly trying to get to grips with, is that, on the occasion of the Council of Ministers held in Brussels on 16 July 2007, the Commission reiterated its full support for the nomination of the Mediterranean diet as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. This nomination will be examined in 2009 – in fact, it now has been – by the responsible UNESCO committee. Is the Commission planning to set up a specific and coordinated strategy to support this nomination, because we are moving on very fast now?</p>
<p class="contents">I represent, as I said, the Committee on Agriculture here, but I probably represent all Members when we talk about diet, because one of the great things about Europe is its diversity and culture and part of that diversity and culture is, of course, our food.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean diet is a very good one. What is the Mediterranean diet? I am sure we could talk a great deal about that this morning, but it is generally a diet rich in oily fish, olive oils, fruit and vegetables. It is without doubt a very tasty diet, and you can see by the size of me that I am a very big fan of it. It is also a healthy diet: it is a rich source of essential fatty acids and antioxidants, a combination that can help improve cholesterol levels and protect heart health. Recent medical research has also suggested it may help cut the risk of conditions such as dementia.</p>
<p class="contents">When you go to Mediterranean countries, you can see that people enjoy it, and not only those who live there but also many of us who travel to Mediterranean countries, especially when we want some sunshine and also some very good food.</p>
<p class="contents">It is something that we need to take seriously in a world where everything seems to be uniform. We see the new generations being bombarded by the fast-food chains – I will not name them all here today – which are spreading throughout the European Union. We should remember that, yes, there is a role for a fast-food chain, but it would be a terrible thing if, in years to come, all we found when we travelled through Europe was fast food. Travelling through parts of America – especially on the west coast – there seems to be nothing but fast-food chains, and that is the last thing we want here in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, we need to support Mediterranean food, and it is a very good idea for culture and diversity. I think that in the future, we will have to look at other forms of diet across the European Union, because what I want to say to you quite clearly this morning is that while I am a great supporter of the Mediterranean diet, I do not come here as the Chair of the Committee on Agriculture just to support the Mediterranean diet, because there are other diets across Europe that are equally as good but have different qualities and different food.</p>
<p class="contents">So this is the start of many things to come and, as I said, I really want to know from the Commission how it intends to actively support this bid throughout this year, because we are looking forward to an award for the Mediterranean diet and we are also looking forward to having some very good Mediterranean food in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As MEPs, you will know that the White Paper entitled ‘A Strategy for Europe on nutrition, overweight and obesity-related health issues’, which was adopted by the European Commission on 30 May 2007, brings together all of the Community policies that can contribute towards improving eating habits and preventing obesity. It mainly involves measures in the areas of public health, catering, transport, regional policy, sport, education and statistics, as well as agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the best examples is the Commission initiative comprising a pan-European programme to supply fruit and vegetables to schools. The aim of the programme is to help make it easier for our children to get a healthy start in life. It will be launched at the start of the 2009/2010 school year with an annual budget of EUR 90 million for purchasing and supplying fresh fruit and vegetables to schools.</p>
<p class="contents">As concerns the specific question raised by one MEP on the request to have the Mediterranean diet included on the world cultural heritage list of UNESCO, the Commissioner’s predecessor, Markos Kyprianou, raised this topic at a Council agriculture meeting in July 2007. The Commission welcomes this initiative, as it can help to encourage healthy eating habits throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission, of course, has no formal powers to support such a request within the framework of UNESCO, since it is not a member of UNESCO and it cannot therefore participate in the decision-making process. I hope, nevertheless, that the participating states succeed in their application to UNESCO and that they will receive proper support for this from the other EU Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Having heard the Commissioner’s response, it is important to remember that the diet is a cultural asset and that the concept of diet is much broader than just the type of food one eats. Of course, as Mr Parish said, the Mediterranean diet, as a type of food, has a very important role in a healthy lifestyle including in the prevention of illnesses related to incorrect diet or the lack of physical exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the concept of the Mediterranean diet goes further than that, and in this respect my comments complement his. It encompasses a specific way of life, a way of sharing food and enjoying it in company that is linked to a certain type of landscape and territory as well as to societies that, over the centuries, have developed culture, art, traditions and festivals around the concept of the Mediterranean diet.</p>
<p class="contents">Having clarified what the Mediterranean diet means to me and the majority of the people involved in this field and the reason behind the nomination, and with the confirmation of the Commission’s willingness to cooperate, let us consider, Commissioner, that, although the Commission is not a member of UNESCO – as we already know – nor does it participate in its decision-making processes – as we are also aware – the Commission can support the nomination with indirect actions which would doubtless have a positive effect on the perceptions of those involved in the voting procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the options, I would suggest a formal statement of support by the European Commission for the nomination, as other international organisations such as the FAO, the World Health Organisation and the scientific and academic communities are making such statements of support.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the future management plan, of course we think that the Commission should become involved, by supporting or joining in with specific transnational actions that may be proposed. This has been the year of intercultural dialogue and one of the states contributing to the nomination is a Mediterranean neighbour of ours, the Kingdom of Morocco. All this is particularly important considering, as you said, the Commission’s interest in promoting healthy diets and lifestyles for Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission could also help in seeking support and collaboration and could undertake diplomatic efforts, given the respect afforded the Commission, especially in Mediterranean countries outside the EU, as well as outside the Mediterranean area and the European Union. Of course, Commissioner, the Commission could show itself to be available to organise or collaborate on potential activities that may come about in these months in some fields of work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe has many things that are envied around the world: our fashion, our lifestyle, our social-security systems – and, increasingly, our diet. We in Europe would do well to draw attention to the healthiest diet, namely the Mediterranean diet.</p>
<p class="contents">To clarify the definition: the Mediterranean diet has its origins in the dietary patterns typical of large parts of Greece, including the island of Crete, and of southern Italy – hence its name. Its main component – as the Commissioner has already said – is olive oil. This is yet another reason – and I address this not only to Commissioner Špidla but also to the whole of the Commission – to accord this original European product even greater protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean diet still consists of high-fibre bread, large amounts of fruit and vegetables – which is why we welcome the Commission’s School Fruit Scheme – fish, dairy products in moderation, and wine too. It has been scientifically proven – this conclusion was reached in a September 2008 edition of the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> – that the Mediterranean diet helps to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, of type 2 diabetes – the contemporary European epidemic – and of cancer, and to decrease the effects of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. This is illustrated by a visit to graveyards in Crete, the island my father hails from: seeing the age people live to there really brings this home to you.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we must do our utmost to increase the number of devotees of the Mediterranean diet in Europe and beyond, and its inclusion on the World Heritage List is an important step in this regard. I wish to thank the Commission for its efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also realise that, if China and India adopt the American diet, as they are increasingly doing, the adverse effects will be threefold. Firstly, the health of the world’s population will decline. Secondly, there will be an increase in intensive livestock farming, with all its adverse effects on the environment, and the third effect concerns methane production, as most of the meat will be beef. Cattle produce methane, and that is bad for the global climate. This is why it is so important to take this particular step. Thank you again, Mr Parish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the institutional commitment displayed by Italy, Spain, Greece and Morocco cannot be limited solely to achieving this prestigious recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we must reconstruct the link, nowadays increasingly weak and fragile, between agricultural produce and food for everyday consumption; that is to say, we must encourage consumers to be knowledgeable about the principles of a healthy diet and the seasonality of produce. Produce must return to being natural and free from additives and chemical preservatives. The international scientific community assures us that the consumption of such produce significantly reduces mortality rates. I am thinking, for example, of extra-virgin olive oil, wine and fruit and, in particular, Sicilian blood oranges, unique in the world for their pigment that is rich in antioxidants.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I hope this objective can be shared with other Mediterranean countries and, as a specific strategy is required, only the Commission can take a lead role and act as interpreter in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The realisation of such an objective may contribute to preserving, raising awareness of, and promoting a diet that predominates in the Mediterranean countries and which has been shown to be healthy by various nutritionists and other specialists.

<p class="contents">Thus, among other consequential and necessary political initiatives, we consider that effective measures must be taken to support traditional Mediterranean production, particularly within the framework of common agricultural policy and common fisheries policy. Such measures should be directed at small-scale agriculture and family agriculture, as well as the fishermen of these regions, to guarantee their production. The measures should give added value to traditional and artisanal products and encourage the development of local markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Essentially, measures are needed to counter the growing decline of agricultural activity and the reduction in the population who, with their knowledge, carry on and safeguard the production of these traditional quality products.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these issues and measures come within the remit of the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Mediterranean diet achieves this in full.</p>
<p class="contents">From the health perspective, it appears there are no remaining scientific doubts about the advantages to human health of a diet based on fresh and natural food. As already mentioned here, this includes cereals, rice, legumes, nuts, fruit and vegetables, frequent consumption of fish, olive oil as the main dietary fat and moderate consumption of wine.</p>
<p class="contents">From a cultural point of view, the systems of production and the processing and consumption of these products are associated with ancestral techniques and traditions that go back further than Greco-Roman culture and that, in many respects, are still present in the practices, customs and techniques of the communities of the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p class="contents">From the perspective of the economy, the activities connected, in particular, to the agriculture, fishing and rural tourism sectors, which are so important in preventing depopulation and maintaining the vitality of the rural and coastal zones, continue to have a very considerable socio-economic impact. At the same time, and curiously in the case of agriculture, they represent the most competitive forms of production in the European Union, and have always benefited from the least financial support under the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, the initiative of the Spanish authorities to have the Mediterranean diet recognised by UNESCO as Cultural Heritage of Humanity deserves to be warmly welcomed, and I think it is the duty and obligation of the European Union to do what it can to influence this decision, because it is not in the specific interests of one country or group of countries; it is in the interests of the whole Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to the experts, if we want to look after the health of our children, the best way to achieve this is to return to the traditions of Mediterranean cuisine on a daily basis, the only life insurance that financial crises can never affect.</p>
<p class="contents">The approach of Alfonso Iaccarino, a well-known Italian chef and member of the expert committee on the recognition of the Mediterranean diet as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, is to return to natural, simple foods and to tradition, diversity and quality in cooking. The Mediterranean diet is not just a lot of bread and pasta, it also involves movement, physical activity and lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet, based on extra-virgin olive oil and good wine, has an excellent effect on health: olive oil reduces blood cholesterol levels and wine, in moderation, has an antioxidant effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean diet has helped Italians break the record for longevity in Europe and Italy leads the ranking for best body mass index, which is the relationship between height and weight. In conclusion: the Italian Senate recently unanimously approved a paper in favour of the recognition of the Mediterranean diet as heritage of humanity. I hope that the European Parliament is of the same opinion and that the Commission acts accordingly.</p>

<p class="contents">It is undeniable that Mediterranean food is part of the historical and cultural heritage of our continent. The healthy basis of the diet is also undeniable. The Commission’s White Paper on obesity identified the Mediterranean diet as an excellent natural medicine.</p>
<p class="contents">The health benefits have been scientifically demonstrated and have an excellent reputation abroad, in particular, in the United States. This has meant that the concept has been broadened to the point of distorting its original nature. Recognition by UNESCO would encourage a definition to protect this particular diet. I would say to Mr Parish that, in relation to specific diets in European gastronomic culture, we are currently talking about Mediterranean food, but this is certainly not the only specific diet in the very rich European gastronomy.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have maintained your predecessor’s commitment to recognising the importance of this initiative, and I thank you for that. You have stressed that you do not have decision-making powers with respect to the UNESCO procedure. However, I think that you could issue a statement and undertake diplomatic efforts …</p>

With your permission and that of my fellow Members, I should like to make two comments, the first on the resolution being put to the vote, and the second a personal statement regarding a Member of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the resolution, my group discussed this again yesterday evening. The discussion was very in-depth and very passionate, but also very thoughtful. I believe that, this morning, as we prepare to vote, we are all shaken by what Mr Wurtz has just told us. When armed hostilities escalate such that international institutions are no longer secure, the situation is extremely serious. An appeal must be made to Israel in particular, in this case, to respect the bodies of the international community, as failure to do so puts the humanitarian infrastructure at risk, which is certainly not consistent with international law.</p>
<p class="contents">We have decided to support this resolution, however, as – following yesterday’s lengthy discussion – we believe that it is right and vital to adopt it now, and that it is necessary for us, for the European Parliament as an institution, to send out such signals. One thing is quite certain, however, and that is that when violence escalates such that it does not even spare schools and kindergartens, it is a matter not for regret, but for condemnation in the strongest terms. Although this is not contained in the resolution,</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">we do want to emphasise it here, as we believe that this reflects the feelings of many of our fellow Members, including those from other groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to say a few words today about a colleague who, throughout his political career, has made a particular contribution to peace in the world and in the European Union. This is the last plenary sitting my colleague Mr Rocard will be attending. For us in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, but I believe for us all ...</p>

<p class="contents">The Treaty of Rome has one sentence on the subject which you would have thought is very easily understood: ‘Men and women shall be given equal pay for equal work’. But in a series of contentious judgments – Defrenne v. Sabena, Barber v. Guardian Royal Exchange, and others – the definition has been progressively widened, first so as to include holiday entitlements and pensions and so on, and then so as to include work of equivalent value.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not at all clear how an employer is supposed to assess work of equivalent value, whether he is required, for example, to factor in the availability of suitably qualified applicants. My point is not really to do with gender equality, it is to do with the fairness of Member States thinking that they have signed one Treaty, and then finding that it is interpreted in the courts by judges who give it a meaning that it could not possibly have been intended to have.</p>

This is very patronising, burdening businesses, as it does, with bureaucratic nonsense simply to hammer home a number of principles that are universally accepted but are not always easy to implement in practice.

But it may be that today, there will be further movements towards a cease-fire in the region, which would be most welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, we support the efforts of Egypt to broker a cease-fire. While Egypt and the Arab leaders may bring influence to bear on Hamas, when it comes to Israel, I think it is the US which carries that influence, although I hope that this motion for a resolution, which was resoundingly supported in Parliament today, will add further to the pressure for immediate and effective humanitarian aid, for a cease-fire and for a lasting peace in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope we have now set the precedent that, unlike those who demonstrated for a referendum, we accept the right to make a peaceful point in a suitable manner as part of the democratic process.</p>
<p class="contents">Like everybody else in this Chamber, I am, of course, horrified by what has been happening in the Middle East. The losers are not one side or the other but people of good will throughout the region. There are Gazan families peaceably trying to bring up their children, who are horrified at the hell unleashed on them by the rocket launches. There are Israelis who understand that one day an independent Palestine will be their neighbour and that actions of this kind are unlikely to make it a benign neighbour. In the current circumstances, however, nobody wants to listen to such voices.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just say that I am puzzled by the resolution’s insistence on proportionality. I am not sure what proportionality means. Would critics of the Israeli Government be happier if it had rained an equivalent number of rockets randomly on Gazan villages? I see your gavel raised so I will simply say that I hope that the cease-fire is quickly negotiated and that we can get back to talking and to finding a peaceful resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU is indeed much more united than people say. If we remain so, we can achieve something in the Middle East, and so we must continue in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The components are clear: ‘yes’ to the right of Israel to exist, ‘no’ to war and bloodshed, ‘no’ to Hamas’ rocket fire, ‘no’ to Hamas’ terrorism and, crucially, ‘yes’ to negotiations on the bones of contention, including the problem of the settlers, as this, alongside the unacceptable terrorism on the part of Hamas, is at the heart of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The fundamental components are on the table, therefore, and so the task of the EU is to drive things forward with energy and determination instead of degenerating into a disunited talking shop, which – unfortunately – we have been in recent years in the matter of Middle East policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any case, we as Europeans need to remain impartial and objective and, above all, we must always uphold the principles of democracy, human rights and freedom of speech and oppose terror in all circumstances.

<p class="contents">As Mrs Madurell’s report also indicates, one of the biggest problems in combating gender discrimination on the labour market is also the lack of information about the rights which the victims of discrimination have. The responsibility for this is shared equally among the Member States, European institutions, such as the European Institute for Gender Equality, and employers.

As the rapporteur mentions, the wage gap remains high, with women earning wages that, on average, are 15% lower than men’s. This gap narrowed by just 1% between 2000 and 2006.

Equal treatment, irrespective of gender, race, religion, etc. is a fundamental human right. Of course, we cannot forget the natural biological differences which exist between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the automatic application of a 50/50 gender balance policy across the board is not really a sign that we are concerned about gender equality. In the case of difficult physical jobs such as mining, work in a steelworks, etc., this approach merely leads to ridiculous situations, just as it does in the case of nurses or teachers. Equally, we cannot force girls to take up technical studies. In order to maintain a fifty-fifty balance. Fundamental issues include access to education at all levels, filling managerial roles (including those in political institutions), implementing the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’, adequate access to social security and benefits, as well as medical treatment (taking into account maternity leave). Trade unions should play an important role in this field. It is an important issue at local, regional and national level, as well as at the level of the European Union institutions.</p>

Nevertheless, Parliament could have sent out a stronger signal; the resolution remains too weak on some points. It is important that we call for a lasting cease-fire and condemn the suffering of the civilian population. It is also our duty to suggest practical solutions for ending the war and to call on the EU to commit itself to these in its role within the Quartet. As the United States is currently in a state of paralysis on account of its change of president, the EU must further increase its sense of duty. A pause in the negotiations on enhancing relations with Israel is called for in view of such excessive military action. Unfortunately, there is no mention of this in the resolution. If Israel does not want to negotiate directly with Hamas, it is up to the EU to work to ensure that others talk to Hamas. The continuation of the military offensive is costing too many lives.

<p class="contents">The confrontation in Gaza reveals, through the opposite situation on the West Bank, that the relationship between the parties, although tense and conflictive, is possible, if both are willing to accept the existence of the other.

Hamas, we know, without any consideration for the life of the Palestinians, uses the population as human shields against the attacks by Israel and their deaths as weapons of propaganda. Israel, determined to legitimately guarantee its security, continues with the fighting in spite of this tragic result. The process is inevitable if the international community, including Arab countries, does not promote the viability of one side and the security of the other as the objective of the peace process in the Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us take note of this and quickly work towards a shared process to improve relations with this country, which is so close to our borders. However, we cannot give an inch on our demands with regard to respect for human rights and guarantees of freedom of expression and information. The images of the repression of several attempted peaceful democratic demonstrations by the opposition are still vivid.</p>
<p class="contents">I would furthermore ask for a greater effort in agreeing common rules on the sensitive subject of visits by Belarusian children to host families in the EU during the summer months. Every year, the Belarusian Government changes its strategy on this matter, often leading to very difficult situations that have a negative effect, in particular, on the children themselves, who are already disadvantaged in other ways. The current progress is welcome, but the road to be followed is still very long: we hope that Mr Lukashenko, after many false starts, wants to move down this road, at least in part, together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If there is common good will, then dialogue will be possible, as will a suitable neighbourhood policy and an Eastern Partnership. Partnerships cannot be built on prohibitions and orders, which is why I welcome the European Commission’s recent initiative to improve relations with Belarus. Objectively speaking, we must admit that Belarus has also done a lot to foster understanding. Examples of this include registration of the ‘For Freedom’ movement, permission for the publication and distribution of opposition newspapers, and openness to the Eastern Partnership initiative. The European Union has greater expectations. There are, of course, good reasons for this. However, there are also good reasons for many of Belarus’ expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for symmetry and understanding between the partners in many fields. For example, since we are calling on the Belarusian authorities to stop issuing exit visas to their citizens, especially children and students, why does the European Union not take steps to simplify and liberalise visa procedures for the citizens of Belarus? These problems are particularly important to those of us who live in border regions, which are linked by both cultural and family ties.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to cultural matters and the issue of nationality, the economy and trans-border cooperation are also important. Here, too, the Commission and the Council could, and should, do more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The promotion of democracy in Belarus is a question both of values and of strategy.

Those in favour of military interventions will not enjoy hearing this criticism. During last night’s speech, I was silenced in mid-flow by the President, perhaps on account of the irritation felt about the content of my speech. The last bit, that was hardly audible because the President was hammering away with his gavel, fits in with this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Srebrenica is also a symbol for the failure of optimistic notions about humanitarian interventions and safe havens.

<p class="contents">At the same time, it attempts to increase the standing of the despised American-inspired Special Court in The Hague, before which the imperialists want to try their victims and which has already been used to physically eliminate the Yugoslavian leader Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
<p class="contents">Calling the events in Srebrenica the biggest post-war crime and the proposal to recognise a day to commemorate it in the Member States of the EU, while there are still serious questions as to what actually happened there, is a gross misrepresentation of history, because in fact, the biggest post-war crime to date in Europe has been the slaughter of the people of Yugoslavia by the American and European imperialists.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communist Party of Greece refuses to support the adoption of such unacceptable resolutions, especially at a time when we are all witness to the daily killing of hundreds of children and civilians in Palestine by Israel, with the support of the same imperialist forces now turning a blind eye, and the people of Yugoslavia were not party to the resolution in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nor should we be surprised by the fact that the regime in Iran will take no notice whatsoever of this resolution. They will laugh at it and throw it in the bin in exactly the same manner that they have dealt with all previous resolutions of this Parliament. And who can blame them? They know that our resolutions are just words, not deeds, and in their estimation they are not worth the paper they are written on.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to help bring change in Iran then we must match our words with action.

If we take such action, then we can be sure that the authorities in Tehran will take us seriously and will think twice about continuing with the persecution of their democracy-seeking citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">So, it seems to me that we should have had a second motion for a resolution in addition to this one, calling on the governments of some EU Member States, such as the UK and France, and applicant countries, such as Turkey, to stop their hypocritical stance on Iran and start taking real action against it immediately and effectively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She was the first female judge in her country but was forced to resign due to the Iranian revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">She defended the rights of Iranian women and children, fighting to change divorce and inheritance laws in Iran. She stood up to defend religious minorities and their rights, and most recently she has defended seven members of the Bahá’í faith who have been collectively arrested and who face persecution like many others of faith in Iran. But it is her work on human rights and her courage and determination which has gained her the respect of all of us in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">She, along with other human rights activists, bravely founded the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights in Tehran. Its purpose was to report human rights violations in Iran, to provide representation of political prisoners and to help their families. However, right from the start, the authorities have tried to close the office down. Those who work there have been threatened, imprisoned and intimidated. Shirin Ebadi has personally faced numerous death threats, and the international community has, for some time, expressed its concern for her safety. Then, just before Christmas, as those at the centre were about to commemorate the 60<span class="sup">th </span>anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Iranian security officials closed the centre down.</p>
<p class="contents">The centre must be reopened immediately. We must put pressure on the Commission, the High Representative, the Czech Presidency and our own Member States to take this case up and see the centre reopened.</p>
<p class="contents">It is hard for us sitting here in this Chamber to truly comprehend the bravery, the courage and strength required by human rights activists like Shirin Ebadi to function in Iran and stand up to the dictatorship. However, the work of human rights lawyers and activists is needed to shine a light on what is happening in Iran, to give hope to those like the Alaei brothers. Arash and Kamiar Alaei are both doctors helping those with HIV and AIDS who have been charged with cooperating with an enemy, when all they have been doing is trying to help the sick.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will see the re-opening of the human rights centre and that this Parliament will do all it can to help Shirin Ebadi. After all, as fellow human beings, her struggle is also our struggle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People have often told us they take great courage from external voices recognising the threat that they are under.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been said, this is a serious case, because an attack on such an internationally renowned defender of human rights signals that people questioning the state or exercising their fundamental rights, such as those to the freedom of belief, will not be safe, so they have to conform to the state or face the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Shirin Ebadi herself has faced death threats on many occasions, not least because she has defended the seven-member leadership of the Bahá’í faith in Iran, who themselves face significant persecution. We have seen further arrests in the last 24 hours of people who have worked with her and indeed other members of the Bahá’í faith.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at what we do here, we also need to realise that we are actually seeing a shift in the recognition of human rights by certain governments throughout the world, and that this has an impact on countries with which the European Union has dealings. They now feel that they do not have to pay so much attention to human rights because they can trade and work with countries that really do not care. I think, therefore, that makes it even more important for us to make sure that we try to uphold those standards and that, as has been said, we do not look to increase trade with countries whose human rights records are abysmal, but make every effort to support those working for human rights and those democrats opposing the undemocratic forces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, I urge the Commission to continue to monitor the human rights situation there and to present a comprehensive report on the situation during the first half of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we protest against the harassment of a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Ms Shirin Ebadi, and her Centre for the Defence of Human Rights. It has often been asked what is the result of these protests. This question should also be addressed to the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iranian regime is potentially the biggest threat to world peace and the rule of law. In all likelihood, in the nearest future, Tehran will have nuclear warheads – it already has the missiles to deliver them. Iran, too, is a big exporter of terrorism – to Iraq for example, it is a supporter of Hezbollah and Hamas.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the EU is still hoping to convince this dictatorship through compromises and has, until recently, been helping the terrorist regime in Tehran to tie the hands of the main democratic opposition, ironically labelling it as a terrorist organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">So we need a clear and forceful stand on human rights and also to have the human rights situation in Iran as a priority in dealing with Tehran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Shirin Ebadi’s persecution is not an isolated incident. Under the regime’s critics, she enjoyed a privileged position for years. The existence of its human rights centre created the impression that things were not that bad in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of the victims of the theocratic regime in Iran are unknown. Holding a different political opinion, protests on the part of discriminated-against ethnic minorities and religious minorities, homosexuality and fighting against the disadvantaged position of women, are all reasons for being locked up or murdered. Many things that we take for granted in Europe can get you killed in Iran. Some victims are hung from tall hoisting cranes as an example in the presence of large crowds.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, the outside world, including Europe, is not terribly interested in this appalling situation and the way in which this can be brought to an end. International attention tends to focus on other things. Whilst it would like to see Iran’s military power restricted and stop the application of nuclear energy, the international community mainly attaches importance to the continued delivery of petroleum and the maintenance and/or extension of good trade relations.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, Iran has been under a constant threat of war, while criticism of the lack of human rights is not expressed. It even leads to a situation where cooperation with the Iranian regime is bought by constantly placing the main exiled opposition groups on the list of terrorists. We must put a stop to the bizarre situation in which, every time there is a judicial ruling declaring this placement on the list of terrorists to be illegal, a new, identical decision is taken by the Council on behalf of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike most other victims of persecution in Iran, Shirin Ebadi is not anonymous but internationally known and respected. So far, the status of the Nobel Prize-winner has, at times, secured her a limited degree of freedom. The fact that this status is now coming to an end indicates the need for international support for those forces that seek change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, we are discussing human rights in Iran, which is an important country in the Middle East and one which will have a decisive impact on the political situation in that region. The Iranian Government should therefore be even more strongly bound to absolutely respect human rights and international standards in the field of humanitarian law.</p>
<p class="contents">We defend the Nobel Prize winner Shirin Ebadi and oppose the recent actions of the authorities and the government campaign, intended to turn public opinion against Shirin Ebadi. I would also like to draw your attention to further arrests of university students in Shiraz. This week, while the European Parliament has been in session in Strasbourg (on 12 January to be precise), a further six people were arrested.

The search of the office is the latest in a series of acts of intimidation aimed at Mrs Ebadi which have included, for example, the closure in December of the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights, an organisation which she led.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission therefore fully supports the French Presidency of the Council of the Union in presenting two declarations regarding Mrs Ebadi’s case on 31 and 22 December last year. The Commission especially emphasises the fact that the Iranian authorities must comply with their international obligations in the human rights area and in particular the right of peaceful assembly set out in the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights. Iran has signed and ratified this Pact and hence it must allow the offices of the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights to be reopened and it must provide them with the legal status they have been requesting for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2009, just as in the past, the Commission will not forego any opportunity to apply pressure on the Iranian authorities to provide protection for Mrs Ebadi and other human rights defenders (individuals or organisations) and to allow them to continue operating in the country without interfering in their legitimate activities.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, the issues of nuclear power and human rights greatly limit the scope of our activities in Iran. Despite this, the Commission will continue in 2009 with cooperation in areas of common interest, especially in the fight against the drugs trade. We have also managed to maintain some programmes supporting human rights and the proper administration of public affairs, for example a project to support children’s rights in cooperation with UNICEF and projects in support of judicial reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also pursuing initiatives aimed at strengthening cooperation and exchanges in the area of education and culture – exchanges within the framework of the Erasmus Mundus programme, the recent visit of several Iranian journalists to Brussels, or the broadcasting of television programmes in Persian which the Commission wants to launch before the end of this year. Despite this, it is clear that our relations will not be able to develop in a normal way unless the human rights situation in Iran improves dramatically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was taken over by the Portuguese in the 15<span class="sup">th </span>century and its citizens were subjected to the European slave trade in the 16<span class="sup">th </span>century and beyond. In 1890, it was colonised by France. After independence in 1958, firm ties were formed with the Soviet Union. Its post-colonial period was largely dominated by presidential totalitarianism, with its rulers being backed by its admittedly rather primitive army.</p>
<p class="contents">Guinea, although blessed with very rich mineral deposits, including iron, aluminium, gold, diamonds and uranium, is nevertheless one of the poorest countries in the world. These minerals are being exploited by companies from Russia, Ukraine, France, Britain, Australia and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">Heavy corruption of officials is well known to occur, and the governments of the countries to which such companies belong seem to care very little about the welfare of Guinea’s citizens, and only start complaining about the appalling human rights situation in the country when their financial interests are disrupted or threatened.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, presently there is yet another dictator in power in Guinea, a young junior army officer called Captain Camara. He heads a junta that has pledged to rid the country of corruption and to improve living standards for its 10 million citizens. To this end, a 32-member National Council for Democracy and Development was set up to govern the country.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no idea whether Captain Camara is genuine in his endeavours, or whether he will succeed in improving matters in Guinea. One thing is certain, however: things cannot get worse than they have been for the last few decades, during which Europe and the rest of the world were happy just to sit back, watch and enjoy the benefits of the mineral exploitation of Guinea. So, although I oppose military dictatorships <span class="italic">a priori</span>, I can only hope that, after a short period of time, a transition to democracy might occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the course of that night of 22 and 23 December, his close relatives were busy making arrangements for the interim period amidst rumours of a coup d’état.</p>
<p class="contents">At that very moment, were they sincere, those men running a country deemed by <span class="italic">Transparency International</span> to be one of the most corrupt in the world and relying on a rule of law and a democracy that have never actually existed? At that very moment, were they recalling how, 24 years ago, General Lanzana Conté seized power when the father of independence in 1958, the Marxist President Sékou Touré, died in 1984? At that very moment, were they thinking that a simple officer in charge of fuel procurement for the army would be able to seize power? At that very moment, were they regretting not having worked hard enough to establish true rule of law and real democracy that would have enabled those precious elections to have been organised within 60 days, as laid down by the constitution?</p>
<p class="contents">If they did indeed have these regrets, Captain Moussa Dadis Camara’s feelings and those of his friends were to change to remorse within a few hours. On Wednesday 24 December, the unknown captain declared himself the President of the Republic, he was cheered by thousands of Guineans and, on 25 December, he made a display of the allegiance offered by the civil government, who agreed to his ultimatum. He promised to fight corruption and to organise elections before 2010. He appointed a decent man as Prime Minister, an Egypt-based international civil servant. He happily reported that nobody in Guinea was condemning him; the opposition political parties, civil society, accepted this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Should the coup d’état be condemned in these circumstances? Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we have to condemn it! The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on behalf of whom I am honoured to speak, condemns this coup d’état although we are not naïve; we know that political solutions are never simple when a country is emerging from a dictatorship. We call on you to vote in favour of the joint resolution of the six political groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This dictator came to power following a coup d’état in 1984 and has been in power ever since. He considered that country his own private property that was of particular significance on account of its natural deposits of gold, iron and bauxite. Most parties did not take part in the elections that were organised under his control, and the official opposition that was temporarily represented in the parliament was later forced to leave.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the trade union confederations CNTG and USTG became the main force in the fight for democracy. The presidential security force, led by the dictator’s son, responded to their protest rally on 22 January 2007 by killing 59 people and wounding 150 others.</p>
<p class="contents">This appalling regime came unexpectedly to an end when the dictator died in December last year. The junta put a banker forward as its next Prime Minister. The question now is what exactly the military junta that subsequently took over power has made room for. Is this a step towards democracy and equality for all residents, or will this new coup d’état clear the way for a new dictator who is, once again, mainly interested in the country’s natural resources and in the prospect of lining his own pockets?</p>
<p class="contents">The reaction from the outside world is one of confusion. The West-African cooperative bloc, ECOWAS, has condemned the latest coup d’état. The Nigerian President praises the late dictator but, fortunately, he does demand a swift transfer of power to a democratically elected government. France and Senegal, too, are applying pressure for elections to be held within a year.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has, over the years, always supported the demands of Guinea’s democratic opposition, which still appears to be out of the game. We do not condemn the changeover of power, but we do condemn the possible continuation of a lack of democracy in the near future. There is, as yet, no reason to penalise or isolate Guinea, but we should remind the new leaders that their moment in the limelight can only be very short-lived. That country does not need another dictator, but the restoration of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While in countries which share a border with Guinea, namely Sierra Leone, the Ivory Coast, Senegal or Liberia, a political thaw is taking place, military regimes have collapsed and a young democracy is emerging, Guinea remains stuck in the past.

<p class="contents">The only good news is that the coup has been condemned by other African states and by the African Union. Further European Union aid for Guinea must undoubtedly be linked to re-establishing constitutional order and calling presidential elections as soon as possible. Independent international organisations should observe the election process and monitor the fairness of these elections.

In fact, Guinea has never enjoyed true democracy in its half-century of independence.</p>
<p class="contents">The death of Mr Conté offered an opportunity for Guinea to turn the page but any hopes of transition to genuine democracy were extinguished by the military coup. Predictably, the African Union’s response to the coup has been lamentably lacklustre. The AU cannot expect to be taken seriously internationally while it continues to prevaricate and procrastinate. Why should we in the West go to such lengths to address this issue when African governments appear so indifferent?</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should consider invoking the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement relating to sanctions. Captain Camara and the coup leaders need to understand that the EU expects certain basic standards of governance in return for a trade-and-aid relationship.

Military juntas behave in a similar way: first there are arrests, then the constitution is suspended, and later there is an announcement that democratic elections will be called. In this case, the elections are to be held in two years’ time. However, in practice, the officers start to exercise power and find that they like it. This then leads to social oppression and revolts, as well as violations of human rights and democratic principles. We have reason to suspect that the same might happen in Guinea, although we all hope that things will be different this time, that events will take a turn for the better and that the outcome will be more positive.</p>

I think that, in view of the social situation, i.e. the constantly falling per capita income, the European Union, and therefore the European Commission, will also take appropriate and considered, but also courageous, action to ensure that normality returns to this country as soon as possible, for the good of its people, and in order to prevent genocide and human rights violations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, the social and economic situation in Guinea is unenviable, people’s living conditions are extremely harsh, there is a lack of basic foodstuffs, human rights are blatantly violated and all this creates an environment favouring a seizure of power by illegal means.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we know very well that seizures of power by means of a military coup have become a tradition in Guinea. Parliamentary elections were not called when the term of the National Assembly ended two years ago. All this undoubtedly is of concern to the international community. In any country, such a situation sooner or later leads to rioting, instability and often also the spilling of blood.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I agree entirely with the resolution we are debating, which urges the organisation of parliamentary and presidential elections, the observance of international standards and help from the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States. In addition, freedom of the press, speech and assembly must be guaranteed before the elections, otherwise the elections will become an electoral farce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It took place immediately after the death of President Conté, who came to power following a coup 24 years earlier. The economic and political situation in this extremely poor country incites the people to protest. These protests are then pacified by the armed forces, which consolidate a corrupt government and the division of the country into those who prosper and those who are dying of hunger.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the African Union and the African Economic Community has suspended relations with the junta is a positive step in this case. External pressure might force the junta to call democratic elections. The lesson to be learned from this situation is that, in order to support democracy in Africa, the African Union needs an action plan, which would prevent coups that result in enormous losses for the citizens of this poor region of the world. I support this Resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission wholeheartedly supports the declaration of the EU Presidency condemning this violent takeover of power and calling on the authorities in Guinea to return to civilian, constitutional and democratic government as quickly as possible. The positive reception accorded to the military regime by the Guinean public, especially by political parties and trade unions, clearly shows that the standard of living for the Guinean people has deteriorated so much that even a military coup is viewed as a change for the better and as an event creating optimism for the future. It also shows that the former regime had lost the trust of the Guinean people to such an extent that they preferred the government to be taken over by military units rather than official successors.</p>
<p class="contents">In this confused situation, it is important to welcome the rapid and effective initiatives undertaken by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and its chairman, Mr Chambas, as well as the determination and decisiveness of the Community and the African Union, which have suspended Guinea’s membership in their organisations and have condemned the violent takeover of power. The Commission is determined to support the efforts of ECOWAS and the African Union and to support their efforts to enable the quickest possible return to a civilian, constitutional and democratic government through free and transparent elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge facing the international community in the following months is to support Guinea in its transition to democracy and in the arrangement of free and democratic elections for a law-making assembly and a president.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, in March 2004, following elections which did not respect democratic principles and which violated fundamental elements of the Cotonou Agreement, we decided to begin consultations between Guinea and the European Union under Article 96 of the Agreement. Progress was achieved in the following areas: general elections to follow in 2006, media liberalisation, election system changes to be carried out jointly by the government and the opposition and improvements to the macroeconomic framework.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not losing hope. We firmly believe that the election process which was started in October last year can be successfully resumed. Currently, a joint mission of the Presidency and the Commission is leaving for Guinea this Wednesday. The mission includes groups from ECOWAS and the African Union and its aim will be to assess the situation in the country and to propose appropriate measures for supporting Guinea in its transition to democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current President, Mr Kibaki, is implementing measures which are clearly intended to restrict the freedom of speech and of the press. On 2 January 2009, he violated the provisions of the Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter of Human Rights by sanctioning amendments to what is known as the Kenya Communications Bill of 1998, giving the national authorities new rights, including the right to dismantle broadcasting and communications equipment, as well as to control and alter the content of mass media publications. The international community unanimously declared this to be a further step towards media censorship in Kenya.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in spite of earlier commitments arising from agreements signed to establish Kenya’s grand coalition government, the President failed to consult the Prime Minister in office regarding either this decision or any further decisions. This exacerbated the crisis in Kenya, which had already lasted for over a year and which had claimed around 1 000 victims and left 350 000 people homeless. The European Union cannot stand by while fundamental freedoms are being blatantly violated.</p>
<p class="contents">We should welcome the Kenyan President’s assurances that the amendments will be revised and that all political powers will be consulted on this matter, in order to give these amendments a new, democratic quality and ensure the broad support of Kenyan society. The European Union must support these measures and monitor them in detail, fostering pluralism during the process of building a civil society. At the same time, the Kenyan authorities should take stronger action to introduce a state of normality in the country, including the creation of a special committee, consisting of local and international experts, to punish those guilty of violence and of causing the crisis last year. There is a chance that these measures will stabilise the internal situation and prevent a humanitarian disaster, which inevitably threatens this Eastern African country with a population of ten million. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the Second World War, when Europe slowly came to accept that the independence of African countries was eventually inevitable, Kenya was emphatically excluded, as was the country we now know as Zimbabwe. According to colonial rulers, there were too many foreign colonists and too many foreign economic interests in those countries to be able to leave them in the hands of the predominantly black populations.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike other West African countries, independence in Kenya did not come about peacefully, but only following a protracted and violent struggle by the independence movement Mau Mau. This need for a violent struggle has laid the foundations for continued violence and intimidation. The victors mainly belong to one major tribe, the Kikuyu. Other population groups have always been kept in opposition, where necessary on the strength of rigged election results. The latest presidential elections proved once again that a non-Kikuyu cannot become President, not even if the majority of voters vote for him.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks to a compromise, the opposition candidate is now Prime Minister and domestic peace seems to be restored. While, out of the two African countries with rigged presidential elections, Zimbabwe is considered the country with the bad compromise, Kenya has been praised as the country with the good compromise. For years, Western Europe and America considered Kenya to be a major success story. It was a country with relative prosperity, freedom for international businesses, friendship with the West and attention for tourists. Kenya has now lost that success-story image. A food shortage and a new press law have made for renewed tension. This food shortage is partly attributable to the fact that the President, in exchange for the construction of the port, has leased out 40 000 hectares of farm land to the oil state Qatar for food supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">The press law appears to be a lever which the President uses to restrict the power of the coalition government and to eliminate critical opponents. This is all the more shocking, given that this law came about without the Prime Minister even being consulted. The coalition compromise between the President and the Prime Minister is in jeopardy if the President is given the capability of bypassing the Prime Minister, restricting the role of the government and protecting his own role against the critical press. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">President Kibaki needs to realise that political stability and a free press are mutually reinforcing. This restriction of freedom of speech, as proposed, is unbecoming for a country led by a man who came to power promising a new era of openness and transparency. Unfortunately, it seems that many senior politicians in Kenya have still not developed a sufficiently thick skin to handle the inevitable barbs of a free press and a democracy. I hope that President Kibaki will take our advice and change his mind. That would reassure us of Kenya’s purported commitment to a free society under a power-sharing coalition government. It would also strengthen Kenya’s case for moral authority and leadership in an unstable region.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the President’s pledge now to consider amendments to this bill and to consult more widely with the media. Given that Prime Minister Raila Odinga and the ODM, his party, are vigorously opposed to this legislation, it is also vital for the stability of the Government that it does not become even more of an inflammatory and divisive political issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A year ago, like many others, I was dismayed and disappointed that, after flawed presidential elections in Kenya, street demonstrations led to riots and ethnic clashes that spread across the country, killing more than a thousand people and leaving another 350 000 people homeless. Those responsible for the post-election violence a year ago must be brought to justice and a period of reconciliation and tolerance is now essential for Kenya.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is very bad news that, on Friday 2 January 2009, President Kibaki signed the Kenya Communications (Amendment) Bill 2008, which amends the Kenya Communications Act of 1998. This bill flies in the face of press freedom and disregards international conventions signed up to by the Kenyan Government. Two sections effectively introduce direct media censorship by the Government. Section 88 gives the Information Minister considerable powers to raid and dismantle broadcasting equipment from a media house that is deemed to be a threat to national security. Section 46 gives the state the power to regulate contents to be aired and published by both electronic and print media. Within Kenya, the bill has been opposed by journalists, by Prime Minister Odinga and by the ODM, and its passing highlights a serious lack of consultation within the current grand coalition. I regret the passing of this bill and urge that any revision of the media law takes account of the many, many reservations expressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I call on the Kenyan authorities to relinquish their plans to introduce censorship, to build consensus in order to foster the freedom of the press and the public communications sector. I hope that the rights of religious and ethnic minorities will be respected in Kenya. A year ago, over a thousand people died during protests linked to the elections and 350 000 people fled their homes.

It is worth stressing that the new legislation was adopted by 25 out of the 220 members of parliament. This is an utterly inconceivable situation. What is worse is that, until that point, Kenya had boasted one of the most developed and pluralistic press networks in the whole of Africa. This will change after the new legislation is implemented, which will allow special services to interfere in the activities of the media, close down editorial sections and control the printed or spoken word.

<p class="contents">Firstly because freedom of speech is a fundamental human right, as laid down in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Kenya is a signatory. Therefore, it, like other signatory countries, must not only observe its spirit, but follow it to the letter.</p>
<p class="contents">The demonstrations which took place almost a year ago after the Presidential elections in Kenya and grew into riots and ethnic conflict, in which more than 1 000 people were killed and tens of thousands were left homeless, is the strongest argument for not allowing similar events to be repeated. Therefore, the Kenyan Government and President should act together and honour their own obligations to respect freedom of the press, speech and assembly. In addition – and this is particularly important – they should fight impunity and call to account those who are responsible for the riots which took place a year ago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This freedom is among the key European values and it cannot be called into question.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘Communication Act’ of 2008 which became law in Kenya on 2 January 2009, includes some points which, in our opinion, might encroach upon media freedom. We therefore noticed with satisfaction the recent decision of President Kibaki on 7 January to revise some disputed sections of this Act. We are delighted that Mr Kibaki authorised the Minister for Information and Communications and the Attorney General to meet with media representatives in order to propose changes to this law that would eliminate these fears.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of expression and freedom of the press form part of public affairs administration in the broadest sense of the term and this, in itself, is at the centre of EU development strategy. I frankly take the view that a free and responsible press is an essential precondition for democracy and the legal state, which are integral components for sustainable development. Only on the basis of dialogue will the media and the Kenyan Government be able to develop a common understanding and build mutual respect. Thus, the European Commission looks forward with interest to the results of the various meetings which will take place in Kenya between the parties involved and it hopes that relevant parties will reach agreement on appropriate recommendations for proposals to amend the media law.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the post-election violence is concerned, the Commission welcomes the report of the investigative commission on the violence (the Waki Report). It appreciates the undertaking of the Kenyan Government to implement the report recommendations, including the establishment of a special tribunal to ensure that the people responsible for the violence will have to answer for their acts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

President Mwai Kibaki has signed a law, although he has subsequently had a change of heart, which grants the Kenyan authorities the right to carry out raids on editorial offices, tap journalists’ telephone calls and check the content of broadcasts on the grounds of ‘national security’. As if these abuses were not enough, the law also stipulates huge fines and terms of imprisonment for reporters found guilty of ‘anti-government’ practices. Although President Kibaki has ordered these provisions to be amended a week later, we are not aware as to what these ‘amendments’ envisage.</p>
<p class="contents">This law, in its initial form, is a reminder of the dark days of dictatorship, when the Kenyan press was brought to its knees. Kenya is currently a democracy and I firmly believe that no one, President Kibaki included, wants to return to those times. An attack against press freedom is an attack against democracy. The international community must continue to put pressure on the Kenyan authorities to treat civil liberties responsibly, especially press freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The European Parliament and the Council established a clear objective in the legislative package of the Seventh Research and Development Framework Programme 2007-2013 (FP7)<a href="#defann_1_1" name="refann_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, according to which particular attention is to be paid to ensure the adequate participation in the Programme of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SME).</p>
<p>Consequently this objective is at the core of the FP7 implementing measures, notably the "Cooperation" programme, which provides that a strategy should be established for SMEs for each priority theme and that the aim will be to enable at least 15% of the funding available under this programme to go to SMEs. The SMEs also benefit from a higher funding rate of 75% of eligible costs in FP7 (compared to 50% for larger companies). The collective financial responsibility that existed in FP6 was in FP7 replaced by the existence of the Guarantee Fund, which minimized financial risk for SMEs.</p>
<p>As the Honourable member is aware, the Commission is responsible for the implementation of the FP7 according to the objectives of the Programme therefore, the Commission should take all necessary measures to promote the participation of SMEs. One of such measures is the conference Research Connection 2009 organised by the Commission under the Czech Presidency in May 2009 in Prague. One part of this conference is directly dedicated to the participation of SMEs in FP7.</p>
<p>The Council would also like to draw the attention of the Honourable Parliamentarian to the important European Community initiatives in support of innovation, such as:</p>
<p>The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006<a href="#defann_1_2" name="refann_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>The lead market initiative for Europe launched by the Commission, which the Council welcomed and encouraged in its conclusions adopted on 29 May 2008<a href="#defann_1_3" name="refann_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The regional innovation cluster policy, which the Council welcomed in its conclusions of 1 December 2008 as a tool to stimulate the SME potential and integration in high technology networks<a href="#defann_1_4" name="refann_1_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, one should also point out the European Investment Bank's recent decision to mobilise EUR 30 billion to support European SMEs in the context of the European Economic Recovery Plan.</p>
<p>These elements need to be mentioned together with the research activities provided for by the FP7, given that innovative SMEs conduct research and technological development activities not falling under the FP7could develop with the help of these other innovation support schemes provided by the European Union.</p>
<p>I would like to ensure the Honourable Member, that the Czech Presidency is fully aware of the importance of small and medium enterprises (SME´s) as drivers of research, its application and innovation. According to the Presidency a special approach towards SME´s is needed in order to facilitate their participation in the FP7 – we believe that further simplification of procedures linked with participation of SME´s in all framework programmes needs to be encouraged. The Presidency will also lend full support to the European Commission in its implementation activities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The European Union is the world's largest giver of aid to the developing world, yet a BBC Panorama programme broadcast in late November 2008 highlighted how this aid is too often misspent, inefficiently used, or fails to reach its target population. Among the many issues highlighted was the inefficiency of aid spent in the education sector, where money is spent on buildings rather than on training and wages, with the result that teaching standards can be low. There are often high levels of teacher-absenteeism as teachers are forced to work in multiple jobs to get by. Such trends could very easily lead to a very worrying and frankly unacceptable situation where the MDG 2 of universal primary education is superficially achieved, but with the education being of such a low standard as to be of little merit or value in changing the lives of the children involved.

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council recalls that it is the responsibility of the Commission to programme the use of financial resources and support the management of Community aid, and the European Development Fund (EDF).</p>
<p>The Council would like to draw the attention on the two dimensions of the aid, i.e. (1) the specific provisions intended to monitor the delivery of aid and (2) the initiatives designed to improve the effectiveness of aid. On both aspects, the Council is and will continue to be vigilant and active.</p>
<p>1.	Monitoring of aid delivery</p>
<p>All EC development cooperation instruments contain specific provisions intended to protect the EC's financial interests. The Commission and the Court of Auditors are entitled to perform audits, including document audits or on the spot audits of any contractor or subcontractor who has received Community funds.</p>
<p>Both the Council and the European Parliament have the possibility to assess the way in which EC external assistance has been implemented on a yearly basis through the Annual Report on the EC's Development and External Assistance Policies and their implementation that the Commission usually presents towards the end of June.</p>
<p>This being said, the Council believes that the proper management and implementation of development aid is not just the donor's responsibility: the principles of ownership, good governance and mutual accountability must apply, and in this regard our eligible partners are also co-responsible. In its Conclusions of 27 May 2008, the Council reaffirmed the importance of implementing strengthened mutual accountability mechanisms at the country, regional and international level for ensuring more equal partnerships.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission set up in July 2008 an Internet website offering comprehensive information on the management and implementation of all EC external cooperation programmes. It is managed by Europe Aid and is accessible to the wider public.</p>
<p>2.	Aid effectiveness</p>
<p>The EU is firmly committed through both the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness of March 2005<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the EU Consensus on Development of November 2005<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> to deliver more and better aid. In particular, the EU is committed to promote better donor coordination and complementarity by working towards joint multiannual programming, based on partner countries’ poverty reduction or equivalent strategies and country’s own budget processes, common implementation mechanisms including shared analysis, joint donor wide missions, and the use of co-financing arrangements.</p>
<p>Complementarity of donor activities is of paramount importance for increasing aid effectiveness, and thus for a more effective and efficient development assistance. In this sense, the Council and the Member States adopted in May 2007 an EU Code of Conduct on Complementarity and Division of Labour in Development Policy<a href="#defann_2_3" name="refann_2_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Finally, the Ministerial Declaration adopted in September 2008 after the third high level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (i.e. the Accra Agenda for Action) provides for a very ambitious approach of the EU and wanted strong, precise and measurable commitments as well as a timetable for implementation</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>With regard to the Spring European Council and the EU strategy for growth and jobs, the Czech Presidency will indeed put the European Union's competitiveness agenda on top of its priorities, as it is well aware that the current economic downturn requires the EU to act, and to do so with strength and resolve. A significant economic slowdown underlines the importance of the Lisbon Strategy as a set of instruments to strengthen economic growth and resistance of economies to internal and external shocks. Therefore, the March Competitiveness Council will be dominated by the adoption of the Key Issues Paper<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of the Competitiveness Council to the Spring European Council 2009, which will be all about growth and jobs. The rest of the Presidency will be dedicated as a priority to implementing the European Economic Recovery Plan<a href="#defann_3_2" name="refann_3_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and to fulfil such new European Council mandates as the European Innovation Plan.</p>
<p>The Presidency's intention is already quite clear from the motto it has chosen for its term, i.e. "Europe without Barriers", which is much more than a political catchword. In fact, it includes an ambitious programme to work towards effective strengthening of the single market and the knowledge triangle including research, education and innovation in order to preserve and stimulate growth and job creation, while keeping in mind necessity of administrative burden's reduction and simplification of legislation</p>
<p>The fifth anniversary of the most extensive EU enlargement creates an opportunity for an evaluation of its costs and benefits for all Member States. The Czech Presidency, in cooperation with European Commission and the OECD, will present a study that will identify remaining barriers in the internal market and will discuss it at the international conference "5 Years After’, to be held in March 2009.</p>
<p>In this framework, the Czech Presidency intends to focus its activities and mobilise Member States on the following six major issues:</p>
<p>- A fully-functioning single market without barriers.</p>
<p>- Promoting seamless interaction within the knowledge triangle.</p>
<p>- Better regulation, focussing on a reduction of administrative burden</p>
<p>- Strengthening the backbone of European industry: support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs)</p>
<p>- Speed up the economic reform process in order to achieve a sharper focus on competitiveness and innovation</p>
<p>- Stepping up and improving investment in knowledge, research and innovation</p>
<p>These activities cover a short-term, a medium-term and a long-term perspective on Europe's competitiveness. In other words, we need to act now while thinking ahead. With this in mind, the Czech Presidency intends to centre discussions amongst Member States on these issues of the competitiveness agenda, and it firmly believes that a clear message on them should be sent to the heads of state and government leaders who will gather in March 2009 to discuss, among other subjects, the EU's economic situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The fight against trafficking in human beings is among one of the present greatest challenges not only in the EU but word-wide as well. Trafficking in human beings is one of the most serious forms of organised crime and, due to the huge profits made by offenders through such activities, it is one of the most profitable forms of crime. As trafficking in human beings takes a range of forms, the measures adopted against it must be equally broad and comprehensive.</p>
<p>In its Legislative and Work Programme 2009<a href="#defann_5_2" name="refann_5_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> under "Organised Crime Package: helping the victims", the Commission announced the submission to the Council of a legislative proposal for up-dating the Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA on combating trafficking in human beings<a href="#defann_5_3" name="refann_5_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Therefore it is firstly for the Commission to examine the possibility and the necessity of further harmonisation concerning such criminal law provisions. It is the intention of the Czech Presidency to initiate rapidly thereafter the discussions in the framework of the Council on such a proposal.</p>
<p>In the area of combating trafficking in human beings, the Czech Presidency intends to contribute mainly to the introduction of best practices with regard to the harmonisation of data collection. An expert Conference, titled "Joint Analysis, Joint Action" is scheduled in Prague on 30-31 March 2009. Among other topics, the conference will aim in particular at exploring possibilities for the creation of a network of national rapporteurs on trafficking in human beings in the European Union, as well as at the issue of protection of vulnerable victims and their position within criminal proceedings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In addressing the question of work performed within the context of the family, and especially the recognition of that work, and its implications for the family, the Honourable Member has raised a highly important issue.</p>
<p>As you know, the European Parliament and the Council can only act in a legislative capacity on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. I would like to recall that the Commission has indeed recently tabled a proposal that addresses the concerns expressed by the Honourable Member. I refer to the proposal for a new Directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity and repealing Directive 86/613/EEC<a href="#defann_6_1" name="refann_6_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The proposal aims at improving the social protection of self-employed workers, with a view to removing disincentives to female entrepreneurship. It also seeks to improve the social protection of "assisting spouses", who often work in the self-employed sector without enjoying the corresponding rights. As the Honourable Member knows, the vast majority of such “assisting spouses” are women, and many of them work in the agricultural sector. The Commission's proposal aims also at enhancing the recognition of such self-employment within the family. By providing for maternity leave rights to be granted to “assisting spouses” who wish to have them, the proposal also seeks to redress the sometimes problematic implications that informal employment within family businesses can have for the family itself, especially when “assisting spouses” have children.</p>
<p>Turning to the broader implications of unrecognised work by “assisting spouses” in the long term, I would also like to assure the Honourable Member that the Council is aware of the particularly difficult situation faced by unsalaried women who depend on their husbands for their income and whose financial situation is often precarious when they retire, or if they divorce or are widowed. The Council expressed its concern with regard to this issue in December 2007, when it adopted a set of Conclusions on "Women and Poverty", including a set of statistical indicators developed by the Portuguese Presidency in the context of the Beijing Platform for Action<a href="#defann_6_2" name="refann_6_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. In these Conclusions, the Council recognised that women were more vulnerable to income poverty than men and that the gender gap increased with age.</p>
<p>More recently, in December 2008, the Council adopted a set of Conclusions on "Women and the Economy: the Reconciliation of Work and Family Life", once again in the context of the follow-up to the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action<a href="#defann_6_3" name="refann_6_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Here, too, the Council reaffirmed the importance of measures allowing women and men to reconcile their work and family responsibilities, and called for appropriate policies.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Council is actively addressing the concerns that the Honourable Member has raised with respect to self-employment within a family context. The Czech Presidency will continue with discussions on the above-mentioned legislative initiative and in this respect will follow development in the European Parliament.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council shares Parliament's concerns in relation to the high number of road fatalities every year on European roads and the difficulty in punishing traffic offences committed by non-resident drivers.</p>
<p>The Council would like to point out that in September 2008, the French Presidency of the Council organised a seminar on the European coordination of road safety campaigns. During this seminar, possibilities were explored for making action on road safety more effective. As a follow-up to the conference, the Council adopted on 27/28 November 2008 conclusions on the coordination of police action on road safety. These conclusions aim to put in place a Europe-wide process of coordination of police forces involved in road safety. The Council also affirmed its determination to launch the necessary initiatives to improve strategic and operational cooperation to improve road safety on the basis of what already exists.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Council recalls its Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This Framework Decision covers financial penalties imposed in respect of road traffic offences. The national legislation enacted in line with the Framework Decision should enable judicial authorities and, in certain cases, also administrative authorities to transmit a financial penalty to authorities in other Member States and have that penalty recognised and executed without any further formality.</p>
<p>The Council also recalls its Decision 2008/615/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation<a href="#defann_7_2" name="refann_7_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime. This so-called "Prüm Decision" provides for cross-border co-operation in matters covered by Title VI of the EU Treaty, and inter alia facilitates the exchange of vehicle registration data between Member States.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council would point to the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety of 19 March 2008. This proposal aims at improving road safety in the European Union by foreseeing the cross-border enforcement of sanctions for four road traffic offences, which provoke the largest percentage of deaths, namely speeding, drink-driving, non-use of a seat belt and failing to stop at a red traffic light, committed with vehicles registered in Member States other than the State of the offence. This proposal has been examined by the Council.</p>
<p>It is true that a large majority of its members is not convinced that the legal case proposed for adoption of these measures allows the Community to do so, it cannot be inferred from this position that the Council would be unwilling to support other proposals for new legislation that may be submitted to it. Indeed, the legitimacy of the objective of ensuring cross border enforcement of traffic offences has not been questioned as such by Council members.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The idea of setting up a European coastguard was put forward by the European Parliament and the Council in Article 11 of Directive 2005/35/EC on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In that Directive the Commission was asked to submit a feasibility study on a European coastguard dedicated to pollution prevention and response. That study has not so far been submitted. The question of whether a European coastguard should be set up is also one of the issues raised in the Commission Green Paper of June 2006 on an EU maritime policy<a href="#defann_8_2" name="refann_8_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As regards border controls and combating illegal immigration, the “Hague Programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union”<a href="#defann_8_3" name="refann_8_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, approved by the European Council at its meeting on 5 November 2004, raises the possibility of creating a "European system of border guards". This idea was taken up in the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum<a href="#defann_8_4" name="refann_8_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, adopted by the European Council on 15 and 16 October 2008, which states that ultimately the setting up of such a system may be examined.</p>
<p>It is a matter of fact that threats need to be addressed with appropriate measures and this concerns sea, land as well as air borders. Frontex plays a significant role in the management of operational cooperation of the Member States at the external borders and is still in a phase of developing the use of tools available based on the current mandate.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Article 62, point (2)(a) of the EC Treaty limits Community competence to the adoption of standards and procedures to be followed by Member States in carrying out checks on persons at external borders, which implies that responsibility for carrying out such checks lies with the Member States.</p>
<p>To date, no Commission proposal, either on the setting up of a European coastguard or on a European system of border guards, has been received by the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Furthermore, it should be noted that in this regard a démarche by the local EU Troika had been carried out on 3 December 2008 at the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Minsk. On this occasion the importance of the continuation of these visits was stressed and had been received in constructive spirit by the Belarusian authorities.</p>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In July 1999, the Council adopted Directive 1999/74/EC on minimum standards for the protection of laying hens. The Directive provides that as from 1 January 2012, rearing of laying hens is no longer permitted in the EU in cages that do not meet the minimum welfare requirements set out in the Directive.</p>
<p>With stakeholders' concerns in mind, the Directive had mandated the Commission to submit to the Council a report, drawn up on the basis of a scientific opinion which takes into account the physiological, ethological, health and environmental aspects of various breeding systems of laying hens, and on a study of their socio-economic implications and their effects on the Community's economic partners. The report was to be accompanied by appropriate proposals taking into account the conclusions of the report and the outcome of the World Trade Organisation negotiations.</p>
<p>The report in question was submitted by the Commission to the Council in January 2008, together with a Commission Working Document citing the sources used. It was drawn up taking into account, inter alia, a socio-economic study containing Member States reports.</p>
<p>Based on this report, the Commission confirmed to the Council its intention not to propose any deferment of the date foreseen for the prohibition of conventional cages, nor any other appropriate proposals.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 249 of the EC Treaty, Directive 1999/74/EC is binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member certainly knows, the Accession Treaty with Bulgaria and Romania provides for a transitional period of up to seven years regarding the freedom of movement for workers. During this period, the EU-25 Member States may apply national measures regulating access to their labour markets by nationals of the new Member States.</p>
<p>The initial transitional period of two years from accession indeed expired on 31 December 2008. The Council is now called upon to review any transitional restrictions on the basis of a report from the Commission. The Council took note of the Commission's presentation of its report on 17 December 2008. The Report will be again on the agenda of the next Meeting of the EPSCO Council in March 2009. The Czech Presidency put the removal of any barriers in the Internal Market of the Union, including the barriers to free movement of workers, as one of its main political priorities with the objective of thorough political debate at various levels, for example at the Informal meeting of employment ministers in the Czech Republic, and encouraging Member States to remove barriers to mobility and free movement of workers where they prove useless and unsubstantiated. The Council will promote various measures which facilitate mobility and free movement of workers throughout the European Union.</p>
<p>However, national measures may continue to be applied until the fifth year after accession and may be prolonged for another two years in those Member States where would be serious disturbances on the labour markets.</p>
<p>In any event, it should be underlined that, according to the Accession Treaty, the decision on whether to continue applying national measures, as well as the nature of these measures, is a matter of national competence. However, such a decision should only be taken after serious reflection by the Member States concerned on the basis of an objective assessment of the situation on the ground.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1002"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The motto of the Czech Presidency is Europe without barriers. Dismantling barriers is our aim not only in terms of internal, but also external policies. The EU exists in a world of relations and contingencies and as such it has never been a solitary player in the field of trade policies. The internal objectives of the EU, be it employment, high standard of living, development or security, are linked to a large extent to the capacity of European economic players to assert themselves beyond the borders of the EU itself. The Czech Presidency is aware of this fact and will actively contribute to the opening of more markets to products, services and investments from the EU - free trade is one of the tools for solving the contemporary crisis.</p>
<p>On 15 November, the members of the G20 emphasised the importance of reaching an "agreement on modalities that leads to a successful conclusion to the WTO’s Doha Development Agenda with an ambitious and balanced outcome this year ". In this context, the Council was briefed by the Commission on 8 December on the latest developments at the World Trade Organisation concerning the trade negotiations of the Doha Development Agenda, with a view to a possible ministerial meeting in Geneva by the end of December.</p>
<p>On 11-12 December 2008, the European Council in its conclusions indicated that it endorses the objective of arriving this year, within the World Trade Organisation, at an agreement on the modalities leading to the conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda with an ambitious, global and balanced result.</p>
<p>In this sense, the Commission and the Council were ready for an EU constructive participation at a Ministerial meeting if and when convened. However on 12 December 2008, the WTO Director General, at an informal meeting of heads of delegations, indicated that in the absence of "dramatic changes in the following 48 hours", he would not convene ministers to finalize modalities by the end of the year. On that occasion, he said that after a week of intensive consultations, he had not detected the sufficient political drive for a final push towards agreement and considered that holding such a meeting would have a high risk of failure which could have damaged not only the Round but also the WTO system as a whole, and so the Ministerial meeting took not place.</p>
<p>The European Union continues to stay fully committed to the multilateral trade system as well as to the conclusion of a balanced, ambitious and comprehensive agreement of the WTO Doha Development Round, especially in the present economic and financial circumstances. For the Czech Presidency the DDA is a tool for achieving transparent liberalisation of trade on the multilateral level, which will bring about long-term advantages. The Presidency will strive to renew discussion as soon as possible and will also support more intense negotiations within the framework of other WTO agendas, in particular in the services and TRIPS area. The Presidency supports the most extensive application of the multilateral trade system possible. For these reasons it will continue the process of the extension of the WTO membership base.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1009"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council strongly considers that discriminations based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation are incompatible with the principles upon which the EU is founded. The EU institutions have repeatedly rejected and condemned all manifestations of such discriminations.</p>
<p>The EU, within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the Treaties, determinedly pursues a clear policy of fighting these phenomena, both within its borders and in the context of its external action around 80 countries worldwide still criminalise homosexuality.</p>
<p>Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides a legal base on which to develop "appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation". Using these powers, the EU unanimously adopted the Racial Equality Directive in June 2000 (2000/43/EC)<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the Employment Framework Directive in November 2000 (2000/78/EC)<a href="#defann_14_2" name="refann_14_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the external relations context, the EU is actively engaged in efforts within the United Nations to tackle racism and discrimination, including discrimination based on sexual orientation. In this regard, the EU has fully and successfully supported in 2006 Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender (LGBT) rights groups to have UN consultative status in the NGO Committee of the UN ECOSOC. In addition, the declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity was presented in the General Assembly on December 18, 2008 on behalf of the (so far) 66 states as a part of the debate of the General Assembly agenda item 64b "Human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms". The declaration reaffirms the principles of universality and non discrimination (among other things) and "urge(s) States to take all the necessary measures, in particular legislative or administrative, to ensure that sexual orientation or gender identity may under no circumstances be the basis for criminal penalties, in particular executions, arrests or detention."</p>
<p>The EU has incorporated racism, xenophobia and discrimination issues in its political dialogues with third countries and constantly promotes the principle of non-discrimination which requires that human rights apply equally to every human being regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>
<p>Concerning applications for asylum, the Council Directive 2004/83/EC on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted introduces the concept of persecution ground based on the membership to a particular social group. According to its Article 10 (d), a particular social group might include a group based on a common characteristic of sexual orientation. Member States shall take this element into account when assessing the reasons for persecution in the context of the decision to be taken concerning an application for international protection.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to recent reports appearing in Spain, a official document has come to light which states that in January 2002 senior Spanish government figures were informed by the political-military attaché of the US embassy that his country wished to use Spanish airspace and airports for purposes of transporting 'prisoners' to the Guantánamo military base. Also requested was the use if necessary of Spanish military bases for transport back-up. The document, which until now was secret, states that the same procedure was being followed with other countries on the American planes' route, including Italy and Portugal. On accepting this request the Member States concerned appear to have been informed that the US was going to use their airspace to transport illegally held prisoners to Guantánamo.

<p>As far as Official Development Assistance (ODA) is concerned, in the Council Conclusions adopted in May 2008<a href="#defann_16_1" name="refann_16_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the EU strongly reaffirmed its long-term financial commitment with developing countries to achieve a collective ODA target of 0,56% GNI by 2010 and 0.7% GNI by 2015, as set out in the May 2005 Council Conclusions, the June 2005 European Council Conclusions and the European Consensus on Development in November the 22nd 2005.</p>
<p>In the context of Council Conclusions of May 2005<a href="#defann_16_2" name="refann_16_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, in particular, it was specified that Member States which had joined the EU after 2002 and that had not reached a level of 0,17% ODA/GNI would strive to increase their ODA to reach, within their respective budget allocation processes, that level by 2010, while those that were already above that level undertook to sustain their efforts. Moreover, EU Member States undertook to achieve the 0.7% ODA/ GNI target by 2015 whilst those which had achieved that target committed themselves to remain above that target; Member States which had joined the EU after 2002 will strive to increase by 2015 their ODA/GNI to 0.33%.</p>
<p>The commitment of the Czech Republic should refer to the context of the collective ODA target which the EU undertook in order to achieve the targets as has already been reaffirmed at several occasions.</p>
<p>In its recent Conclusions adopted on 11 November 2008<a href="#defann_16_3" name="refann_16_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Council, underlining that this issue falls within the competence of Member States, encouraged Member States concerned to work on national timetables, by the end of 2010, to increase aid levels within their respective budget allocation processes, towards achieving the established ODA targets.</p>
<p>We find of substantial importance that the essential tools and modalities of financing should aim at emphasizing the inevitability of aid effectiveness taking into account of the role of trade and the WTO in the development as well as the importance of the Aid for Trade Program. The responsibility for sound development policies of our partners in their respective countries in light with our accountability to tax payers for resources provided is vital both for the donors and receiving countries. These issues have been broadly discussed at the international forums. The recent ones in New York and at the HLF in Accra as well as the Doha Conference have stressed that discussions on strengthening of FfD follow-up mechanism will be initiated at the spring conference of the ECOSOC in April 2009. We believe that different modalities of the ODA should be considered as an effective way and thus consequently enable all actors become beneficiaries of the ODA commitments.</p>
<p>The actions of the Czech Presidency are and will be in accordance with the previously mentioned Council Conclusions. Similarly as a number of EU Member States, the Czech Presidency will strive to increase its ODA to the level of 0,17% by 2010 and to the level of 0,33% by 2015. In the current situation of global financial crisis we do not expect any substantive increase of our ODA.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council follows up closely the human rights situation in Tanzania and has noted with great concern the deteriorating situation of Albinos in the country. In line with its human rights policy, the Council will raise the issue with the Tanzanian authorities, calling for further action to put an end to the phenomenon and for justice to the victims and their families.</p>
<p>In Tanzania Albinos have traditionally been victims of discrimination. In some regions, getting an Albino child was long perceived to be a curse for the entire community, and quite a number of them were killed at birth. However, the problem has recently taken another dimension and gruesome Albinos' murders now occurring are driven by sheer lure of money, killers taking advantage of poverty, despair and strong belief in witchcraft.</p>
<p>The Government of Tanzania has already taken some measures in order to put an end to these crimes and President Kikwete has instructed the regional commissioners to that effect.</p>
<p>Measures include improved security and protection of Albinos in Mwanza region and awareness raising. Among others Albino schoolchildren whose lives were threatened have been transferred to a special school in Misungwi district and other boarding schools in the region which are guarded by police force. A census of Albinos is on its way.</p>
<p>At the same time NGOs are actively involved in the field of awareness raising. In many concerned villages people have been sensitized against the killings of Albinos. All households with Albinos have been visited separately to sensitize them and to encourage them to report any suspected person to the police.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to closely monitor the situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1021"></a>

<p>The Czech Presidency confirms its commitment to tackle the crucial challenge represented by the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. The efforts made so far have not been sufficient to stem the worldwide expansion of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, aggravated by poverty and social, economic and gender inequalities.</p>
<p>In this respect, the Council would like to recall its conclusions "Combating HIV/AIDS within the European Union and its neighbouring countries" adopted on 31 May 2007 as well as conclusions on combating HIV/AIDS adopted on 3 June 2005.</p>
<p>In particular, in its conclusions from 2007, the Council underlined the need for an integrated and coordinated focus on HIV/AIDS prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care and support, based on the promotion of human rights both of people with HIV and vulnerable groups of the population. The Council invited the Member States, among others, to promote appropriate screening and treatment methods to reduce as far as possible mother-to-child transmission of HIV and to promote universal access to evidence-based prevention and comprehensive harm reduction as the central part of a successful response to alleviating the impact of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>The CZ Presidency will promote this work, building on what has been achieved, so that the EU remain the world leader in respecting the commitment to put an end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1027"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Energy belongs to one of the three main political priorities of the Czech Presidency. It is generally recognised that in the implementation of the European Council Action Plan (2007-2009), as agreed by the Spring 2007 European Council, an emphasis should be placed on energy security. This is where the Czech Presidency will concentrate its efforts to further and strengthen the EU Energy Policy. The recent interruption of gas import from Russia and transit via Ukraine have highlighted the weight of this issue on the EU agenda.</p>
<p>Regarding the imports of gas into the European Union, the Council recalls the aim stated in that Action Plan, namely to enhance security of supply through effective diversification of energy sources, suppliers and transport routes. The Czech Presidency has reiterated the need to reinforce confidence vis-à-vis existing suppliers, but at the same time to intensify cooperation with other complementary suppliers at the informal General Affairs Council, which took place in Prague on 8 January 2009. Energy security was one of three main topics of this informal meeting of Ministers of European Affairs and Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>In February 2009, according to the Presidency's calendar, the Council is scheduled to adopt conclusions on the Communication "Second Strategic Energy Review – an EU energy security and solidarity action plan", which the Commission presented in November 2008. In the larger context of intra-EU energy security, this communication mentions the Baltic Interconnection Plan, along with the Southern gas corridor. These Council conclusions and the Communication itself will be submitted to the Spring 2009 European Council.</p>
<p>The Czech Presidency furthermore intends to signal the interest of the Community to gas producers and transit countries in the Caucasus region and in Central Asia at the “Southern Corridor Summit – East West Link”, which will be held during its Presidency. The summit, the preparation of which is being pursued by the Presidency in close cooperation with the Commission and Member States, will be held at the heads of states level with the aim to launch a stable cooperation with countries of the region.</p>
<p>The diversification of gas resources will be improved by the construction of the LNG terminals too.</p>
<p>But this is a timely, financially and energetically demanding variant.</p>
<p>Apart from decreasing the dependence on gas imports, the repeated dispute between Russia and Ukraine over gas, which has held EU hostage to an unprecedented extent, has highlighted the importance of strengthening solidarity of all Member States in case of disruptions of supplies. This issue belonged to the topics of the extraordinary Energy Council convened by the Czech Presidency on 12 January 2009. Possible measures include revision of the Directive 2004/67/EC concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply, which is currently the main legislative tool for implementing energy solidarity, investment into interconnections of energy infrastructure (so as to technically enable Member States to assist each other in need) or introduction of a transparency mechanism for sharing information in the field of energy between Member States (including contacts with third-country partners or planned investment into infrastructure projects).</p>
<p>As regards the Council's position on the Nabucco project and its effect on the export of gas to the European Union, the Council refers the Honourable Parliamentarian to its replies to Oral Question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0590_EN.html">H-0590/07</a> on that subject.</p>
<p>As regards the Council's position on the Nord Stream gas pipeline project, the Council refers the Honourable Parliamentarian to its replies to Oral Questions <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0121_EN.html">H-0121/07</a> and <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0575_EN.html">H-575/07</a> on that subject.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1028"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the January 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The question put by the Honourable Member refers especially to the effects of the application of Council Regulation n°343/2003/EC establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (Dublin II Regulation). Art 28 of the said Regulation provides for the submission of a report by the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council on its application, as well as of proposals for the necessary amendments, where appropriate. Accordingly, the Commission has presented in December 2008 a proposal intended to recast the Dublin Regulation. The aim of this proposal is mainly to strengthen the asylum seekers´ set of rights and guarantees that fall under the scope of the Dublin II regulation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission is expected to submit a proposal intended to recast asylum directives which will focus on improving the minimum standards that were adopted so far and which will aim at further building the common European asylum system. Great emphasis should be put on the initial stage of the asylum procedure, i.e. access to the procedure as such. The first proposals have already been published in December 2008 – proposal to recast reception conditions directive, Dublin II and Eurodac regulations. In spring 2009 proposals to amend qualification and procedural directives are expected. These ones also aim at strengthening the status of asylum seekers. It should be noted however that all EU Member States are bound by minimum standards on reception conditions for asylum seekers set out in Directive 2003/9/EC.</p>
<p>For both proposals, which will be considered by the Council in 2009, codecision procedure applies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In late November, the Peruvian Government arrested 14 leading members of the Communist Party and the opposition, including a candidate for president in the last elections, Ollanta Humala.

The Commission is committed to promoting the principle of prevention in the development of the strategic guidelines for each type of crime. Much progress has been made since 2006 in the creation of the EU action plan on statistics on crime and criminal justice. Indicators established by a group of experts can be used in the medium term to compare the data from the Member States.</p>
<p>Due to the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility for preventing and fighting urban crime falls on the Member States and/or the regional and local authorities.

<p>(FR) The four Funds in the general ‘Solidarity and management of migration flows’ programme, namely, the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals, the European Refugee Fund, the External Borders Fund and the European Return Fund, have just been launched. The total value of the Funds is EUR 4.02 billion for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>To date, the vast majority of the programmes from those States participating in the Funds have been adopted by the Commission. For the Return Fund, for which credits only became available in November 2008, it is expected that the process of adopting the last programmes will be completed in the first quarter of 2009. At the end of this process, the Commission will have committed EUR 580 million to the launch of these four Funds. In 2008, three Member States also benefited from extra support to the value of EUR 10 million in the framework of the emergency measures in the European Refugee Fund: these countries are Greece, Italy and Malta.</p>
<p>The payment of sums to Member States for the financing of actions for the initial years of the programme is currently under way.</p>
<p>The launch of these Funds has required a major effort from the Commission and from national governments. This demonstrates the European Union’s commitment to putting the solidarity principle into practice in the management of migration flows.</p>
<p>The Commission attaches particular importance to involving regional and local authorities, as well non-governmental organisations, in the implementation of the Funds. In fact, the Commission invited the Member States to organise a partnership with the authorities and bodies participating in the programmes and with others who could make a useful contribution to their development. These partnerships could include all competent public authorities, especially regional, local and municipal authorities, as well as international bodies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) representing civil society. The constitution of the partnerships is the responsibility of each Member State and depends, among other things, on the characteristics of each Fund. In this framework, many NGOs should see, for example, their projects cofinanced by the European Union from the Integration Fund, the Return Fund and the European Refugee Fund.	</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0986"></a>

<p>(EN) The Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre – Narcotics (MAOC-N) is a law enforcement supported military intergovernmental organisation set up by means of a Treaty signed on 30 September 2007 in Lisbon by seven EU Member States (UK, F, I, ES, PT, IRL, NL), MAOC undertakes high sea interdiction operations, by coordinating the exchange of actionable (maritime and aviation) intelligence, available assets and trained personnel to respond to the threat posed by trans-Atlantic drug trafficking.</p>
<p>The aim of the collection, exchange and analysis of information is to optimise the use of the naval and aerial assets of those Member States that are the contracting parties to this Treaty. Its operational area as defined by the contracting parties themselves comprises the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to the Cape of Good Hope, including European and West African seaboards.</p>
<p>Since January 2008 the Commission has the observer status, as has the United States (US) Joint Inter Agency Task Force – South (JIATF-S) based in Key West (USA) to which some EU MS take part due to its regional (Caribbean dimension) which covers some Member States' territories, notably some included under Chapter IV of the TEC), and Canada. Brazil has shown interest in becoming an observer too.</p>
<p>The Commission is co-financing MAOC-N activities, namely € 661.000 via the Directorate General JLS<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> ISEC budget line<a href="#defann_26_2" name="refann_26_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, as a part of the Prevention of and Fight against Crime Programme, to cover staff and equipment costs until September 2010.</p>
<p>As not all EU Member States are parties to MAOC-N it is important that its initiatives are neither overlapping, nor contradicting potential initiatives to be taken at EU level or by any EU Member States not party to MAOC-N. Therefore Europol is tasked to closely monitor the activities of this regional maritime law enforcement organisation, by participating in the MAOC-N Executive Board meetings which took place so far, as well as by appointing a liaison officer from January 2009.</p>
<p>The Commission considers Europol to be the suitable body of an EU based law enforcement cooperation, namely for intelligence exchange, to ensure coherence and interoperability and avoiding possible duplications of mandates, tasks and expenses.</p>
<p>Against this background therefore Commission (i) supports coherence of maritime law enforcement efforts with other maritime regional initiatives and (ii) closely monitors interactions with the extensive Community acquis in the maritime safety, security and environmental domains and foster potential cooperation with other actors notably European bodies such as Frontex and EMSA<a href="#defann_26_3" name="refann_26_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> that have to conform with different specific rules.</p>
<p>In 2009 a pilot project will start that aims to test solutions for a more effective sharing of maritime surveillance information amongst maritime authorities in the Mediterranean and Atlantic approaches and a preparatory action will determine the effectiveness of space-based receivers for picking up AIS identification signals far from the coast.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Through the ‘Aeneas’ programme and its successor, the ‘Migration’ thematic programme, the Commission is already supporting several projects in this field aimed particularly at helping unaccompanied minors of Moroccan origin who have arrived in Spain and which, as far as possible, support their re-integration in their country of origin and prevent the departure of more illegal migrant minors. In addition, new initiatives in Morocco, Algeria and Senegal have been selected for financing in 2009.</p>
<p>It is evident, however, that more attention should be given to the issue of unaccompanied minors. This will be one of the priorities in the next call for proposals for the migration and asylum thematic programme (first half of 2009). In addition, this issue will appear in the migration clauses in EU agreements with third countries and on the agenda for policy dialogues with third countries. Finally, where appropriate, the situation of minors could be the subject of specific offers of cooperation in the framework of mobility partnerships.</p>
<p>As for future proposals in this field, it should be remembered that in Autumn 2009 the European Council will adopt a new five-year programme in the area of Justice, Freedom and Security, which will succeed the Hague Programme (‘Stockholm programme’). Any new policy or measure should be proposed and discussed in the framework of the preparation of this new programme.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In March 2009 the High-Level Segment of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) of the United Nations (UN) will finalise its review on the 1998 United Nations General Assembly Special Session Declarations on the World Drugs Problem, usually known as United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) 98<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, by the adoption of a new Political Declaration.</p>
<p>In preparation to the UNGASS 2008 review, the Commission has been active in supporting the process, i.a. by providing funding for UN expert groups that provided advice to UNODC<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the implementation of the 1998 Declarations. Furthermore, the Commission has actively contributed to the EU Position Paper on the UNGASS review process that was adopted by the Council in October 2008<a href="#defann_29_3" name="refann_29_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Within this UN framework, the Commission has – with the exception of the field of drug precursors – no competence to represent the European Union and its Member States. The latter represent themselves while the European Union is coordinated by the EU Presidency whose object is to present as many common EU positions as possible. The above mentioned EU position paper on the UNGASS represent such a common position</p>
<p>In this paper, the EU Member States conclude that although progress has been made in several areas of the implementation of the 1998 Declarations and attached Action Plans, there has been no containment or major reduction of the global drugs problem, which was the major target of the 1998 Political Declaration.</p>
<p>The position paper reconfirms the EU's commitment to the UN Drug Conventions from 1961, 1971 and 1988, while it reiterates the aims and objectives of the 1998 Declarations. At the same time, it calls for a serious assessment of experiences gained in the past decade and to incorporate lessons learnt. The paper also presents a number of key principles for future declarations and action plans, including:</p>
<p>Strengthening the balanced approach in UN drug policy, by enhancing drug demand reduction efforts and by recognising harm reduction as an effective and important element in drug policy.</p>
<p>Raising attention for the respect of human rights and proportionality in law enforcement interventions in drug policy and interventions in demand and supply reduction.</p>
<p>Strongly advocating sustainable alternative development, while not making this conditional on the prior eradication of drug crops.</p>
<p>A stronger emphasis on the need for evaluation, data collection and monitoring, to base policies on evidence (rather than ideology).</p>
<p>In early 2009, the Commission will furthermore publish the results of a broad study containing a 'Detailed analysis of the operation of the world market in illicit drugs and of policy measures to curtail it'. This study is one example of the Commission's contribution to the knowledge base that underpins European and international drug policies. Last September 2008, the Commission also introduced further proposals for action in the framework of the EU Drugs Action Plan (2009-2012), with specific emphasis on shared monitoring, data collection and evaluation in the field of drug supply reduction and law enforcement, areas in which little analysis has been done, or at least published.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Information transmitted by Member States early in 2008 indicates a positive trend concerning international cooperation in the fight against trafficking in human beings. In particular Member States, more than in the past, are ready to use Europol and Eurojust resources in order to improve the quality of the institutional response to trafficking.</p>
<p>In respect of the submission by the Member States of information and data to Europol, Analytical Work File (AWF) Phoenix was opened in June 2007 with a focus on trafficking. 22 Member States have signalled their support for this work file and the Analytical Work File is currently supporting a number of diverse investigations on trafficking for sexual exploitation, labour exploitation and child trafficking. Since September 2007, when Analytical Work File Phoenix became active, Member States have forwarded 131 intelligence contributions to the work file.</p>
<p>Beside these contributions, there have been 127 Member States contributions to the Europol Information System (EIS) on trafficking cases since the Information System went live in April 2006.</p>
<p>Regarding the role of Eurojust, 78 new cases of trafficking in human beings have been recorded in 2008. The trend shows a substantial increase, since 13 cases were recorded in 2004 and 33 in 2006.

<p>The Greek Government has recently drafted a law regulating matters concerning nationality and immigration policy in relation to children. Children of immigrants, who were born in Greece, have reached the age of 18 and whose parents are legally resident in the country, may, under certain conditions, acquire the status of 'long-term resident immigrant' but not Greek nationality. The draft law does not take account of the case of children who were not born in Greece but are growing up there and studying at Greek schools or of similar cases of children whose parents are not legally resident in the country. The European Union is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, while the Commission has also stressed in a communication (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2006&amp;nu_doc=0367">COM(2006)0367</a>) that 'Another challenge is to ensure that the rights of children as immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees are fully respected in the EU and in Member States' legislation and policies.'</p>

<p>(FR) Greece has exclusive competence in determining the conditions in which a citizen of a third country can acquire Greek nationality. This question is not covered by Community law.</p>
<p>As for the common policy on immigration, one of the main requirements of Directive 2003/109 for the status of long-term resident is to have five years’ legal residency. The question refers to the situation of children of parents without legal residency. Pursuant to Directive 2003/109, these children are not automatically excluded from long-term resident status. This status may, in principle, be acquired by a minor under the age of 18 independently of its parents, where all the conditions set out in the directive are met. In addition, the conditions set out in the directive to benefit from the status of long-term resident are comprehensive. As there is no obligation to be born on the territory of a Member State, the introduction of such a condition by Greece would seem to be contrary to the directive. The Commission will therefore contact the Greek authorities for more information on these two issues.</p>
<p>As for children’s rights, the Member States should respect fundamental rights as arising from the constitutional traditions of the Member States and from their international obligations. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the United Nations in 1989 and ratified by all the Member States of the EU, obliges signatory states, for every child under their jurisdiction, to respect and guarantee the rights therein, irrespective, among other things, of the child’s situation and, in particular, irrespective of the residence status of the child’s parents.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1014"></a>

<p>On 21 December 2007, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia joined the Schengen area. However, technical difficulties and missed deadlines meant that those countries did not join not the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), as originally planned, but the first-generation Schengen Information System (SIS 1+). The Commission had received the mandate to develop the new system, scheduled to begin operating in March 2007, on 6 December 2001. Following a number of delays, a new timetable was announced that provided for SIS II to become operational by 17 December 2008.</p>

<p>(FR) The second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) should in time replace the current SIS 1+ system, which relies on a platform designed in the 1990s. SIS II will use the latest technologies, offer new functionality and will offer the option of including biometric data. In addition to the technical advances, the legislative instruments relating to SIS II include provisions on strengthening data protection and transparency for Parliament.</p>
<p>Between November and December 2008, the Commission’s main contractor on the SIS II development ran a set of tests to prove the functionality of the central system operating interactively with a given number of national systems.</p>
<p>The final test report and the analysis of the Commission’s ‘quality’ contractor confirm, in essence, that the contractor had been unable to show the correct operation of a number of the functions required of SIS II. Therefore, they are unable to meet all of their contractual commitments.</p>
<p>This setback will also affect the project schedule. The objective of commissioning SIS II in September 2009 will have to be reviewed.</p>
<p>The difficulties SIS II faces, however, are not a problem for the operation of the Member States’ borders, as SIS 1+ continues currently to play its role, guaranteeing a high level of security on the external borders of the Schengen area.</p>
<p>The priority for the Commission in the coming months will be to do everything possible to overcome the current difficulties and have an operational system in place that complies with the legal framework and fully meets user requirements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1029"></a>

<p>A few days ago Alexandros Grigoropoulos, a 15-year old schoolboy, was killed in cold blood by a police officer in Athens, unleashing a storm of protest and mass demonstrations in Greece, coming as it does in the wake of other similar cases, in which lives have been claimed in the course of decades of brutality by the police and state authorities in Greece and other EU Member States, for example the United Kingdom. Such cases are the natural and predictable consequence of the climate of terror and repression fostered by the unprecedentedly authoritarian laws being adopted by the EU and the Member States, which have created a leviathan of hitherto unrivalled proportions for the repression and suffocation of basic human rights and democratic freedoms, treating the people and organised popular protest movements as ‘the enemy within’.</p>

<p>(EN) The financial crisis has demonstrated how interlinked global financial markets are today. The G-20 process marks a new phase in international economic and financial co-operation, where advanced economies work more closely with emerging countries. This is key if we are to ensure a more stable global economic and financial system.</p>
<p>At the Washington Summit of 15 November 2008, the leaders of the G-20 approved an action plan to reform global financial markets following five common principles: (i) strengthening transparency and accountability of financial markets and align incentives in order to avoid excessive risk-taking; (ii) strengthen regulatory regimes, prudential oversight, and risk management, and ensure that all financial markets, products and participants are regulated or subject to oversight, as appropriate to their circumstances; (iii) promote the integrity of financial markets by bolstering investor and consumer protection, avoiding conflicts of interest, preventing illegal market manipulation, fraudulent activities and abuse, and protecting against illicit finance risks arising from non-cooperative jurisdictions; (iv) reinforce global cooperation on regulation, crisis prevention, management and resolution, and (v) reforming the International Financial Institutions (i.e., the Bretton Woods Institutions) in order to increase their legitimacy and effectiveness. The Action Plan includes a set of high priority actions to be completed prior to March 31 2009 as well as a number of medium-term actions. Europe is playing a full role in transforming these principles into practical and concerted action ahead of the next G-20 summit on 2 April 2009 in London.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that regulation is first and foremost the responsibility of regional and national regulators, the G-20 agreed that intensified international cooperation, strengthening of international standards and consistent implementation is necessary to protect against adverse cross-border, regional and global developments affecting international financial stability. The Commission strongly welcomes and is actively contributing to the international efforts to reform the world's financial systems. Key countries such as the United States, Brazil, India and China are part of these efforts, and the Commission is confident that this process will indeed strengthen financial markets and regulatory regimes, thereby reducing the possibility of similar crises in the future. As the Commission represents the EU in some key policy areas and prepares and enforces critical pieces of legislation in the area of financial services, it will continue to be an active and engaged partner in these international discussions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-0976"></a>

<p>(EN) On November 26<span class="sup">th</span> 2008, the Commission proposed a European Economic Recovery Plan<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>in order to provide the appropriate Europe-wide policy response to the current economic downturn. It presents a framework for actions to be taken both at the EU and Member states level. The European Council held in Brussels on December 11 and 12 2008 agreed upon this Recovery Plan and its main proposal for an immediate budgetary stimulus package amounting to € 200 billion (1.5% of EU GDP) along with a series of other priority actions grounded in the structural reforms of the Lisbon strategy aimed at strengthening the long-term growth and adjustment capacity of the EU economy.</p>
<p>The Recovery Plan includes measures both at Community and Member State level, aiming to restore growth and increase competitiveness of the real economy, especially for the Small and Medium-Sized Entreprises (SMEs). Member States were asked to bring forward national budgetary stimulus actions. In addition, a number of initiatives were proposed at Community and Member State level including:</p>
<p>A major European employment support initiative.</p>
<p>The enhancement of access to financing for businesses, notably through an European Investment Bank package of € 30 billion for loans to SMEs.</p>
<p>Proposals to increase and bring forward investments in Europe’s infrastructure and promote high-speed internet connections.</p>
<p>Proposals to improve energy efficiency in buildings and increase the take-up of green products.</p>
<p>A key element of the Recovery Plan is the full implementation of the Small Business Act action plan<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>In particular, in order to significantly reduce administrative burdens on business, promote their cash flow and help more people to become entrepreneurs, the Community and Member States are invited to:</p>
<p>Ensure that starting up a business anywhere in the EU can be done within three days at zero costs and that formalities for the hiring of the first employee can be fulfilled via a single access point.</p>
<p>Remove the requirement on micro-enterprises to prepare annual accounts and limit the capital requirements of the European private company to one euro.</p>
<p>Accelerate the adoption of the European private company statute proposal so that from early 2009 it can facilitate cross border business activities of SMEs and to allow them to work under a single set of corporate rules across the EU.</p>
<p>Ensure that public authorities pay invoices for supplies and services within one month to ease liquidity constraints and to accept e-invoicing as equivalent to paper invoicing; any arrears owed by public bodies should also be settled.</p>
<p>Reduce by up of 75% the fees for patent applications and maintenance and halve the costs for an EU trademark.</p>
<p>The Recovery Plan also stresses the need to increase investment in Research and Development (R&amp;D), Innovation and Education. It is indeed very important that industry and in particular SMEs are encouraged to maintain and even increase their activities in R&amp;D and innovation. R&amp;D spending should be seen as an investment and not as a cost to be decreased. Investing in R&amp;D and innovation now will lay the foundations for a strong competitive position of the European industry in a short and medium term future. The Commission is continuing to support R&amp;D activities for SMEs through the different actions under the 7<span class="sup">th</span> R&amp;D Framework Programme. For instance, the dedicated scheme "Research for the benefit of SMEs" will be allocating an extra € 25 million in 2009 to fund more projects and the Commission is also providing support to Member States for improving the coordination of their support programmes for R&amp;D in SMEs.</p>
<p>In addition the Commission put forward in the Recovery Plan, a number of initiatives to increase the competitiveness of its industry, in particular of the automobile and construction industries. The Commission will launch 3 major public-private partnerships to support innovation and prepare these sectors to face the significant challenges in the transition to the green economy.</p>
<p>In the automobile sector, a European Green Cars initiative will support research on Energy-efficient transport technologies and their market uptake.</p>
<p>In the construction sector, a European Energy-efficient Buildings initiative will promote green technologies and the development of energy-efficient systems and materials in new and renovated buildings with a view to reducing radically their energy consumption and CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>Finally, a Factories of the Future initiative will help EU manufacturers across sectors, in particular SMEs, to adapt to global competitive pressures by increasing the technological base of EU manufacturing through the development and integration the enabling technologies of the future, such as engineering technologies for adaptable machines and industrial processes, ICT, and advanced materials.</p>
<p>The Community-level priorities for the Recovery Plan were further detailed in the Implementation Report on the Community Lisbon Programme<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> published on 16 December 2008 that will be discussed at the Spring European Council 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As such, the Commission does not foresee any conflict of interest in the implementation of the proposed Directive with Member States' competence in the provision of health care services. The Commission's impact assessment suggests that the overall impact of the proposal on the national healthcare systems will be limited.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Commission’s proposal for a Directive on patients’ rights in cross border healthcare is simply to improve the situation for patients in specific circumstances, for whom cross-border healthcare is the best solution and to provide an additional option for patients who are not entitled to receive an authorisation to go for the planned treatment abroad under the terms of the Regulation 1408/71.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The economic and financial crisis is affecting many of the Member States, and every week brings more reports of new measures affecting thousands of employees in different Member States. Investment in transport infrastructures is one of the means by which Europe can tackle the economic crisis. Constructing transport infrastructures (rail, road, air, sea) requires major investment, and project implementation is only concluded in the medium or long term. If there is to be sufficient investment in transport infrastructures, the Member States will need to agree a corresponding increase in the TEN-T budget, or else allow their budget deficits to grow for a certain period of time. What measures are envisaged by the Commission with a view to enabling the Member States, at this time of economic and financial crisis, to achieve a significant increase in investment in transport infrastructures?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission welcomes the emphasis of the Honourable Member on the role of investment in transport infrastructure as a means of tackle the economic crisis. Indeed, such investment results not only in stabilising macro-economic demanding and creating jobs, both directly and indirectly, but at the same time paves the way for sustainable economic growth and increased productivity in the future. It is essential for the whole of Europe to turn the challenge represented by the current crisis into an opportunity.</p>
<p>The European Economic Recovery Plan, which has been recently endorsed by the Council, is the Commission's direct response and calls for smart investment including infrastructure. In particular, to enable an increase in investment in transport infrastructure the Plan provides for four specific actions:</p>
<p>1.	Reinforcing the capital base of the European Investment Bank and enabling a increased financing from the bank by some €15 billion over the next two years;</p>
<p>2.	launching an equity fund which would target infrastructure as well as energy and climate change projects;</p>
<p>3.	enabling a wider participation of the private sector in the infrastructure investments by clarifying the legal framework and eliminating administrative barriers for partnerships between the public and private sectors;</p>
<p>4.	launching in 2009 an additional 500 million EUR call for proposals for Trans-European Network Transport (TEN-T) projects for which a Community grant would lead to construction beginning before the end of 2009.</p>
<p>The latter alone is expected to accelerate the delivery of the trans-European infrastructure and mobilise national investment of more than €3 billion. But it is apparent that a €500 million call is not going to satisfy existing demand. Works for several projects cannot advance due to funding limitations, particularly severe under the current economic circumstances. Many more concrete TEN-T projects could be accelerated immediately which would also usefully contribute to the recovery programmes of individual Member States, were additional budgetary funding available.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1001"></a>

<p>(EN) As a Party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the Community and 26 Member States are bound by the commitment to provide for protection from exposure to tobacco smoke in all indoor workplaces and public places.</p>
<p>In 2006-2007, the Commission services participated in the work to formulate extensive guidelines on how to implement this obligation. The guidelines were adopted by all the Parties in July 2007. They formulate a "golden standard" that every Party should aim to achieve within five years of the Convention's entry into force for that Party – that is by 2010 for the EC and the majority of Member States.</p>
<p>To support Member States in adopting comprehensive smoke-free laws, the Commission intends to put forward a proposal for a Council Recommendation on smoke-free environments in 2009.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has decided to start consultations with the social partners at Community level on the need for additional measures to protect workers from risks to their health arising from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke at the workplace.</p>
<p>The evidence reported in the literature on the impact of smoke-free policies on revenues and employment in the hospitality sector appears mixed. Overall, there seems to be a largely neutral effect.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that an international review of the studies on the economic effects of smoke-free policies on the hospitality industry found that 47 of the 49 studies that are best designed report no negative impact on objective measures such as taxable sales.</p>
<p>Importantly, there are reliable reports that the health of bar and restaurant workers has improved considerably within months of implementation of smoke-free regulations. The respiratory symptoms in hospitality staff have been shown to drop by up to 50% as a result of smoke-free policies.</p>
<p>The Commission will address this issue in detail in the Impact Assessment which will accompany the Commission's proposal on smoke-free environments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1005"></a>

<p>The European Union is negotiating the ACTA anti-counterfeiting treaty with Japan, the United States and other countries.

In the leaked versions of the treaty, provision is made for a set of criminal and civil measures on breach of copyright, and for very extensive powers for border and airport security staff.

<p>(EN) The goal of the negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeit Trade Agreement (ACTA) is to provide for improved international standards for action against large-scale infringements of intellectual property rights (IPR).</p>
<p>Counterfeiting now takes place on an industrial scale. It has become an extremely profitable business, generating income that can compete with narcotics and weapons trafficking, but at much lower risk. Obviously, this type of activity causes enormous damage to the EU economy, whose major comparative advantage consists of quality and innovation. This trend is particularly worrying also from the point of view of consumer protection since many counterfeit products are clearly dangerous (fake medicines, spare parts, toys, food stuff etc.).</p>
<p>The EU is therefore working together with partners sharing its concerns such as the United States (US) and Japan, but also Mexico, Korea, Morocco and others on the negotiation of an anti-counterfeiting trade agreement (ACTA).</p>
<p>ACTA is first and foremost about tackling an activity pursued by criminal organisations which harm the economy or the consumers. ACTA is not designed to limit civil liberties or to negatively affect consumers. There is therefore no question that the ACTA current negotiations would result in creating new powers for border or airport security staff to check travellers’ computers or digital music players.</p>
<p>The current EU regulation has a de minimis clause that excludes goods in traveller’s personal baggage from the scope of the legislation, as long as these goods are no part of commercial traffic. The aim of ACTA is not to affect consumers negatively but to provide a clear basis for customs to act against commercial importations of fake goods and protect consumers from potentially dangerous products.</p>
<p>ACTA will not go further than the current Community acquis on the enforcement of intellectual property rights<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which does not limit fundamental rights and freedoms and civil liberties, as consecrated by the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Additionally, this acquis in terms of IPR enforcement is without prejudice to national or Community legal provisions in other areas, in particular in the area of personal data protection [e.g. Data Protection Directive<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and the Directive on privacy and electronic communications<a href="#defann_41_3" name="refann_41_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>].</p>
<p>As is the case in any trade negotiation, the ACTA negotiators have to respect a certain level of confidentiality. This does not mean that these negotiations are secret or that the EU institutions are prevented from exerting their institutional prerogatives. The EU's objectives in the negotiations are very clear and both the Council and Parliament have been regularly informed of, and consulted on, the state of play of the negotiations. Discussions have also been held with civil society stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Council and Member States have been closely involved in the process due to the possible inclusion of matters of criminal policy, which are not yet harmonised at EU level. Consequently, the Presidency will be negotiating on this matter (and other non-harmonised issues which may arise, such judicial and police cooperation).</p>
<p>Also, the Commission has discussed the matter on a regular basis with European Parliament in particular in the INTA Committee<a href="#defann_41_4" name="refann_41_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, and will continue to do so. Of course, the Commission is prepared to appear before other Committees to give further information on these negotiations if so requested.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The EU Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is a major tool for research policy and research funding with a dedicated budget that has increased over time. Its European character, with the majority of projects carried out by multinational and multisectoral consortia, and the legal and financial framework governing all EU expenditure, bring about an intrinsic level of complexity that is somewhat higher than in national research schemes. The Commission must also ensure the sound financial management of public resources and comply with the obligations and reporting requirements of the legal base of the programme.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission is striving for continuous improvement and streamlining of processes, rules, documentation and Information Technology (IT) systems to limit the administrative burden for participants. With the successful starting phase of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (2007-2013) (FP7), the Commission can already identify a number of improvements in simplification compared with previous programmes:</p>
<p>The installation of a system for unique registration of participating legal entities, abandoning the need for repeated checking of existence and legal status of each participation. Legal documents now have to be provided only once, all information is stored in a central data base accessible to all Directorates-General implementing FP7.</p>
<p>By introducing a threshold of € 375,000, the number of required certificates on financial statements is reduced in FP7 to one tenth of that in FP6.</p>
<p>Much fewer ex-ante financial capacity checks and protective measures are required due to the introduction of the guarantee fund in FP7. Ex-ante checks are now only necessary for coordinators and participants requesting more than a € 500,000 EC contribution. This is of particular benefit for the participation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and start-up companies.</p>
<p>Grant agreement negotiation and amendments: A new Web-based electronic system for negotiation, used by all research Directorates-General, was introduced by the end of 2007. The system allows online interaction between participants and Commission project officers. The guidelines for amendments are streamlined. Many changes can now be handled by simple information letters, i.e. they will not require a formal amendment procedure. A Web-based electronic system will also be used for the handling of all amendments.</p>
<p>The alleviation of burdens on project reporting and certification of financial statements: The structure of periodic and final technical reports was considerably streamlined and the Commission aims at extended reporting and payment periods (increasing the average period from 12 to 18 months), leading to a considerable reduction of the overall number of reports and payment transactions.</p>
<p>All these initiatives, together with the streamlining of guidance documents for participants contribute to the simplification of the procedures related to FP7. The Commission is committed to continuing the work in this direction. The eFP7 initiative, for instance, aims at a major improvement of the IT systems for all interactions between the Commission and participants. The Commission will also soon make proposals for implementing ex-ante certification of audit methodologies in order to extend the use of average cost reporting by certain beneficiaries. For the identification of further potential areas for simplification, the Commission seeks advice from many parties, including a sounding board of smaller research actors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1019"></a>

<p>(EN) The attention of the Honourable Member is drawn to the attached Excel file giving the current amount of authorised expenditure which the Commission has been obliged to cancel so far under the n+2 rule, by year, by Member State and by fund (ERDF – FIFG – EAGGF – ESF).</p>
<p>The total amount to be decommitted under the n+2 rule for the programming period 2000-2006 will be finalised at the closure of the Operational Programmes (Article 105 (3) of Regulation</p>
<p>n° (CE)1083/2006).</p>
<p>As far as closure dates are concerned, the Commission is not in a position to give a detailed answer per operational programme and per Member State as each operational programme has its own end date of eligibility and this date is the basis to establish the closure date. Moreover, given the pressures arising from the current economic and financial crisis, the Commission is willing to consider constructively requests from Member States for an extension tothe final date for the eligibility of expenditure of the operational programmes of period 2000-2006. However, in general, the estimated closure dates are the following:</p>
<p>End March 2009 for programmes for which the final date of eligibility is at the end of 2007 and without state aids.</p>
<p>End July 2009 for programmes for which the final date of eligibility is at the end of 2007 and include state aids.</p>
<p>End March 2010 for programmes with commitment in 2006 and without state aids;</p>
<p>End July 2010 for programmes with commitment in 2006 and with state aids.</p>
<p>End September 2010 if programmes under 4. or 5. request an extension.</p>
<p>End March 2011 for Greek programmes already benefiting from an extended eligibility date.</p>
<p>It should be recalled that the n+2 and n+3 rules are an integral part of the regulatory framework for the programming periods, 2000-2006 and 2007-2013, respectively, as approved by Parliament and the Council. The rules are an important incentive to managing authorities to accelerate the implementation of the operational programmes on the ground, in order to maximise impact on economic and social cohesion and employment. Accordingly, the Commission does not intend to propose the abolition of neither the n+2 rule for period 2000-2006 nor the n+2 and n+3 rule for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>Rather, in the light of the current economic and financial crisis, the Commission has proposed a recovery package that seeks to ensure that spending targets for the Structural Funds can be met. This means that additional advance payments will be made to Member States as soon as the proposed modification of Regulation n° (EC) 1083/2006 is approved, which should boost the implementation of the operational programmes by increasing liquidity in the system.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the fisheries area, the Council has adopted in July 2008 Regulation n° (EC) 744/2008 instituting a temporary specific action aiming to promote the restructuring of the European Community fishing fleet affected by the economic crisis. One of the measures adopted is the opportunity for Member States to request a second pre-financing in order to speed up the implementation of measures under the EFF operational programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1025"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is committed to the objective of eradicating child labour at a global level. This is reflected in its Communication "A Special Place for Children in the EU External Action"<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and in the EU Action Plan on Children's Rights in External Relations. Both were welcomed by the Council on 27 May 2008<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The EU effectively encourages improvements in third countries' labour standards through incentives and cooperation, including via its bilateral trade negotiations and agreements (eg FTAs) and the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).</p>
<p>The EU's GSP scheme is a key tool to encourage trading partners to improve their performance in this area. In particular, in the Special Incentive Arrangement for Sustainable Development and Good Governance (known as GSP+), the EU offers additional tariff preferences as an incentive to vulnerable developing country partners to ratify and effectively implement a set of international standards, including the relevant International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions on Child Labour (Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour and Convention 138 on Minimum Age for Admission to Work and Employment) and the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child. At present (as of 1 January 2009), 16 countries have taken sufficient steps so as to benefit from additional preferences under GSP+. At the same time, the Commission may temporarily withdraw GSP benefits from any GSP beneficiary in the event of serious and systematic violations of core UN/ILO human and labour rights on the basis of the conclusions of the relevant international monitoring bodies.</p>
<p>This is actually the case for two countries, Belarus and Myanmar, where the Commission took action after carrying out detailed investigations and in the light of clear findings by the ILO.</p>
<p>Child labour is, in most cases, a structural and development problem in poorer countries closely linked to their individual development challenges, the lack of social structures and the access to education. A holistic approach through development policy, political dialogue and cooperation in the multilateral context – ILO and UN – are considered best tools to address child labour. The major programme of the ILO for the eradication of child labour (IPEC) is supported by the Commission. Mid-2008, a new programme under IPEC (TACKLE –Tackling child labour through education) was launched with the financial support of the European Community as part of an effort to accelerate the fight against poverty and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in 11 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific Region. The project aims at strengthening legal frameworks on child labour and education and increase institutional capacities for implementing strategies to eliminate child labour.</p>
<p>The Commission regularly raises with partners the issue of labour rights violations, and in particular child labour. Even though progress has been made so far, the fight against child labour remains a global challenge and continued efforts are required.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
