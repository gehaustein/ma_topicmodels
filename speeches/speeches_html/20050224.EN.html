I welcome Commissioner Potočnik here today. There is a great deal of goodwill towards the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole with regard to the Seventh Framework Programme, as demonstrated by the speed with which the committee has conducted its business on the Locatelli report. I hope the Commission will build upon this goodwill and not dissipate it.</p>
<p class="contents">The research community and the wider community expect a great deal from the Seventh Framework Programme, as it is seen as a crucial part of the Lisbon strategy for strengthening the European economy. Research and development are key elements in that process. Therefore, it is all the more important for us to get this right.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the purpose behind this oral question today is to give you the opportunity to share some thoughts with us before making your proposal to the Council and Parliament on how research is to be funded. It seems to us that the crucial question relates to the doubling of expenditure on the research programme within the overall EU budget. Can this fine ambition be achieved? How it is going to be achieved? We are looking with keen anticipation to you, Commissioner, to tell us how you think you are going to achieve that.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the existence of the 'one per cent club' of Member States who wish to keep European-level spending within an overall cap of one per cent of GDP, I want to offer some suggestions as to ways in which spending on research might be increased at a European level, without necessarily breaching that one per cent cap, and given that there seems to be no lack of goodwill on the part of Member States to spend more on research.</p>
<p class="contents">The first suggestion is that the proposals for the spending programme with regard to research on security should be funded by the Member States at European level, but outside the Seventh Framework Programme. Therefore, it would not count as part of the relevant budget item.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I see great potential for using part of the Cohesion Fund for directing research spending to the new Member States, and I hope you will be sympathetic to that suggestion, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for the third suggestion. Mr Mayor Oreja heads a special working group on the European Research Council, which has suggested that an independent body of scientists should take the programme of research forward, and that this should happen on the basis of excellence and scientific merit. Quite a substantial budget has been proposed for this, totalling EUR 2 billion a year once the working-up phase is complete. That will take a huge slice of the existing framework budget. I would therefore suggest that Member States should also consider funding that outside the context of the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we will take on board a number of the suggestions in the Marimon report. One of the most frequently-voiced concerns about our research activities at European level is the complexity and burden involved in the administrative procedures and regulations relating to the funds, which make it very difficult for small- and medium-sized enterprises and small research entities to access the funds and take part in the programmes. We all pay at least lip service to this. Even when were debating the Fourth Framework Programme, there was a great deal of concern about that. We talk about it; let us hope this time, Commissioner, you are able to do something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of pursuing excellence above all else is crucial to achieving successful research at European level. I look forward to your comments about how we fund all this with keen interest, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Potočnik,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I would like to thank you, and in particular the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for this opportunity to discuss in plenary the issue of doubling the research budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I start by saying how happy I am that Mrs Locatelli's report on the future of European research received almost unanimous support from the ITRE committee on Monday. This report, which I understand will be voted on in the March part-session, gives us an excellent grounding in preparing the formal Commission proposal for the new framework programme. I would particularly like to thank two members of the committee, Mr Chichester and Mrs Locatelli.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me first to underline that today's discussion is not just important for research. It is a debate about nothing less than our credibility to reach the Lisbon objectives, and is a crucial debate for both our institutions only a few weeks before Europe hopefully agrees on the financial means for the next decade.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion about the new Financial Perspectives is a moment of truth and the question of sufficient funding for European research is an essential part of it. This is because research is about knowledge, and knowledge is truly a European strength in global competition. Let me explain.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of our trading partners are competing with primary resources, which we do not have. Some compete with cheap labour, which we do not want. Some compete on the back of the environment, which we cannot accept. The only way for European enterprise to build sustainable leadership is to exploit the knowledge triangle fully: the creation, transmission and use of knowledge through research, education, training and of course innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">My strong conviction is that European enterprises will only achieve competitiveness and leadership on global markets if we rapidly put Europe in the lead as an economy and as a knowledge society. We are strong in knowledge, but we can become even stronger if we pool our efforts in an intelligent way; if we give full emphasis to excellence; and if we use the full research potential throughout the EU – old, new and future. This is what I want the next research programme to stand for.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowledge does not only mean more competitive businesses. It also brings continuous progress to society: progress in fields such as health; preservation of the environment; and sustainable energy supply. All of these rest largely on the progress of knowledge. In view of this, the questions you raised are indeed the right ones.</p>
<p class="contents">First, will the Commission fight for the doubling of the research budget? The answer is yes. In February 2004, when launching the debate on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union, the Commission emphasised the role research will play in building our common future and consequently proposed the doubling of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">This was reaffirmed in the Commission's communication on the Financial Perspectives last July and President Barroso confirmed the approach to this House last December, when he endorsed the Financial Perspective that had been proposed by the Prodi Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The last confirmation came in the proposal of the Lisbon mid-term review. It spells out clearly the importance of investment in research and development. On behalf of the European Commission, I can therefore confirm not only our strong commitment to research, but also that we will do everything to achieve the doubling of the research budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, does this doubling take account of the programme's duration, inflation, enlargement and the need to support new actions? I am very grateful for these questions. It is good that we clarify these fully justified issues. FP7 will be the principal financial tool for realising the ambitious objective of driving productivity growth and ensuring competitiveness through knowledge. When I speak about the doubling of funds I am talking about doubling the budget of FP7. This figure does not include related Community programmes such as Mr Gunther Verheugen's programme for competitiveness and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal will not simply be a doubling of the initial FP6 budget. It will be built on the basis of the yearly amount to be spent on research during the period 2007-2013 compared to the yearly estimated amount for FP6, and revised following accession. This means doubling on a yearly basis regardless of the duration of FP7. Moreover, in the Financial Perspectives these amounts will be adjusted for inflation according to our general calculation methods.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is one particular issue. In the area of research, enlargement was a reality long before the Accession Treaty was signed. The current candidate countries also participate in the Framework Programme. I could, therefore, answer this question by saying that it is true that enlargement has been taken into account, but I would have to add immediately that it is not only in the budgetary figures that enlargement needs to be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I want this programme to be built on excellence, because I know this is also a strength of the new Member States. However in addition, I want this programme to be an enabling one that allows the use of the full research potential in the new Member States and creates an active and effective link with the Structural Funds. Additional new areas of research are included and are part of the justification for doubling the funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, will the FP7 proposal cover basic research, space research and security research? To be brief, our FP7 proposal will be all inclusive, i.e. there will be no mechanisms outside the framework programme. Let me make an important addition here. Parliament has highlighted that the complementary objectives of continued reinforcement of existing EU research support, on the one hand, and of support to new areas of research that are of interest to the EU, on the other, require adequate funding.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, it would not be possible to strengthen existing activities in an efficient way and, at the same time, introduce widely supported new activities, such as the European Research Council and technology initiatives, if the research budget was not doubled. Doubling will enable us to take a decisive step forward in our overall research policy and in continuing support for the European Research Area. Agreement on the substance of future research activities necessarily implies agreement on adequate funding for these activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, how will the Commission try to influence the debate on the Financial Perspectives to achieve the doubling of research funds? In order to underpin the debate on the Financial Perspectives, the Commission will present its proposal for FP7 on 6 April. This will help Parliament to give its preliminary reactions to the Council that your rapporteur, Mr Borg is planning to present during the May part-session. It will also allow the ministries for research and science to have an initial discussion at the Competitiveness Council on 18 April. The Commission proposal will provide sound justification for doubling the budget for FP7, based on a detailed and thorough assessment of the impact of the research and development instruments on investment in growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I will list the two main reasons for doubling the funding. The first – and, for me, the most important set of reasons – is the need for the European Union to be credible in delivering the renewed Lisbon Agenda on growth and jobs. This includes the need to deliver results on the 3% GDP target for research and development that was mutually agreed in Barcelona. Doubling the funding is one of the crucial steps towards a more growth-oriented European Union budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The second set of reasons is more specific to research and development spending. Firstly, we need high public spending on research and development because it is an important source of R&amp;D investment and for its strong leverage effect on private investments in research and development in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need more R&amp;D funding at EU level because of the strong added value of European research funding through the critical mass of resources, sharing of knowledge and facilities, strengthening excellence through close cooperation, competition at European level, the coordination of national activities and support for European Union policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add to that the fact that we are currently rejecting an unacceptable number of excellent proposals purely because of the lack of financial resources. In addition, there is the need and willingness to fund new category and activity initiatives which demonstrate high value added impact at EU level without, however, endangering existing ones. Finally, we should not forget the very simple fact that the costs of research itself are also growing.</p>
<p class="contents">Your fifth question was whether the duration of FP7 should be synchronised with the Financial Perspectives to ensure a better coordination of planning activities?</p>
<p class="contents">Reaching the goals that I have described will require a long-term view and commitment. That is why the Commission will propose that the duration of FP7 should be the same overall as the next Financial Perspective for 2007-13. We should take stock mid-way through the programme to ensure that FP7 continues to respond to the needs faced by the European economy and citizens. By doing so we will introduce more stability on the one hand, and more flexibility on the other. Both factors are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to take this opportunity to underline the exemplary execution rates in the research budget. The current execution rates are close to 100%. We have proved in the past that we can effectively manage constantly increased FP budgets. We are aware that the challenge to managing the doubling of the funds is demanding, but we are determined to provide proper answers. Simplification and rationalisation of procedures are greatly needed. Administration and modernised management, including externalisation, will provide answers to this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals in the field of research are at the core of the delivery of the new Lisbon Agenda. That is the only way we can succeed. The time for delivery is now. Building a knowledge society is probably the best, and perhaps only, way to sustain the European social model without having to make a trade-off between economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection. The first and foremost policy priority for the Union is thus to strongly support the three sides of the knowledge triangle – research, education and innovation – and to ensure that the triangle operates in the most favourable framework conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The change in the structure of the European budget in favour of more growth and competitive oriented expenses in the direction proposed by the Commission is thus crucial. This structural change to the European budget should also be followed by the Member States in their budgets. The doubling of funds in the European budget should not be seen as compensation for the reduction of Member States' efforts. On the contrary, it should be an example followed by the Member States. Their effort is necessary. If we do not make the effort now, we will have to make it later; but it will be more difficult later and it could even be too late.</p>
<p class="contents">I intend to do my best to achieve the vision I have described because I believe it is the right one. We can bring it to life by working together. That is why I ask for your support. I trust that I will receive it, for the sake of the European model of life and for the sake of Europe's future.</p>

He is also taking steps to ensure that the Lisbon agenda is implemented and promises great things, such as new jobs and higher incomes for our people. On the other hand, there are Commissioners who are in favour of REACH and emissions trading, which would result in the relocation of large parts of our industry outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to congratulate the Commissioner on having made a knowledge-based European Union his main priority, and on not merely following in the footsteps of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, but intends to strike out on an entirely new path with the Seventh Framework Programme. The aim of this is not only to implement the Lisbon criteria, but above all to target the Financial Perspectives at new, better and more secure jobs and to ensure that Europe can hold its own in international competition, as what a further priority should be to safeguard existing jobs. Achieving this by 2010 will be a far from easy task.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether it takes place on the basis of a certain percentage of GDP or not, and however it is calculated, we regard doubling as a way to send out a signal, namely that on the one hand we are debating using 1% of GDP for the European Union, but that on the other hand we are talking about spending 3% on research. It is apparent from this how large the gap is when it comes to dealing efficiently with issues relating to our future. I believe that this goal – knowledge-based training and further training and life-long learning in connection with research findings at university, with a clear focus on new jobs – must be pursued, and that for this reason we must also demand of the Research Council that its representatives from business and research departments have a large say in shaping the goals, and that the political goals we fund with the Lisbon agenda are implemented accordingly and that we get a grip on bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are stumbling from one accusation of fraud to another, and a great deal of criticism is currently being levelled at Europe. Yet we should highlight the positive aspects, and the opportunities we are creating in Europe for our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to urge Mr Potočnik to come to Parliament immediately after the programme has been adopted in the European Commission on 6 April. An extended Conference of Presidents will take place here, and the President of the Commission should join you in presenting the Seventh Framework Programme to the public. We should take this opportunity to make a big impression on the public, and to show them that we take the Lisbon goals seriously and want to achieve them.</p>

We are adding this to the Lisbon objectives, as I noticed the Commissioner is also doing. We are therefore in agreement with Commissioner Potočnik. The problem is the Member States. It is the Finance Ministers of the Member States and Ecofin that are our targets and whom we should be grabbing by the scruff of the neck. Only two Member States have achieved the 3% target for research, my own country being one of them. We therefore have a lot of housework to do.</p>
<p class="contents">We require some exceptionally determined work from the Commission, and this really is, as you have said, the first test, or actually a test both for you and for us. The funding is to be doubled, but where is it being channelled? This must be kept in mind the whole time, because it is no good having funding unless you know what to do with it. I would like to know exactly which areas it is destined for. How important, for example, is the lack of digital literacy? It has been calculated that we lose three hours a week because of it. Here, moreover, the working week is being lengthened. In many cases these three hours would salvage our economy.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, of course, we have to consider enlargement. I am one of those who believe that 1% on the budget is not enough to take care of enlargement, the Lisbon Process and many other matters. We certainly knew that enlargement would cost money, and the budget cannot subsequently be reduced: it should remain at the same level it has done up till now. Finally, we need more training, know-how and research. That is the only way out of this vicious circle of competitiveness.</p>

In fact, when it was established, there was not yet such a pressing need to revitalise the competitiveness of the European Union, such a massive and important enlargement had not taken place, international competition had not yet emerged so forcefully, and nor had a knowledge-based strategy such as the Lisbon strategy yet been formulated.</p>
<p class="contents">All of that has now happened and, furthermore, very little has been done in terms of the Lisbon objectives. We therefore need to make up for lost time, considering that half of the time laid down for them has already passed. We must pull out all the stops, starting precisely with research, which sustains all the progress we make. To this end, last Monday the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy approved the three main lines of action for the next framework programme: the European Research Council, the new research proposals and the technology platforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Research Council has emerged out of the acknowledgment that basic research now has an importance which goes beyond the Member States and must be supported at Union level and in accordance with the Lisbon strategy. It is an initial focus around which we can elaborate a development and competitiveness policy, which will then be filled out in the technology platforms. These platforms must obtain resources chiefly from enterprises, but also from public institutions, the Member States, regions and local authorities, in order to organise research of general interest and to help businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, meet the need for research in order to make them competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">These are sound, decisive innovations which will give fresh impetus to our businesses. We must have a presence in the new sectors, adopt innovative measures and provide conventional manufacturing businesses with a new competitive capacity if we do not wish to sit idly by as Europe undergoes full deindustrialisation. We must be consistent and invest in research which, even when it is not strictly targeted, has an extremely high potential for return. Perhaps it will not suffice to double the funds but, in any case, we cannot afford to be too sparing when it comes to these resources. I would make it clear that the Commission can count on the support of Parliament in order to face this challenge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, not only are we concerned about the budget, but also about the social and environmental ends, because we all want a larger cake. However, of primary importance are the ingredients of the cake and how it is cooked and then, but also extremely important, how the cake of European research is shared out.</p>
<p class="contents">We want open science, with a fluid and open transfer of knowledge to all sectors of society, and, within this context, we are worried that some patents may represent obstacles to innovation in the case of small and/or young companies.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we want to see a type of research for which small is beautiful, in which SMEs, small laboratories and small universities are treated as priorities within European programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, we want to create ‘clusters’, groups of small companies at European level, in order to prevent all research from being concentrated within a few projects. In the field of research, we should promote a return to basics, to fundamentals, so that basic scientific research can be supported openly and provided with more funds. We must offer more public support to basic research, with social and environmental objectives in the medium and long terms, rather than restricting ourselves to achieving short-term technological performance.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, there must also be more investment in preventive health and not just in pharmaceutical research, as has happened in the past. Furthermore, we must invest in protecting the climate and not direct all or most of our investment in energy towards nuclear programmes. Renewable energy currently needs a level of support which is at least equivalent to that being given to the ITER or Euratom programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased with Mr Potočnik’s projects in support of social sciences, since they are essential to progress in research into our society.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to call for the creation of an independent European Research Council, with the participation of all the social actors, so that there may be a genuinely fruitful debate, a dialogue, between society and the scientific world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first relates to the total volume of funding for science and research. I believe that certain instruments that we could use, such as European securities, are currently being neglected. In the USA a number of key projects are funded by securities, and this could also act as a financial basis for key European projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Another way to boost funding would be to exploit the resources available in the new Member States. The research potential in these countries is extremely strong, although it is currently underfunded. The costs of achieving research goals could realistically be reduced if these countries were involved.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to the way in which the 3% is to be structured. The Commission is relying on two thirds of this money coming from the private sector. This will be very difficult to achieve, however, given that only 3% of small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay 85% of all business taxes and provide 75% of jobs, currently invest in research, and 40% of them are involved in innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">We will make no progress in this field without a new policy on depreciation, generous funding for investment, flexible legislation, a new credit policy and tax relief. I believe that it is also crucial that there be a high ratio of research workers to technicians. At present the European Union is lagging 50% behind the US with regard to the number of researchers for every 1000 workers; in other words, the US has 50% more researchers for every 1000 workers. Major technological breakthroughs and key discoveries need to be based on a constant stream of minor innovations, and at present this is not happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to note that research follows certain laws. In the past this was analysed in terms of Kondratiev waves, whereby key breakthroughs were found to be concentrated in clearly defined clusters. We should provide generous funding in order to ensure that clusters of this kind come into being once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin, Hans-Peter (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being present at this important debate today. If you want to double funding – and many millions of Europeans would be in favour of doing so, if only they knew anything about it, and indeed I am in favour of it, although I only know a little about it – what investments do you actually want to boost by doing so? Experience has shown that 80% of funding from the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes has gone to the large corporations, and only 20% to those that could be termed SMEs or that are of an even smaller size.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the main reason for this is that lobbyists – in particular those acting on behalf of the large corporations – have an above-average amount of influence. They have long since taken a good look around and asked where they can get even more money if funding is to be doubled. These people are very good at their jobs. The second most important reason, however, lies within the Commission itself. Many of the measures you take – and having been a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for many years, I can say that this has always been the case – demonstrate that you still follow the same old motto as the World Bank: ‘big is beautiful’. It is an unfortunate fact that the Commission is making the same mistake that the World Bank made, by constantly funding oversized projects all over the world. The new and enlarged Commission has a real chance of preventing such a mistake and moving away from the 80:20 ratio that favours large businesses. This would be a sure-fire way of creating jobs, and it would mean that progress was made with all aspects of the European dream.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question, of course, is which areas really receive investment. I should like to warn you against pretending to Europeans that military armament in the field of research can result in any kind of positive progress, and against making the same mistakes that history is full of. What we are seeing is a new armament by stealth in the EU, and I can only issue the most fervent of warnings against it.</p>
<p class="contents">Less dramatic, but equally important, is the nuclear issue. It is absolutely crucial, Commissioner, that if you wish to double funding you must make it quite clear what is actually going where. Transparency is needed so that people know exactly where funding is intended to go, and so that action is not taken behind closed doors. When it comes to informing the public about how funds are used, the European Union will have to decide whether it wishes to move towards propaganda – made what it is by Josef Goebbels, himself the subject of much debate at present – or towards information, with the pioneer of this approach being Jean-Jacques Rousseau. For Europe's sake, I would ask that you move towards informing citizens about funding.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I believe that 1% of GDP from Member States will be more than enough for you to manage with. There are a great many ways in which money could be saved in the EU. This House alone has EUR 50 million to spend this year, and has no idea what it should do with it all. In this instance less would mean more, and doubling is in no way incompatible with a maximum of 1%, which is what many countries want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The main indicators for developments in this sector clearly show not only that we are lagging behind the world leaders, but mainly that we are unable to make use of our own research and innovation potential. There is an undoubted need sharply to increase the volume of resources allocated to this important area, but this must be in line with our financial perspectives. It is not, however, clear how this is to be implemented. The framework programmes for research and technological development, which have been the main tool in the European Union’s implementation strategy, have been found, for various reasons and throughout their existence, to be inadequate in promoting the research and innovation potential of mainly small and medium-sized enterprises. It has been most frequently a matter of the complexity of the entire structure and procedures for access to financial resources, which deters mainly small research and innovation units or small companies. Regional experiences also point to other reasons: there is a lack of an adequate regional infrastructure, relevant institutions, such as university development centres, technological incubators, high-tech centres and so on but also of risk capital funds, which would, on the one hand, stimulate regional innovation and research potential in its broader sense, but also create a stronger competitive environment, on the other hand. The European Union budget must take account of both an increased level of financing for its framework programmes and a strengthened budget for the structural funds in order to establish a regional research infrastructure and also strengthened programmes for the European financial institutions to stimulate the development of regional risk capital funds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This affirmation needs to be substantiated, something which you, Mr Potočnik, have already done in part. In addition to the issues of enlargement and the new activity headings, namely space and research, I would point out that the Constitutional Treaty confers fresh powers on the Union in the field of research. I would also like to mention that the European Research Council will be established, a new instrument which we assume will use up 10 to 15% of the overall resources of the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Potočnik, you are already aware of the outcome of the vote of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the guidelines for the Seventh Framework Programme. The document calls for additional funding within the Seventh Framework Programme for the European Research Council. It also states that a doubling of the budget is the bare minimum if we truly intend to give substance to a European Research Area and pursue the objectives under the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you whether you agree with the European Research Council being funded from additional resources. And with regard to doubling the budget, what is meant by doubling? We need to find a criterion and I would suggest a criterion of proportion, that is, the framework programme resources as a percentage of the Union’s gross domestic product. That is the percentage that we should double. I therefore ask you, do you agree with this interpretation of doubling?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we know that at this stage in the preparation of the Financial Perspectives, there is a major debate underway among the Member States because some of them intend to cut their contribution to the budget of the European Union to 1%. These cuts are likely to have negative repercussions on the ‘research appropriations’ item. Do you agree to fight hard to oppose this position taken by the less generous Member States? And if, in any case, these cuts are effected, will you still be in favour of calling for the funds to be doubled? The Seventh Framework Programme must not merely be a new framework programme, but it must mark a turning-point, in line with the Union’s new powers, if we really want to create a new European Research Area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this is the answer to a very large number of problems. I also think it is right to focus on education, research and innovation, dealing with each of these areas separately but also in the context of the other two.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the technology platforms will serve a very useful purpose. It is good that the social sciences are included in this connection. What we need to focus on is, of course, the infrastructure surrounding research, about which we have not yet had a great deal of discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to raise two matters that are of concern to me. The first relates to the way in which European researchers experience professional and social conditions at a personal level. We see how, in the current situation, large numbers of people are leaving research for other jobs because they find it impossible to carve out careers and create good bases for family life, given the rules and conditions we lay down for them. This is, of course, all the more regrettable now we know that, with this new research policy, we shall require not fewer, but twice as many, researchers. I want to know what measures the Commission intends to take in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The second matter of concern to me is, of course, industry’s share of the total resources allocated to research. The general trend in all the Member States is for this to go down instead of up. I want to know what the Commission is doing to make industry more enthusiastic about investing more in research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are seeing the framework for a new European research policy, we must, finally, at the same time also think about how to translate these research results into job opportunities. I should therefore also like to see an initial fundamental framework programme for innovation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When you realise that public and private research and development expenditure in the EU amounts to only 1.95% of GDP compared with 2.64% in the United States and 2.98% in Japan, you can see how much the famous Lisbon strategy and the Commission have failed. That is why I believe that if the European Union is to have an effective research policy, we must not only double the appropriations for research but also review and radically question the methods and objectives of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development implemented by the European Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, contrary to the philosophy of the Seventh Framework Programme, a successful research and development system can only be based on cooperation and exchange between public and private researchers and laboratories and not on all out competition and shortage of money.</p>
<p class="contents">What I fear the most is that resources will be concentrated in a small number of priority areas of research, which are bound to be those most likely to bring immediate profits for the large industrial groups, at the expense of fundamental physics and the human and social sciences; that would mean researcher recruitment and careers would probably no longer be based on scientific assessment but on priorities directly dictated by the interests of the multinationals involved in the framework programme’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I, of course, believe that research expenditure must be taken out of the Stability Pact calculation, but that is not enough. It is even more important that questions of research in Europe should no longer be decided by the Commission alone, but by elected representatives of the scientific community. I therefore propose the creation of a representative assembly of all researchers at the European Parliament. That assembly would have such important tasks as ethical appraisal, the drafting of recommendations, encouraging cooperation, monitoring and continuity of the funding granted, and ensuring that the regions are not forced to compete with each other. That is the only way in which the European Union will be able to look to the future with greater optimism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you know better than we do, Commissioner, the research programmes will have an even greater effect if you use them to build a bridge between, on the one hand, the research and development programmes under the Cohesion Policy, and, on the other, the Seventh Framework Programme. If the two instruments are brought into line with each other, they will be a great deal more far-reaching in their effects. Please allow me to give an example from my own region, which is bounded by the frontiers between the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the universities of Eindhoven, Louvain, and Aachen, as well as those of Hasselt and Maastricht, now cooperate closely in research, training and development, as well as in the field of cohesion projects. I believe that similar cross-border collaborative projects deserve to be followed and encouraged, as they primarily reinforce the regional dimension as part of the Lisbon process. Surely nobody can object to the towns, universities and regions within which they move and operate playing such a role?</p>
<p class="contents">We were therefore particularly pleased to see the Commission accept an amendment to that effect proposed by Mr van Nistelrooij to the Locatelli report after all, which Parliament approved at the beginning of this week. In it, this House expressly requests cooperation with the regions and the coupling of, on the one hand, national programmes under the Structural Funds and, on the other, programmes under the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Commissioner, businesses are, as you know, ready to invest and to anticipate the opportunities that are presenting themselves. If we in the EU, who deal with financial matters, now allow them to pass by, if our fine words about innovation policy are not followed up by action, then our credibility will, of course, be shattered – both yours and ours, I would say. We will then be giving national governments the ideal excuse for not coming up with the national funding that is so vitally needed. At the moment there exists what is termed a ‘window of opportunity’, with many members of government at every level – regional, national and, of course, European too – being convinced that we must drastically upgrade our investments in innovation. If we simply allow this to ebb away, then I think we will have to look among ourselves to find the reason why. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, knowledge is now to be understood in the broad sense of the word, and if we look at the proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme in the context of the Sixth – and also going back to the Fifth Framework Programme – we can see that socioeconomic research played an important part at that time and contributed to an analysis and understanding of the interaction between advanced technologies and social development. Separating scientific and sociological research when drafting the Seventh Framework Programme has, however, in actual fact put sociological research into budgetary competition with technological research in relation to the IST programme. This tends to marginalise the relevance of socioeconomic research, and, in future, technological research should therefore be developed in tandem with the development of society’s needs, values and expectations. Socioeconomic research in the information society is a precondition for our achieving this objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no question that if we are to achieve the objectives set in the Lisbon strategy for 2010, we must be committed to improving substantially the resources dedicated to Research and Development, since that is the central pivot of a knowledge-based economy and, therefore, the main tool for promoting growth, employment and competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we agree that the Union's scientific policy should be placed at the centre of the strategy for the coming years, and also that overall spending on Research and Development should be set at 3% of the Union's GDP, and, of course, I agree with what most of the previous speakers have said.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add something else. It is certainly very important to reduce the technological gap between the Union and countries such as the United States, but it is just as true that within the Union there is another significant technological gap between the different countries, which we must also try to reduce. In this regard, our objective must be to improve the competitiveness of the Union as a whole, in order to narrow the gap with the most technologically-advanced countries, but we must do so in such a way that this does not involve increasing the differences between our various countries in terms of technological capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very important, Commissioner, that we take concrete measures to improve the capacity of the countries which so far have participated less in the framework programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we would ask that you commit yourself to reducing the internal technological gap which unquestionably also exists within our Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to do that, we need money, and so we must increase funding. Commissioner, you have my full support in obtaining the Council’s agreement with the help of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if we ask for more money we must see to it that these funds are put to the best possible use. We must also learn the lessons from the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, and make procedures simpler, less bureaucratic and more streamlined. I see this as an absolutely crucial task that we must all strive to achieve, and both the Commission and Parliament are needed in this respect. The members of the Committee on Budgets are presently examining the Financial Regulation, and this is another area where work must be done and improvements made. Commissioner, this is another task for which you and your College are needed. What is needed is professional project management, and I am eagerly awaiting your proposals on this issue on 6 April.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to return to the lessons we should learn from the Sixth Framework Programme. Industry involvement fell under the Sixth Framework Programme, and we must come up with ideas of ways to buck this trend. If we are serious about the Lisbon goals, we simply need more investment in research and development. Such investment must also come from the private sector, and I would be interested to hear the Commissioner's ideas in response to the following question; how do you intend to get industry, in small and medium-sized enterprises, more involved in the Seventh Framework Programme?</p>

The Seventh Framework Programme has presented us with a unique opportunity to move towards this goal by improving the way we exploit the intellectual potential of the European Union’s 450 million citizens, including its almost 80 million new citizens in the new Member States. The Seventh Framework Programme should accelerate European integration, and it should provide not only for a much-needed and significant rise in funding, but also for measures under which this funding will be put to effective use. This will only be possible if entirely new and innovative methods are devised for implementing European policy on science.</p>
<p class="contents">The main priority should be to alter the criteria according to which funds are distributed, as this will make it possible to establish centres of expertise at institutions where the researchers are based. Students from Central and Eastern Europe do not wish to be treated as an afterthought, or sometimes merely as the odd ones out, in ‘Centres of Excellence’ programmes, as is the case under the current Sixth Framework Programme. Two questions come to mind in this connection. The first is whether the concept of ‘excellence’ is not being misused here as a strange kind of curse, which can later be invoked to justify an unequal distribution of funds. We should not strive for excellence only with regard to gaining and spending funds. The second question that arises concerns the kind of objective criteria for the distribution of funds provided for in the Seventh Framework Programme. I thank you.</p>

It is very encouraging for my future work. Many questions were asked, some of which I cannot answer very precisely, but I will group them together and try to be as informative as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The calculation behind doubling is made in real terms on a yearly basis and with the same assumptions in mind as with the other aspects of the debate on the new financial perspective. At the end of the day it is crucial that we double the funds as a percentage of GDP. That is a credible way of looking at it. Our proposal was based on that thinking and I believe that this proposal is ambitious enough to achieve our goals. I am more afraid of going backwards than of asking whether it goes far enough, although even that question is credible, too, and could be approached in an official way.</p>
<p class="contents">Public funding is not the only funding. As you know, public funding is estimated as being approximately one-third, with two-thirds private funding. So it is crucial that we increase public funding, because of the source and because of the leverage effect on private investment. However, as some of you stressed, it is even more crucial to create conditions under which companies will stay and invest in Europe. The latest figures are not promising: in 2002, investment by the 500 biggest companies in the European Union decreased by 2%; investment by the 500 biggest non-EU companies increased by 3.9%.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, around 24% of investment involves the car and spare part industries. In the rest of the world, information technology is the biggest sector with regard to investment. Those are the facts we have to deal with. That is why it is crucial to create a better environment for research and development. Ways of doing this might include state aid; tax incentives; intellectual property rights; the structural and cohesion funds; and risk and venture capital, which is certainly one of the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Two days ago, I met the President of the European Investment Bank and we have already started to prepare actions in an effort to address that problem. Environment is crucial. If we want to achieve our goal, we need to create an environment in which companies will work, compete and carry out their research and development activities in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The framework programme now being discussed in the Commission has to take account of the Lisbon Agenda. I would like it to be simple, flexible, understandable, easily applicable and based on continuity. We would like to establish four major areas of support.</p>
<p class="contents">First, cooperation. Today we call this the 'collaborative approach', although in some countries the term 'collaboration' is not particularly acceptable. That area should be more industry-driven than it was in the past. That is why technology platforms should play an important role in deciding where money will go and how decisions are taken. It will be more thematically orientated and less instrumental than in the past. I believe that is the proper way to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area is ideas. This means the European Research Council. This area is researcher-driven, so the division between basic and applicable research is practically outdated. We would try to make it clear what is industry-driven, what is politically driven and what is research-driven. That will be more transparent. We will give everyone the opportunity to make known their views on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area should be people. The major problem there is that they have been under-financed. The fourth area is capacities, which involves infrastructure, SMEs, regions and research potential. Here, we would like to address the question of new Member States, but not in a way that would undermine the excellence of the programme. Researchers in those countries should be supported so that they develop and become more visible. We should establish actions which allow us to access the structural and cohesion funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst thing for the new Member States and their researchers would be to create conditions under which they would not be able to compete. It is best for them to develop rapidly so that they are competitive from the very beginning. They are doing that already. I am very much aware that conditions in some countries mean that they cannot compete. We have to help them, but the question is how we do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Our programme seeks to achieve excellence and competitiveness in the EU, which is crucial. We have structural and cohesion funds for solidarity. If we are using these funds for road, rail and environmental infrastructure, we could and should use them for the development of research infrastructure as well. It is crucial that we create conditions in which researchers from the new Member States will remain in these countries and compete and cooperate with others in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Simplification and streamlining should be the name of the game, otherwise we will have major problems. I am aware of all the challenges ahead of me and I count on your support. The Commission is not the only body involved: I have created a taskforce in my directorate. We now also have an inter-service task force. We are now organising sounding boards among SMEs and smaller groups, to give them a chance to voice their opinions on the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Framework programmes, research and development structures, cohesion programmes, and competitiveness and innovation programmes are crucial. These should seek to achieve the same goals. That is one of the points I would especially like to underline.</p>
<p class="contents">For smaller users, we are trying to establish better definitions for the instruments, which are often far from user-friendly, especially the integrated projects. On the other hand, simplification and streamlining are major problems for smaller users. For them, costs are proportionally much higher and burdens are greater than they are for the bigger users. I believe these two things will be crucial. We should bring more SMEs into the process itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that the talks on the next financial perspective will be a kind of moment of truth. I hope that we will be strong enough to reach conclusions which tally with the Commission's proposal. I am afraid that if certain changes are made the structure of the budget will be worse than it is now. Thank you for your support.</p>

<p class="contents">Concerning the subject, I wish to thank Members of Parliament for accepting the urgency procedure, and the members of the Committee on Fisheries for their support and their efficiency in handling that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The tsunami disaster devastated the coastal areas of numerous Asian countries and, besides tourism, the fisheries and aquaculture sector of these countries was the most affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Council have already welcomed and encouraged the initiatives taken by the Commission, in particular the measures aimed at rebuilding the sector in the areas concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is only a specific part of a whole package of rehabilitation and restructuring measures. It aims to create the legal framework to allow Community vessels receiving public aid for permanent cessation to be transferred to countries affected by the tsunami, rather than being scrapped or reassigned for non-profitable purposes other than fishing. The intention is to make fishing capacity available in order to allow for a quick return to the activities on which the livelihood of countless coastal communities is completely dependent.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken particular care to ensure that the local needs are carefully assessed. In this respect, the role of FAO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, is decisive for the implementation of the rebuilding efforts in the area. This is on the agenda for the next FAO meeting of fisheries ministers in Rome on 12 March.</p>
<p class="contents">Two main guiding principles have determined our approach in this proposal. Firstly, a strong commitment to ensure consistency with the general objectives of the common fisheries policy and promote sustainability of the fishing activities in the long term. To achieve those objectives, we have proposed technical assistance to make an immediate impact assessment and design of the rehabilitation and reconstruction requirements for the areas concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, a monitoring system will be set up in order to avoid possible adverse effects on the local economy and to ensure that the vessels transferred meet the needs identified by FAO. In addition, we have also emphasised that the transfers must be in accordance with the third country’s requests and that they respect the local fishing traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the European Community must offer a mechanism making it possible to act swiftly, while establishing an effective monitoring and control system without imposing unnecessary administrative burdens. The present proposal respects these constraints. Indeed, the proposal will not require reprogramming in the Member States under the current structural regulation for the fisheries sector. It has the further advantage that there are no financial consequences for the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I would underline the political importance of this proposal. Faced with an immense destruction of thousands of vessels, this proposal alone will certainly have only a limited impact. The expected availability of suitable vessels, taking into account the principles of adaptability and sustainability, will allow us to meet only a fraction of the needs with this short-term measure. Doubtless, this specific and focussed action will be followed by other actions in the humanitarian field to address the immense needs also of the fishing sector in the affected countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you that the Council has already discussed this proposal at a technical level and Member States' reactions are overall very encouraging. I also welcome the amendments that were tabled by Parliament, which clearly has this issue very much at heart. The Commission can accept a number of them. Regarding the other amendments, I note that in many instances they are noteworthy in the sense that they go far beyond what this regulation may provide for and so, very regretfully, they cannot be taken on board as part of this regulation. Their spirit, however, is undeniably driven by a clear commitment to alleviate the suffering brought on by the tsunami.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the European Parliament will give a positive opinion on this proposal to enable me to move this regulation forward in the Council next Monday, on 28 February. This will allow the Member States to make the necessary changes in their internal regulations so that, if the needs are indeed established by FAO, we will be able to act quickly and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the amendments. The Commission can accept Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 2: the Commission is in agreement with the spirit of this amendment, but it is somewhat misplaced and inappropriate to have such a reference to education and training since this aspect is not within the scope with respect to third countries. However, I will be willing to make a declaration before adoption by Parliament later on, wherein the Commission will declare that appropriate training and educational measures towards fishermen in the countries hit by the tsunami should be encouraged and wherein the Commission will state its intention to provide an assessment of the needs, at the request of the third countries, through the expert facility which has been made available for the long-term rehabilitation of the fisheries sector in the affected countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 3, 18 and 19: again we agree with the spirit of these proposals, but the actions being proposed are provided for by the monitoring mechanism contemplated by the regulation. Providing for such detailed and specific amendments within the text of the regulation itself could, however, have the affect of making the regulation cumbersome and too difficult to implement. We are, therefore, of the view that there is no need for these specific amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept Amendments Nos 4 and 5.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 6: we have no problem with the substance and we are willing to look at this change with the Presidency and the Council and expect to be able to overcome legal and technical difficulties that may arise with introducing changes to a title at a late stage.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 7: there again we agree with the spirit, but we have difficulty in accepting the amendment because it goes beyond the scope of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 8, 9, 11 and 21: again, we agree with the spirit, but we feel that this is not the place to address such wider issues relating to the humanitarian assistance programmes. What this regulation enables us to do is to take a very concrete and specific action within the fisheries sector and more specifically within the FIFG regulation. Other initiatives will follow, not only to meet the overall humanitarian needs but also for the fisheries sector, but unfortunately they cannot be addressed in this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 10 and 12: the coming into force of these amendments to Regulation 2792/99 cannot be made dependent to specific requests being made by affected countries. I wish to point out that this regulation guarantees the participation of the third countries and I refer honourable Members to Article 1 of the current regulation, which amends Article 7 of the basic regulation, and which states that our actions are to be in accordance with the third countries' request.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 15: we agree with the spirit of these amendments and we will take them up with the Presidency and the Council to see how best they can be reflected in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 16: the regulation already provides in a number of instances for the assurance that fishing activity will be carried out in a sustainable manner. We, therefore, feel that this amendment is already taken into account in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">We can accept Amendment No 17, but we would like to limit the scope of the action to small-scale fishing vessels, as defined in Article 3 of Council Regulation 2371/2002 (the CFP reform regulation).</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 20: we feel that this point is sufficiently covered by the provision under which the vessels to be transferred should be for the benefit of the affected fishing communities, and so this amendment is not required.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 22: the Commission has difficulty accepting this amendment: whereas technically it may be sound, its scope clearly undermines the spirit with which the regulation is being adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The trouble is that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>
<p class="contents">20 000 vessels under 12 metres in size were destroyed by the tsunami in the affected countries. The Commission proposal is to send somewhere between 150 and 200 old, redundant vessels from the Mediterranean to help replace the 20 000 that were destroyed. It is, as the Commission has pointed out, no more than a symbolic gesture. It is nevertheless a very expensive symbolic gesture. The cost has been put at roughly EUR 9 million, with an additional EUR 400 000 to pay for transporting these vessels to the affected part of the Indian Ocean. Therefore we are talking about roughly EUR 47 000 per vessel with the costs to be met entirely by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reliably told from experts on the ground in the Indian Ocean that replacement vessels of exactly the size required can be built for EUR 2 000 each. For the same amount of money that we propose Member States should spend, we could build 3 500 fishing vessels. This would be a much more meaningful response.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's response to the amendments tabled by the various groups this morning would nevertheless suggest that the entire focus remains on this regulation to transfer vessels. I would suggest that the Commission refocuses and looks more closely at sending the things we can provide quickly, such as skilled experts, fishermen, carpenters, engineers, blacksmiths, boat builders, and the money to get people over there, as quickly as possible, to start rebuilding the kind of vessels they need to help replace the ones destroyed, instead of this nonsense of sending redundant, old, decrepit boats from the Mediterranean as a symbolic gesture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These boats could, then, be taken out of service in the European Union, but the victims of the tsunami in South-East Asia could reuse them if they wished and asked to do so; they would, indeed, be exactly what would meet their requirements. In order to provide emergency aid in this way, however, amendments must be made to the legal framework currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcome this opportunity, which will remain open to us only for a short period of time, although we are obviously aware of the many problems it entails. In our opinion helping people to help themselves is always the better option in the long term, and this should be apparent from our amendments. Yet we view this proposal as a political sign of solidarity, and will support it accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, the groundswell of solidarity provoked by the tsunami disaster on Boxing Day may have been even greater among the seafaring community, which is more aware than others of its consequences for populations most of whom lived from the sea’s resources.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, in response to this, Parliament, in its 13 January resolution, asked for an examination of the possibility of sending to the communities affected anything that might be of assistance to them, including boats. That is why Commissioner Borg and his services went to see things for themselves and are now asking us to approve the regulation authorising these potential transfers. As Mr Stevenson has just said, this announcement has stirred the feelings of some of my fellow Members, who are alarmed at the idea that Europe was in this way going to salve its conscience by simply sending its old vessels to people who would have no use for them and who would thereby be deprived of the resources essential for getting their economies going again.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, that is not what the Commission intends, since it has sent the necessary experts to look at how to reconstruct the devastated countries in the medium and long term. Authorising the transfer of a few dozen vessels suitable for the needs of the local populations and therefore requested by their authorities is therefore a short-term measure, one for the next few months. As you know, these vessels will be less than 12m long and must be less than 20 years old.</p>
<p class="contents">Before approving the Commission’s draft, as I hope we will, Parliament wanted, by means of a number of amendments, to clarify the terms for this transfer which, in particular, will not be made until the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has completed the study you mention, Commissioner. The FAO has the necessary expertise and authority and is responsible for coordinating aid from all over the world. The amendments also seek to introduce new recitals to make clear that this is obviously in addition to the funds granted for the reconstruction of the sector’s industries and infrastructures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a nice idea to export old fishing vessels, but it would not work. This is a clear case of the emperor’s new clothes. Everyone can see that the idea would not work, but no one dares to say so publicly and to scrap the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The FAO has not received any request for boats. On the contrary, both Indonesia and Sri Lanka have declined such offers. In addition, a conference of regional fishing organisations met last week in Sumatra, with representatives from all the countries affected. They oppose the export of old vessels. They would rather have assistance in building up their local shipyards and fishing fleets. That is what we must help them with.</p>
<p class="contents">At all events, our amendments are aimed at reducing the risk of this export of boats destroying sea beds and the local economy and damaging fish stocks with the wrong kind of equipment. I hope that the Commission acts on its good intentions, but its voting recommendations could have been more generous.</p>
<p class="contents">Is there anyone from the Council – yes, the Council – in this House? Can you see that the emperor has no clothes and scrap this proposal?

On further consideration, however, all of the difficulties come to mind and, on still further reflection, the question arises as to whether the proposal would create more problems than it would solve and, ultimately, of whether the costs might not outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly: what would be obtained in return for the money? If an amount similar to the total cost were spent on manufacturing boats locally, the benefit to local fisheries would be many times greater. It would also have the effect of supporting the local economy and the local shipbuilding industry, which need support in this emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the practicalities. Is it really so practical to collect these boats and transport them to the region? How should we handle distribution and allocation?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the matter of ecology. Completely different kinds of fishing are involved, different kinds of equipment are used and different catches are fished for. Sending a completely different kind of boat from those traditionally used in the area would be in danger of making fishing less sustainable and less environmentally friendly.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly: do the countries intended as recipients of these boats really want them? The answer to this question is, of course, the one we have received from the UN body FAO, which coordinates such matters: ‘no, they do not’. No request for these boats has been received; instead, the countries concerned want to be able to build their own boats, using their local traditions and their local techniques.</p>
<p class="contents">Having considered and twice re-considered this proposal, it becomes quite clear that it was a good idea but one that, on closer reflection, should be abandoned. It could undoubtedly be improved by adopting the amendments, especially those by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. This would make it a better proposal. Most sensible of all, however, would no doubt be for the Commission to understand the situation, withdraw the proposal and instead try to persuade the Member States to provide at least equivalent sums for increasing the number of boats locally in the countries hit by the disaster. That would bring greater benefit to those we all wish to help, that is to say the victims of the terrible tsunami disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives, millions lost close relatives or their livelihoods. The historically unparalleled demonstration of solidarity and generosity with which the rest of the world responded constituted a ray of hope in the middle of this tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">The fishing industry was hit particularly hard by the tsunami. In many cases, the survivors lost their boats, which are the tools upon which their livelihood depends. The proposal to help countries hit by the tsunami by giving them vessels from the EU is therefore morally commendable, but the measure would be a drop in the ocean, making the proposal almost absurd. A far better alternative would be to buy boats, suited to local purposes and needs, in the countries affected and in other neighbouring countries. This would also give the local economies a very badly needed boost.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is it obvious what constitutes the EU’s role as an international player in such contexts. There is a tendency for forces within the EU to use disasters to advance their own positions. New EU authorities, programmes and measures are proposed, and anyone questioning this development appears disloyal at this particular moment in history. Often, the truth is, however, that, in such situations, the EU Member States should coordinate financial and material resources through other international bodies, principally within the framework of cooperation with the UN. One example of this would be the urgent development of an early warning system, of the kind already in place in the Pacific, for tsunami disasters in the Indian Ocean. </p>
<p class="contents">I object to the use of international tragedies for the purpose of giving the EU new powers. The EU’s powers must be discussed under normal conditions and in the context of the principle of subsidiarity, and not determined by quick decisions in disaster situations. The European peoples’ support for global solidarity should not be abused with a view to undermining the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we also believe that it is important to do things quickly, but to do them well. In this regard, we can only applaud the fact that humanitarian aid is being directed towards the fishing sector in question, but we believe that opting exclusively for the transfer of vessels is not the most appropriate approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner says that she agrees with the spirit of many of the amendments; we would have liked the Commission to have presented a full package of measures to alleviate the problems faced by this sector and we believe that the method presented is not appropriate, since it has been rejected by the NGOs working in the area, which have received this proposal with great reservations. The FAO itself has stated that our good intentions may aggravate the problem rather than resolve it and, as far as I know, two countries have said that they do not want ships to be sent, and some of them have extreme restrictions such as, for example, the prohibition of fishing by vessels of more than 10 horsepower.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore not sufficient simply to ensure that we do not send large vessels, as the proposal states, but rather we must send appropriate vessels to the area, which are designed to anchor at shallow beaches and are made with materials which are resistant, amongst other things, to high tropical temperatures and humidity.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further problem, that of funding, and we had been promised it would be resolved. In this case, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said, there is no extra funding, which means that this burden is going to affect countries at the expense of an FIFG which has already been promised to them, and I very much doubt that this proposal can be at all effective.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, we would ask that the amendments which have been presented by the majority of these groups, which we have all signed and which we are going to support, and which propose other alternatives and furthermore propose accepting the European Commission’s proposal, be seen as a political message from this Parliament to the European Commission and the Council, and I hope it will become effective over the coming weeks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These two months must have been the most terrible eternity for the many thousands of human beings who have lost not only their families, their homes and their communities, but have also been deprived – and unfortunately remain deprived – of their only means of subsistence, especially those whose livelihood was fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal tabled by the Commission is therefore a welcome one and should be adopted by Parliament once the proposals for improvement, tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and other parliamentary groups, have been incorporated. The proposal must, however, be assessed realistically and in terms of its actual scale. In other words, it should be viewed as a limited, short-term solution that is little more than symbolic, bearing in mind that thousands of boats were destroyed and it is unlikely that this action will help to replace more than a few dozen vessels. In addition, doubt has also been raised as to the suitability of the vessels for their intended purpose, and the logistics of the proposal are becoming complex and costly, especially when it comes to transporting the vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">The initiative does have the merit, however, of demonstrating that the EU has not turned a blind eye to this aspect of the tragedy. Yet solidarity will only be effective if we go further, that is, if adequate funding is granted for building and rebuilding vessels <span class="italic">in situ</span>, especially small boats and traditional tools that are appropriate for local fishing methods. The funding in question can be secured by removing part of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance from the appropriations allocated to each Member State. To sum up, the Commission’s proposal should not be subject to demagogical criticism simply because it falls short of what is needed. Our primary objective is to do everything we can to bring it up to speed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one begrudges help to the people affected by the tsunami. Parliament, in its resolution on the tragedy, made special mention of those engaged in fishing, calling on the Commission to examine ways in which tangible aid in the form of vessels, gear, technical expertise and raw materials can be directed towards the affected communities. But there have been too many examples in the past of well-intentioned aid being left to rot because it was not suited to local conditions, or because there was not the wherewithal or the expertise to make use of it.</p>
<p class="contents">If decommissioned vessels are to be exported, this must be under stringent conditions as to suitability, processed in accordance with the full assessment of needs, only upon request by the country concerned and accompanied by appropriate assistance. Because of concerns about distortions of local economies and the depletion of fish stocks, we also seek some further reassurances. First, about where the ownership of vessels will rest and second that this is purely an emergency measure and will not open the back door to a wider export scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Given such reassurance, and on the understanding that both the Commission and the Council will take our reservations seriously, it is possible to support the proposal. The Commissioner has made some commitment in this regard, but I am disappointed by the reluctance to incorporate much by way of amendment into the regulation itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commission and the Council to take a much more comprehensive approach to rebuilding fishing communities. The swift commitment of support to projects like that offered by the Maritime Rescue Institute in Stonehaven, Scotland, is just one example, and it is much more directly in tune with Parliament's earlier call. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, that does not mean that these vessels are suitable for use in any area. The more I have looked into the actual situation in the tsunami-hit countries, the more sceptical I have become about the value of this particular proposal. It may be a symbolic gesture and it may be that a small number of vessels could be used or converted, but I do not think that will be of major assistance to areas that were devastated.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the amendments tabled by the various groups. I very much regret that the Commission has not agreed to support them. If this proposal is adopted in some way by the Council, I believe that the amendments would bring about very considerable improvements, not only to in a practical sense, but to its intention and spirit. A measure such as this should be looked at as an enabling measure; not to enable Member States to actively offload unsuitable vessels to the these countries, but to enable those countries that have been affected to request certain vessels to be transferred to their areas if they are suitable for use or conversion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are incapable of either predicting or preventing such disasters, and they act as a reminder of how insignificant we are in the face of nature. They also remind us that animals are sometimes better at sensing danger and preparing to face it than we are. This should act as a warning to us all against feeling too clever, too overconfident and too sure of our own omnipotence. There is a force more powerful than we are, and from time to time it humbles us and reminds us of our insignificance.</p>
<p class="contents">The rest of the world responded to the tsunami disaster by making extremely generous donations, whether on an individual, governmental or institutional basis. The question that must be asked, however, is whether we will succeed in putting these donations to appropriate use, and whether we will succeed in getting them to where they are most needed. Immediately after the disaster, there was a lack of everything, including water, food, tents and blankets. The world already has a certain amount of experience in the rapid provision of such items, and aid reached the victims quickly. The provision of long-term aid is a different story, though, and another opportunity for us to be reminded of our own small-mindedness. Jackals tend to appear wherever money is involved, with the sole aim of snatching something for themselves. This gives rise to a number of problems, such as the way in which the money should be shared out, what should be rebuilt first, which institutions or parties should be used to transfer the money and who can be trusted.</p>
<p class="contents">The tsunami destroyed the coastal and seaside economy. The tourist industry was hit hardest, including the sex tourism industry, for which many of the regions devastated were renowned, but the fishing industry was also hit. The question is whether, and to what extent, money that people have been generous enough to donate should be used to rebuild the sex tourism industry, with its escort agencies, massage parlours and brothels. We must also ask ourselves whether we will succeed in reassuring those who have donated money that their money will not be used for such purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are debating a proposal to transfer fishing boats to fishermen whose livelihoods were destroyed by the tsunami. This is the best possible form of assistance that could be provided. In the European Union we pay fishermen to scrap their boats. Surely, if the boats are still seaworthy we should instead give them to fishermen in the areas hit by the tsunami disaster who have lost their own boats? Provided the costs of transferring fittings for these boats and other related costs are not too high, aid should be targeted at such measures. We can be confident that donors will be happy with such an arrangement. </p>
<p class="contents">The proposal deserves our support, but it is only a drop in an ocean of needs. We should do more, by allowing aid to be used to build fishing boats that meet the specific needs of the tsunami victims. We would then be confronted with the familiar problem of who should benefit from these orders and from being paid to build the boats. The countries hit by the tsunami should be the ones to benefit wherever possible, with donor countries taking second place. At the same time, those who build the boats must agree to forsake their profit, and to earn only a minimal amount of money. We should also rebuild other branches of the coastal industry destroyed by the tsunami, such as the shellfish farming industry, but we should take care to ensure that aid is not granted to the tourist industry, in particular the part of it that preys on human weakness.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sudre (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission’s laudable desire to transfer Community vessels, which would otherwise be scrapped, to the Asian countries affected by the tsunami disaster is all to its credit. It is only right that the European Union should show solidarity when major natural disasters occur.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my concern here about measures of this kind. There is a real risk that the vessels sent to the Asian countries will be suited neither to those countries’ fishing habits nor to their environment. Worse, they could be a source of pollution. Let us not add to the tragedy of the tidal wave that of seeing unsuitable vessels abandoned to pollute those countries’ coastlines.</p>
<p class="contents">My other concern is about the cost of transport. The European Commission estimates that transferring fishing vessels from the European Union to the countries affected by the tsunami will cost around EUR 50 000 per vessel. In that case, would it not be better to give that money directly to the countries concerned, which could then build far more boats that are in keeping with their traditions, especially since the NGOs that are in contact with the fishermen have told us they can build a vessel for around EUR 1 200?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that two essential conditions must be satisfied for Europe’s action. The request for the transfer of shipping vessels must come from the Asian countries themselves; it would in fact already appear that neither Indonesia nor Sri Lanka wish to receive any. Moreover, the FAO has not received any requests for this kind of transfer. I am also convinced that the transfer of the vessels must only be one part of our efforts. Community humanitarian aid funds must also be mobilised for the reconstruction of the fishing sector. Aid could for example take the form of sending experts and fishermen to help with the rebuilding of the local fishing infrastructures. The FAO report we are expecting at the beginning of March will be crucial in determining the strategy to be followed by the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It will be some time before the full extent of the loss and damage suffered by the fishing industry is known. But severe losses and/or damage to fishing vessels of all types have been reported from countries affected by the tsunami disaster, in particular Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and India.</p>
<p class="contents">Sri Lanka, for instance, has lost nearly 70% of its entire fishing fleet, according to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Most of the fishing in the area is carried out by thousands of small boats of around 4.8 m in length. As well as the loss of fishermen's lives and boats and gear, harbours, production plants and freezing plants all suffered extensive damage. Normal fishing activity cannot resume without intervention and investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Understandably, we want to help. The urgency before us today relates to transferring vessels from EU Member States to countries hit by the tsunami. The proposal has been strongly criticised, as we hear this morning, as being inappropriate because the climate and fishing practices of EU countries vary from those of south-east Asia. I can understand why concern has been expressed over how suitable EU boats may be for fishing in south-east Asia. However, I welcome the proposal before us today on the basis that it allows for the transfer of boats that meet the restricted criteria and that might be useful.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome amendments tabled on behalf of the PSE Group by Mr Kindermann, both singly and jointly with other groups, in particular the amendments that ensure that adverse effects on fisheries resources and the local economy are avoided, that the transfer is accompanied by any appropriate training, that boats are suitable and that the transfer meets the requirements of the FAO's needs assessments and is requested by the third country. On that basis, I am happy to support the urgency and I call on colleagues to do likewise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This week, the FAO has written to this House to say that, firstly, we were mentioned seven times in the Commission’s proposal, about which it itself was not consulted even once. Secondly, it informs us that no governments are currently asking for European boats, and, thirdly, that the vessels and the industrial fish sector on the Atlantic coast are in every respect different from the traditional canoes and catamarans of Sri Lanka and India. A fourth point is that local boatyards must do the repair work, for that is what they are good at, and that provides the people there with money, work and the wherewithal to earn a living. Our money would buy something like 2500 boats in place of the 200 referred to here. Fifthly, we must prevent our vessels from further interfering in the already gravely ravaged fishing grounds and local fishing communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The only conclusion to be drawn from this is: help the local fishermen in the boatyards, but do not send ships, or else, no matter how good our intentions, we will be inflicting another tsunami on the coasts of Asia. I am disappointed that the Commission is willing to accept only 3 of this House’s 22 amendments, which, let me add, I was happy to support. All this, along with the FAO letter and the reports from the NGOs on the ground, leads me to vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, while the Commission is trying to find innovative solutions to an unprecedented disaster, I would urge it to remain pragmatic about the impact of this gesture. This proposal is well-intentioned. I appreciate we all want to do all we can to help the hundreds and thousands of people who have lost their homes and their livelihoods because of the tsunami but it is important that this is additional help and not replacement help or help in kind and that this does not count towards the EUR 350 million that the EU has already committed to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to ask the Commission to look at the best use for the larger decommissioned boats. The fishing communities in India and Thailand were equally devastated and I believe that the more developed fishing industry in these countries may be better placed and better equipped, to use the larger vessels, so this idea should be explored. Obviously, these boats will not be of any use to the individual, local fishermen, but they could be used by cooperatives or SME businesses. It is important that all the countries are treated equally and that we explore the right avenue for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the ways in which non-financial assistance will be granted is the transfer of second-hand boats to fishermen who were affected by the tsunami, and who lost not only their families and their closest friends, but also their homes and the means of earning their living. When the House held a vote on this resolution on Tuesday morning, no one was in any doubt as to whether to vote in favour. This was a natural expression of emotion and solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of questions that must be asked, however. Will the Commission pay out compensation to all of those to whom it has been guaranteed? To what extent will this make extra demands upon the European Union’s budget, and why does the Commission wish to transfer some of the cost to the Member States? Will European fishermen who have decided to give up their jobs receive the compensation promised by the EU? Will there be any chance of compensation for companies and steelworks that had already been awarded contracts to demolish boats and had incurred organisational costs, and will jobs created under the previous programme be safeguarded? Should the Commission consider providing assistance for building new ports and shipyards in countries affected by the tsunami, instead of restricting itself to the transfer of old fishing boats?

I shall attempt to address all the questions that have been asked, but I should like to start my answer with a phrase that Mr Kindermann used; ‘a political sign of solidarity’. Our aim is to send out precisely such a sign by means of this project, which is merely a small part of a much larger aid measure, and one way in which we can provide aid rapidly and to those who need it. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span>With your permission, I am now going to give a more specific answer to a few particular questions. First, the question of the calculation. I have heard talk of EUR 47 000, 50 000 per vessel. As has already been explained to the Committee on Fisheries, these figures are not correct. The vessels’ owners are paid a scrapping premium for them in any case. The only thing that changes is that the vessels are not scrapped but transferred, and the transport cost is no more than EUR 4 000 per vessel. That is therefore the cost to be taken into account and not the fanciful figures that have been mentioned. Incidentally, they are not small boats. Small boats like dinghies can of course be rebuilt on the spot. What we are talking about here, however, are medium-sized vessels of not more than 12 metres, and the necessary capacity for building such vessels does not exist on the spot.</p>
<p class="contents">Another question was about the age of the vessels. The average age of European vessels in service is 25 years; that of the vessels that will be exported to the countries affected by the tsunami will be between 5 and 20 years. We are not therefore talking about very old boats.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of experts, I would like to say that experts have already been sent out and more will be sent. Moreover, it is at our request that the FAO is making an assessment of needs and this point will be on the agenda for the 12 March ministerial meeting, at which Mr Borg will represent the Commission. We are all in favour of close cooperation with the FAO; we will see to it that our experts are able to contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the establishment of the early warning system is concerned, together with experts from international bodies, the Commission is in the process of setting up early warning systems by transferring our technologies to the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to say very clearly that the condition of the vessels and their suitability for the needs will be examined by experts. The needs will be assessed by the FAO. We want to be ready if requests come in. We have already had a request for vessels from Thailand. Finally, Mr President, I believe this is a moral question. Can we continue to scrap vessels here if they can be of use to fishermen on the other side of the world?</p>

At the beginning of this debate, the Commission informed us that it would not accept most of the amendments that have been agreed between the political parties in this House. That now means that instead of sending meaningful help to the devastated fishing communities by way of skilled experts, fishermen, engineers, boat-builders and money, we are going to send one or two old, redundant boats at massive cost as a purely political gesture. That is not helpful. The FAO has written to the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries to explain that Sri Lanka and Indonesia reject this help. They do not want these boats. Under these circumstances we should think again, before the final resolution is voted upon.</p>

<p class="contents">So far as the cost is concerned, I will repeat what I said so that everyone can hear. There is no cost of EUR 47 000, 50 000 or 100 000 per vessel. In any case, these are vessels the owners of which are paid a scrapping premium. Now the final destination for these vessels is not scrapping but transfer; that is what has changed. The transfer of a vessel costs EUR 4 000 at the most, and they are vessels that are too large to be built on the spot.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are supplying such vessels only if we are asked for them. At present, we have a request from Thailand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This amendment mentions the recent declaration of the Donors Conference for Colombia held in Cartagena. Also involved are the identical Amendments 4, 19 and 23, tabled by the Socialist and ALDE Groups.</p>
<p class="contents">These concern support for the recommendations of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia. These are clearly not mutually exclusive. It would be quite wrong for Amendments 4, 19 and 23 to fall if Amendment 15 is adopted, as the voting list suggests. The services have advised me that this problem can be resolved by voting on the PSE and ALDE amendments as recital Ia (new), rather than as amendments to recital I. I ask for your support on this, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is established in Bogota by agreement with the Colombian Government. It is actually funded by the European Union. I hope the entire House will reaffirm its support for the work of the Office by supporting the PPE-DE amendments and the PSE/ALDE amendments. Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra agrees that it should be voted separately, although he advises his Group to vote against. I regret that, but I am grateful for his support in the technical matters concerning these amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the intention of this proposal is to implement sanctions – and they will hopefully be implemented with the necessary rigour – intended to thwart anyone who may constitute a threat to the peace and national reconciliation process in Côte d’Ivoire. Given the fragile nature of this peace and national reconciliation process, it requires all the international protection that it can be accorded. Furthermore, the sanctions laid down in this proposal do not concern – nor are they intended to concern – the wider population; rather, they are solely aimed at certain persons.

We have had advice from the WWF and from the NGOs on the ground, and I have also sought an opinion from the FAO. It is evident that the boats that we want to send there are completely inappropriate, being different in terms of structure; the fishing techniques used are different, and, without adaptation, aid can be counter-productive in its effects. The operational maintenance of the boats we are willing to donate will also bring problems in its train. Let me add to that the fact that the FAO confirmed to me that most of the fishing grounds in that area have been over-fished and that we have to take into account the limited biological capacities that exist there. It is a matter of absolute necessity that fishing techniques be adapted accordingly. As if that were not enough, ladies and gentlemen, the FAO also stresses that the affected countries do not wish to import vessels, whether old or new. The Indonesian and Sri Lankan Governments have themselves told the FAO that they have no desire for such action. The authorities and the fishing community would far rather receive support in building boats for themselves, adapted to local traditions and methods of fishing. The FAO has confirmed that there is ample technical capacity in the area to build these vessels there. In short, this sort of support is unwanted and inappropriate. The Commission has even stated that it will accept only 3 of the 21 amendments we have passed, and so, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a very large majority of my group has voted against this proposal for a regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I insist that the Commission take the FAO advice before taking any action; that they only respond to requests from tsunami countries and do not impose the transfer of vessels on any particular country; and that they carry out a full cost/benefit analysis of shipping boats to the tsunami region, as opposed to building boats in that region.</p>

I was very disappointed by the Commissioner's lacklustre explanation and her rationale for rejecting Parliament's amendments. They were amendments that would have moved the vote in the right direction. Nevertheless, I believe that the proposal was a flawed gesture from the EU and not the sort of aid we should be intent on sending.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in the north and east of Sri Lanka recently. I saw at first hand the devastation. I saw boats ruined and lives devastated, but I saw nothing to make me believe that discarded, old, unwanted European vessels would be of use to them. Nor can I believe it is economic to try to transfer them: a few hundred boats to replace thousands that were lost. The people of Sri Lanka and elsewhere in South Asia need real help. Eight-and-a-half weeks on from 26 December, here we are offering a few clapped-out boats.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe in real aid; helping the people to rebuild their lives themselves. Give them the tools to build their own boats, suitable vessels. Lend them the labour, by all means. Help them make nets for continued fishing and everything else that they need. At the moment that aid is not getting through in the way that it should.

<p class="contents">The scale of the disaster means that a major effort is required on the part of the international community to support the rebuilding of this key sector</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the proposal to transfer vessels to these countries that were destined for the scrapheap in the various Member States illustrates the hypocrisy of nominal and barely practicable aid that does not address the needs on the ground.

These industrial activities account for a large proportion of the population of the enlarged Europe and, in recent years, there has been substantial public investment in innovation and development in European industrial interests.</p>

There are so many, it would be impossible for me to list them all. What is worse, a recital to the resolution that was adopted expresses concern that not enough of them are mentioned. This disturbing list of countries does not include any Member States of the European Union. That really is a problem, ladies and gentlemen, because I think we ought to put our own house in order first, the Kingdom of Belgium for example, where we have recently witnessed the sorry spectacle of an unbelievable legal action brought by an agency directly dependent on Prime Minister Verhofstadt and financed by him. I am referring to the ‘Centre for Equal Opportunities’, the director of which is a Dominican by the name of Johan Leman, a new kind of Torquemada, who, following scandalous proceedings, brought about the <span class="italic">de facto</span> prohibition of the Vlaams Blok, a perfectly legal and peaceful party, simply because of its beliefs. It is an absolute scandal, but it has never been mentioned in this House other than by members of the political grouping in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what should we say about the situation in many European countries, including France? France, where ‘thought crime’ is hunted down in many fields; where making reference to the crimes of communism during the second world war is banned on the pretext of revisionism; where criticism of immigration policy is banned on the pretext of combating racism; where mentioning a legitimate national preference is banned on the pretext of fighting xenophobia; where, only recently, on the outrageous initiative of Mr Perben, stating a preference for the natural family over homosexual or lesbian partnerships is banned on the pretext of fighting homophobia; that is the scandal our Parliament should be concerned about. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a recent meeting I attended in Geneva on the issue of human rights in North Korea, in the presence of the special rapporteur for North Korea, we were told we must have a new resolution next month because there was no dialogue, something we lost with the initial resolution.

I did not vote to support this report because, while much of the content of the work programme is acceptable, I was concerned about what is not there. I am concerned that the EU continues to overregulate; it continues to produce legislation that is too detailed, imposes too much red tape on enterprise, and is significantly harming the prosperity of Europe and its Member States, including, of course, the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned that we do not see serious enough measures put in place in this work programme to try and get serious financial control over the EU budget. It is not acceptable that, for nearly a decade, the EU has failed to produce a budget that is capable of being signed off by its own auditors, and that over 80% of the EU budget is not properly accounted for. It is taxpayers' money, and I would have liked to have seen a Commission work programme that took this scandalous situation much more seriously and proposed action to deal with it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also very much like to see a Commission work programme that considered ways in which powers could be returned to Member States, to decentralise power in the European Union, rather than driving forward more integration with the euro and the European constitution, both of which I firmly oppose.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I am pleased about is that Amendment 64, the amendment on Cyprus, proposed by the Liberal Group, was rejected. That would have sought to increase economic ties with the unrecognised regime in Northern Cyprus. It is important that we give financial support to Northern Cyprus, but that must be through the recognised democratic Government of the Republic of Cyprus. It would not be acceptable to have direct links with a regime that is not recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for the embargo is the initial invasion by Turkey that took place so many years ago. This is not an international boycott: it is simply that the regime there is not capable of issuing export certificates. Therefore, the embargo is a reflection of the illegal nature of the invasion by Turkey. That is why I cannot vote to lift the embargo, but I would support legitimate financial support being given to Northern Cyprus but only with the consent and cooperation of, and via, the democratic, recognised, lawful Government of Cyprus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no upward fiscal and social harmonisation, and the anti-social trends of the draft ‘working hours directive’ are maintained. It calls for flexibility, for structural reforms to take account of ageing, which will call retirement schemes and labour law into question.

It lacks ambition in development aid, especially with the creation of a tax on capital movements.</p>

It is now fundamental for the Commission to examine the state of Member States’ preventive systems in greater detail and to come forward with proposals, in cooperation with the competent national authorities, for framing coherent national prevention policies based on an overall EU strategy. To this end, it is essential to improve the statistical system for accidents at work, since the absence of reliable and compatible statistics makes it difficult to devise Community policies and promote them in an effective way. Health and safety at work represents one of the Community’s most important policies, and safe and healthy organisations have a very positive knock-on effect on the economy and on competitiveness in a society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whenever we speak about health and safety at work we immediately think of how far we have come since the beginning of the industrialisation process. This unavoidable thought process illustrates that, as far as this issue is concerned, what is acceptable today will fall short of what is required tomorrow. In other words, we are increasingly demanding and, with regard to this issue, that is a sign of significant progress. That is the first consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I do not agree entirely with some of the points made in the report, and whilst I would change the order of priorities in some cases, I welcome the thrust of its content, because its guiding principles are close to mine on this issue. Indeed, bearing the above in mind, I believe that the defence of health and safety at work is a prerequisite to the kind of civilisation that we must promote, and, moreover, amounts to an obligation on the part of employers, because businesses also have social obligations. In addition, the better the conditions at work, the greater the productivity, the better the quality of work and the lower the losses incurred, both individually and collectively. Consequently, I voted in favour.</p>

It has already happened in Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, more recently in Togo, and may well happen soon in Egypt as well. It sometimes happens that elections are announced to decide the succession, but it is known in advance who will emerge from them as the victor. In Togo, this step was missed out; the Gnassingbé family took power by violent means from the Olympio family a long time ago, and they want to hold on to it. An amendment to the constitution, accomplished in the twinkling of an eye following the death of the Head of State, prevented the President of the country’s parliament from succeeding him temporarily and preparing new presidential elections in good time, and instead made it possible for his son to take over the state as if he were the heir to private property. The fact is that the son is in no more legitimate a position than his father; what is happening is the continuation of a long-past <span class="italic">coup d'état</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Continuing this state of affairs has robbed Togo of the hope that it, having been a German and then a French colonial possession, and then for a long time a home-grown dictatorship, might develop into a democracy. Up to now, it has been cause for popular lamentation that power has almost always been in the hands of profiteers who were supported by military might and were not concerned with serving the national interest; their concern was rather with taking up their privileged positions. Not only in Togo, not only in Africa, but throughout the world too, this state of affairs must come to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of being selective in our outrage at what is happening in Togo, let us help to put a stop to the military and economic protection of regimes of this kind. That is what matters at the present moment. The unfortunate fact that it is the rule rather than an exception means that we have to ensure that these events do not repeat themselves and that it would be a good thing if free elections could be held in Togo within a short period of time.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Togo is similar to many other West African countries in that it is an artificial state, created to serve colonial interests, and indeed one only needs to glance at a map to see this, as Togo, in common with most other West African countries, is shaped like a narrow handkerchief. Togo was governed first by German and then by French colonial masters, but its borders were imposed artificially, and initially there was very little chance of it enduring in this form.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that Togo’s borders were drawn on a drawing board, with entire peoples and families being torn apart in the process, and other ethnic groups that had nothing in common being artificially merged, it must be said that in spite of this the country made every appearance of developing remarkably well for a number of years. It appeared to be an island of stability in West Africa, even though we are all aware that there have barely been any real democracies in our sense of the word in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet Eyadéma’s rule, as Mr Meijer has pointed out, has come ever more to resemble an extremely violent dictatorship, and attempts are now being made to put it on a hereditary basis. Without wishing to deny the fact that families and tribes have a different meaning in Africa than in our societies, it must be said that we cannot accept this hereditary dictatorship.</p>
<p class="contents">Our demands are therefore quite clear; resignation by the President, who came to power illegally, a reinstatement of the parliament’s legitimate President, free elections to be held without delay, and widespread respect for the rule of law and human rights. Above all, one thing must be clear; this time the African Union itself – and this is something I welcome greatly – as well as the West African Economic Community that is forming along the lines of the EU have made it very clear that they do not accept this illegal rule. I should like to thank both these communities, and see this as an encouraging sign that Africa is – albeit hesitantly – beginning to seize its own destiny in such issues, and deserves our full support in so doing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Togolese people and Togo nationals living in our European countries are looking to the European Parliament and the European Union to take a firm and resolute stance. They want our solidarity and new prospects for their future and that of their children. This requires first of all a genuine return to popular sovereignty.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two conditions for that. The first is that Faure Gnassingbé must withdraw immediately and without argument and put an end to this hereditary dictatorship that he sought to install by military <span class="italic">coup</span> in defiance of democratic principles and the laws of his country and in violation of international law.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the restoration of constitutional legality and the resumption of pluralist dialogue involving all parties, including of course the opposition parties. Only Mr Natchaba, the speaker of the National Assembly, would be in a position to provide an interim government to prepare for presidential elections in accordance with the constitution. It will only be possible for Mr Natchaba to return to Togo if his safety can be guaranteed, however.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, Mr President, I want to stress the justified concern expressed in this House yesterday by a representative delegation of associations of democratic movements and human rights associations about the real risks that political activists, human rights activists and journalists are running today.</p>
<p class="contents">With my colleague, Marie-Arlette Carlotti, we received them and listened to them with the greatest attention, because some of them, or members of their families, have been physically ill treated and abused under the Eyadéma dictatorship. They made an emotional appeal to us and to all international bodies to take definite concerted action to restore democracy permanently to Togo. Knowing that their country, which is already subject to sanctions, has suffered during the last several years, they nevertheless said they expected us to adopt a firm and tough attitude towards Togo if nothing happens to guarantee the holding of free elections. Our resolution responds to that expectation by referring to sanctions, some of which have already been imposed by the Economic Community of West African States, while others are planned by other international bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I want to stress the need for targeted measures to be taken quickly concerning the supply of arms and transfers of money outside Togo. International bodies must also act to give the population the security necessary for future elections to be prepared for in an atmosphere of calm. It is essential that the political parties should be able to conduct a proper election campaign; it is equally essential that all the media do their duty by providing information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The good news, as Mrs Trautmann has emphasised, is that the Economic Community of West African States responded very quickly and positively. They insisted on the withdrawal of all their ambassadors, they applied trade sanctions, they banned arms sales and stopped issuing visas both for their own citizens to visit Togo and vice versa, for Togolese citizens to visit their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is a step in the right direction. We need the rest of the international community to follow that example. The European Community needs to support the democratic forces which, I am glad to say, exist inside Togo. We need to give them encouragement; we need to urge the army to stay in its barracks. As Mrs Trautmann has said, we need to try and work with Mr Natchaba to establish a situation whereby he can return to his country and organise fair and free elections.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea that this <span class="italic">coup d'etat</span> is popular is killed by the fact that, on seizing power, the president has had to ban all public demonstrations for two months. He has closed eight television and radio stations and has made sure that every other voice of opposition is oppressed. This is a coup in every sense of the word and we should show no sympathy for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Incidentally, EU aid to the country has been suspended since 1992, and the unconstitutional seizure of power, described as an hereditary dictatorship, has called into question any hope of normalising relations with the country that we might have had at the end of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has responded firmly by condemning what must be considered a <span class="italic">coup</span> <span class="italic">d'état</span> and by calling for a return to the constitutional order and respect for the principles of the rule of law. Mr Louis Michel has voiced a very firm position on behalf of the Commission. Everything we are doing and saying is therefore in support of the action taken by the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union, which have been exemplary in their handling of the Togo crisis. The actions of the international community have already begun to have an effect, since on 18 February Mr Gnassingbé agreed to hold presidential elections within the time laid down by the constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must also condemn the breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the days following the takeover. Demonstrations were banned and many radio and television stations were closed. The first demonstration was put down violently, pressure was put on journalists and arbitrary arrests were reported. It was because of international pressure that the Togolese Government started to backtrack. The right to demonstrate was restored on 18 February and some radio stations were able to resume broadcasting from 21 February.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as cooperation is concerned, Mr President, and in particular the ninth EDF, the Commission is therefore sticking to the conclusions of the consultations contained in the Council decision of 15 November 2004. There will be no new cooperation measures until free and transparent elections have been held, and obviously that now also means presidential elections, which are part of the process of returning to the rule of law. There will therefore be no resumption of EU aid outside that framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council decision of 15 November last also provided for a partial resumption of cooperation. All the projects concerned are <span class="italic">de</span> <span class="italic">facto</span> suspended until the situation is clarified. So far as the money remaining from previous project-funding EDFs is concerned, the Commission intends to organise support for the presidential and legislative elections should the government express a desire to hold them soundly and transparently and if the time available allows.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the proposal for targeted sanctions, in its statement of 20 February the European Union indicated that it reserves the right to take measures to support the action taken by the Economic Community of West African States. In general, the Commission supports Parliament’s draft resolution, which is in line with the proposal and position adopted by the European Union and backed by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Just as we showed our solidarity with the protagonists of the ‘orange’ revolution in Ukraine a few weeks ago, we must today give our support to the Togolese demonstrators who are refusing to accept this <span class="italic">coup</span> <span class="italic">d'état</span> and are being harshly repressed for doing so. There have already been several deaths in the demonstrations taking place in Lomé. It is all absolutely unbearable and intolerable. Europe must bring all its weight to bear in rejecting this hereditary dictatorship, which is backed by certain Mafia financial networks, calling first of all for the resignation of Fauré Gnassingbé and then for the drawing up of a new constitution. That is the only way to guarantee the holding of free and transparent elections, to ensure the return to democracy of a country that has been bled dry and reduced to poverty by General Eyadéma’s dictatorship and to enable the European Union to resume its cooperation with Togo, which has been suspended since 1993 and which the Togolese people greatly need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

A magnificent parade involving tens of thousands of participants and several hundred thousand spectators demonstrated the full extent of the cultural wealth of the country, with its sherpas, monks, temple dancers, sadhus, mahouts, mandala artists and mountaineers.</p>
<p class="contents">I took part in this parade with the organisation Friends of Nepal. We marched through Kathmandu and past King Birendra, who enjoyed the highest respect of 95-98% of the Nepalese people, both as a person and as a champion of the constitutional monarchy. This makes the contrast with King Gyanendra, seven years later, appear all the starker. He has dismissed yet another prime minister, and dozens of politicians, human rights activists and journalists have been taken into custody or placed under house arrest. He now intends to rule as an autocrat for three years.</p>
<p class="contents">The question that needs to be asked is why not one prime minister in recent years has managed to hold free elections, and the answer is that agreement has never been reached between the various parties, not to mention with the Maoists. The main reason, however, is the lack of security in the country. People are living in fear, and by no means only in western Nepal. Two thirds of the country is now under the control of Maoist rebels, and inadequately-trained police officers fall victim time and time again to lethal attacks. The civil war has claimed 10 000 lives so far and shows no sign of coming to an end, with tourism, the country's main source of income, having been brought almost to a standstill.</p>
<p class="contents">I am afraid that the Maoists will gain further supporters following the coup of 1 February. The state of emergency will be used to place further restrictions on human rights, and it is for this reason that it is a cause of great concern to us in the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. By way of example, key places of refuge for Tibetans who have been forced to leave their homeland have been closed, including the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office. For the past 15 years, this Office has supported the work of the UNHCR refugee centre in Kathmandu, with which I myself am familiar, and at present around 1 000 asylum seekers are living there.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Office of the Representative of the Dalai Lama, which was established in 1959, has been closed. The situation is becoming increasingly desperate. Commissioner, I welcome the initiatives taken by the European Union, as well as those taken by India and the USA, one example of these being that the King has been called upon to end the state of emergency within 100 days. A representative of the European Commission who was present at the meeting of our SAARC Delegation this morning said that a number of funding programmes would be suspended, in order to strengthen democracy by means of economic pressure. Fortunately, however, development aid will continue to be granted, and targeted at the poorer sections of the population and local human rights organisations and NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be delighted if the issue of human rights violations in Nepal were to appear on the agenda of the session of the UN Commission on Human Rights to be held in Geneva. Nepalese democracy is only 15 years old; it is still fragile, and must be protected rather than destroyed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is facing a dilemma. On the one hand we cannot afford to waste any time in taking a stance on this issue. That is exactly why we are aiming to adopt a position today. On the other hand, however, we have no detailed knowledge of the precise reasons behind the <span class="italic">coup d'état</span> staged by the King of Nepal, although that knowledge would be extremely useful for us. If we delay on this account, however, it is likely that our intervention will come too late, and rapid intervention is key.</p>
<p class="contents">The King has announced that he wishes to mount a more effective fight against the Maoist guerrilla movement, but at the same time he has closed the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office, as Mr Mann mentioned a short time ago. In addition to this closure, Nepal has stopped its aid to Tibet, which was intended to strengthen the country’s resistance against China's aggression. Against this background, the reasons given by the King appear somewhat unconvincing.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must adopt a stance on this issue rapidly, as if we leave it too late we will be unable to achieve our goal, which is to prevent further criminal acts. I believe we should be reassured that the more active diplomatic measures taken by other countries, such as the United States and India, are appropriate. India is a neighbour of Nepal, and so it may well have its own reasons for taking diplomatic action. These may be reasons we would not entirely subscribe to if we were familiar with them. The measures taken by other countries such as the United States, however, should convince us that that theirs is a course of action we should also be following.</p>
<p class="contents">All rights have been suspended by the King, and while we have not forgotten the tragedy that befell the royal family several years ago, since that time no questions have been asked by the international community or international organisations as to the legitimacy of the royal rule. There are therefore a number of considerations that must be weighed up. As I said earlier, the reasons behind these events are unclear, but they are a source of some concern. Furthermore, and reiterating Mr Mann’s comments, we cannot condone cutting off aid to Tibet, just as we cannot agree to the suspension of civil rights, to arrests, to the closure of press outlets or to far-reaching restrictions on freedom of speech. We are therefore fully justified in taking action, and we should adopt the resolution. Let us hope that a rapid reaction by this House, along with the measures taken by other countries, will go some way towards normalising the situation in Tibet. Many thanks, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Both these destinations for alternative holidays have since become places of horror to which nobody goes any more as a tourist or as somebody in search of a better world. In both countries, over past decades, various attempts have been made at imposing from the top downwards an authoritarian monolith lacking any real support from a majority of the population. The outside world, too, has an interest in putting governments in the saddle or imposing one new regime or another.</p>
<p class="contents">It is under such circumstances that people, on realising that they cannot bring about change by peaceful means, reach for their weapons. In Nepal, one king after another has dismissed democratically-elected governments in the belief that they could do a better job themselves. In so doing, they have not only incurred the hostility of a wide variety of political parties, but have also provoked popular uprisings. Insurgents are now in control of much of the country, particularly its western parts. The warring factions on both sides will stop at nothing.</p>
<p class="contents">While this is going on, mainstream politicians are in dispute about how best to gain the upper hand over the insurgents, whether through one-man rule by the king or by means of parliamentary democracy. It is Belgian weapons suppliers that protect the King against the insurgents. There seems to be no prospect of an end to this misery for anyone, and yet a stop must be put to it. The traditions that Mr Mann celebrates may well not return that quickly, but the people of Nepal still have the right to make their own choices, to opt for democracy and human rights. Let us not impose limits on the people of Nepal’s ability to choose for themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must all remember, however, that although the European Union's Code of Conduct in the field of arms exports explicitly prohibits sales to countries in armed conflict, certain European governments, such as the government of the United Kingdom, have been selling arms to the Nepalese Government over the last three years.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the resolution we are voting on today is of crucial importance in terms of clarifying the European Union's position on the peace process and on human rights in Nepal. Given the seriousness of the situation, we must firstly welcome London's decision, and that of the Indian Government, to suspend all military aid to the current Nepalese Government.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Union must strongly insist that King Gyanendra immediately suspend the state of emergency and engage in a political process aimed at resolving the conflict, based on justice and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the European Union must urge the Maoist guerrillas to commit themselves to respecting international humanitarian law and to signing a humanitarian and human rights agreement with the governmental security forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, in accordance with the resolution we adopted this morning on the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, we must also urge that Commission to adopt a specific resolution on Nepal and to appoint a Special Rapporteur to monitor the human rights situation in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with reference to Mr Mann’s invitation — with whom I entirely agree — we must not forget that the situation in Nepal has a regional dimension, particularly with regard to its neighbour Tibet. To this end, we must demand that the Nepalese Government reopen the Tibet Refugee Welfare Office, as well as the Dalai Lama’s representation in Kathmandu. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He sacked the Government and assumed direct powers himself. This follows on from a decade-long conflict, which has cost 11 000 lives. The Nepalese people have suffered a legacy of human rights abuses, both from the security forces and from the Maoist rebels. They have suffered torture, detention, disappearances and unlawful killing.</p>
<p class="contents">Communication links with the outside world have been severed and, hidden from public scrutiny, the risk of further abuse escalates, according to Amnesty International. Radio news broadcasts have been shut down, foreign news channels taken off air and local media barred from publishing news or commentary without prior approval. In the immediate aftermath, telephone lines were severed, and some mobile phone services have not resumed.</p>
<p class="contents">Approximately 3 000 people are currently under house arrest according to Nepalese Government sources. The people who have been arrested are either senior members of the ousted government, human rights defenders or student and trade union leaders. Access to them has been restricted. They should either be charged or tried under due process of the law, or released forthwith.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the Member States provide more than EUR 100 million in aid per year. All military assistance should be stopped now.

It cannot be overlooked that King Gyanendra's actions on 1 February were a sad day for democracy in Nepal. Neither can we ignore the actions of the terrorists. The European Parliament cannot just stand by.</p>
<p class="contents">Nepal, as we have heard, is a desperately poor nation with an unfortunate history of conflict and has recently suffered under terrorist attacks from the Maoist rebels. This Himalayan country faces several problems, including the issue of refugees from Bhutan. The dissolution of the Nepalese Parliament does not help the situation of the common Nepalese people. On the contrary, the Nepalese need stability and democracy in order to prosper economically and politically.</p>
<p class="contents">The most immediate actions that we demand of the Nepalese authorities are: the lifting of the state of emergency; the release of all political prisoners under house arrest or detention in prison; and the lifting of the media embargo, to allow freedom of the press, national and international.</p>
<p class="contents">In the medium and long term, we must also examine the ways that the EU and other international bodies can help. So, I ask the Commission and the Council to support the following three suggestions. First, that the EU look very closely into our conflict resolution programmes and identify other innovative solutions to help reduce poverty. This is conducive to reducing the vulnerability of the Nepalese to the Maoist rebels.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would request that the Member States impose sanctions in their bilateral programmes. That would send a clear message that Member States do not approve of what has happened. However, we must be careful not to penalise the ordinary people, as that would alienate us from helping them.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must look at the diplomatic efforts we could make. That could include arbitrating between the monarchy and other political parties, so as to encourage them both to the negotiating table, where steps towards multi-party democracy could be made. Furthermore, we need to explore the possibility of sending a neutral third party, such as Javier Solana, the EU High Representative, or the United Nations, to formulate a road map to peace and democracy in Nepal. It might even be helpful to send a delegation from Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to stress the importance of the restoration of fundamental freedoms in Nepal, and the role we can play to encourage and support a democratic future. However, the EU must act with caution: there are dangers in this unstable time of aggravating a fragile situation. We must remember Nepal's fairly precarious geographical situation between India, Pakistan and China. So, this small country is very significant for regional security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have heard that the King has declared a state of emergency, dismissed the government, assumed direct power and suspended civil rights indefinitely. Since then the King has continued to suppress the media and potential opposition, detaining thousands of people, including politicians, student leaders, human rights activists, journalists, professors and other important public figures. A few have been released since then.</p>
<p class="contents">Nepal is relatively new to the concept of multiparty democracy, which it established only in 1990 with the framework of a constitutional monarchy. I enjoy and respect constitutional monarchies. At this time, Nepal reinstated previously banned political parties and increased the civil liberties of the Nepalese people. Unfortunately, its attempt at democracy has been fraught with difficulties. Over the last 15 years, the credibility of the Nepalese politicians has been repeatedly undermined with allegations of corruption and self-interest. They refuse to put Nepalese interests first; they have been putting their own first.</p>
<p class="contents">Politicians have proved incapable of ridding Nepal of a group of so-called 'Maoist insurgents' that was launched in 1996 to bring down the monarchy and the regime. The ceasefire they attempted to negotiate with the insurgents broke down in August 2003. The King's recent actions exemplify someone who, on the one hand, wishes to rid Nepal of terrorism and, on the other, wishes to bring stability to a country whose democratic actors have failed to achieve it. He has decided to take matters into his own hands. However, in doing so, he has played into the hands of rebel forces and has infringed upon the very rights he was purportedly aiming to protect.</p>
<p class="contents">Nepal cannot be allowed to regress to a system whereby the King is undisputed ruler and the rights and lives of his subjects are in the hands of one man. The recent chain of events is extremely worrying and reminiscent of the Nepal of the Rana oligarchs, a Nepal whose human rights record the world had hoped was finally going to be laid to rest. We in the international community must encourage the King to undo his recent actions. If necessary, this may involve suspending military aid to Nepal until the King finally realises that the fight against terror is an international struggle which is best dealt with in an open and democratic society, as opposed to the oppressive, closed, authoritarian state which he is sadly attempting to recreate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this period more than 11 000 people have been killed. In June 2001 the King of Nepal was murdered, along with other members of the royal family. His brother, Gyanendra, was crowned as the new King.</p>
<p class="contents">Gyanendra's democratic credentials have never been too obvious, quite the contrary. He has followed the line of aggravating confrontation with the rebels and he has side-stepped the country's political forces. In 2001-2002 a state of emergency was declared which led to an explosion of serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and torture. Despite this, the King continued to enjoy the support of Western nations, including EU Member States, I am sorry to say. On 1 February this year, the King, supported by the Royal Nepalese Army, dismissed the government, assumed direct power and again declared a state of emergency. As expected, widespread human rights violations ensued.</p>
<p class="contents">This joint motion calls on the King to lift the state of emergency, to restore all fundamental democratic freedoms, including freedom of the media, and re-establish parliamentary powers. It also calls on the Council and the Commission to take practical measures such as imposing an embargo on military assistance to force the King to give up his dictatorship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The events of recent weeks have left the European Parliament with no choice but to hold a debate on human rights violations in Nepal, a problem that has been escalating for many years. The Kingdom of Nepal, which is situated between India and China, is becoming ever more dependent on China, as that country is both its main trading partner and the main source of inspiration for the Maoist guerrilla movement. The latter is engaged in a struggle to overthrow the constitutional monarchy, and its aim is to establish a Communist state. The civil war in Nepal has already claimed over 12 000 victims, and the political situation is Byzantine in its complexity, although the information blackout means that we are not familiar with all the details. After the Prime Minister was dismissed, the King and the Nepalese army seized power and suspended basic constitutional rights such as the right of association, the freedom of speech, the right to information, privacy and property and the ban on illegal detentions. The King has prohibited criticism of the security services on the radio, on television and on the Internet. Censorship and persecution are part of everyday life. The Nepalese Government also disregards the rights of refugees, as it has closed the Office of the Representative of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Refugees Welfare Office, which provided assistance to Tibetans persecuted for their faith. Every year 2 500 people flee from Chinese-occupied Tibet because they wish to practice their religion freely and to study in their native language. An ever-greater number of Tibetans are choosing to leave the country because they feel increasingly threatened. The Nepalese Government, however, acts in violation of national and international law by handing Tibetans over to China. These Tibetans are imprisoned and subjected to unbelievably cruel abuse after having been deported to China.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Government and the Maoist rebels have been accused by international humanitarian organisations of committing atrocities against the civil population. The debate this House is holding today will make it possible to identify the roots of the conflict. These can be found in an insane totalitarian, Communist and atheist ideology that denies the existence of God and treats human beings as objects, as well as trampling on their dignity and violating their rights. Nepal has a population of 23 million, and every second person is illiterate, whilst society is still governed by a caste system. What are needed are improved living conditions and education, not a civil war aimed at establishing a destructive Communist system.</p>
<p class="contents">The only options available to us are to increase awareness of the conflict and to use diplomatic channels, such as this European Parliament resolution, to insist that the Nepalese Government puts an end to the illegal arrests and other corrupt practices. We must also demand that the Nepalese Government protects human rights activists, journalists and political leaders from such practices. Public pressure has already resulted in a decline in persecution once before. Consideration should be given to the question of whether EU aid is in fact used to foster development and for humanitarian purposes, and there is also a need for action. Finally, I should like to quote the Holy Father John XXIII, who wrote that a threat to the family is a threat to the state, and that similarly, a threat to social order in one state is a threat to international order. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to highlight a further point, namely the lack of media freedom, which has become particularly acute since 1 February 2005. We know for certain that censorship is taking place and that journalists are being dismissed and arrested, often without their families being informed. The Government has also barred private radio stations from broadcasting, and 800 journalists have lost their jobs as a result. As many Nepalese citizens cannot read, the closure of these radio stations means that they no longer have any access to news or to any radio stations other than the BBC. As if this were not enough, editorial offices have been ransacked and documents censored. This is a brief snapshot of the present situation in Nepal, and we must not remain unmoved by it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Presidency’s declaration of 2 February is very clear: the European Union views the King's move as a serious setback for the prospect of a negotiated and democratically-based solution to the current conflict. The European Union troika, which visited Nepal only two months ago, expressed at that time its grave concerns at the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation. Since 1 February, Nepal has been experiencing a profound human rights crisis, as many parliamentarians have now underlined.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations has recorded more than 340 detentions of political leaders, journalists, human rights defenders and civil society activists. We, the European Union, will continue to press for the release of all those who remain arbitrarily detained, and we will use the opportunity of the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva to remind both sides to the conflict of their obligations under international law.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members may be aware, no European Union position has yet been taken on the issue of continued external assistance to Nepal, because the situation is very complex. The Commission's global approach to conflict prevention calls for us to ensure that Community instruments and programmes are directed towards achieving political and social stability and democracy. As we have frequently stated, development policy and other cooperation programmes provide the most powerful instruments at the Community's disposal for treating the root causes of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We have learned that conflict countries sometimes require more, rather than less, assistance, and applying blunt political conditions risks penalising the weakest in society. That is why we think that the basic objectives of EC cooperation remain achievable. Indeed, the priorities of support to poverty reduction, human rights and conflict mitigation are more urgent in the new environment. Now is not the time for us, for instance, to cancel our support to Nepal's National Human Rights Commission, provided this institution continues to operate as an autonomous and independent technical body, seeking to promote the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this does not mean that it is 'business as usual' in terms of donor support to Nepal, not least because of the new constraints faced in ensuring that all sides respect the donors' basic operational guidelines in the state of emergency as the conflict escalates.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Commission has taken the following position. The delegation of the European Commission in Kathmandu will not accept any high level invitations from the King or from any of his cabinet ministers unless instructed otherwise by its headquarters. All ongoing EC cooperation activities are carefully reviewed and the situation in the field is constantly monitored. For the time being, activities continue but new appraisals or identification missions will not be launched for the preparation of the 2005 cooperation pipeline until further notice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission maintains extensive contacts on this issue with Member States and with other donors on the ground, and will participate in a meeting of like-minded donors during the week of 7 March in Europe to continue to seek a coordinated line.</p>
<p class="contents">As ever in such situations, the cost of conflict falls heaviest on the weakest in Nepalese society. I am thinking of the children denied schooling or forcibly recruited, the poor deprived of basic healthcare and shelter and the many victims of brutal violence. Whilst the primary responsibility for resolving the conflict in Nepal rests with the local actors, we must not abandon them now.</p>
<p class="contents">Working closely with the European Union Member States and especially with successive European Union Council presidencies, the Commission remains committed to pursuing all diplomatic, political, and developmental efforts that might facilitate the peace process and a return to democracy in Nepal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can take it as read that the chaos and the reversion to old ways have resulted from the long-standing discrimination against the people of the interior, who are poor, ill-educated and least urbanised.</p>
<p class="contents">They rebel against the English-speaking inhabitants of the coastlands, whom they regard as colonials. That is what happens in Liberia, established in the nineteenth century as a colony where slaves freed in America could return to their African roots. One group managed the land, while the other regarded themselves as colonial masters along the lines of the Europeans in other African countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is significant in all African countries that present-day state borders were drawn by foreign colonial powers. Groups that belonged together by virtue of a shared language and culture were separated from each other. Groups that had very little in common were joined together in a single federated state. Mr Posselt also drew attention to this during today’s discussion of Togo.</p>
<p class="contents">Adventurers and profiteers, who employ drug-addled children as assassins and decorate themselves with the heads of the victims they kill, terrorise those whom they cannot control. I might add that the Americans did a good job of training Charles Taylor as President and bringing him into office, after which it was very difficult to get rid of him again. What is even more important is that, after the removal of one person, the groups in the interior who have reverted to primitive living should be given the opportunity to develop as fully-fledged twenty-first century people.</p>
<p class="contents">I would counsel against pinning all our hopes on Nigeria’s influence. Nigeria may well be a major power in the region, but it also has a tradition of internal conflict, <span class="italic">coups d’état</span> and dictatorships, although it is fortunate that matters have been improving recently. The problems of Liberia and Sierra Leone will not be resolved in the long term without all the groups of their inhabitants being involved on an equal basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Deva (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Liberia are all members of the ACP and signatories to the Cotonou Agreement. This agreement secures good governance. However, Sierra Leone is ranked as the least-developed country in the world. Sadly, the criteria set out by the Cotonou Agreement as essential to long-term development could also be used as a list of what Sierra Leone lacks most.</p>
<p class="contents">In January 2002 Sierra Leone saw the end of a decade-long, savage civil war. The conflict in Sierra Leone cost tens of thousands of lives and the displacement of millions. Charles Ghankay Taylor, the former President of Liberia, has recently been indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone with actively supporting the Revolutionary United Front which was responsible for the widespread atrocities in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p class="contents">According to Amnesty International, Taylor's crimes included the systematic killing of civilians, amputation, rape, other forms of sexual violence, the use of child soldiers, abductions and forced labour. The Special Court of Sierra Leone created by the international community and which the EU supported with some EUR 800 000 last year, has charged Taylor with 17 counts of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. However, Nigeria has given Taylor asylum. International law now cries out that those suspected of committing war crimes or crimes against humanity must be investigated and brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the 1949 Geneva Convention the Nigerian authorities are obliged to arrest Taylor and to surrender him to the Special Court of Sierra Leone. There is no legal base whatsoever for Taylor to be protected by President Obasanjo of Nigeria. If Taylor remains in Nigeria, however, it is doubtful that this man accused of heinous crimes will ever face trial. Moreover, if he seeks sanctuary in another ACP country we should bring the full force of the Cotonou Agreement to bear on that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those of us who live in prosperous countries have no idea of what is happening in many African states. Immediately upon achieving so-called freedom after centuries of exploitation as colonies, many countries suffered another tyranny of the worst kind, for example in the case of Liberia under Charles Taylor.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot remain indifferent to the catalogue of crimes of which a Special Court in Sierra Leone found Charles Taylor guilty in 2003, and we must do everything in our power to ensure the handover to the courts of this criminal, who, whilst in exile, is persisting in his attempts to destabilise Liberia and its neighbouring countries. I support all the initiatives that this House has called for, yet it is with concern that I note that neither the UN, the UN Security Council, nor any of us yet possess anywhere near the authority for which world peace cries out. International law and human rights require that all people of good will overcome their indifference, and that all possible means be used to find fairer and more peaceful solutions.

He actively supported armed opposition groups in Sierra Leone in their committing of such atrocities as murders, mutilations, rapes and the conscription of child soldiers. Under his rule, Liberia bore the brunt of violence and the misuse of power, all of which resulted in great human suffering that must not be allowed to go unpunished. Nigeria must be induced to surrender Charles Taylor to the court in Sierra Leone, thus doing the right thing by the innumerable victims and survivors in Liberia and elsewhere, and bringing peace to West Africa. The European Union is working for peace, security, stability, respect for human rights and democratic principles. We cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that Charles Taylor remains at liberty in Nigeria, from where he is still in a position to manipulate the peace process in the region. Not only is Nigeria under a moral obligation to hand Charles Taylor over to the tribunal, but it is also subject to an obligation under international law. Among other things, the international legal order, in the shape of the Geneva conventions, stipulates that war crimes must be punished at all times. This rule of international law ensures that states refrain from offering protection to this sort of malefactor. Nigeria will need to extradite Charles Taylor to the tribunal in Sierra Leone, in order that he may be judged by it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is now, at last, beginning to get its own house in order with regional blocs and continent-wide supranational institutions committed to observing international human rights law, such as Economic Community of West Africa (ECOWAS) and the African Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Charles Taylor, as a former warlord, ruled Liberia brutally between 1997 and 2003 as a bloody dictator, sanctioning rape and summary executions at the end of that country's 14 years of civil war, but he was forced into exile as part of a peace-making deal mediated by Nigeria. During Taylor's reign, ECOWAS imposed sanctions on Liberia because of the abuses he perpetrated. In power, he supported the Revolutionary United Front in neighbouring Sierra Leone, which, in alliance with renegade soldiers, overthrew President Kabbah in 1997, having wreaked havoc in the country since 1991, with tens of thousands of civilians brutally slaughtered, and which made use of child soldiers.</p>
<p class="contents">The War Crimes Tribunal in Freetown, Sierra Leone, is a hybrid mix of national and international justice, accepted by all parties and with UN backing, and aims to be a model for other war courts not mandated by Chapter 7 UN resolutions. Taylor was indicted for war crimes by this court in 2003, but Nigeria is refusing to extradite him, claiming he has sovereign immunity and benefits from the asylum deal they agreed to.</p>
<p class="contents">A children's rights group called FOCUS is now calling for his surrender to the court in Sierra Leone, directly blaming Taylor for the limb amputation of thousands of women and children in Sierra Leone, as well as for ordering bloody, cross-border raids into neighbouring Guinea. We now know that sovereign immunity no longer applies for war crimes, but the group has also pointed out that Taylor has breached the terms of his asylum by interfering in Liberian politics ahead of the elections scheduled there for October and by financing parties sympathetic to him with money he obtained corruptly through the diamond trade when in power as President. He presumably hopes that, with a change of government, he will be allowed back.</p>
<p class="contents">President Obasanjo of Nigeria is currently Chairman of the African Union, and his country must set an example to the international community, and end impunity for bloody tyrants, by handing Taylor over. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In July 2003, Taylor fled the country and accepted the Nigerian Government's offer of asylum.

<p class="contents">It is an insult to international law and an affront to human dignity that this alleged mass murderer continues to be given refuge by Nigeria.

If it fails to do so, it should and will face the justifiably serious consequences from both the EU, and the international community in general.

Perhaps the strongest contributing factor to the likelihood of current and future human rights abuses and war crimes is the fact that, in the past, persons of power have been allowed to act with impunity, with no fear of prosecution or trial under international law.</p>

<p class="contents">The crimes Charles Taylor is accused of are terrible and have led Interpol to add his name to the list of the most wanted criminals in the world. Taylor's challenge to the Special Court's indictment on the ground of presidential immunity was an insult to those who suffered the atrocities. Taylor's alleged interference in Liberia's economic and political life, and his openly expressed desire to return to the country, represent a threat to the continuation of peace-building in Liberia and to this year's electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">The non-execution of the arrest warrant issued by the Special Court undermines the legitimacy of this Court. The Special Court of Sierra Leone, unlike the international courts for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, was not granted a mandate under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter requiring all UN member states to comply with the court orders. Making the Special Court successful, therefore, needs the cooperative attitude of all countries hosting criminals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission formally supports efforts by the European Union to ensure the handing over of Taylor to the Court. The latest UN initiative was during the high-level troika meeting with Nigeria in December. Nigeria's position has been as follows, and I quote: 'There cannot be impunity for Taylor. However he is currently a guest of the Nigerian Government and he will be handed over to the first democratically elected Liberian Government asking for his extradition'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that EU offers have to continue and we must make it clear that at some point – and we hope that this point is not too far away – Charles Taylor will have to go to trial. It is also vital that effective initiatives are taken in Nigeria and elsewhere to stop Taylor from continuing to interfere in Liberian affairs and destabilise other countries in the region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>On 11 January 2 Turkish port authority patrol boats illegally entered Greek territorial waters near the islets of Imia, remained there for many hours and obstructed Greek fishermen in the area. This fresh provocation by Turkey openly calls into question the exercise of national sovereignty and sovereign rights by Greece and Greek citizens and constitutes a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and international treaties which constitute an inalienable part of the European acquis. At the same time, Turkey is continuing to violate Greek national airspace, thereby creating tension in the Aegean.</p>
<p>Since the European Council decided very recently - in December - to commence accession negotiations with the candidate country Turkey in October 2005, what measures does it intend to take in respect of Turkey to dissuade it from taking similar actions in future and to prevail upon it to live up to its commitments as an applicant country? How does it intend to assess Turkey's continuing provocative behaviour towards Greece, an EU Member State, through the mechanism for monitoring and evaluating the performance of candidate countries? How does it intend to express its solidarity with Greece, as it is obliged to do?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The European Council in Helsinki in 1999 had already declared that applicant countries must share the values and objectives of the European Union as set out in the Treaties. In this respect the European Council had insisted on the principle of the peaceful settlement of differences in accordance with the United Nations Charter, and had urged the applicant countries to make every effort to settle any border disputes they might have, and any other issues of a similar kind.</p>
<p>It is in that spirit that the Council has constantly monitored developments in the relations between Turkey and its neighbours.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member is aware, on 16 and 17 December 2004, the European Council, emphasising the need for an unequivocal commitment to good neighbourly relations, noted with satisfaction the improvement in Turkey’s relations with its neighbours. The European Council also welcomed the fact that Turkey was prepared to continue to cooperate with the Member States concerned with a view to settling unresolved border disputes while observing the principle of the peaceful settlement of differences set out in the United Nations Charter. The European Council, in line with its previous conclusions, and in particular those which it adopted on this matter in Helsinki, has taken stock of the situation with regard to the continuing differences and welcomes the exploratory contacts which have taken place with this end in view. On this subject, it has reiterated its view that any unresolved differences which have repercussions on the accession process should if necessary be referred to the International Court of Justice with a view to their settlement.

<p>(FR)The entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol on 16 February 2005 will provide an additional effective legal basis for international efforts to combat climate change and should demonstrate the effectiveness of global cooperation involving all countries. The fact that 136 States have so far ratified the Protocol is a clear signal that this binding legal instrument, based on specific quantified commitments to limit or reduce emissions, is perceived by the majority as the only multilateral instrument capable of tackling climate change.</p>
<p>As the Council pointed out in reply to an earlier question put by the honourable Member, the European Union is ready to do everything in its power to persuade the United States to rejoin the multilateral process on climate change, in particular by stepping up scientific and research cooperation and encouraging national policies and measures within the framework of a frank dialogue on future climate change policy.</p>
<p>The Luxembourg Presidency, for its part, raised this issue at the meeting with President Bush on 22 February 2005 and will bring it up again in its bilateral meetings with certain countries that have a key role in curbing climate change. Its efforts are part of an action programme which will be continued during the second half of the year by the future United Kingdom Presidency.</p>
<p>In this context, the Conference of Parties will start examining commitments for the period after 2012 at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period (2008-2012), in practice this will be in November 2005. It is important that all the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on climate change should be involved in these negotiations in order to reach a post-2012 climate regime for the whole planet.</p>
<p>Finally, the Luxembourg Presidency is also counting on the support of European Parliament in continuing to explain the merits of the Protocol and all its potential benefits to the parties that have not yet ratified it, in particular the United States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0027"></a>

<p>(FR) The central importance of education in fighting poverty and aiding development was clearly defined under paragraph 19 of the Millennium Declaration, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2000.</p>
<p>The European Union's commitments in terms of promoting education in Africa and other developing regions are based on sectoral budgetary aid that also targets the areas of health, politics, water and sanitation.</p>
<p>The EU's strategy is rooted in the context of the Millennium Development Goals for education and the wider objective of Education For All (EFA), adopted by the international community in Dakar in April 2000.</p>
<p>In its Resolution of May 2002 entitled 'Education and Poverty', the Council stated that a substantial share of the ODA increase resulting from the Monterrey/Barcelona commitments should be used to support social development in developing countries, with special emphasis on improving health and education outcomes, and that this should be followed up accordingly. In the education sector, this should translate into additional support for the MDG/EFA goals to ensure universal primary completion, for boys and girls alike, by 2015.</p>
<p>According to a Commission evaluation, contributions to national programmes and projects in the field of education totalled EUR 258m in 2003, EUR 70m of which went to ACP States. These projects cover primary, vocational and higher education and are all integrated into the national programmes and development strategies of partner countries.</p>
<p>The Council supports the EFA Fast Track Initiative (FTI), in which the Commission plays a key role in coordination at EU Member State level and examines the possibilities of financial support. This initiative aims to help low-income countries with sound policies but insufficient resources to reach the Millennium Development Goal of giving all children a full primary education by 2015.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0029"></a>

<p>(FR) The issue raised by the honourable Member was addressed in Council conclusions adopted in June 2004, which were based on a communication from the Commission. These conclusions recognise that making fishing activities more environmentally friendly will contribute to a more sustainable fishing industry. In its conclusions, the Council emphasised the importance of research in areas such as more environment-friendly types of fishing gear and marine ecosystems. It confirmed its support for pilot projects on discards.</p>
<p>The Council also invited the Commission to take a series of measures in this field, and in particular:</p>
<p>to assess, by the end of 2005, the potential for the provision of financial and non-financial incentives to encourage fishermen to employ more environment-friendly fishing methods;</p>
<p>to propose, after consultation with the relevant Regional Advisory Councils, simplified technical conservation measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea.</p>
<p>As regards the Luxembourg Presidency, environment-friendly technical conservation measures are among the priorities of the joint work programme adopted by that Presidency and the future British Presidency for 2005. The proposal on the Mediterranean is a top priority in this regard, and the Council looks forward with interest to Parliament's opinion on this subject. The Presidency hopes, if possible, to adopt this proposal by the summer.</p>
<p>The Luxembourg Presidency also plans to launch discussions on the proposal on technical conservation measures in the Baltic Sea. It can therefore assure the honourable Member that it will devote the utmost attention to this important matter, which is crucial to arriving at a sustainable fisheries approach.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0031"></a>

<p>(FR) The Council is closely monitoring the development of the situation in Ukraine. The Council wholeheartedly welcomed the organisation of a second round of presidential elections in Ukraine, conducted on a free and proper basis. To demonstrate the EU's support for the new, democratically elected leaders, the Council and the Commission proposed to the Ukrainian Government that an EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council should be swiftly organised for 21 February with a view to the prompt adoption of an EU-Ukraine action plan, as envisaged at the European Council meeting of 16 and 17 December 2004 in Brussels. In tandem with this initiative, the Council is studying the other possibilities available to it to strengthen cooperation between the EU and Ukraine and support the reforms of the new democratic government in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In this context, the Council invites the honourable Member to refer to the conclusions which it adopted on 31 January 2005, and recalls that, at its meeting of 21 February 2005, the Council adopted conclusions in which it stressed that the European Union is resolved to support Ukraine at this crucial juncture and is prepared to press ahead swiftly on all aspects of the action plan, in particular by envisaging an initial consideration of its implementation from the beginning of 2006, provided that significant progress has been achieved. In addition, the Council agreed to a number of measures designed to strengthen and enrich the action plan in support of a democratic and reform-oriented Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Council would inform the honourable Member that no official application for the accession of Ukraine to the European Union has been submitted to the Council and this matter is, therefore, not currently on the agenda.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0045"></a>

<p>It has been established that, in the EU in general and in the individual Member States, there is low demand for agricultural products which are mainly associated with very low market prices. Cereals are one of the products which have suffered the worst fall in market prices and demand.</p>
<p>A typical example is Greece where market prices for most agricultural products, such as rice, cereals, peaches, tobacco and cotton are unprecedentedly and unjustifiably low, which is causing significant problems for the rural economy and farmers' incomes.</p>
<p>How does the Council, in cooperation with the Member States, propose to tackle this difficult commercial situation on the market in agricultural products which, apart from a possible increase in production, is significantly affected by the implementation of bilateral trade agreements, the pre-accession agreements and, above all, by the period pending implementation of the new CAP in the Member States which is creating uncertainty among producers and the individual sectors concerned?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Council’s attention has indeed been drawn to the risk of disruptions on the markets for certain products in several regions of the Union. The Council has noted the explanations supplied on this issue by the Commission, which is responsible for the management of the markets.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that, in 2003 and 2004, the Council adopted a major reform of the common agricultural policy, which was implemented on 1 January 2005 in most Member States, and which will be implemented with effect from 1 January 2006 in the remaining Member States. All products which are alleged to have been affected by low demand and low prices have in recent years been the subject of the above-mentioned reform. The key element of that reform is the replacement of market and price support by income support for farmers, which will give the market more of a role in guiding production. One of the objectives of the single farm payment system is precisely to give farmers stability of income, particularly in cases where the markets are disrupted.</p>
<p>After such a general reform, while being aware, at this stage, of the need to allow time for the implementation and application of the new policy so as to have the perspective which is essential for a proper assessment of the new mechanisms, the Council will be sure, nevertheless, to examine closely any legislative proposal from the Commission which seeks to put in place any adjustments which may be necessary.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0047"></a>

<p>According to an AFP report, which also appeared in the Turkish daily newspaper 'Hürriyet', there has been an increase in cases of fraud involving vending machines selling cigarettes and confectionery in Germany since the new Turkish lira was introduced on 1 January 2005. Apparently, many vending machines in the Federal Republic of Germany and in other Western European countries cannot differentiate between a coin with a face value of one Turkish lira - which is worth about 55 euro cent - and one with a face value of two euro. This has apparently led to losses running into seven figures. Is the Council aware of this abuse? If so, what action does it plan to take?

<p>(FR) Cases of fraud involving vending machines using Turkish lira have not been brought to the attention of the Council. The Council has not, therefore, adopted a position.</p>
<p>The Council, in collaboration with the Commission, established the legal framework for the introduction of the euro coins, after long consultations with all the parties concerned, including the automatic vending machine sector. The Council even made an adjustment to the specifications for the 50 cent coin before it was brought into circulation, in order to respond to the only explicit request to that effect from the distribution sector.</p>
<p>The Council’s role is restricted to defining the technical specifications for the coins. Protection against this type of fraud is chiefly the responsibility of the national authorities and, as far as possible, of the economic operators themselves.</p>

<p>(FR) The Council has not specifically discussed the destruction that has occurred on the site of Babylon. However, it wishes to stress that it attaches great importance to the conservation of the rich legacy of the world’s cultural heritage.</p>
<p>In its statement of 5 June 2003 on the destruction of cultural goods in Iraq, the Council expressed its deepest concern at the tragic destruction of cultural goods, archaeological sites, and monuments of irreplaceable historical value in Iraq, and the vandalism and looting of the museums and libraries of vital importance not only to Iraq but to the whole world.</p>
<p>In this text, the Council also stressed the need to protect in an efficient way the cultural goods of Iraq and to return the objects illegally removed from museums or archaeological sites, without allowing them to become objects of trade ending up in foreign museums or private collections.</p>
<p>The Council would like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to Council Regulation (EC) No 1210/2003 of 7 July 2003 concerning certain specific restrictions on economic and financial relations with Iraq.

At the same time, it emphasised that ‘reconstruction efforts must be based on the national priorities of the countries concerned and must respect the principle of ownership’ (Conclusions, paragraph 12). At this stage, therefore, the Council does not intend to ask the Commission to submit specific guidelines regarding priorities for the aid provided, other than those just quoted.</p>
<p>As for the monitoring of the amounts granted, the Council intends, as part of the action plan adopted on 31 January last in order to follow up the GAERC Conclusions of 7 January 2005, to adopt measures enabling the effective implementation of the financial commitments to be regularly reviewed on the basis of a Commission report updated in the light of all the information available, including information available via the United Nations. In this context, special attention will be paid to the systems for monitoring financial commitments, which will be improved if necessary.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Council explained, in the above-mentioned conclusions, that ‘the international response should make populations and governments less vulnerable and better equipped to cope with possible natural disasters in the future’ (paragraph 18 of the Conclusions of 7 January). By this means, the Council was expressing, implicitly, its desire for reconstruction which would comply with a certain number of parameters as regards habitat and environment, while at the same time wishing to act in such a way as to respect the priorities of the affected countries receiving the aid as well as the principle of ownership. Moreover, in the action plan referred to above, the Council invites the Commission and the Member States to ensure that reconstruction respects the environment and is of such a kind as to prevent or attenuate the effects of such disasters in the future.</p>
<p>The Council pointed to ‘the United Nations’ central role in the coordination and management of assistance to victims’, and stressed ‘the particular importance of cooperation with the OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs)’ (paragraph 5 of the Conclusions of 7 January). The action plan of 31 January emphasises the central role of the United Nations and the need to coordinate EU action, both now and in the future, with the special responsibilities accorded to the United Nations Organisation and the various bodies or organisations which depend on it, such as the OCHA, UNICEF and the WHO. The Council also points to the need to ensure that the efforts of the Commission and of the Member States are coordinated with the development banks (Asian Development Bank and World Bank), and to the advantage of fully involving the NGOs and civil society partners in the process as a whole.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0055"></a>

<p>Dawit Isaak is a Swedish citizen who has been imprisoned without trial in Asmara, Eritrea, since 23 September 2001. Dawit Isaak is one of ten journalists working for private-sector media who were arrested in Asmara in September 2001. Mr Isaac has been interned for over three years and the authorities refuse to have his case tried by a court of law. Reportedly, no charges have yet been brought against Mr Isaac for any offence against Eritrean law. His family in Sweden have not received any news of him and do not know whether he is alive. The Eritrean authorities have categorically refused to comment on the case.</p>
<p>In the hope that the Council is aware of the above situation, will it say what practical measures it will take and what pressure it will exert on behalf of Dawit Isaak and other EU citizens who are imprisoned in Eritrea? The previous Presidency promised to tackle these problems but nothing has happened. Is it reasonable for EU citizens to be treated in the manner that Dawit Isaak has been? Can the suspension of aid - € 88 million over the period 2002-2007 - be used as a means of exerting pressure on the government and the authorities in Asmara?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) As the Council indicated in its reply to a similar question raised by the honourable Member in October 2004, the Council is closely monitoring the fate of Dawit Isaac and the other journalists who were arrested in September 2001. Since the resumption of a political dialogue with Eritrea in May 2003, the EU Heads of Mission in Asmara have not neglected any opportunity to make clear to the Eritrean authorities their concern over the arbitrary detention of the group of journalists arrested, and over the lack of any information as to their fate, and the lack of any legal framework, rules or procedures for dealing with the cases of the detained individuals in question and of others. As the Council also indicated in October, the Heads of Mission have tried to obtain an assurance that the prisoners are in good health. As part of the political dialogue with the Eritrean authorities, the emphasis will continue to be placed on the fate of the journalists held and on that of other prisoners of conscience. Moreover, the EU Heads of Mission will continue to take initiatives with a view to being able to visit the imprisoned journalists.</p>
<p>Following the request by the Council’s ‘Africa’ Group to the EU Heads of Mission in Asmara, to the effect that the latter should, if possible, raise the question of the fate of the imprisoned journalists in the context of the next political dialogue with the Government of Eritrea, or should take separate action on this issue, the Presidency has written a letter to Mr Isaias, the President of Eritrea, informing him of the EU’s concern over the imprisoned journalists and calling for a transparent and fair trial to be held. The Presidency has also asked the President of Eritrea to authorise the EU Heads of Mission to visit those journalists as well as other political prisoners. Neither the President of Eritrea nor the Eritrean Government has replied to that letter.</p>
<p>The suspending of cooperation with Eritrea would require the opening of consultations with the authorities of that country pursuant to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement and in accordance with the procedures laid down in that Agreement, following a Commission proposal to that effect.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0058"></a>

<p>(FR) The Council has constantly reiterated its determination to find a solution to the Cyprus question, and its hope that all Cypriots will soon be able to be reunited as citizens of a united island of Cyprus within the European Union. Against this background the Council has always supported – and will continue to support – all the efforts being made, particularly by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, towards finding an overall solution to the problem. Nevertheless, the Council recognises that the crucial contribution towards this goal must come from a gradual rapprochement between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. At the same time it should be borne in mind that the Cyprus question is still on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>The European Union has made a contribution, by adopting various measures to facilitate a rapprochement between the communities, given that the European Union’s common denominator is still the Conclusions of the Council of 26 April 2004, which recommend measures intended to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community by encouraging economic development, and to promote the reunification of the island. The implementation of these conclusions is to some extent still being discussed within the Council’s preparatory bodies, while some of them (the rules concerning the Green Line) have already been adopted.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0062"></a>

<p>(FR) In its conclusions on Colombia, adopted in December 2004, the Council expressed the European Union’s readiness to pursue an effective and result-oriented engagement. A more formal EU involvement could take place through timely political endorsement for the ongoing peace process once the Colombian Government has set out a comprehensive legal framework. In this respect the Council underlined that the European Union would have great difficulty in endorsing the peace talks so long as the illegal armed groups have not ceased hostilities. Taking a gradual approach linked to developments on the ground, the Council also expressed its readiness to provide concrete and adequate financial support for the outcome of such talks once a comprehensive strategy has been defined for the assembly, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration in society of the members of the illegal armed groups.</p>
<p>The Council welcomed the fact that, in the statement made in Cartagena on 3 February 2005, the Colombian Government and the donors have revived the London Declaration of 10 June 2003. The ambitious and precise London undertakings thus remain valid as guidelines for the peace process and as a foundation for possibly increased donor commitment. The statement described a certain degree of progress by the Colombian Government and stressed the need for a legal framework to put into effect the principles of truth, justice and reparation. Such a framework is essential for devising a realistic peaceful long-term solution based on respect for democratic principles and victims’ rights.

The South Caucasus was included in the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU co-hosted a major donor-conference for Georgia and has appointed a Special Representative for this sub-region. The EU also has an ESDP rule of law mission operating in Georgia, EUJUST Themis, which is further evidence of EU support to Georgia. In pursuance of the European Security Strategy, the EU takes a strong and active interest in the problems of the South Caucasus.

The EU is currently considering options as how an international presence on the border could be ensured in the event that the OSCE route remains blocked. Possible options could include an independent EU-led monitoring operation, within the framework of the ESDP; the EU could also consider providing more support and training to Georgia's border guards. Currently consultations are being held with the Georgian and Russian authorities. A training mission of the OSCE for the border guards could also help to ensure that valuable experience is shared and, that the OSCE involvement in this matter is continued.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0080"></a>

<p>The Council intends shortly to hold its second reading of the patent directive, which is giving rise to much controversy in a large number of circles and Member States (e.g. a fact borne out in Poland, for example, by even the most recent statements made by representatives of the Polish government). The Commission representative, Commissioner Potocnik, is unwilling to make an official statement on this subject.</p>

<p>(FR) The reason why the Council has not yet adopted a joint position on this directive was initially a procedural one, that is, the fact that the Council’s lawyer-linguists had not yet completed their legal examination of the wording of the common position. The drafting of the text could not begin until the wording of the political agreement was available in all the official languages of the Union, including those of the new Member States.</p>
<p>Moreover, following the recent decision by the EP’s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which has since been confirmed by the Conference of Presidents, to ask the European Commission to resubmit this proposed directive to the European Parliament, the Council Presidency thought it advisable to wait for the Commission’s response to Parliament’s request before placing the formal adoption of the common position on the Council agenda.</p>
<p>Once the response is known, the common position will be adopted and notified to the European Parliament, accompanied by the Council’s reasons for adopting it, in accordance with the Treaty. The Council’s explanation of its reasons for adopting a common position forms the appropriate framework enabling the Council to explain its position in the light of the various amendments proposed by the European Parliament. Consequently I do not believe it is advisable to comment on individual amendments today. I am convinced that the European Parliament will make full use of the second reading to reach a clearer opinion on the content of the Council’s common position.</p>
<p>I must emphasise, however, that the Council does not share the very negative opinion which honourable Members hold regarding its political agreement. The Council’s objective, in fact, is to codify existing legal practice throughout the European Union, while retaining a balance between the need to encourage innovation throughout the electronics industry and the information and communications technology industry on the one hand, and the taking into consideration of all software operators, especially SMEs and individuals, on the other. Having said that, the Council’s position would also have to develop in the light of the work carried out within Parliament.</p>
<p>As for the remarks made on the subject of the attitude allegedly adopted by certain delegations, both during and after the Council discussions of 18 May 2004, I would remind honourable Members that the Council refrains from commenting on considerations of this kind.</p>
<p>Finally, I cannot ignore the fact that the fear of creating an institutional precedent of a kind which would considerably delay the taking of a decision in the Community context explains, to some extent, the Council’s position expressed here today.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0082"></a>

<p>The recent elections in Iraq are being portrayed by the USA, the EU and the international media as a victory for democracy and the start of a new era in a bid to justify the unjust war, the occupation of Iraq by the USA and its allies, 'legitimise' the appointed Prime Minister Ayad Allawi and the political representatives of capital in his government, control the wealth-producing oil-wells and exploit the peoples of Iraq and the surrounding region. Official estimates put the turnout in the Iraqi elections at 57-60%, a highly dubious figure given that they were held under occupation by an appointed government, while at least one million Iraqis were not registered to vote.

At its meeting on 31 January 2005, the Council adopted conclusions regarding the Iraqi national elections.</p>
<p>The European Union is committed to contributing to the economic, social and political reconstruction of Iraq, and it supports the activities of the UN.

<p>(FR)The Council invites the honourable Member to refer to the conclusions from November, when a very pertinent report was adopted on the issue of the role of education systems in promoting European values. This report entitled ‘Education and citizenship: report on the broader role of education and its cultural aspects’, which responded to a request from the Thessaloniki European Council in March 2003, was then passed on to the European Council in December 2005. Although the content of education systems is the responsibility of the Member States, as clearly indicated in the Treaty, the Member States have a great deal to learn from each other, by using the open method of coordination. The process envisaged in the ‘Education and Training 2010’ work programme (the educational side of the Lisbon strategy) is an excellent way of doing so. This report gives an overview of the priority measures in the field of citizenship education and confirms active citizenship as a specific objective of Community programmes in the fields of education and training.</p>
<p>The Council notes that the Council of Europe has designated 2005 ‘The European Year of Citizenship’ and will follow this event with a great deal of interest. In this first six-month period, the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union has organised a ‘Forum for a Multicultural Europe’ (Mersch, 22-29 January), the aim of which was to enable young secondary school pupils from every country in the EU to discuss and work on the theme ‘We are Europe!’ With the participation of more than 250 schools and 23 Member States, the forum was highly successful. The Presidency’s slogan ‘Let’s learn more languages to speak the same language’ demonstrates Luxembourg’s well-known commitment to multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Mobility, multilingualism and creating a climate for better mutual understanding are the main themes of several conferences taking place in Luxembourg as part of the Luxembourg Presidency. The launch of Europass (31 January – 1 February) and the symposium on multilingualism in schools ‘the development of education in Europe – multilingualism opens up new possibilities’ (Luxembourg, 9-11 March) are other occasions when this aspect of the Luxembourg Presidency’s programme is being implemented.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0098"></a>

<p>The European Union's policy which involves the restructuring of air transport has dealt a severe blow to the labour, wage and social rights of workers and caused the bankruptcy of airlines in the Member States (Sabena, Swissair, etc.). The Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice has demanded the restitution, as state aid for the 1998-2002 period, of sums which, according to the Greek government, were paid to offset liabilities of the Greek State towards Olympic Airways. The former commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, has herself recognised the Greek State's increased liabilities in respect of Olympic Airways. It is clear that matter was referred to the European Court of Justice in order to justify the financial depreciation of Olympic Airways and the imminent sell-out of the company, the blow to wage and labour rights and the dismissal of thousands of employees of Olympic Airways.</p>

<p>(FR) As the honourable Member points out, the Commission is well aware of the strategic importance of air transport for the Union and the Member States.</p>
<p>This is why it has accompanied the gradual unification of the European market, which goes back to the early 1990s, with a generally favourable attitude towards the restructuring of traditional operators, and at the same time towards the establishment of fair competition rules.</p>
<p>This policy has been the same across the Union.</p>
<p>It has enabled the establishment of a competitive and innovative European industry.</p>
<p>It has also enabled new, successful operators to emerge, including in Greece.</p>
<p>The Commission did not act differently with regard to Greece or Olympic Airways.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the discussion that we are now holding stems from two positive decisions that the Commission took (regarding State aid) in favour of Olympic Airways in 1996 and later in 1998.</p>
<p>Everything that followed was only intended to ensure that these two initial positive decisions by the Commission were complied with, which should have allowed Olympic Airways to be restructured and ensure that it was economically viable without further State aid (one time, last time).</p>
<p>This was the aim of the Commission’s referral to the Court in October 2003, asking for the decision made one year previously (2002) to be complied with in order to ensure that the decisions made in 1996 and 1998 were complied with (the Commission had stated in 2002 that the conditions for the 1996 and 1998 decisions had not been complied with, and that new illegal aid had been paid).</p>
<p>This was also the aim of the enquiry that the Commission began in March 2004 to ensure that Olympic did not benefit from further illegal advantages granted since then.</p>
<p>While ensuring that competition rules are complied with in air transport, the Commission encourages the development of regional air transport. We demonstrated this a few days ago when we proposed guidelines for financing airports and launching new lines from regional airports.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0089"></a>

<p>(EN) The current situation of the EU pigmeat sector is positive. Without any unforeseeable circumstances it is likely to remain that way.</p>
<p>The Community average market price for pig carcases is currently rather good and experts foresee stable and firm market prices for the first six months of 2005. This positive picture is based on the fact that the pigmeat production in the EU will go down by 1.6% in the first half of 2005 compared to the same period of 2004; also for Poland, a decrease of production is foreseen. Moreover, exports from EU may remain at a high level in the first months of 2005 and will have a positive influence on the EU balance sheet for pigmeat.</p>
<p>Even if the introduction of support measures such as export refunds for carcases and cuts or aid for private storage are possible under the pigmeat regime, no such measures have been applied since March 2004 due to favourable market conditions. Lower costs for compound feed since summer 2004 have contributed to this situation.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to follow very closely the development of the market in the coming weeks. However, on the basis of the forecasts for prices and production, it does not appear at this point in time necessary to apply the above mentioned market measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0041"></a>

<p>For the milk marketing year 2002/2003, the Portuguese Government transferred part of the additional reference quantities assigned to the Azores pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) 1453/2001<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> to the mainland, with the result that Azores milk producers, despite their milk production falling 512 tonnes short of its legal limit, were obliged to pay Euro 1 133 911 of additional tax for excess mainland production.</p>

<p>(EN) Due to a very significant increase of milk production on the Azores in the nineties, the total of their individual reference quantities in 1999/2000 was exceeded by about 80 000 tonnes. This led to Portugal exceeding its national reference quantities for the first time and Portuguese producers therefore became liable for supplementary levy.</p>
<p>At the request of Portugal and in order to enable the milk sector being restructured, the Council decided to allow a special franchise of 73 000 tonnes to be used by Azorean producers, who exceeded their historical reference. No levy therefore was paid by Portugal in 1999/2000.</p>
<p>In 2002/2003 Portugal exceeded its national reference including the above franchise and Portuguese producers were therefore liable for the corresponding levy.</p>
<p>At this time it became apparent that Portugal may have applied the franchise in a manner which allowed it to indirectly benefit continental producers</p>
<p>Discussions between the Portuguese authorities and Commission services have taken place on how to correctly apply the franchise in the context of reallocation of unused quantities. A method was agreed that avoids franchise quantities being used directly or indirectly on the continent.</p>
<p>In the context of the Clearance of Accounts procedure the Commission services have requested the Portuguese authorities to review their supplementary levy calculations for the period 2002/2003 in light of the method. Depending on the outcome of this review the Portuguese authorities will have to fix the extent to which Azorean producers have contributed to the excess of the national reference quantity and if it is proved that a supplementary levy was paid in excess, a reimbursement should be done according to national rules.</p>
<p>The Commission does take all indications of unequal treatment seriously and the honourable Member can be assured that the issue about the possible over and underpayment of levy by producers will be addressed during the clearance of accounts procedure which is currently underway. The Commission will pay attention as well to supplementary levy wrongly charged to some Azorean producers as to no payment of supplementary levy related to producers in overshot.</p>
<p>With regard to the honourable Member’s first question, in relation with the previous discussions there are currently no infringement proceedings either underway or in preparation with regard to Portugal’s application of the milk quota regime.</p>
<p>The Commission always seeks to ensure the protection of the Community financial interests.</p>
<p>With regard to the 2002/2003 milk marketing year, the Commission has launched a clearance of accounts procedure which will objectively examine the facts and arrive at the appropriate conclusions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Our key objective for this Round has been and remains to respect the Doha Mandate, without calling into question our Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) Reform. This objective has been achieved with the Agreed Framework, which is the basis for developing modalities to be agreed in Hong Kong. The Commission has already made it clear to its partners in the Word Trade Organisation (WTO) that since Agenda 2000, the EU has already undergone important reforms of its farm policy, moving support from product to producer. The latest 2003 reform is going even further in the sense wished by the entire WTO Membership and it is now for other WTO Members to match our level of ambition.</p>
<p>Regarding the honourable Member’s question about any analysis on the consequences of a WTO agreement, obviously it is too soon to deliver a definitive analysis on the consequences of the WTO talks before reduction formulae and levels of reduction have been agreed. However, the honourable Member can be ensured that Commission’s services are working on a daily basis on analysis and scenarii to design and adapt our negotiating position, based on assumptions and depending on the evolution of the discussions in Geneva.</p>
<p>It is the EC objective to reach agreement on detailed modalities next year in Hong-Kong. Bearing in mind the comprehensive nature of the Doha Agenda, it is important that the modalities cover all sectors and that, as regards agriculture, the agreement in Hong Kong should be balanced between the different pillars and between trade and non trade issues. The Commission is fully aware of the importance of the WTO agriculture negotiations in the Doha Development Agenda. The negotiations are at the top of its priorities. The Commission therefore intends to play an active role both in the EU and internationally to defend and promote the EU position. During these negotiations, it has been and will continue its collaboration with both the Council and the Parliament through the normal channels.</p>
<p>The on-going technical discussion which have been taken place in Geneva since the summer break under the responsibility of Tim Groser, Chair of the agricultural negotiations, have proved to be very useful. However, there are issues of a highly political nature which will have to be moved to a higher level. Political involvement has now become crucial since the Commission believes that to reach modalities in Hong Kong it is necessary to get substantial work done by the summer break.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0094"></a>

<p>(EN) Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch clearly states that the quota is allocated to each Member State according to starch production in a certain reference period, taking irreversible investments into account which were made before a certain date. There is no provision for an increase in the allocated quota to take a later increase in processing capacity into account. The quotas for the New Member States were negotiated at the Copenhagen Summit in 2002 and agreed on by the candidate countries and the EU-15 Member States. They are part of the Accession Treaty and have been applicable since the 2004/2005 marketing year.</p>
<p>As far as the use of the production quotas in the EU-15 from 1998 to 2004 is concerned, it is 93% on average due to the influence of the 2003/2004 marketing year, where a drought had severely damaged the potato crop in Europe.</p>

<p>When will discrimination against farmers from the new Member States with regard to direct payments end, and when is it anticipated that the common agricultural policy will be brought entirely into line with the adopted Constitution?</p>
<p>The EU has undergone enlargement and the EU institutions have adopted a Constitution. It is an appropriate time for a declaration of the principles on which the EU is based: equality of conditions for all, rejection of all kinds of discrimination etc.</p>
<p>However, the reality is quite different. For example, on the River Oder, which forms the border between old and new Member States, there is multiple discrimination against farmers from the new Member States. Here, under identical soil and climate conditions, farmers on one side of the river receive over EUR 400 per hectare in support from EU funds, while farmers on the other side of the river receive barely EUR 50 per hectare. It appears that discrimination in the new Member States will continue even after 2013 and will reach approximately 50%. At the same time, the original fears of competition from eastern European foodstuffs on the western European market have not been confirmed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has carefully examined the situation in the New Member States before accession and considered various possibilities how to approach problem of direct payments. It is aware of the fact, that New Member States have limited experience with Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) administration and also short time between conclusion of accession negotiations and the accession itself was difficult to set-up necessary control systems for EU schemes. Therefore farmers in New Member States have the option to use simplified support scheme and they do not have to meet all the obligations required for EU 15 counterparts. For instance they do not have to comply immediately with the same environmental, animal welfare and other rules (cross-compliance) as farmers in EU-15 in order to qualify for direct payments. This is considerable administrative simplification as reaction to their limited administrative capacity.</p>
<p>The major need for the farmers in the New Member States is need of investment into agricultural holdings in order to modernise their structure and comply with EU production standards. This can only be reached by tailor-made rural development programmes and not by full direct payments which would have negative impact on price disparities between various sectors in the New Member States. Furthermore, the latest data from Eurostat indicate that in 2004 the real agricultural income per worker in the New Member States was on average increased of 53.8% compare to 2003. This strong growth is mainly due to an increase of 244% in subsidies. Moreover, national co-financing of direct payments enables to reach EU level in 2010 and under certain conditions on product bases the EU level can be reached already from the date of accession.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0103"></a>

<p>(EN) As part of its humanitarian aid, the Commission has taken the following initiatives to protect the children affected by the Tsunami:</p>
<p>Emergency decision for Indonesia adopted on 31 December 2004:</p>
<p>The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) provides water and sanitation to the affected populations and ensures an adequate protective environment for separated children that enables their registration, tracing and reunification with their parents or extended families. To this end, UNICEF is assisting the Government in establishing 20 child centres in affected areas of the Province of Aceh.</p>
<p>Save the Children provides emergency nutrition for the children under five years old in affected areas of the province of Aceh.</p>
<p>The Danish Red Cross and the Inter Catholic Migration Commission provide psychosocial support to the survivors of the Tsunami in Indonesia. Within these programmes, specific actions adapted to the needs of the children are included, such as the setting up of recreational spaces and activities for children in the camps.</p>
<p>Télécommunications sans frontières provides telecommunication services aiming at, among other objectives, facilitating the reunification of families.</p>
<p>Within its emergency decision for Sri Lanka and the Maldives adopted on 30 December 2004, the Commission is funding the following organisations:</p>
<p>UNICEF in Sri Lanka for actions including the distribution of children hygiene kits, clothes and safe water as well as medicine to 5 000 households, including children</p>
<p>The World Food Program for food distribution in Sri Lanka, including targeted supplementary distributions for malnourished children under five years old.</p>
<p>The Danish Red Cross for psychosocial support actions in Sri Lanka including specific activities (games and sharing of experiences) and counselling for children.</p>
<p>UNICEF for actions in the Maldives including the provision of water tanks for 120 schools and the provision of cold rooms for vaccines for 50 000 children in hospitals.</p>
<p>On 9 February 2005, the Commission adopted a humanitarian aid decision of € 80 million covering the countries affected by the tsunami in South and South East Asia. These funds will be allocated for actions that will benefit children, among other target groups, in the sectors of food aid, shelter, primary health care, water and sanitation, psychosocial care and livelihood support.</p>
<p>In Sri Lanka, the European Humanitarian Aid Office’s (ECHO) intervention strategy includes child sensitive components with partners that are practically omnipresent in the country. Most of the ECHO partners are working directly with beneficiary households and are therefore aware of needs at the family unit level including specific needs of children. Providing assistance in the form of shelter, food, livelihood activities and so forth at the family level provides an essential protection mechanism for the whole family unit which in turn also responds to the needs of children.</p>
<p>In India, ECHO has identified psycho-social care as one of the priority sectors of intervention. This support will focus specifically on children who have been orphaned, lost one parent, sibling or other family members and friends, or made homeless and displaced, or otherwise traumatised. ECHO will work only with partners who were already established in India prior to the tsunami, and thus have a solid understanding of the local context. ECHO partners will in turn develop partnerships with existing structures (such as NIMHANS: National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences) and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This will help to ensure that interventions in response to psycho-social needs are appropriately formulated, as well as contributing to capacity building of local NGOs.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, interventions will take place at the household level, even if the households are temporarily residing in camps. ECHO will not work with state or private orphanages, and will strive to ensure that children are not removed from their immediate or extended family.</p>
<p>Projects focused on livelihoods recovery do not specifically target children, but will benefit the whole family, and will promote a swift return to a normal and stable livelihood and thus home environment. Projects focused on water-sanitation will contribute to a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of water-borne diseases, and will all contain a public and personal health and hygiene awareness campaign, with a specific child-centred component.</p>
<p>With regard to the fight against child sex tourism EU legislation has been adopted through the Council Framework Decision of 22 December 2003 on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. In particular, Member States shall criminalise sexual engagement with children carried out abroad by own nationals (Art. 8 par. 1b). On the other hand, the Framework Decision allows Member States to deviate from this rule (Art 8 par. 2). If they deviate they have to inform the Council Secretariat and the Commission. The deviation rule is difficult to understand and could be questioned even before the deadline for implementation (January 2006). Therefore, the Commission will examine whether or not Member States deviated (or intend to do so) from the requirement in the Framework Decision to establish their jurisdiction for sexual offences committed abroad by their own nationals (Art. 8 par.1b) and, if so, for what reasons. In any case, the Commission will reiterate the importance of establishing jurisdiction in accordance with Article 8 par. 1b of the Framework Decision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0015"></a>

<p>(EN) In December 2004 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations.<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> This Regulation significantly improves the present situation on animal welfare conditions during transport in many respects. The Commission, however, regrets that the Council did not consider going as far as the Commission proposal on the issues of restrictions of travel time and transport density.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the text of the Regulation does not deprive the Commission of the right to come back on important issues related to sensitive topics. Namely, the text of the Regulation (art. 32) provides for the Commission to report back to the Council on the issue of travelling times and loading densities, and possibly to accompany its report by appropriate legislative proposals concerning journey times on the basis of the experience acquired from the application of the new rules. This process can be initiated by the Commission at any time and no later than January 2011. In this context, the Commission believes that all possibilities should be exploited to go in the direction of reinforcing the provisions on travelling time. The Member of the Commission responsible for Public Health and Consumer Protection has publicly stated his intention to revisit this issue preferably before the end of the mandate of the current European Parliament.</p>
<p>On this issue, in addition, the Commission intends to avail itself of its power of initiative also beyond the above-described reporting exercise foreseen in the Regulation. To this end, it intends to carefully analyse any possible evolution of the prevailing political conditions. The Commission will therefore continue to monitor the situation and, depending on the results, it is prepared to take a legislative initiative at any time in the future, should the welfare conditions of animals need further improvements. It explicitly retained this right when giving its consent to the compromise draft of the Regulation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The current draft proposes that the EU should introduce a common rule stipulating that data from 'publicly available communications services' should be stored for 12-36 months ' for the purpose of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of crime and criminal offences including terrorism'. The proposal is not confined to telephony; it also covers data traffic, i.e. information concerning websites visited and addresses to which e-mail has been sent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the proposal is not simply concerned with the investigation of crime but also with prevention; everyone is to be treated as a suspect. Naturally, the Article 29 Group has also sharply criticised this proposal. Their opinion states that the proposal is not only contrary to the rule that information may not be used for a purpose other than for which it is retained, it is also as a whole contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which states that 'Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.'</p>

<p>The political support given by the Commission to the controversial project to build a new gas pipeline network from the Russian Federation along the floor of the Baltic Sea (known as the Northern European gas pipeline) is a matter for concern. The Commission is giving additional backing to the project by funding a feasibility study, which constitutes unequivocal support for the private interests of monopolistic gas companies.</p>
<p>The Commission's position is very surprising, given that the estimated cost of this investment is 5.7 billion dollars, that is, two and a half times more than that of an alternative project based on the building of a second Yamal pipeline (around 2.2 billion dollars). In addition, the maintenance and transport costs for the Northern European pipeline will be three times greater.</p>
<p>Confirmation that this is the case can be found in the records of the EU-Russian Federation Energy Dialogue which show that the Commission takes absolutely no account of the cheaper and easier option of the building of the Yamal pipeline project.

<p>(EN) As part of its humanitarian aid, the Commission has taken the following initiatives to make sure that its humanitarian aid following the tsunami reaches the whole country, including the north and east areas controlled by the LTTE.</p>
<p>The primary emergency decision of € 3 million, approved the very same day of the disaster, targeted the most-affected countries, including Sri Lanka. This support allowed the International Federation of the Red Cross, through the actions of the Sri Lankan National Society’s volunteers island wide, to distribute essential relief items such emergency shelter, non-food items, family kits, emergency medical kits, basic building and repair items.</p>
<p>Also the Commission adopted a € 10 million emergency decision for Sri Lanka and the Maldives on 30 December 2004. Out of this amount, € 8.26 million have been contracted to nine humanitarian aid partners active in Sri Lanka and all operations, mainly focusing on water and sanitation, food aid and health, are well underway since the very first days following the disaster.</p>
<p>These organisations were already working in the conflict-affected areas before the tsunami hit the coastal belt of Sri Lanka, and are indeed targeting their support to tsunami victims living in the north and the east, notably in LTTE-controlled areas. Some of these operations are implemented directly by our partners, some others, like the ones under the responsibility of the United Nations agencies, are managed with the support of local organisations or authorities.</p>
<p>In detail, the Commission provides funds, among others, to the following:</p>
<p>UNICEF for actions including the distribution of children hygiene kits, clothes and safe water as well as medicine to 5 000 households, including children</p>
<p>The World Food Program for food distribution, including targeted supplementary distributions for malnourished children under five years old.</p>
<p>The Danish Red Cross for psychosocial support actions including specific activities (games and sharing of experiences) and counselling for children.</p>
<p>ZOA for tracing and transporting bodies; transporting survivors to hospital; providing shelter, food, non food relief items, water and sanitation.</p>
<p>Oxfam for the installation and provision of safe drinking water, disinfection of polluted water sources and containers; for ensuring access to safe excreta disposal facilities through construction of temporary latrines.</p>
<p>Action Contre la Faim (ACF) for the victims to accede to safe drinking water through the provision of regular water trucking, decontamination of 220 wells; to live in a decent sanitation environment through the construction of emergency latrines in 14 camps and the distribution of hygiene kits.</p>
<p>On 9 February 2005, the Commission approved an additional € 80 million package for relief and small scale rehabilitation activities in the most affected countries, including Sri Lanka for which an indicative amount of € 20 million has been earmarked. This package foresees, among other actions, small-scale livelihood recovery projects such as boat repairs and supply of fishing gear to fishermen communities, as well as psychosocial care for traumatised victims, food aid, shelter and housing repair.</p>
<p>The European Commission’s humanitarian aid policy, which is need-based driven, will continue to focus primarily on the North and the East, but will also consider interventions islandwide through our support to United Nations agencies.</p>
<p>The main reason for this geographical targeting is need-based driven, following the humanitarian aid principles of neutrality and impartiality, since it is estimated that the north and the East sustained about 60% of the damages.</p>
<p>It is also based on our humanitarian partners’ presence and expertise in this region. Since the ceasefire of February 2002, the Commission, in the framework of its humanitarian aid policy to focus on ‘forgotten crises’, has been very active to respond to the needs of the internally displaced people returning to their areas of origin or living in the so-called ‘welfare centres’. Between 2002 and 2004, more than € 23 million have been allocated to this population through nearly twenty partners.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0024"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission does not share the view that the Internal Market poses a threat to workers and consumers. The aim of the Internal Market is to contribute to Europe’s quality of life and standard of living – now and in the future. In accordance with successive European treaties, market opening has gone hand in hand with ensuring high levels of consumer and worker protection. By removing obstacles to trade and investment within EU25, the Internal Market has already delivered many tangible benefits to Europe's consumers and workers.</p>
<p>Consumers enjoy a wider choice of high-quality products at more competitive prices. In addition, measures have been taken to protect and inform consumers better. The position of consumers within the Internal Market will be further strengthened with the adoption and implementation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. This measure will provide consumers with the same protections against unfair business practices irrespective of whether they buy locally, from a web site or when travelling abroad. Moreover, effective enforcement of consumer rights has been strengthened with the adoption of the Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation in October 2004<a href="#defann_46_1" name="refann_46_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The aim of this Regulation is to establish a network of national enforcement authorities and enable them to take effective action against rogue traders who abuse the freedom of the Internal Market to deceive consumers.</p>
<p>All this is recognition of the fact that consumer and Internal Market policies are inextricably linked. Consumers gain from competitive markets. At the same time, no market can work well without confident consumers.</p>
<p>The results of Internal Market policies for workers have also been positive. Evidence shows that, during the first decade of the Internal Market, at least 2.5 million additional jobs have been created. The Internal Market is capable of contributing even more to growth and jobs, as, for example, the recent Kok Report on revitalising the Lisbon Strategy points out. Internal Market freedoms allow workers to find employment in other Member States and enjoy full social security benefits. Where relevant, professional qualifications obtained in one Member State must be recognised in all other Member States. Furthermore, Internal Market policies have been accompanied by strong worker protections. For example, EU law provides for high levels of protection concerning working time rules, the posting of workers, rules on health and safety at the work place and rules against discrimination. EU law also enhances worker consultation and representation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The honourable Member draws attention to high mobile phone charges and an absence of real competition in the mobile market in Ireland, as illustrated by the profit margins of certain operators referred to in his question.</p>
<p>The EU e-communications regulatory framework is based on the premise that effective competition should drive down prices, to the benefit of users and consumers. National regulatory authorities (NRAs) have the task of analysing the state of competition in relevant markets and imposing appropriate ex ante regulation if they find that competition is not effective.</p>
<p>In the case of Ireland, the NRA (ComReg) has already carried out an analysis of the market most pertinent to the honourable Member’s question, the wholesale market for mobile access and call origination. ComReg concluded that Vodafone and O2 are jointly dominant in this market, a finding which the Commission has supported in the notification procedure provided for in the Framework Directive. ComReg intends to impose on these undertakings an obligation to give mobile virtual network operators (‘MVNOs’) access to their networks, with the aim of increasing competition in the retail mobile market in Ireland and thereby addressing the relatively high retail prices.</p>
<p>Moreover, under the e-communications regulatory framework, all NRAs, including ComReg, are due to carry out their analyses of the wholesale national market for international roaming on public mobile networks. In this regard questionnaires have been sent on a co-ordinated basis by many NRAs within the framework of the European Regulators Group (ERG) to gather information, inter alia, on the tariffs charged between operators for wholesale international roaming services. Based on their market analysis, NRAs will have to determine whether there is effective competition in each market and, if not, envisage appropriate remedies, in accordance with EU law.</p>
<p>In addition, as the honourable Member has pointed out, the Commission recently initiated an investigation into roaming charges. In that context, the Commission has initiated proceedings under Article 82 of the EC Treaty against the Vodafone Group, the mmO2 Group and the T-Mobile Group as regards the high roaming charges applied in the United Kingdom (Vodafone, O2) or Germany (Vodafone, T-Mobile).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0034"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission is pleased to be given the opportunity to present the latest steps taken to address the problem of accidental catch of dolphins and porpoises in fisheries</p>
<p>The Commission would first recall the strong support given by the Parliament on 10 February 2004 when approving Mr Kindermann’s report on the Commission proposal on a set of measures to protect cetaceans against by-catch. This contributed to the fast adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 812/2004 specifically dedicated to the incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Further to other Commission proposals aimed at reducing fishing effort and which will also indirectly benefit to cetaceans, this Regulation provides for a phasing out of driftnets and a total ban by 1 January 2008 in the Baltic Sea to benefit the critically endangered population of Baltic harbour porpoise. Significant reduction of bycatch of cetaceans, especially porpoises, is also expected through the use of acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) that are mandatory in a number of gillnet fisheries since 1<span class="sup">st</span> January 2005. Finally, this regulation makes compulsory the monitoring of by-catches of cetaceans through on-board observer schemes in a number of fisheries using pelagic trawls or gillnets that were considered by scientists as presenting a high risk. These extensive monitoring programmes also begin this year.</p>
<p>In parallel to these recent new legal measures, the Commission continues to support scientific studies and research to conserve cetaceans. Such projects include in particular the so-called ‘NECESSITY’ research project, which began in 2004, with the aim of developing mitigation measures for bycatch of cetacean in pelagic trawl fisheries, as well as the so-called ‘SCANS 2’ project, co financed under LIFE - the financial instrument for the Environment- which aims at updating the scientific estimates of small cetacean abundance in European Atlantic waters.</p>
<p>All these studies, research and conservation projects, in combination with data on bycatch of cetaceans in a large number of fisheries that will be made available through the mandatory observer programme to which it has just been referred, are designed to provide elements for more targeted and effective management measures to limit the effects of fishing on cetaceans. The Commission will continue working towards solutions with regard to the incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries in close cooperation with all interested parties.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Nor has it proposed a comprehensive peace plan for the country or an acceptable legal framework for the process of the demobilisation of paramilitaries that would prevent impunity for atrocities.</p>
<p>Does the European Commission plan to commit cooperation funding to the demobilisation process in these circumstances? Does it not feel that in doing so it could be subscribing to a process of impunity that grants legitimacy to criminal forces, thereby tying itself into the conflict in Colombia?</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission reiterates its full support for President Uribe’s commitment to seek a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict, including through direct engagement with those illegal armed groups prepared to negotiate a peace agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission stresses its willingness to assist in reaching a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict within the framework of a comprehensive peace strategy, as expressed in the EU GAERC conclusions of 13 December 2004.</p>
<p>More specifically, this peace strategy should include:</p>
<p>a comprehensive legal framework which is compatible with Colombia's international commitments and take into account the right of the victims to truth, justice and reparation. According to the Commission, the objective should be to avoid impunity. No mass murderer and drug dealer should ever be allowed to hold public office.</p>
<p>a roadmap towards a complete concentration, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of the members of the illegal armed groups.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are not yet in a position to support the current process with the paramilitaries: we do not have all the necessary details on the final political and legal framework of the process under way, which we need before being in a position to support it.

<p>(EN) Chicken kept for meat production (broilers) are among the most intensively farmed animal species. A scientific opinion of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare identified important housing and husbandry problems to be addressed in this sector.</p>
<p>The Commission has undertaken wide consultation with stakeholders on this issue. Valuable data has also been provided by the poultry industry.</p>
<p>As it has been announced to this Parliament in the Commission legislative Work Programme for 2005, the Commission is finalising a legislative proposal focusing on the welfare problems in these intensive farming systems.</p>
<p>The draft proposal aims to introduce animal welfare improvements by means of technical and management requirements for the establishments.</p>
<p>Furthermore the aim is to adopt an integrated approach in the animal welfare area in line with the principles of the new Community legislation on food hygiene and veterinary controls adopted in 2004.</p>
<p>The key elements of the draft proposal will be: enhanced monitoring on the farms and improved flow of information between the producer, competent authorities and the slaughterhouse. This is a new and innovative way of shaping European animal welfare legislation.</p>
<p>The Commission’s draft proposal for a Council Directive is currently in the process of being finalised.

<p>(EN) The Commission responded promptly to the tsunami in the Indian Ocean, providing an initial € 3 million through its Humanitarian Aid Directorate-General (ECHO) on the same day as the disaster. By 9 February 2005, € 103 million out of the announced € 123 million humanitarian funding had already been committed. The funds support a wide variety of humanitarian activities, both in response to the United Nations’ appeal, and as additional assistance provided through other humanitarian organisations</p>
<p>The Commission has stringent procedures in place to ensure that humanitarian funds are effectively and properly spent in relieving the suffering of crisis victims. From the outset ECHO experts undertake needs assessments in the stricken areas to ensure that EU support goes to where it is most needed. The implementation of humanitarian projects funded by the Commission is also closely monitored by the experts, as well as being subject to rigorous audit and evaluation procedures.</p>
<p>The Commission has also pledged up to € 350 million for the medium and longer term reconstruction/rehabilitation phase. The priority areas and disbursement mechanisms for this money will be decided in consultation with the affected countries and other donors. The countries in South-East Asia are currently carrying out needs assessments for the rehabilitation/reconstruction, together with the World Bank.</p>
<p>Commission officials are closely following the work on the needs assessments, and are in contact with the World Bank on what management structures can be set up for the rehabilitation/reconstruction programmes. The Commission has experience of various structures from its reconstruction/rehabilitation programmes in other countries, like in Afghanistan and East Timor. One option is, for example, to contribute to World Bank managed Trust Funds, to which many different donors can also contribute. The precise rules for the workings of such structures, including auditing, procurement, and adaptation to the local environment are defined on a case-by-case basis; in any case, key rules and principles on sound and efficient financial management and on environmental requirements will be respected.</p>

<p>Counterfeiting has assumed significant proportions in terms of world trade, currently accounting for more than 10% of international trade. European companies are the primary victims of such completely unfair practices. In France, as throughout the territory of the European Union, cutlers are particularly badly affected by this scourge, with all its harmful effects on economic growth and employment. European cutlers consequently do not understand why knives and cutlery products coming into Europe are not labelled with the country of origin. The textiles and clothing sector, which faces the same challenges, has launched the creation of a 'Made in Europe' label. In order to strengthen the competitiveness of this sector, the Commission proposed in December 2003 the introduction of Community rules on origin marking of products manufactured in the European Union or imported into Community territory. A 'Made in the EU' label is envisaged for products manufactured in the European Union, to be introduced on a voluntary basis only in interested sectors.</p>

<p>(FR) Following a working document on the current situation of place of origin labelling and the possibilities of introducing a Community regulation on this subject, which was presented in December 2003, in the first few months of 2004 the Commission began a consultation process with European federations covering the different industrial sectors, consumer organisations, unions and other institutions. The results of this process were submitted to Committee 133 in July 2004. Far from reaching a unanimous agreement, only a few sectors (textile and clothing, leather and tannery, footwear, ceramics, rubber, tyres, furniture) showed their support for the initiative, and mainly for imported products. The ‘made in EU’ label, however, only seems to be acceptable to most sectors on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>The Commission is continuing to analyse the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a European origin labelling scheme, perhaps limited to the sectors that have indicated their agreement at European level. This analysis includes technical, economic and legal aspects. At this stage, the Commission has not been able to obtain convincing indications that EU origin labelling could significantly contribute to combating counterfeiting.</p>
<p>Further meetings took place recently with the sectors concerned and a questionnaire addressed to the national consumer associations was circulated. An on-line consultation (Interactive Policy Making) is also going to be launched in the near future.</p>
<p>The European representatives of the cutlers’ professional organisations are invited to contact the services of the Commission Directorate-General for Trade, and their respective governments, in order to put forward their point of view on the initiative, and to reach an agreement with their European representatives.

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the honourable Member for his question regarding a fundamental objective of its proposal on the 2007-2013 financial framework, which is European added value.</p>
<p>In its two general communications regarding the 2007-2013 financial framework<a href="#defann_55_1" name="refann_55_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and in particular the communication of July 2004, the Commission highlighted the three elements that should help make the Union’s activities more effective. These elements were systematically taken into account in drawing up the legislative proposals for the 2007-2013 financial framework and are part of the idea of European added value.</p>
<p>Criterion 1 - effectiveness. Definition: EU action is the only way to get results in order to resolve missing links, avoid fragmentation and realise the potential of a border-free Europe. Examples: programmes promoting mobility in education and culture; trans-European networks.</p>
<p>Criterion 2 - efficiency. Definition: the EU offers better value for money, because externalities can be addressed, because action can be better coordinated and because of the resources and expertise available. Examples: research, the Galileo system, immigration and asylum policy, external relations (economies of scale).</p>
<p>Criterion 3 - synergy. Definition: EU action is necessary to complement, stimulate and leverage action and create synergies. Examples: cohesion policy for which EU action is a lever and complements national action; rural development; external relations.</p>
<p>The desire for greater effectiveness is also at the heart of the Commission’s proposals regarding the simplification and streamlining of instruments. There were therefore two guiding principles for drawing up the legislative proposals: the first aims to achieve ‘one instrument per policy area, one fund per programme'; the second aims to consider alternatives to in-house direct management. The Commission has also identified an overall approach on administrative governance, which will lead to streamlining and the selection of the most suitable and cost-effective delivery mechanism.</p>
<p>More specifically in relation to administrative expenditure, the Commission proposed that the structure of the 2007-2013 financial framework should be in line with the ABB structure of the annual budget. The development of administrative expenditure would have a less than proportionate link with that of operational expenditure, taking into account the specific characteristics of certain Commission activities such as competition policy or implementing the internal market, which only involve a marginal proportion of operational expenditure, while the main expenditure associated with these policies is administrative. For the majority of the Commission’s activities, for which the operational proportion is larger, we can reasonably anticipate that the increased effectiveness achieved at operational level will have a direct positive impact on administrative expenditure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Community customs tariff applicable to imports of raw aluminium and aluminium alloys is currently 6%. The majority of the Member States that joined the Community on 1 May 2004 previously applied a zero tariff to these imports, and therefore had to raise their customs tariffs in order to take on the acquis communautaire. Only one Member State, Hungary, requested and obtained a transitional derogation as part of the accession negotiations for a period of three years, during which decreasing quotas of these imports will be able to benefit from reduced tariffs.</p>
<p>The Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> defines the guiding principles and the procedure for dealing with requests for autonomous tariff suspensions or quotas. A number of requests regarding the products in question were submitted in 2004 by several new Member States within the Ad hoc Group on Economic Tariff Problems made up of experts from the Member States and the Commission. After careful consideration of these requests, it does not appear that any of the requests satisfied the principles laid down in the aforementioned communication. The Commission therefore concluded that the conditions for proposing such autonomous tariff suspensions or quotas under Article 26 of the Treaty establishing the European Community were not fulfilled, and therefore considered these requests to be rejected.</p>
<p>At the request of the Czech delegation, the Article 133 Committee considered this issue of the tariff on aluminium at its meeting in January 2005. Work is currently in progress in that forum at technical level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) According to Article 149 of the EC Treaty, each Member State is responsible for the content of teaching and the organisation of its educational system. On this basis, the Union does not have the competence to oblige a Member State to regulate or not the profession of nutritionist in its territory, or to determine which diploma gives access to that profession, or to fix the content and level of training for the exercise of that profession.</p>
<p>The Union is competent only to take the measures necessary to ensure the free movement of professionals within the European Union. To that end Directives on the mutual recognition of diplomas have been adopted and are already in place. In addition, on 7 March 2002 the Commission made a proposal for a Directive on recognition of professional qualifications in order to improve the existing system.</p>
<p>In particular, in this proposal, any professional association or organisation that represents the profession at national and European level, may establish a common platform and submit it for adoption to the Commission. The purpose of the platform would be to ‘pre-define’ the qualification criteria to overcome the differences between the various national training courses so that a citizen qualified to exercise a profession in one Member State may obtain recognition of his/her diploma when moving to another Member State which regulates that profession, without having to undergo compensation measures. It must be emphasised that the purpose of the platform would not, in any way, be to force national authorities to harmonise their national legislation.</p>
<p>This proposal is currently being examined by the co-legislators in second reading.</p>
<p>As far as the issue of the inclusion of nutrition in the basic training of doctors is concerned, reference is made to the ‘doctors’ Directive’ 93/16/EC <a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which provides that during basic medical training, there is, inter alia, a ‘sufficient understanding of the structure, functions and behaviour of healthy and sick persons, as well as relations between the state of health and physical and social surroundings of the human being’ (Article 23, paragraph 1(b)).

<p>(EN) The Commission thanks the honourable Member for drawing attention to the need of taking measures to avoid the virus spreading in the European region. The Commission is concerned with the spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in south-east Asia and it has already taken the relevant measures.</p>
<p>Reports of human-to-human transmission have so far been very sporadic. Infection was limited to family members and no wider transmission of the virus in the community has occurred.</p>
<p>The Commission is very well aware of the risks posed by the current Avian Influenza epidemics in certain Asian countries. It is working in close contact with the animal and public health authorities of the Member States, the World Health Organisation, the Food and Agricultural Organisation and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The Commission has already adopted a number of measures to prevent that the disease is introduced in the EU via trade in live poultry or other birds and in those products of avian origin that could pose a risk in relation to avian influenza.</p>
<p>At EU level, the Commission is following up the implementation of the proposals made in the Commission working paper on Community Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Planning adopted in March 2004 within the framework set out by the Council conclusions of 2 June 2004.</p>
<p>Key areas for action include the operation of the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) and co-operation with the World Health Organisation on the co-ordination and facilitation of national pandemic planning in the Community and in the European region.</p>
<p>Regardless of the production of a vaccine with the avian influenza strain circulating in Asia, appropriate vaccines for pandemic influenza strains can unfortunately only be developed once the strains of the virus are precisely identified. Development and production of a vaccine can take up to a year to complete. Procurement and use of vaccines, however, is the responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p>As regards market authorisation of vaccines, the Commission has taken regulatory action to ensure that the market authorisation procedure is speeded up. Moreover, it has initiated a process of joint consultation with the European Vaccines Manufacturers and the Member States to ensure that there is a better capacity in place for the production of efficacious vaccines in good time.</p>
<p>The Commission has also been promoting a comprehensive research agenda in this field.</p>

<p>(EN) The role of the Commission in the negotiations currently held in Council of Europe was already the subject of the reply to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0570_EN.html">H-0570/04</a> by Baroness Ludford during question time of Parliament’s January 2005 Plenary session. As pointed in this response the Commission is negotiating on behalf of the European Community further to a Council Decision of 28 June 2004 authorizing the Commission to negotiate the Draft European Convention on combating trafficking in human beings. This Council Decision covers those provisions of the Draft Convention that concern Community law (first pillar). It was adopted on the basis of existing EC legislation, in particular on Council Directive 2004/81/EC of 29 April 2004 on the residence permit issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or who have been the subject of an action to facilitate illegal immigration, who cooperate with the competent authorities. Consequently, in the negotiations in Strasbourg the Commission aimed at ensuring a level of treatment for victims, who are third country nationals, at least complying with the standards set out in the EC Directive.</p>
<p>The question of a so-called non-punishment clause is not covered by Community law. Insofar the Commission is not authorised to negotiate. Member States negotiate themselves but have to respect the Common Position adopted on the basis of a proposal of the Commission by the Council on 25 October 2004 on negotiations relating to the Draft European Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings being undertaken in the Council Europe. The Commission assists the Council Presidency in coordinating Member States positions. The Commission has supported the inclusion of a non-punishment clause into the convention and explicitly opposed the deletion of such clause, which was also discussed during the negotiations.</p>
<p>The use of the services of a trafficked person in the knowledge of the relevant circumstances must be considered as injustice and as an offence against that person. While the moral justification of criminalizing such act cannot be contested, Member States seem to have different views regarding the usefulness and possible practical impact of such measure. Against this background a further discussion of the question in the European Union will be necessary and should take place further to the Communication on trafficking in human beings the Commission will issue in 2005.</p>
<p>The question of an appropriate control or monitoring mechanism with regard to the implementation of the Convention is particularly important. The Commission is authorized to negotiate on this matter insofar as such monitoring concerns issues that are covered by Community law. The Commission supports a monitoring mechanism that is based on the work of independent experts. Furthermore, the Commission tries to ensure a coherent solution respecting the control mechanisms that are already established for the proper implementation of European Community legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0069"></a>

<p>(EN) European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)</p>
<p>45 of the 48 ERDF operational programmes of the second CSF for Greece (1994-1999) are now closed with the agreement of the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>Of these, 22 were closed by the end of 2003. The closure of the remaining 23 operational programmes, containing a large number of public works projects, was delayed to give the Greek authorities the opportunity to submit additional elements in particular regarding the findings of ‘ESPEL’, the body responsible for verifying the quality of the works delivered. These additional elements were submitted up until the summer of 2004, and formed the basis for an agreed closure at the end of 2004.</p>
<p>For two ERDF Operational Programmes (OP), closure proposals have not yet been sent to the Greek authorities: operational programmes ‘Posts’ and ‘Rail’.</p>
<p>As regards OP ‘Posts’, closure has been delayed by the need to decide on the adequate treatment of a land purchase. This issue is now resolved and the closure proposal will be issued very soon.</p>
<p>For OP ‘Rail’, the delay was due to discussions on the findings of an audit carried out by the Commission's Directorate General (DG) for Regional Policy. The Greek authorities have submitted proposals for the follow-up of such findings in November 2004. The Commission's services have examined these proposals and expect to be able to make a closure proposal soon.</p>
<p>For ERDF operational programme ‘Roads’, the closure proposal sent to the Greek authorities in 2004 has not been accepted by them. A contradictory procedure according to Article 24 of Regulation 1260/1999, taking into account also the findings of a recent audit carried out by DG Regional Policy, is now to be expected.</p>
<p>European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)</p>
<p>As far as the EAGGF is concerned, 15 out of 18 operational programmes have already been closed in December 2004. Closure of these programmes was finalised in December 2004 after a long dialog with the Greek authorities regarding, amongst others, controls on the quality of public works operated by ESPEL. All programmes were closed with the agreement of the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>Three programmes (Rural Development, CI Leader II and Leader II network) are still pending for closure as the dialog with the Greek authorities is still open. Should this dialog be completed in the next two months, closure may take place during this first semester of 2005.</p>
<p>European Social Fund (ESF)</p>
<p>All 24 operational programs of the ESF have been closed, 22 in 2003 and 2 in 2004, the latest in July 2004. In the context of all these ESF-programs, the Greek authorities have accepted the closure proposals from the Commission services.</p>
<p>With regard to the ESF, 1.88% of the credits of CSF II have been lost, (€ 48 million out of € 2 564 million), the reason being under-consumption and corrections made by the Commission in compliance with the regulatory requirements.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0075"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees with the honourable Member’s position that promoting digital literacy is essential to fight the digital divide. The provision of digital skills has been supported by the Commission by means of a wide range of strategies<a href="#defann_66_1" name="refann_66_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> - such as eEurope, the European Employment Strategy, the Social Inclusion Process and the Social Agenda, the eLearning Action Plan – and tools, such as the European Social Fund and the EQUAL initiative. The importance of digital literacy has been supported by the work of the ESDIS Group (High level Group on the Employment and Social Dimension of the Information Society )<a href="#defann_66_2" name="refann_66_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and spelled out in a number of Council resolutions, namely on eInclusion (2001), on eAccessibility (2002) and Social and Human Capital (2003).</p>
<p>The Commission believes that an inclusive Information Society can only be achieved if three complementary axes are addressed:</p>
<p>ensure physical access to the technologies underpinning the Information Society</p>
<p>facilitate individuals’ participation and access to new Information Society processes and services</p>
<p>empower individuals and communities to take advantage of new opportunities offered by the Information Society.</p>
<p>To improve participation and empower individuals, the promotion of digital literacy is essential. Policies need to be based on a set of complementary actions such as awareness raising, capacity building, policy development, legislation, standardisation, public procurement, education, social dialogue, exchange of best practices, financing of social services, monitoring and benchmarking.</p>
<p>The Commission is promoting the principle of ‘making the necessary knowledge available to all’ and increasing digital literacy in the European Union from two perspectives. First, in terms of Information Society Technology (IST) research, the area of ‘ICT for Inclusion’ aims at full participation in the Information Society of all individuals on equal terms. Improving eSkills and understanding the type of eContent and supporting technologies relevant to each specific target community or group at risk of exclusion have been already identified as relevant areas for research.</p>
<p>Second, from the policy perspective, in the forthcoming Commission Communication on eAccessibility<a href="#defann_66_3" name="refann_66_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, one of the likely actions to be proposed is to increase skills. There is already much knowledge on how to foster eAccessibility and how to avoid creating new barriers, partly based on the research funded by the Commission. This knowledge needs to be shared among Member States and translated into practical guidelines for implementation. The public consultation on this Communication (the results of which will be available shortly) brought an overwhelming response, particularly on this issue. More than 73% of the respondents have identified ‘developing eSkills’ as essential or very important.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the policy initiative i2010, which will be presented by the Commission in May 2005, the contribution of the Information Society to growth and employment will be addressed, encompassing the need to increase digital literacy and improve eSkills.</p>

<p>This communication proposes the broad guidelines for action over the next few years and makes some estimates, by way of illustration, of the impact of certain types of reform included in the strategy.</p>
<p>These estimates are preliminary and highlight what is at stake in the debate and the benefits that successful implementation of the Lisbon Strategy would provide in the coming years. As indicated in the communication, ‘while it is not possible, therefore, to provide a comprehensive assessment of the effects of the whole Lisbon Action Programme at this stage, it is now widely recognised that the type of measures envisaged in this Action Programme can make an essential contribution to increasing the growth potential in the medium- and longer-term.’</p>
<p>The Commission has not, therefore, made any estimates at this stage on a case-by-case basis. If such an exercise were carried out, it could only be following a detailed analysis of all of the measures and reforms that each Member State should set out in their national action programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In addition to the massive bomb damage sustained by the historic city of Baghdad, Iraq in its entirety, which constitutes a massive archaeological preserve, much of which is still unexplored, is now falling a prey to vandalism and looting. Archaeological sites are being used by multinational forces as locations for helicopter pads and parking areas, while invaluable items are being stolen from museums by organised networks of illicit antiquities dealers. Rare archaeological finds, the ancient city of Babylon and monuments to Nebuchadnezzar, which previously survived for centuries, have now, in the space of a few weeks, been destroyed forever.</p>
<p>The occupying forces are destroying not only the present and future of the Iraqi people but are, in addition, brutally laying to waste the cultural heritage of humanity as a whole. Under the terms of international law, they bear sole responsibility for the acts of vandalism committed.</p>

In particular, within these competences there is a strong presence of the European dimension, covering the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes.

<p>(EN) In accordance with the EU-Treaty any European country that respects the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law may apply to become a member of the European Union. The European system of rules has been very effective in producing peace and prosperity; it would therefore not seem expedient to draw the limits that this zone of peace and prosperity can reach in the future, basing oneself on today’s information.</p>
<p>The term ‘European’ country has never been clearly defined by the EU and would certainly have to take into account geographic but also cultural and historic elements. There is no simple formula and each application for accession would have to be considered on its merits for the European Union as well as for the country concerned. Although the final borders of the EU have not been determined yet, the EU is currently developing other forms of partnership and cooperation than full membership with neighbouring countries such as the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
<p>With regard to the honourable Member’s second point, whether the enlargement process affects the pace of integration, the Commission would like to underline that experience shows that EU-enlargement often gave impetus for new developments like the Single Market, the Maastricht Treaty or the drafting of the European Constitution. We need to make sure that this will also be the case with future enlargements. We therefore have to constantly re-evaluate our performance in the enlarged EU and – based on a thorough and honest assessment – carefully consider the options.

<p>(EN) There is indeed a positive turn of events in the Middle East which should lead back to the Quartet’s Road Map with the goal of a two-state state solution. However this cannot be taken for granted. Both President Abbas and Prime Minister Sharon will need to build up support within their own constituencies and to face down opponents of peace.</p>
<p>The Commission is seeking to support this process by remaining engaged with both parties on the following measures : to provide significant financial support for Palestinian Authority reform, focussing on the fight against corruption and promoting good government and financial transparency; strengthening the democratic process; to implement the Action Plans for Israel and the Palestinian Authority endorsed by the Council under the European Neighbourhood Policy; and to use the improved climate in trans-atlantic relations to ensure that our action and that of the United States are complementary and coordinated. The EU Special Representative is co-ordinating the EU’s support for the Palestinian security services.</p>
<p>The Commission is ready to provide financial resources to support the process of disengagement from Gaza, under the conditions laid down by the Council. This could include support for infrastructure measures to provide a quick start to the economy following withdrawal.</p>
<p>Regarding the security barrier the Commission refers to the EU’s position that the route of the wall is illegal under international law when on occupied territory, and affects the livelihood and humanitarian situation of Palestinians living in the wall’s vicinity. This issue is discussed with Israel and there appears to be an openness to revisit the route of the wall and bring it closer to the 1967-line.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0100"></a>

<p>(EN) Annex III 2b of Council Directive 91/676/EEC<a href="#defann_74_2" name="refann_74_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources, provides for the possibility of derogating from the limit of 170 kg N/ha from livestock manure, in the case where the different amounts fixed do not prejudice the objectives specified in Article 1 of the Directive and are justified on the basis of objective criteria. The Commission is prepared to consider the derogation requests from Member States that respond to the above-mentioned conditions.</p>
<p>However, the Commission’s approach is that a derogation request must be based on an action programme fully compliant with the Directive. The technical justifications for the derogation request and its compatibility with the Directive’s objectives can only be examined if the above-mentioned condition regarding the action programme is met. Ireland has not yet submitted an action programme which the Commission considers to be fully compliant with the Directive.</p>
<p>The approval of a derogation request requires a Commission Decision following the opinion of the Nitrates Committee, which assists the Commission, according to the procedure set out in Annex III 2.b and Article 9 of the Directive.</p>
<p>Pursuant to provisions of Article 5 of the Directive, it is in the responsibility of the Member States to establish the content of their action programmes on the basis of available scientific and technical data and environmental conditions of the regions concerned. The action programme shall include all the measures listed in Annex III of the Directive and the measures of the Code of Good Agricultural Practices established in accordance with Article 4. The Member State may establish different action programmes in its territory in order to tailor the set of measures to the specific conditions of the vulnerable zones or parts of zones.</p>
<p>In its analysis of the action programmes established by Member States, the Commission takes into account all the available scientific and technical evidence, including the results of studies and analysis provided by Members States and the outcome of independent studies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 2002 the European circuit board industry accounted for about 16% of the world market. Partly because of the current market consolidation, but mainly because of significant locational disadvantages and customs barriers, this branch of industry is threatening to migrate to Asia. There is, for example, a significant imbalance in the duty charged on products. European purchasers do not pay any customs duties for finished products (circuit boards) from Asia. On the other hand, customs duties of 5-7% are charged on primary materials, which according to information from the industry can account for up to 50% of manufacturing costs, when imported to Europe from Asia. Since these products are essential for domestic producers, however, the customs charge puts them at a distinct disadvantage.</p>
<p>Do these arrangements amount to discrimination against Community manufacturers of circuit boards and distort competition with Asian competitors?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The honourable Member refers in his question to circuit boards which can be imported duty free from third countries. Printed circuits without any active electrical elements fall with CN code 8534 00. Such products have been duty free since 1 January 2000 due to the Information Technology Agreement (ITA). Populated printed circuit boards, get ITA duty free treatment when they are classified as parts of finished products such as personal computers.</p>
<p>The production of these goods mainly requires chemicals for edging (CN Chapter 29, duty rate 6,5%), plastics (CN Chapter 39, duty rate 6,5%) and copper foil (CN Chapter 74 duty rate 5,2%) as primary materials. However, in cases where the EU industry imports some of these primary materials, it has the possibility to apply for the customs procedure called ‘transformation under customs control’. By this procedure Community producers can be authorised, when it is economically justified, to use imported materials duty free in the production of goods which are not subject to import duties when imported from a third country. Given this situation it is very unlikely that import duties on raw materials are a prime cause for the transfer of such industries to third countries.</p>
<p>The Commission considers therefore that issues other than tariffs are much more likely to influence the decision where to locate such factories. These could be labour costs and, for the most sophisticated multilayered boards the availability of advanced technology. Equally important may be investment aids that can attract foreign direct investment into some parts of Asia, as well as environmental considerations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0104"></a>

<p>In a desire to meet the conditions of membership for the EU, Poland has rigorously applied Community regulations and so is testing for BSE. This is being done out of concern for the health of EU citizens who might encounter Polish beef and beef products. In the meantime, the commitment of a large number of individuals and the dedicated efforts of two years of solid, hard and intensive work via tender procedure have come to nothing. The report on the activities under the PHARE programme, the main aim of which was to ensure research into BSE in livestock, was rejected by the European Commission Representative, which also cancelled the tender. The resulting situation caused an undesirable turnaround of affairs for Poland, which was compelled to ask the European Commission Representative to agree to reopening the tender and extending the contract period, or to agree to initiating an open tender with a shortened notice period. If agreed to, this will unquestionably lead to all manner of procedural activities with huge time pressures and funds will have to be committed from Poland's own budget which had been allocated to other objectives linked to the fight against contagious diseases. This will cause a temporary budget shortfall for the Veterinary Inspectorate, whilst also drastically reducing (by over 25%) the funds for the prevention of other animal diseases.</p>
